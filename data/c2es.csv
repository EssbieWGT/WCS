Dublin, Ireland-based CEL Critical ‘s new facility will produce power systems that will serve data centers throughout the United States. The number of jobs is expected to rise to 500 by 2030, Youngkin said.

“We are thrilled to welcome CEL to Virginia as they establish their first-ever American manufacturing site right here in the commonwealth,” Youngkin said in a statement. “Everyone involved in this project moved at the speed of Virginia to make this possible, and the impact is already being felt on the ground.”

The construction timeline and opening of the new facility was not provided, and the company did not immediately return requests for comment.

In a statement, Secretary of Commerce and Trade Juan Pablo Segura said the facility’s location shows “the positive ripple effects” of growth.

“With this new plant, we are ensuring every dollar invested in Virginia data centers stays in Virginia,” he said. “For data centers in other parts of the country or the world, Virginia is uniquely positioned to provide fast, reliable transportation of the products they need.”

CEL Managing Director Niall McFadden, an Irish investor, thanked Youngkin for his support of the project in a statement.

Founded in 1982, designs and manufactures power solutions for the global and cloud industry. Products include low-voltage power distribution systems, switchgear equipment and remote power panels.

The company says its products are able to handle increased workloads of the next generation of microchips, such as those designed by Nvidia.

The topic of increased energy demands driven by the development of more data centers and increased use of AI has become a major source of controversy in Virginia, as some localities have rejected such projects. According to Dominion Energy, the state’s energy demand is expected to increase 5% each year over the next 20 years and double by 2045, leaving the utility and state lawmakers grappling with how best to produce needed electricity.

The 24% month-over-month decline in EV sales isn’t just a statistic—it’s proof that American EV adoption remains heavily dependent on government subsidies.
We predicted this collapse back in June when Senate Republicans first pushed to end the tax credit.","U.S. motor vehicle sales plummeted in October 2025 as the elimination of federal EV tax credits sent electric vehicle demand into freefall and broader economic uncertainty kept car shoppers away from dealerships. The data reveals the immediate aftermath of one of the most significant policy shifts in American automotive history.

Light vehicle sales decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units last month, according to market analysis firm Omdia. This marks the lowest sales pace in 15 months and represents a stark 4.5% decline compared to October 2024. The drop signals that the automotive market’s brief summer surge has given way to a prolonged slowdown driven by policy changes and mounting economic pressures.

Electric Vehicle Sales Collapse Following Tax Credit Elimination

The most dramatic decline came in the electric vehicle segment. Unadjusted sales of electric vehicles dropped to 74,897 units in October from 98,289 units in September—a stunning 24% collapse in just one month. The timing directly correlates with the September 30, 2025 expiration of federal EV incentives.

President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” approved by Congress and signed into law on July 4, 2025, eliminated the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing new electric vehicles and the $4,000 used-EV credit. These subsidies, implemented during the Biden administration, had been instrumental in driving EV adoption over the past several years by reducing the effective purchase price for consumers.

Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide Financial, directly attributed October’s weakness to the policy change.

“Sharply lower electric vehicle sales, following the expiration of the federal tax credit on October 1, reduced dealer volumes over the month,” Ayers said in comments reported by Reuters. “With concerns about the labor market building, the near-term outlook for auto sales could be soft as more consumers stay away from auto showrooms this holiday season.”

Economic Headwinds Compound Sales Pressures

Beyond the EV tax credit expiration, multiple economic factors are converging to suppress vehicle demand. The overall unadjusted light vehicle sales declined 4.5% year-over-year in October, suggesting the slowdown extends beyond just electric vehicles.

The labor market has shown signs of weakening, with layoffs remaining relatively low but hiring activity tepid. Economists cited by multiple sources point to economic uncertainty, the impact of tariffs on vehicle prices, and companies increasingly embracing artificial intelligence as factors reducing demand for labor. These conditions are making consumers more cautious about major purchases like vehicles.

Adding to the uncertainty, a 35-day federal government shutdown—on track to become the longest in U.S. history—has created an economic data blackout. Last month’s sharp decline in retail vehicle sales would typically trigger detailed government analysis, but the shutdown has halted normal economic reporting. The Chicago Federal Reserve estimated that retail sales excluding motor vehicles increased just 0.3% in October after a projected 0.4% gain in September, but comprehensive data remains unavailable.

Consumer Sentiment And Labor Market Concerns Mount

Labor market stagnation has persisted since August, with economists identifying several contributing factors. A Conference Board survey last month showed consumers’ perceptions of the labor market remained downbeat in October, with the unemployment rate near a four-year high of 4.3% in August.

Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics, warned of additional challenges ahead.

“Vehicle sales will face headwinds in the coming months,” Zwemmer said. “New vehicles are one of the most exposed sectors to tariffs. So far, foreign and domestic automakers have largely absorbed the costs through their profit margins, but this isn’t sustainable.”

The combination of higher effective vehicle prices (due to the loss of EV tax credits), ongoing tariff pressures, elevated interest rates, and labor market concerns creates a particularly challenging environment for automotive sales heading into the traditionally strong holiday shopping season.

September Pre-Buy Surge Creates October Hangover

The October decline was partially predictable. Throughout August and September, industry analysts and EVXL warned of an impending “pre-buy” surge as consumers rushed to purchase EVs before the September 30 deadline. That surge materialized, with EV sales spiking in the third quarter and pulling forward demand that would have otherwise occurred in Q4.

Multiple automakers offered aggressive incentives in the weeks leading up to the deadline, with Tesla prominently displaying banners warning buyers to “Take Delivery by September 30, 2025” to secure the $7,500 credit. The resulting September sales boom left dealerships with depleted inventory and consumers who might have purchased in October or November having already completed their transactions.

EVXL’s Take

We’ve been tracking this story for months, and October’s numbers validate every warning we issued. Back in early July, we reported on the impending September 30 deadline and predicted exactly this pattern: a rush of purchases before the cutoff followed by a dramatic sales collapse.

The 24% month-over-month decline in EV sales isn’t just a statistic—it’s proof that American EV adoption remains heavily dependent on government subsidies. When you effectively raise the price of every EV by $7,500 overnight, demand craters. This wasn’t a surprise to anyone paying attention.

What makes this particularly significant is the timing. Just one week before these October sales figures emerged, we reported on GM laying off 3,300 EV workers and idling battery plants that had received billions in investment. GM CEO Mary Barra told shareholders that EVs “remain our North Star” during the company’s Q3 earnings call, yet the automaker slashed EV production capacity by 50% at its flagship Factory Zero plant within weeks.

This disconnect between corporate messaging and actual behavior is a pattern we’ve documented repeatedly. When Ford faced a supplier crisis, the company immediately prioritized gas-powered F-150 production over the electric F-150 Lightning. Both GM and Ford are revealing their true priorities when market conditions tighten: profitable internal combustion engines win every time.

The broader context matters too. We’re now in the midst of the longest government shutdown in U.S. history—35 days and counting—which began on October 1, the exact same day the tax credits expired. This isn’t just creating economic uncertainty; it’s producing a data blackout precisely when we need transparency about how consumers are responding to these dramatic policy shifts.

The path forward looks increasingly challenging. Without the $7,500 credit, EVs must compete on price and merit alone against gas-powered vehicles. Some manufacturers like Hyundai responded by slashing prices on the 2026 Ioniq 5 by nearly $10,000, but those price cuts eat directly into already-thin margins. How long can automakers sustain that approach?

We predicted this collapse back in June when Senate Republicans first pushed to end the tax credit. The question now is whether the industry can stabilize or if we’re looking at a multi-year setback for EV adoption in America while China continues to dominate global EV production with robust government support.

Dynamic grid fees could help steer supply and demand and ultimately allow for “a happy hour” for electricity consumers, Duso argued.
“We need a targeted decommissioning of gas grids as well as binding plans by grid operators,” Duso said.","The transition to renewable power sources requires a comprehensive reform of the electricity system in Germany to better align prices with power output, the country’s monopoly commission has said in an expert opinion on the energy sector for the government.

“Only by tackling the root causes of high energy prices can we achieve durable changes. Merely doctoring symptoms is not enough,” said commission head Tomaso Duso. More competition and more efficiency are needed to make the energy transition a success, the competition watchdog found. This applies not only to electricity supply, but also to district heating, gas infrastructure and charging points for electric vehicles, the advisory body consisting of economists and legal experts concluded.

In the electricity sector, “dynamic grid fees” and progressive digitalisation are seen as key steps. “The system currently rewards a behaviour that brings grids to their limits,” commission leader Duso said. Today’s grid fees would not offer incentives for using available grid capacity more efficiently, leading to curtailment of wind power in northern Germany while gas or coal plants are fired up in the south. Dynamic grid fees could help steer supply and demand and ultimately allow for “a happy hour” for electricity consumers, Duso argued. A digitalised grid would allow for introducing more flexible fees – and could help the country avoid the “politically difficult” debate about splitting into multiple power price zones, he added.

The monopoly commission also lamented a lack of competition among operators of EV charging infrastructure, especially along Germany’s motorways, where most projects were awarded to the same company without a tendering process. The commission called for more tenders and welcomed the planned launch of a price transparency office for customers. A similar price transparency platform would be needed for district heating, where monopolies are becoming a risk due to the disappearance of oil and gas heaters. At the same time, more and more gas grids will fall idle as customers switch to other heating technologies, raising the question of who pays for phasing out the obsolete infrastructure. “We need a targeted decommissioning of gas grids as well as binding plans by grid operators,” Duso said.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-11-05 16:19:47.809206

Storage revenue surges

Nevada-based Ormat is an independent power producer that operates a 1.6-GW portfolio of geothermal, waste heat recovery, solar and energy storage resources with assets in the United States, Kenya, Latin America and Southeast Asia. It aims to nearly double its energy generation and storage capacity by the end of 2028, executives said on a third-quarter earnings call Tuesday.

Ormat earned $24.1 million profit in the third quarter, up 9.3% from $22.1 million a year ago. Its Q3 2025 revenue was $249.7 million, an increase of nearly 18% from the third quarter of 2024.

Ormat saw strong performance in its products and energy storage segments, which respectively account for 25% and 8% of its total sales. Storage was the standout, posting 108% growth year over year thanks to favorable seasonality and higher capacity prices in the PJM Interconnection.

The electricity segment accounts for 67% of Ormat’s sales. It was noticeably weaker this quarter due to a September storm that knocked out the grid near the company’s southern California assets, curtailments related to transmission upgrades in Nevada and lower energy prices in Hawaii.

On Tuesday, Ormat Chief Financial Officer Assaf Ginzburg said the curtailments could cost Ormat $40 million to $50 million this year. But CEO Doron Blachar characterized the issues as one-offs and said the company did not expect a repeat in 2026.

Ormat expects to book about $167 million from tax equity financing and tax credit transfer transactions this year, higher than previously forecast. It sees $50.4 million in net tax benefits from the investment and production tax credits for energy storage and geothermal authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and extended in full through 2033 by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

Ormat expects to grow its energy generation and storage capacity by 15% to 17% annually through 2028. In its core electricity segment, it sees 162 MW of solar growth and 240 MW to 340 MW of geothermal growth. Though a significant portion of its planned geothermal additions are slated for non-U.S. markets like Indonesia, Blachar said Ormat feels good about its projects in resource-rich Nevada despite a recent 10-fold increase in geothermal proposals entering NV Energy’s interconnection queue.

Updates on two enhanced geothermal partnerships

Ormat announced enhanced geothermal, or EGS, partnerships with SLB and Sage Geosystems earlier this year.

“We have achieved significant progress in advancing our EGS strategy,” Blachar said on Tuesday. He cautioned, however, that the partnerships likely would not accrue to Ormat’s capacity pipeline until after 2028.

The SLB partnership is a joint venture that Blachar said would blend SLB’s drilling and subsurface engineering expertise with Ormat’s thermal power plant design, development and operation. The first phase is a pilot project that could be operational in late 2026 at Ormat’s Desert Peak plant in Nevada — a significantly shorter headway than building a new facility for the project. If successful, Ormat and SLB would jointly develop commercial-scale power plants for independent power producers, utilities and large industrial customers.

The Sage pilot would follow a similar timeline, but the Texas-based startup is still deciding on a site, Blachar said. In August, Sage CEO Cindy Taff told Latitude Media that it was considering three sites in Nevada and Utah. If the pilot pans out, Ormat could then develop, build, own and operate geothermal power plants and energy storage facilities — including long-duration storage — using Sage’s EGS technology.

In both cases, Blachar said, each commercial-scale EGS facility could have hundreds of megawatts of capacity, compared with a few tens of megawatts at most traditional geothermal sites.

Strong energy storage growth and pipeline

Revenues in Ormat’s energy storage business more than doubled in the third quarter, albeit from a low base.

But that base is growing quickly as Ormat plans to add 660 MW to 760 MW of capacity over the next three years, upsizing its storage portfolio from 290 MW today to as much as 1,050 MW by the end of 2028. Ormat commissioned a 60 MW/120 MWh project in Texas last quarter and plans to bring an additional 175 MW/580 MWh online across three projects in California and Texas by the end of 2026.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s foreign sourcing rules remain a concern for Ormat given industrywide dependence on Chinese components, Blachar said. The company had “safe-harbored whatever we could” to reduce the near-term impacts on tax credit eligibility, he added, referring to the practice of beginning work on energy projects to grandfather them into existing tax rules.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/EIyLtm66cSdYNqYzvzA2Prfwdk-beVWHkw6gZS2HpQs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Pcm1hdF9nZW90aGVybWFsLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-05 16:05:38.832617

According to Ellis, California now imports about one million barrels of oil per day, with roughly 20 percent of its jet fuel, gasoline, and diesel coming from India—where about 40 percent of crude oil originates from Russia.

Supply Strain and Security Concerns

Ellis told supervisors that several U.S. military installations, including Travis Air Force Base and Naval Air Weapons Station China Lake, rely almost entirely on California refineries for jet fuel.

“If our defenses can’t fly when needed and we only have a three-day fuel supply—we’re in bad shape,” he said.

Kern County Seeks Federal Action

Supervisor David Couch introduced a motion supporting a white paper co-authored by Ellis and two other state lawmakers, California Energy and Fuel Policies: A Clear and Present Threat to National Security and Force Readiness. The motion, approved unanimously, directs the county to send letters urging federal review of California’s refining and energy regulations to the president, Congress, and the governor.

Supervisor Phillip Peters added that Kern County is also pursuing designation as a natural resource development zone to reaffirm its strategic importance to U.S. energy and aviation fuel security.

Ellis said the solution to relieving the state’s aviation fuel strain lies in easing restrictions on oil and gas producers to maintain refinery operations and stabilize supply chains.

“There are some solutions,” he said. “The solutions are, simply get rid of some of the regulation through federalizing oil and gas. If we can do that and we can empower the other areas in the state to produce diesel, and we can get some of the air regs off of our refineries. Guess what? We win,” he said.",https://avweb.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/AD32_StanEllis_2-768x678-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:06:24.749609

Entergy volunteers kicked off day one in Tigerland alongside Keep Tiger Town Beautiful. The volunteer-led group of “litter warriors” hosts weekly cleanups across Baton Rouge and provides supplies for anyone interested in organizing their own event.

What began as a typical cleanup quickly turned into a treasure hunt. Alongside the usual bottles, cans, and paper, volunteers collected doors, a shopping cart, window blinds, and even children’s toys. By the end of the morning, more than 20 bags of trash were cleared from the neighborhood.

“Entergy’s support is such a blessing for our team and our city. Their investment helps us maintain a clean, healthy city residents can take pride in,” said Jennifer Richardson, Keep Tiger Town Beautiful founder.

The following day, Entergy volunteers showed up to support Keep Jaguar Nation, a part of Scotlandville Community Development Corporation’s efforts to address the pressing issue of blight and environmental neglect in the Scotlandville neighborhood of North Baton Rouge. This initiative mobilizes residents through organized cleanup events, fostering collaboration and neighborhood pride while transforming neglected areas into cleaner, safer, and more welcoming spaces.

“Partners like Entergy provide generous financial support so we can purchase supplies for our cleanups, and they come with an employee volunteer group to help us tackle and complete large tasks,” said Pat McCallister-LeDuff, Scotlandville CDC President. “Entergy is a great community partner that is bringing our neighborhoods out of darkness.”

“It was an honor to volunteer today,” said Joseph Williams IV, Choctaw Storekeeper. “Giving back to the Scotlandville community was especially meaningful as a former resident. I’m already looking forward to the next event.”

EBR Mayor-President’s office, Metropolitan Councilmembers as well as Baton Rouge Police Department, and Baton Rouge Fire Department representatives also rolled up their sleeves to support the cleanup effort.

To help sustain these important community initiatives, Entergy Louisiana contributed $5,000 to both Keep Tiger Town Beautiful and Keep Jaguar Nation Beautiful. Together, we’re not just cleaning streets, we’re strengthening communities, protecting the environment, and powering a brighter, cleaner Baton Rouge through hands-on community action.

Will it be permanent legislation that is updated periodically?

This is an interesting question that I have received numerous times since the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). It’s an excellent and very forward-looking question about the future of U.S. agricultural policy. My thoughts are that, based on the nature and scope of the OBBBA, it is unlikely that the stand-alone, comprehensive Farm Bill will be eliminated entirely in the near future. However, the OBBBA has fundamentally changed the landscape.

Rationale for Expecting a Stand-Alone Farm Bill

Significant Provisions Remain Outside OBBBA. While the OBBBA included major, multi-year extensions and enhancements to core areas like Commodity Programs (ARC, PLC), Crop Insurance, and certain Tax Provisions for agriculture, it left several critical titles and programs either partially addressed or untouched. These include:

Conservation (many programs, despite some funding being extended by the Inflation Reduction Act)

Nutrition (like SNAP, although OBBBA may have included budget-related changes)

Rural Development

Research, Extension, and Education

Forestry

Horticulture/Specialty Crops

The Need for Bipartisan Updates. The traditional Farm Bill process is a rare instance of comprehensive, bipartisan legislation. Agricultural committees in Congress are generally motivated to draft and pass a full bill to address new issues and fine-tune existing programs across all titles, a process that a large, omnibus bill like OBBBA often bypasses.

Talk of a “Skinny Farm Bill.” Following OBBBA’s passage, there have been discussions in Congress about passing a “skinny Farm Bill” to reauthorize the programs that the OBBBA did not include or fully address, indicating that the full process is still seen as necessary.

The Nature of Future Legislation

The OBBBA is seen as extending and making some farm policy changes permanent or long-term (e.g., through 2031 for some commodity programs). The Farm Bill is not permanent legislation in the sense of never expiring. Congress typically writes a new bill every five or six years, suspending the old, permanent law (from the 1930s and 40s) for the duration of the new bill. The OBBBA’s actions effectively act as a very long-term extension and update for its included titles. Because the OBBBA resolved some of the most expensive and contentious titles (Commodity and Crop Insurance) for several years, it may reduce the urgency and political leverage for future stand-alone Farm Bills. Future Farm Bills will now likely start with the policies established by the OBBBA as their new baseline, focusing their debates and funding changes on the remaining titles and any new issues that emerge.

Specific Farm Bill Titles or Programs Not Included in the OBBBA

The “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” (OBBBA) focused primarily on the titles of the Farm Bill that have direct budgetary impacts and could be passed through the reconciliation process. Indeed, the OBBBA, in its agricultural provisions, focused heavily on the major spending titles. As a result, many other important titles from the 2018 Farm Bill (and previous versions) were not fully reauthorized or were only partially addressed, leaving programs for a future bill.

The key Farm Bill titles and areas that were generally not included or were left for a separate, traditional Farm Bill, often referred to as a “skinny Farm Bill,” are as follows:

Title III: Trade:

While OBBBA may have created or adjusted some trade promotion funding (like a new Agricultural Trade Promotion and Facilitation Program), the full reauthorization of key programs like the Market Access Program (MAP) and the Foreign Market Development Program (FMD) was largely left out or addressed only as part of a temporary or replacement measure.

Title V: Credit:

Programs for farm credit, which provide government-backed loans and guarantees, were generally not the primary focus of the OBBBA’s agricultural title.

Title VII: Research, Extension, and Related Matters:

Many of the core research and extension programs and institutions (like funding for land-grant universities, State Agricultural Experiment Stations, and various research agencies) were not comprehensively reauthorized, though some targeted research funding for specialty crops and facilities may have been included.

Title VIII: Forestry:

The Forestry title, which deals with public and private forest land management, was mostly excluded. For example, the Secure Rural Schools (SRS) program, which provides payments to counties with federal forestland, was specifically noted as being handled in separate legislation.

Title IX: Energy:

The Energy title programs, which support renewable energy and bio-based products, were generally not the focus of the OBBBA, though changes to tax credits (like the Clean Fuel Production Tax Credit) did have energy implications.

Title XII: Miscellaneous (Including many “Orphan Programs”):

This title includes a wide array of programs for beginning and socially disadvantaged farmers, livestock and poultry disease preparedness, and other assistance that are often considered “orphan programs.” Many of these programs were not addressed in the OBBBA and required separate action.

Key Reason for Exclusion

The primary reason these titles were often excluded is that the OBBBA was passed through the budget reconciliation process. This process is limited by the Byrd Rule, which means that most provisions must directly affect federal spending or revenues and cannot primarily be matters of policy. Many of the programs in the excluded titles are either:

Policy-focused, not directly budgetary.

Discretionary spending programs, which do not have the same immediate budgetary impact as mandatory programs, such as commodities and SNAP.

In short, a subsequent “skinny Farm Bill” would likely be needed to address the policy updates and fully reauthorize these other crucial titles.

Conclusion

It is highly likely that there will be a stand-alone Farm Bill in the future, but its focus and scope may differ due to the OBBBA. It will remain temporary legislation that will be updated periodically (typically every five years), but key parts of the farm safety net are now secured for a longer time horizon than usual.",https://rfdtv.brightspotgocdn.com/dims4/default/fca47d2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/794x446+58+0/resize/730x410!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fbrightspot-go-k1-rfdtv.s3.us-east-1.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F37%2F2e%2F407ac341454aa4753964057a84a4%2F8-farm-bill-hope.JPG,N,,2025-11-05 17:00:34.716408

According to the recently released 2025 Clean Jobs Midwest-Minnesota report , nearly 64,000 Minnesotans now work in fields such as energy efficiency, wind and solar development, electric vehicles, and grid modernization. These are family-supporting jobs that exist in every part of the state, from Duluth and elsewhere in Greater Minnesota to the Twin Cities — and they continue to grow twice as fast as the overall economy.

This success is not an accident. It is the direct result of consistent, forward-looking energy policy at the state level. By setting a clear path to 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040, Minnesota has created the market confidence that businesses and workers need to invest and grow.

That stability is more important than ever. At the federal level, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed earlier this year abruptly ends tax incentives for energy efficiency, electric vehicles, and wind and solar technologies. When the clean-electricity investment and production tax credits were signed into law in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, they were designed to support an all-of-the-above approach to electricity generation as well as storage technologies, as long as they produced electricity with no emissions. They also provided market participants with a decade of certainty regarding the phaseout of the tax credits, which was scheduled to begin in 2032.

However, the act specifically targeted only clean-energy technologies for rapid phaseout, with electric vehicle tax credits already ended and accelerated expiration timelines for other clean technologies, hampering American energy innovation and increasing energy costs for consumers. This kind of policy whiplash makes it extremely difficult for companies to plan and invest in hiring new workers, as well as developing capital and time-intensive projects that benefit our local communities and ensure a low-cost, flexible, and resilient energy system.

In the midst of all the uncertainty caused by federal-policy instability, Minnesota’s commitment to a steady clean-energy transition has and will continue to be critical in helping shield our state from volatility. By investing in low-cost and reliable energy efficiency, renewable energy, storage, and a portfolio of other clean-energy technologies, we are not only creating local jobs but keeping energy costs affordable for families and businesses.

In fact, a recent Politico analysis of federal data found that states investing most heavily in wind and solar have lower electricity costs. The data confirm what Minnesotans are already experiencing: Innovative clean-energy technologies make our energy system more reliable, more resilient, and more affordable over time.

As energy demand is projected to rise dramatically in the years ahead — especially with the growth of artificial intelligence, data centers, and electrification — the role and skills of clean-energy workers will only become more vital. These are the people building the infrastructure that will power our future while growing and strengthening our economy and energy independence.

Minnesota’s record-setting year for clean-energy jobs is proof that when we combine clear policy direction with local innovation and determination, we can lead through uncertainty and come out stronger. Our clean-energy workforce is one that all Minnesotans should be proud of, building new technologies and a more stable and prosperous future for all citizens of our state.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/570e8f4/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1807x1135+0+0/resize/1697x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F16%2F4a%2F6cf25f354ec9b972ef274560bf25%2F110625-op-dnt-masttoon.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 16:06:00.867735

By producing research partnerships and academic pathways, we're translating our discoveries to the real world and training students to fill critical workforce needs in Indiana.

Indiana is entering a new era of dynamic growth led by the biosciences, manufacturing, artificial intelligence, healthcare and hospitality industries. Just last year, Indiana's biosciences sector generated over $99 billion in economic activity, while its hospitality industry welcomed 30 million visitors who contributed $5.8 billion of economic impact. Increased demand presents opportunities to innovate, and Indiana University is rising to the occasion to help Indianapolis and the state thrive.

By creating new ways to ensure that students graduate with relevant experience, developing cooperative initiatives that strengthen key sectors and delivering research-backed solutions to issues affecting our region, IU is responding to the state's needs in real time and helping define its future.

Where academia meets industry

IU is reimagining how higher education can serve a state's business environment by helping boost existing businesses and creating and attracting new ones.

The IU Launch Accelerator for Biosciences is the front door for industry. Supported by a $138 million grant from Lilly Endowment Inc., this first-of-its-kind academic-industry initiative is elevating the state as a national biosciences hub. In collaboration with leading central Indiana bioscience organizations - like Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, BioCrossroads and IU Health - its goal is to find new discoveries and commercialize therapeutics and products that improve Hoosiers' health while creating jobs and driving investment in the state.

""IU LAB will unlock the potential of human health innovation by connecting ideas, talent and technology across disciplines and sectors,"" IU LAB President and CEO David Rosenberg said. ""It will do more than advance research; it will drive advancements and commercialization in biosciences that will ultimately shape the future of care, industry and Indiana through collaboration.""

IU LAB is already drawing in new companies. For example, the IU Health Incubator at IU LAB will assist up to 40 human health biosciences startups per year and help them grow into major companies. In July, the incubator's pre-accelerator in partnership with gener8tor launched a seven-week program where founders received tailored training to refine their businesses models and learn to raise capital.

Last month, IU LAB's LifeTech Accelerator launched in partnership with Plug and Play, BioCrossroads and IU Health. This 14-week intensive program will connect up to 30 startups to mentors, workshops, pitch sessions and corporate partners to accelerate their growth.

IU LAB also works to bring IU research to market. In tandem with the Convergent Bioscience and Technology Institute, the Institute for Human Health and Wellbeing, and the Integrated Nanosystems Development Institute at IU Indianapolis, it's leveraging faculty research to patent lifechanging technologies.

The Joint Center of Excellence for Point of Care Precision Medicine, a center co-created by IU and the Indiana Biosciences Research Institute, will be housed at IU LAB. The center seeks to transform healthcare outcomes by taking an interdisciplinary approach to discovering and developing new therapies, diagnostics and manufacturing processes, as well as become a genesis for startup ventures to grow.

""IU LAB is a powerful catalyst for Indiana's biosciences sector,"" said Vince Wong, president and CEO of BioCrossroads. ""By connecting promising startups with the resources and partnerships they need to develop and scale, IU LAB is helping unlock Indiana's full potential as a life sciences leader.""

Breaking barriers to innovation

IU's strategic partnerships help researchers seamlessly translate their discoveries - accelerating breakthroughs and strengthening Indiana's innovation ecosystem.

A Master Collaboration Agreement between the university and one of the state's largest medical device companies, Cook Medical, is making it easier to propel innovation, removing administrative barriers that can prevent ideas from flowing back and forth.

This all-services model includes research and development, research services, technical certifications, credentialing, workforce training and development, and technical consulting.

Researchers at IU already collaborate with Cook on cutting-edge technology. The Fibers and Additive Manufacturing Enabled Systems, or FAMES Lab, at the IU Luddy School of Informatics, Computing and Engineering worked with Cook to develop microscopically thin sensors that would revolutionize how surgeons operate.

Another IU-led initiative is bringing together the state's academic leadership with industry expertise to strengthen central and northern Indiana's musculoskeletal health impact.

The Indiana Musculoskeletal Health Partnership for the Advancement of Care & Treatment is a statewide, IU-led consortium with more than 100 partners, including Eli Lilly, Zimmer Biomet, BioCrossroads, OrthoWorx, IU Health and the Regenstrief Institute. The consortium aims to bridge the gap between unmet orthopedic health needs and the technologies - like implants and wearable diagnostics - that can solve them.

Preparing Indiana's best and brightest

When it comes to talent development, IU is a driving force for businesses across central Indiana and the entire state.

At IU Indianapolis, where 90% of graduates remain in Indiana to build their careers, co-op partnerships across sectors equip students with authentic workforce experience, while creating talent pipelines to the state's top employers in biomedical, business and hospitality industries.

Students interested in careers in finance, human resources or information technology can develop their skills through a co-op at Eli Lilly and Company. White Lodging, a hospitality company that operates the JW Marriott and four other hotels in the city, established a co-op for students studying tourism, event and sport management, preparing them for careers in Indianapolis' bustling hospitality industry after graduation. The Kelley School of Business connects students to real-world job experiences at Elanco through its Kelley Indianapolis Business Plus program.

To learn more about critical minerals, check out EESI’s issue brief, Critical Minerals and the U.S. Clean Energy Transition.

Rolling the Credits: Reps. Mike Thompson (D-Calif.) and Richard Neal (D-Mass.) introduced the American Energy Independence and Affordability Act (H.R.5862). The bill aims to restore the clean vehicle tax credit and investment and production tax credits for clean energy sources, and extend the energy efficiency and clean hydrogen production tax credits, which were established by the Inflation Reduction Act (P.L.117-69) but phased out by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L. 119-21).

At a press conference, longtime farmer and rural advocate Kent Yeager said rising production costs have completely changed the way farmers run their operations.

“Inputs are so expensive anymore,” Yeager said. “It’s changed dramatically over the last 25 or 30 years in how much it costs to raise a crop. It makes it really easy for that number to be negative if we don’t have good prices, and those prices are affected by a lot of things we can’t control.”

Yeager said the lack of clear market and government data, combined with the ongoing federal government shutdown, makes it even harder for farmers to plan for the next growing season.

Farmer Andrew Stewart echoed those concerns, noting that uncertainty in fertilizer supplies and energy costs has hit producers hard.

“We’ve been trying to look at alternatives. Chicken litter and other organic fertilizers are getting more popular, but with bird flu, you never know how many chickens will be out there to produce the manure,” Stewart said. “Then there’s the cost of transportation and application. If we can control our inputs a little bit, that helps, but everything is connected.”

He added that environmental and industrial shifts are unintentionally raising costs. “All our diesel engines now require DEF, which is made from urea, and that’s raised the cost of urea for fertilizer,” Stewart said. “Now we’re seeing phosphorus being used for electric car batteries, and down the road that could raise fertilizer costs too.”

Cattle producer Tim Schwab said trade policy and consumer education are equally important to the future of Hoosier agriculture.

“We need to educate consumers, not just about beef, but about all the products coming off the farm,” Schwab said. “Trade policies need to be market-driven and science-based. We raise the highest-quality soybeans and beef. If we let the markets work and base our policies on science, we’ll be a lot better off.”

Despite the current federal shutdown, the 36th in U.S. history, Stewart said most farmers are determined to keep working.

“Farmers are resilient,” he said. “We’re going to keep producing whether the government is open or not. There are things we have to put off, but we’re still trying to produce the highest-quality corn and soybeans we can.”

Still, the shutdown has disrupted key services. Yeager noted that some Farm Service Agency offices are closed and market reporting has stopped for crops and livestock. “Thankfully, meat inspectors are considered essential,” he said. “So processing plants are still operating.”

Schwab also spoke about the toll of the avian flu outbreak, which continues to affect poultry and egg producers nationwide.

“When we have to depopulate because of something like that, the stress is unreal,” Schwab said. “We care about our animals, and it takes a human toll. Consumers see higher prices for eggs and other products, but it also means producers have to change their biosecurity practices and deal with that emotional stress.”

Looking ahead to 2025, all three farmers agreed that stability in markets, policy, and public understanding will be key to sustaining Indiana’s farms and rural communities.","https://wibc.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/99/2025/11/17623636071824.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=723&crop=0,0,100,482px",N,,2025-11-05 16:06:29.716075

To further its impact, the organization launched a multi-million-dollar grant program across Appalachian states to assist partners in protecting the lands and waters most important for nature and people. The application process is now open to fund more projects in 2026.

The Resilient and Connected Appalachians Grant Program provides funding for nonprofit organizations, municipalities and other partners to engage in conservation efforts in the Appalachians—a center of climate resilience and a critical migration corridor for wildlife. The Program, launched in 2023, offers grants of up to $100,000 to support projects that result in the permanent protection of resilient and connected lands in key areas of the Appalachians. The program area includes all or portions of Maine, Vermont, New Hampshire, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Ohio, Maryland, West Virginia, Virginia, Kentucky, North Carolina, South Carolina, Tennessee, Georgia and Alabama.

“We are living in a pivotal moment—a defining decade to confront the urgent challenges of climate change and biodiversity loss, and to shape the future we aspire to,” said Heather Furman, Appalachians Director for TNC. “Through this grant program, we aim to accelerate vital efforts across the region, build lasting connections and preserve and protect important and critical lands.”

Conserving resilient and connected lands provides benefits to local people and communities, and the grant program aims to support like-minded organizations to accomplish similar goals. The community benefits that result from project funding will enable a broad cross-section of people and communities to cope with the effects of climate change and provide spaces for enhanced community well-being.

Earlier this year, grants were awarded to 14 organizations in 11 states to support the acquisition of over 17,000 acres, giving more than $1 million in privately-raised funds to communities, nonprofits, land trusts, Indigenous tribes and other partners working to protect forested land, waterways, mountains and natural habitats in the Appalachians region, a vital and vast corridor for wildlife migration, climate resilience and overall ecological protection. In total, the RCA Grant Program has provided $2.3 million to help protect over 27,000 acres since 2023. This will be its third year of funding.

The Resilient and Connected Appalachians Grant Program is part of the larger Connectivity, Climate and Communities Fund, which also includes the New York Climate Resilience Grant Program. The Fund’s overall areas of focus include:

Connectivity: Creating a connected network of resilient lands and waters—a biodiversity superhighway enabling plants and animals to adapt to a changing climate.

Climate: Protecting and managing forests that store significant amounts of carbon, accelerating the transition to well-sited renewable energy and helping communities to adapt and mitigate impacts from flooding.

Communities: Supporting resilient communities and sustainable livelihoods and strong connections to their natural landscapes.

“Through these efforts, we have the opportunity to protect essential habitats, cut greenhouse gas emissions, strengthen climate resilience and create new pathways for jobs and outdoor recreation,” said Furman. “By working together, we can shape a future where people, wildlife, and ecosystems have the space and freedom to adapt and flourish in a rapidly changing world.”",https://natureconservancy-h.assetsadobe.com/is/image/content/dam/tnc/nature/en/photos/t/n/tnc_31288858.jpg?crop=0%2C283%2C4000%2C2100&wid=1200&hei=630&scl=3.3333333333333335,N,,2025-11-05 17:00:56.630559

Developed in collaboration with governments, employers, and industry stakeholders, the standard provides a clear and consistent way for the workforce to build a strong knowledge and understanding of sustainability.

Meeting a global challenge

Every nation is navigating its own path to lower carbon emissions. Yet the global ambition remains the same: to reduce carbon emissions and move towards cleaner energy solutions.

“Around the world, countries are at different stages of their energy transition journey,” explains Ewen Hay, OPITO’s Director of Products and Services. “But the shared aspiration is clear. As a result, there’s a global desire to educate and inform the workforce about alternative energy solutions in a consistent way.”

OPITO’s new Sustainability Training Standard gives employers across safety-critical industries a practical, flexible route to prepare their people for the present and future demands of the energy transition.

Building sustainability expertise across the workforce

Designed for learners at all stages – from early careers to experienced professionals – OPITO’s Sustainability Training Standard is open to all, with no entry requirements.

The standard’s learning outcomes cover a comprehensive range of sustainability topics. Learners explore:

The global context for sustainability and climate change

The rationale for reducing carbon emissions

Key alternative energy sources, including hydrogen, wind, solar, and carbon capture and storage (CCS)

Local and global policies driving the transition to net-zero emissions

Participants learn how sustainability principles apply within industry and wider business settings. They also understand the contribution different energy sources make to both national and international carbon reduction goals.

“All learners who complete this training will have a greater understanding of sustainability in a global business context,” says Hay. “The standard provides participants with a really comprehensive understanding of alternative energy sources, the future energy mix, and aspirations of local governments to meet climate change targets.”

Global consistency, local relevance

OPITO’s Sustainability Training Standard offers employers consistent sustainability education for global teams while tailoring the learning experience to reflect local contexts. The standard combines international best practices with local strategies to make learning both globally consistent and regionally relevant.

For Hay, this balance is essential. “The standard is a trusted, globally relevant source of information that can also be contextualised to fit regional differences,” he explains. “Employers can be confident that their people are learning from an industry-recognized standard, with scope to reflect regional carbon reduction aspirations.

Developed in close collaboration with industry

Like all its products, OPITO’s Sustainability Training Standard was developed through close collaboration with industry stakeholders, and with governments and employers around the world.

This partnership-led approach underpins OPITO’s wider mission to support safety-critical industries through high-quality, globally-recognized training frameworks.

While the Sustainability Training Standard is a standalone product in its own right, it can complement some of OPITO’s other offerings – like its Introduction to Energy qualifications – for learners who wish to explore energy industry topics in more detail.

Preparing the workforce for the future

For employers, the energy transition brings both challenge and opportunity. The workforce must evolve in step with industry changes as new technologies and energy sources emerge.

“Now is the time for employers to train their workforce and get them ready for the changes ahead,” says Hay. “OPITO’s Sustainability Training Standard provides a valuable vehicle for organizations to give their people the knowledge they’ll need to work confidently across the future energy mix.”

Empowering learners for the energy transition

The launch of the Sustainability Training Standard reinforces OPITO’s commitment to supporting an industry in transition. As the global energy mix continues to diversify, OPITO remains focused on developing new, relevant solutions that reflect emerging technologies and changing workforce demands.

“We’re firmly focused on meeting the needs of employers and learners as the energy sector evolves,” Hay concludes. “This is just one step in OPITO’s ongoing journey to equip the global workforce with the skills and knowledge they need to play their part in shaping the future.”

Lead in soil, left by lead-based paint, can cause neurological damage, especially in children, for example. Meanwhile, contaminants called PFAS (per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances) and dubbed “forever chemicals” for their high persistence, are linked to cancer, problems with the immune response and in pregnancy, among other issues.

Zhiming Zhang, an assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering in the Henry M. Rowan College of Engineering, devises methods for removing these and other substances from soil and water.

When picked up and transported by stormwater, PFAS can enter drinking water sources. In studies of New Jersey stormwater runoff, he and colleagues identified multiple PFAS compounds, among which the concentrations of PFOA and PFOS exceeded many times over the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s four parts-per-trillion maximum contaminant level for drinking water. Meanwhile, his group is testing ways to remove these contaminants, including breaking them down with bacteria or specialized oxidation treatments. They are also experimenting with filtering PFAS out of water by, for example, binding them onto materials leftover from the treatment of drinking water, which would otherwise go to a landfill..

Separately, his group is extracting lead from soil with vetiver grass along with the use of biodegradable agents that aid this process. Over three years, this method cut the lead in a community garden plot in Jersey City down to about one-fourth its original concentration. After completing a remediation project like this one, they recycled the plants’ lead-containing roots by turning them into a type of charcoal known as biochar that then can be used to filter contaminants (e.g., heavy metals) from wastewater. The leaves, which uptake very little lead, are used to make bioethanol, a type of fuel. The use of the entire vetiver plant after soil lead extraction aims to form a circular economy model.

“We try to minimize waste and make the most use of the resources we have during the environmental protection process” Zhang says.

The Commerce Department signed a deal last week with Westinghouse owners Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management to spend $80 billion to build the company's nuclear plants across the U.S.

Under the deal, the U.S. government is granted a participation interest in Westinghouse and can require an initial public offering on or before January 2029 if the company's value surges to $30 billion or more.

The government could become an 8% shareholder in Westinghouse under this scenario, said Cameco Chief Operating Officer Grant Isaac on the company's third-quarter earnings call Wednesday. It is not entitled to a stake in Cameco or Brookfield under the deal, Isaac said.

Cameco would consider spinning out Westinghouse as an independent company in 2029 depending on the circumstances, the executive said.

""There is definitely a unique interest in investing just in Westinghouse,"" Isaac said. ""Cameco is a funny proxy for that. Brookfield's probably an even funnier proxy to invest in just Westinghouse.""

Cameco is one of the largest uranium miners in the world and Brookfield is one of the biggest investors in energy generation.

""We're going to keep all options on the table,"" Isaac said. ""This partnership agreement does not force us to leave Westinghouse in 2029. We don't have to sell any of our share — or we may if the value of Westinghouse is so significant come 2029 when that window opens up.""

The government's interest in Westinghouse vests only if it makes a final investment decision with definitive agreements to build new reactors in the U.S. with a total value of $80 billion.

The U.S. could use tools like Department of Energy loans or financing from ""other jurisdictions"" to finance the projects among other options, Isaac said.

""We're assured that there is a lot of interest in investing this minimum $80 billion in order to begin the process,"" the executive said.

Westinghouse has designed a big modern nuclear reactor called the AP1000 that the Trump administration wants to deploy across the U.S. to meet rising electricity demand from data centers and manufacturing. It generates a gigawatt of electricity, which is enough power for more than 750,000 homes.

President Donald Trump signed an executive order in May that called for the U.S. to start construction on 10 large new nuclear reactors by 2030. Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner said in July that the company would meet Trump's call with the AP1000.

But Westinghouse has struggled in the past to deliver the AP1000 on time and on budget. It went bankrupt in 2017 from cost overruns at big nuclear projects in Georgia and South Carolina.

The first two AP1000 reactors in the U.S. came online at Plant Vogtle in Georgia in 2023 and 2024 but the South Carolina project was canceled.

Westinghouse was bought by Brookfield and Cameco in 2023, five years after it emerged from bankruptcy. Brookfield has a 51% stake in Westinghouse and Cameco owns 49% of it.

The nuclear industry needs a big order of reactors to stimulate the market and supply chains, Isaac said. The U.S. government is serving that role, the executive said.

""What the U.S. government has done is committed to step in and be that stimulant if you will, their commitment is to facilitate the financing,"" he said.",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107159026-1669822107322-gettyimages-526258454-img_6728.jpeg?v=1669982401&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-11-05 15:20:26.782265

In the U.S., nuclear waste containing I-129 is scheduled to be disposed of in deep underground repositories, which scientists say will sufficiently isolate it.
What’s the best way to handle spent nuclear fuel?
Managing waste Iodine-129 is often a key focus for scientists and engineers as they conduct safety assessments of nuclear waste disposal sites around the world.
But there are still industries that release waste into the air and water.","One of the highest-risk components of nuclear waste is iodine-129 (I-129), which stays radioactive for millions of years and accumulates in human thyroids when ingested. In the U.S., nuclear waste containing I-129 is scheduled to be disposed of in deep underground repositories, which scientists say will sufficiently isolate it.

Meanwhile, across the globe, France routinely releases low-level radioactive effluents containing iodine-129 and other radionuclides into the ocean. France recycles its spent nuclear fuel, and the reprocessing plant discharges about 153 kilograms of iodine-129 each year, under the French regulatory limit.

Is dilution a good solution? What’s the best way to handle spent nuclear fuel? A new study by MIT researchers and their collaborators at national laboratories quantifies I-129 release under three different scenarios: the U.S. approach of disposing spent fuel directly in deep underground repositories, the French approach of dilution and release, and an approach that uses filters to capture I-129 and disposes of them in shallow underground waste repositories.

The researchers found France’s current practice of reprocessing releases about 90 percent of the waste’s I-129 into the biosphere. They found low levels of I-129 in ocean water around France and the U.K.’s former reprocessing sites, including the English Channel and North Sea. Although the low level of I-129 in the water in Europe is not considered to pose health risks, the U.S. approach of deep underground disposal leads to far less I-129 being released, the researchers found.

The researchers also investigated the effect of environmental regulations and technologies related to I-129 management, to illuminate the tradeoffs associated with different approaches around the world.

“Putting these pieces together to provide a comprehensive view of Iodine-129 is important,” says MIT Assistant Professor Haruko Wainwright, a first author on the paper who holds a joint appointment in the departments of Nuclear Science and Engineering and of Civil and Environmental Engineering. “There are scientists that spend their lives trying to clean up iodine-129 at contaminated sites. These scientists are sometimes shocked to learn some countries are releasing so much iodine-129. This work also provides a life-cycle perspective. We’re not just looking at final disposal and solid waste, but also when and where release is happening. It puts all the pieces together.”

MIT graduate student Kate Whiteaker SM ’24 led many of the analyses with Wainwright. Their co-authors are Hansell Gonzalez-Raymat, Miles Denham, Ian Pegg, Daniel Kaplan, Nikolla Qafoku, David Wilson, Shelly Wilson, and Carol Eddy-Dilek. The study appears today in Nature Sustainability.

Managing waste

Iodine-129 is often a key focus for scientists and engineers as they conduct safety assessments of nuclear waste disposal sites around the world. It has a half-life of 15.7 million years, high environmental mobility, and could potentially cause cancers if ingested. The U.S. sets a strict limit on how much I-129 can be released and how much I-129 can be in drinking water — 5.66 nanograms per liter, the lowest such level of any radionuclides.

“Iodine-129 is very mobile, so it is usually the highest-dose contributor in safety assessments,” Wainwright says.

For the study, the researchers calculated the release of I-129 across three different waste management strategies by combining data from current and former reprocessing sites as well as repository assessment models and simulations.

The authors defined the environmental impact as the release of I-129 into the biosphere that humans could be exposed to, as well as its concentrations in surface water. They measured I-129 release per the total electrical energy generated by a 1-gigawatt power plant over one year, denoted as kg/GWe.y.

Under the U.S. approach of deep underground disposal with barrier systems, assuming the barrier canisters fail at 1,000 years (a conservative estimate), the researchers found 2.14 x 10–8 kg/GWe.y of I-129 would be released between 1,000 and 1 million years from today.

They estimate that 4.51 kg/GWe.y of I-129, or 91 percent of the total, would be released into the biosphere in the scenario where fuel is reprocessed and the effluents are diluted and released. About 3.3 percent of I-129 is captured by gas filters, which are then disposed of in shallow subsurfaces as low-level radioactive waste. A further 5.2 percent remains in the waste stream of the reprocessing plant, which is then disposed of as high-level radioactive waste.

If the waste is recycled with gas filters to directly capture I-129, 0.05 kg/GWe.y of the I-129 is released, while 94 percent is disposed of in the low-level disposal sites. For shallow disposal, some kind of human disruption and intrusion is assumed to occur after government or institutional control expires (typically 100-1,000 years). That results in a potential release of the disposed amount to the environment after the control period.

Overall, the current practice of recycling spent nuclear fuel releases the majority of I-129 into the environment today, while the direct disposal of spent fuel releases around 1/100,000,000 that amount over 1 million years. When the gas filters are used to capture I-129, the majority of I-129 goes to shallow underground repositories, which could be accidentally released through human intrusion down the line.

The researchers also quantified the concentration of I-129 in different surface waters near current and former fuel reprocessing facilities, including the English Channel and the North Sea near reprocessing plants in France and U.K. They also analyzed the U.S. Columbia River downstream of a site in Washington state where material for nuclear weapons was produced during the Cold War, and they studied a similar site in South Carolina. The researchers found far higher concentrations of I-129 within the South Carolina site, where the low-level radioactive effluents were released far from major rivers and hence resulted in less dilution in the environment.

“We wanted to quantify the environmental factors and the impact of dilution, which in this case affected concentrations more than discharge amounts,” Wainwright says. “Someone might take our results to say dilution still works: It’s reducing the contaminant concentration and spreading it over a large area. On the other hand, in the U.S., imperfect disposal has led to locally higher surface water concentrations. This provides a cautionary tale that disposal could concentrate contaminants, and should be carefully designed to protect local communities.”

Fuel cycles and policy

Wainwright doesn’t want her findings to dissuade countries from recycling nuclear fuel. She says countries like Japan plan to use increased filtration to capture I-129 when they reprocess spent fuel. Filters with I-129 can be disposed of as low-level waste under U.S. regulations.

“Since I-129 is an internal carcinogen without strong penetrating radiation, shallow underground disposal would be appropriate in line with other hazardous waste,” Wainwright says. “The history of environmental protection since the 1960s is shifting from waste dumping and release to isolation. But there are still industries that release waste into the air and water. We have seen that they often end up causing issues in our daily life — such as CO2, mercury, PFAS and others — especially when there are many sources or when bioaccumulation happens. The nuclear community has been leading in waste isolation strategies and technologies since the 1950s. These efforts should be further enhanced and accelerated. But at the same time, if someone does not choose nuclear energy because of waste issues, it would encourage other industries with much lower environmental standards.”

The work was supported by MIT’s Climate Fast Forward Faculty Fund and the U.S. Department of Energy.

The government closure dragged into its 36th day Wednesday, shattering the record set during the last Trump administration for the longest shutdown ever. And there’s little indication this one will end anytime soon.

Federal workers across the government are furloughed, missing paychecks and unsure whether they’ll get back pay after White House suggestions that it’s not a sure thing.

The impacts of the shutdown have been uneven across the government — including at energy and environmental agencies — as the administration has found cash to keep some programs funded and officials have prioritized some favored projects over others. Some energy and environmental work has stopped entirely, while other projects are expected to grind to a halt as funding dries up.

Meanwhile, Democrats’ big wins in off-year elections Tuesday could shift the political calculus as the stalemate continues. Congressional Democratic leaders, emboldened by Tuesday’s results, kicked off the day Wednesday with their latest demand for a bipartisan meeting with President Donald Trump to talk about the shutdown.

Here’s what the longest shutdown looks like at energy and environmental agencies on day 36:

Interior Department

Despite roughly 29,000 Interior Department employees on furlough since Oct. 1, the department has barreled ahead with Trump priorities, including energy development.

That has included reopening the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling and issuing more than 600 drilling permits across public lands.

But elsewhere the shutdown has frozen normal business. Interior has missed court appearances and is losing an estimated $1 million a day in revenue that national parks usually collect during the busy fall season.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum sent an email Friday commiserating with the department’s furloughed staff.

“Whether you serve in the field, in regional offices, or here in Washington, your absence is felt,” he wrote.

The note comes on the heels of Burgum making several statements to the media characterizing the shutdown as an opportunity for the Trump administration to cut costs. Burgum was planning to lay off more than 2,000 department employees, but that agenda was temporarily blocked by a federal judge. Department officials said Tuesday they will no longer pursue layoffs during the shutdown.

Some critics have taken Burgum to task for advancing energy projects and visiting an oil summit in the United Arab Emirates and an energy gathering in Bahrain during the lapse in federal funds.

“Approving more than 600 drilling permits and dozens of new leases while parks operate with skeleton crews shows this shutdown is being used to benefit oil and gas executives at the expense of our public lands,” Aaron Weiss, deputy director of the Center for Western Priorities, said in a statement.

Bureau of Land Management

Interior’s Bureau of Land Management has continued to work on big-ticket items, such as a suite of policy directives opening hundreds of thousands of acres in Alaska to drilling, as well as smaller-scale moves like planned oil and gas lease sales, timber harvests, and mining permits.

Burgum announced last month that he was signing an order to reopen the coastal plain of ANWR to drilling, reversing the Biden administration’s halt on development.

He also announced that the agency is advancing construction of the 211-mile-long Ambler mining road to provide access to a remote mining district in northwestern Alaska.

Mining of critical minerals has remained a priority during the shutdown, and the bureau Monday approved the expansion of a barite ore mine in northeastern Nevada. In that case, the bureau used a streamlined permitting process, following the president’s call to shorten environmental reviews of simpler projects to 14 days.

BLM also announced this week it would hold an oil and gas lease sale in January involving parcels in Montana and North Dakota. That lease sale is now open for a 30-day public protest period.

Fish and Wildlife Service

While oil, gas and mineral permitting barrels forward, agencies including the Fish and Wildlife Service have missed court-set or statutory deadlines for action.

Environmental groups, for instance, have been pressing the Trump administration on allegations that officials ignored the National Environmental Policy Act when the state of Florida constructed an immigrant detention facility near the Everglades National Park.

Citing the shutdown, government attorneys convinced the 11th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to extend an important brief-filing deadline originally set for late October.

“The Department of Justice does not know when such funding will be restored by Congress,” DOJ attorneys advised the appellate court.

The Fish and Wildlife Service, too, has missed various deadlines set under legal settlements, including a decision whether to list the Bornean earless monitor as threatened or endangered and finalizing critical habitat for the endangered rusty patched bumble bee.

“The agency is starved of the money and staff needed to meet those deadlines,” said Jake Li, a former FWS official who is now vice president of conservation policy at Defenders of Wildlife. “Long before the shutdown, FWS struggled with this problem daily, and now it’s amplified multifold.”

National parks

The National Park Service has attracted significant public attention amid the shutdown, with more than 9,000 park staffers furloughed. The Trump administration ordered parks to remain mostly accessible to the public, tapping recreation fees to pay skeleton crews for cleaning. Those crews haven’t stopped some illegal activity spiking in parks, such as parachuters in Yosemite.

Some conservation groups, worried about damage to facilities, urged visitors to stay home during the peak fall foliage that drives the highest visitation days of the year for some parks.

Private groups and local governments have secured funds to pay national park staff in some cases, as a stopgap until the government reopens. West Virginia secured cash to keep Harpers Ferry National Historical Park and the New River George National Park and Preserve open. Similar efforts supported Muir Woods National Monument in California and the Great Smoky Mountains National Park in Tennessee and North Carolina. States have helped pay for parks in previous shutdowns as well, but those arrangements have sometimes sparked discord over whether states should be repaid.

Parks without outside funding have been burning through their fee funds to keep facilities partially staffed. As long as the shutdown lasts, the agency is also losing new revenue to replace that money, because parks can’t collect fees during the shutdown. They are bleeding roughly $1 million per day from uncollected entrance and recreation fees, according to the National Parks Conservation Association.

EPA

EPA has managed to stay open during the shutdown, but its operations are slowly grinding to a halt.

Tapping carryover funds, the agency has adopted an unusual “phased” approach to furloughs. Consequently, employees working on Trump administration priorities, such as drafting rule rollbacks and approving permits, remain on the job while others have been sent home.

That has spiked anxiety among staffers who don’t know if they will receive a paycheck or furlough notice during the funding lapse, according to EPA employees granted anonymity because they fear retaliation.

One agency staffer said managers have been unable to answer questions about who will be sent home and when. “Headquarters is basically flying by the seat of their pants, but we all knew that already,” they said.

On the eve of this shutdown, essentially all staffers received an unsigned email to report to work for the time being. Furloughs, however, have now spread across the agency through its program offices and regional branches.

American Federation of Government Employees Council 238, EPA’s largest union, conducted an internal survey of EPA employees two weeks ago, and 60 percent of roughly 1,000 respondents said they were furloughed. In turn, the union estimates that 6,000 to 7,000 EPA employees have been sent home during the shutdown.

Administrator Lee Zeldin has said EPA’s biggest wave of furloughs came last month, capturing 4,000 employees. He has warned that another round is coming as the shutdown lingers.

“A total lapse of funding is an 89 percent reduction of our agency, which means that a lot of the president’s priorities, the American public’s priorities, wouldn’t be able to be met,” Zeldin said in a Fox News interview over this past weekend.

The administrator was referring to the agency’s shutdown plan, which would furlough more than 13,000 EPA employees once carryover funds run out.

EPA spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said in a statement the agency has been “intentional and aggressive” focusing on statutory obligations and presidential priorities during the shutdown. EPA’s statement didn’t address questions about how many employees have been furloughed and when carryover funds will expire.

Slowed operations

Parts of the agency’s operations have been stalled as spending starts to run thin. The publication of proposed and final rules in the Federal Register — a key step in allowing for public feedback and ensuring that new regulations take hold — has slowed to a trickle.

More than a month ago, for example, EPA dropped a bid to give the coke industry more time to meet hazardous air pollutant regulations strengthened last year during President Joe Biden’s tenure. But because the decision to reinstate the original compliance timetable has yet to appear in the Register, it has not taken effect.

EPA press aides acknowledged receipt of a Tuesday email but did not reply to questions regarding the publication delay.

The shutdown is also slowing proceedings in Clean Air Act lawsuits. Except for “very limited circumstances,” Department of Justice attorneys are prohibited from working, according to a filing early last month in legal challenges to another Biden administration regulation that tightened the annual soot exposure standard.

A federal appeals court agreed to DOJ’s request to postpone an upcoming deadline until funding is restored.

Water, chemical safety work

In EPA’s Office of Water, the shutdown has halted the distribution of grants to states, water utilities and local governments. The situation comes as EPA is months behind in allocating funding this year to states to remove and replace lead pipes under the state revolving funds.

EPA has also stopped approving new water quality standards and water pollution cleanup plans for specific bodies of water, per its shutdown plan. But the water office has continued to work on certain Trump administration priorities, having held a webinar on Oct. 14 about EPA’s plans to give coal companies more time to comply with a major water pollution rule.

It’s not clear how widespread the impacts have been when it comes to water-related permits, according to some observers.

“We have not heard of any issues yet. I think this is because of the carryover funding the agency was using,” Julia Anastasio, executive director of the Association of Clean Water Administrators, an association for state officials charged with protecting surface waters, said in an email.

“We know that several regional offices and parts of [the water office] were operating on carryover funds and that those funds are starting to run out,” Anastasio added.

Meanwhile, staffers who work on new chemical reviews and pesticide registrations have been churning out approvals, as evidenced by documents published in the Federal Register this week. But employees in that same office who work on pollution prevention programs — roughly 30 percent of the office’s workforce — have been furloughed.

The shutdown has added to the often lengthy wait times for EPA to process records requests under the Freedom of Information Act, with the agency citing “unusual circumstances” in noting that FOIA office employees may be furloughed.

Meanwhile, waste from industrial facilities has gone unchecked as meetings with polluters have been canceled, according to a third EPA employee who has been sent home. They recently stopped by one of the sites they had been monitoring.

“I watched the stack spew stuff into the air for a little bit before driving on,” said the staffer.

Energy Department

At the Energy Department, the shutdown has dealt the biggest blow to hundreds of staffers in the office that oversees the nation’s nuclear weapons.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright late last month said the agency was finding “creative ways” to pay contractors at the National Nuclear Security Administration through the end of October. Wright’s comments arrived on the heels of the department furloughing 1,400 employees in the division. About 375 staffers are being exempted and will remain on the job at NNSA.

DOE later clarified that it had tapped money for contractors from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in July.

Ben Dietderich, a spokesperson for DOE, said in a statement that NNSA contractors across the agency have enough funding to work through the end of November and that the agency is continuing to safeguard the nation’s nuclear deterrent.

“Due to the Democrat shutdown, a portion of the [NNSA] federal support contracts lapsed on October 31st. These contractors, which account for less than six percent of the NNSA’s contracts, primarily serve administrative roles,” said Dietderich. “Our contractors across NNSA’s labs, plants, and sites have funding through the end of the month. DOE/NNSA continues to safeguard our nation’s nuclear deterrent.”

Staffers throughout other parts of the agency say they’re girding for possible furloughs, but that hinges on how much funding their individual offices have left to continue operating.

They are also eyeing possible layoffs.

DOE last month notified staffers in at least six offices, including those focused on solar, wind and hydrogen, that they could be reassigned, fired or transferred.

The agency also accused those divisions of “wasteful spending” and “regulatory overreach” under the Biden administration, even though many of the offices don’t write regulations and are focused on research, and small-scale testing and demonstration of new technologies.

One DOE staffer said they’ve received no information “since those letters went out something like three weeks ago.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/67/29/a2feec7c44ad9efba65bb938fa21/u-s-congress-12899.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 17:19:30.435407

In the letter, ABC thanked the committee for examining how apprenticeship and workforce development programs can help meet the nation’s growing demand for skilled construction workers. “Registered apprenticeships are one important part of a diverse workforce development ecosystem,” said Kristen Swearingen, ABC vice president of government affairs. “But rigid structures and lengthy completion times discourage participation by employers and workers alike. Congress should modernize and expand the system to support all high-quality training models that successfully prepare Americans for rewarding construction careers.”

ABC’s 67 chapters educate craft, safety and management professionals using innovative and flexible learning models, such as just-in-time task training, competency-based progression and work-based learning. These talent development initiatives occur alongside ABC’s more than 450 federal and state government-registered apprenticeship programs, or GRAPs, that prepare American’s nationwide for safe and productive work in more than 20 occupations. Further, ABC members invested an estimated $1.6 billion in construction industry workforce development to upskill 1.3 million course attendees in 2023, including hundreds of GRAPs, independently administered by ABC member companies.

However, it is clear that, at current rates of participation and completion, federal and state GRAPs still fail to meet the construction industry’s short- and long-term skilled workforce development needs. According to an annual ABC analysis of U.S. Department of Labor data, ABC estimates that, in fiscal year 2024, 290,000 apprentices were enrolled in federal and state GRAPs that yielded less than 40,000 completers—well short of the 439,000 workers needed in 2025 alone.

ABC and its members’ investment in GRAPs is reflected by DOL data displaying significant growth in nonunion GRAPs between FY 2015 and FY 2024.

The DOL’s data presents five-year trend lines indicating stronger proportional growth in the number of nonunion GRAPs, apprentice participants and apprentice completers compared to union-affiliated GRAPs since FY 2019.

In FY 2024, 84% of the construction industry’s GRAPs were nonunion providers. The number of nonunion GRAPs has grown by 25% since FY 2019, compared to a 7% decrease in union-affiliated GRAPs since FY 2019.

Participants in nonunion GRAPs increased by 40.7% from FY 2019 to FY 2024, compared to 10.7% for union programs.

In FY 2024, 29.74% of all construction industry GRAP participants were in nonunion programs.

Further, while construction unions represent just 10.3% of the U.S. construction workforce, they continue to operate a majority of the nation’s registered apprenticeship programs, accounting for roughly 69% of participants.",,N,,2025-11-05 14:06:19.137643

Mikie Sherrill won the governor’s race in New Jersey on Tuesday running on a platform of keeping electricity prices down. Environmental groups see Sherrill’s election as a triumph for the Garden State’s struggling offshore wind sector.

Sherrill, a four-term Democrat and a U.S. Navy veteran, arrived on the political scene in 2017 and advocated for offshore wind projects on Capitol Hill. As a gubernatorial candidate, she was one of only three Democrats who explicitly endorsed offshore wind on campaign websites early in the race.

Her Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, ran on a promise to ban future offshore wind development. His campaign website sells ​“stop offshore wind” tote bags, t-shirts, stickers, and beverage koozies. Sherrill handily beat Ciattarelli, winning 56% to 43% at press time.

“In-state produced power through offshore wind and other renewable technologies is the only path forward to ensure carbon reduction while prioritizing price stability, economic growth, and resource adequacy,” said Paulina O’Connor, executive director of the New Jersey Offshore Wind Alliance, an advocacy group whose work is funded in part by wind developers.

Sherrill will take office next year without any offshore wind projects operational or under construction along the state’s roughly 130 miles of coastline. That’s in stark contrast to the other East Coast states that, like New Jersey, have incentivized offshore wind development through tax breaks and have planned grid and clean-energy goals around the sector’s growth. Massachusetts, Virginia, New York, and Rhode Island all have installations completed or currently underway.

New Jersey’s incumbent Phil Murphy, also a Democrat, was once a fierce proponent of offshore wind but has ostensibly distanced himself from the sector in recent months as President Donald Trump’s war on offshore wind proved, in some ways, insurmountable for a lame-duck governor.

The Trump administration has frozen the permitting pipeline for all of New Jersey’s earlier-stage offshore projects. Atlantic Shores, the state’s only fully approved wind farm, had one of its federal permits revoked in March by the Environmental Protection Agency. Shell, the project’s codeveloper, officially withdrew from the project last week.

As governor, Sherrill’s ability to counter federal anti-wind policies will be limited. But she can make sure the state remains a player in the industry, which is still advancing in nearby New York. In that state, one project, South Fork Wind, is fully operational, and another, Empire Wind, is under construction.

Sherrill, for example, could expand funding for programs that train workers for wind jobs. She could increase legal pressure against the Trump administration for obstructing certain projects, as Rhode Island and Connecticut have done. New Jersey’s Attorney General Matthew Platkin, along with 17 other attorneys general, is already suing the Trump administration over its broad-reaching executive order that froze federal permitting for wind power.

Her campaign promise to freeze New Jerseyans’ utility rates through a State of Emergency declaration on Day 1 and to push back on federal overreach signifies a willingness to come out fighting.

“Governor-elect Sherrill campaigned on the need for bold action to reduce family energy costs. [The American Clean Power Association] welcomes the Governor-elect’s recognition that clean power is key to meeting demand and keeping costs low,” said Jason Grumet, CEO of the trade group, in a statement released shortly after Sherrill’s acceptance speech on Tuesday night.

In January, Sherrill will take the reins from Murphy, who set New Jersey on a path to building a 100% zero-emissions power grid by 2035 but ultimately failed to generate any new offshore wind power. New Jersey voted on Tuesday for a candidate who aims to keep the state’s climate ambitions alive.

Africa’s share of the voluntary carbon market tripled between 2020 and 2024.

Credits are increasingly funding clean cooking and off-grid electrification.

British lender Tandem Bank announced in late October 2025 that it had offset all its 2024 operational emissions by purchasing over 3,300 tons of carbon credits from Climate Impact Partners. The credits were generated from household solar projects in Kenya and Uganda, which provide thousands of homes with reliable electricity while reducing kerosene use. Revenue from the sale of these credits helps sustain and expand such community-based clean energy initiatives.

Carbon credits have become an important climate finance mechanism linking companies in the Global North to high-impact projects in the Global South, particularly across Africa. Issued following independent verification of emission reductions, these credits are purchased by companies to compensate for residual emissions. The voluntary carbon market, where Tandem operates, channels growing private investment into clean energy efforts—mainly in clean cooking and decentralized electrification.

Some African projects are also part of regulated international frameworks such as Article 6.2 of the Paris Agreement. One example is the Spark+ Africa Fund and Envirofit initiative in Ghana, which completed the first issuance and sale of transferable carbon credits (ITMOs) to Switzerland. The credits were generated from improved cookstove projects that reduce firewood and charcoal use while creating local jobs.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), transactions linked to energy-related carbon credits reached $335 million in 2024, representing less than 0.02% of global clean energy financing.

Xcel Energy anticipates that the projects will qualify for federal tax credits, 30% for the Blue Lake battery, 40% for the Sherco battery and solar projects.
Xcel Energy’s plan to expand Sherco Solar with a fourth phase will increase its total capacity to 910MW by 2029.
Sherco Solar, launched in 2024, is the largest solar power plant in the Upper Midwest.
Earlier in October, Xcel proposed building out a 200MW network of distributed battery storage across Minnesota.","Additionally, Xcel states the proposal would add 135.5MW of battery storage at the company’s Blue Lake facility in Shakopee and expand the company’s Sherco Solar facility with an additional 200MW solar array in Clear Lake Township.

This would bring the total BESS deployed to 735.5MW. The company would begin construction on the BESS projects in 2026, aiming to be operational by late 2027. The projects will use lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cell technology.

The batteries will utilise existing grid connections, enabling Xcel Energy to store energy generated from its wind, solar, nuclear, and natural gas facilities across the Upper Midwest. This stored energy can then be released during times of high demand.

According to Xcel, the Sherco battery projects are expected to generate over 150 union construction jobs and approximately US$200 million in local tax revenue.

Additionally, the Blue Lake project is projected to create around 55 construction jobs and contribute US$60 million in local taxes.

Xcel Energy anticipates that the projects will qualify for federal tax credits, 30% for the Blue Lake battery, 40% for the Sherco battery and solar projects.

The company claims it passes these tax credits directly to customers as reduced bills.

Xcel Energy’s plan to expand Sherco Solar with a fourth phase will increase its total capacity to 910MW by 2029. This expansion is projected to generate approximately 300 union construction jobs and bring about US $90 million in local economic benefits.

Sherco Solar, launched in 2024, is the largest solar power plant in the Upper Midwest. The first two phases are already operational, with a third phase under construction that aims to begin supplying electricity to customers in 2026.

Earlier in October, Xcel proposed building out a 200MW network of distributed battery storage across Minnesota.

Under its ‘Capacity*Connect’ proposal, Xcel Energy aims to install up to 200MW of small-scale battery storage across Minnesota by 2028, networked and aggregated as a virtual power plant (VPP) to operate as a front-of-the-meter (FTM) resource.

Partnering with Sparkfund, Xcel explains that these distributed energy resources will help meet increasing electricity demand, provide reliable service, optimise existing infrastructure, and boost local employment.

When this plan was announced, John Farrell, Co-Director of The Institute for Local Self-Reliance (ILSR), noted in a post on social media networking site LinkedIn:

“Xcel’s programme would monopolise ownership of a battery storage program that seems to approach distributed batteries as a ‘small chunks of a utility-scale battery’ strategy, focused solely on transmission system benefits.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/xcel-energy-riverside.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 17:19:10.278972

What's happening?

California established the California E-Bike Incentive Project, a program designed to provide e-bike voucher incentives to low-income residents, in 2022, opening applications in December 2024.

The program was funded by the California Air Resources Board (CARB) and offered eligible residents up to $2,000 toward the purchase of an e-bike.

According to the San Diego Union-Tribune, CARB spokesperson Lisa Macumber said interest in the program far outstripped the number of available vouchers.

""We had over 150,000 people trying to get into the program, and we only have 1,000 vouchers. It's challenging. It's like getting tickets to a Taylor Swift concert,"" she explained.

Less than a year later, however, the ambitious initiative was unceremoniously axed, and its funding reallocated.

Executive Director of the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike), Kendra Ramsey, told KQED that the decision appeared to stem from the end of federal EV tax credits. Ramsey said that of the $30 million allocated for e-bike vouchers, $17 million will go to an electric vehicle incentive.

Ramsey stated that it was ""really unfortunate"" that federal policy undermined Californians' access to ""really the cheapest and most economical, sustainable transportation option.""

She and others with knowledge of the decision were surprised that the popular program was ending, and suggested CARB's silence on the matter spoke volumes.

""It definitely gives the sense that CARB knows that this is the wrong direction to be moving in, to keep it so quiet,"" said San Francisco Bicycle Coalition executive director Christopher White.

Why is this important?

Individuals with knowledge of the program admitted it was imperfect, but as Ramsey emphasized, it offered a clean transportation option to those without the means to buy an electric vehicle.

Unused funds from California's e-bike initiative were expected to go to Clean Cars 4 All.

Typically, it's extremely good news when states pour funding into EV incentives — but in this instance, those funds come at the expense of subsidizing e-bikes, a form of transport accessible to those who cannot or do not wish to drive or own a car.

For all their upsides — and there are many — electric vehicles don't cover all travel needs.

E-bikes offer unique benefits like allowing commuters to get a workout in on the way to work.

What's being done about it?

According to BikingInLA, bicycle advocacy groups have yet to respond to the news, which didn't appear to have been announced in a cohesive manner.

California riders can contact lawmakers to object to the decision.

However, even without vouchers, upgrading to an e-bike is an underrated choice for many commuters and city dwellers. TCD partner Upway is a great place to look for an affordable option, especially since it sells both new and used models often starting as low as about $700.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hsERJKiUuF8KIrtJ1Hnqew--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/89b5d82e6964b67a247da15a95219373,N,,2025-11-05 15:20:11.636239

Retail food, supermarket racks: Original rule: 150 GWP limit for new supermarket systems with 200 or more lbs.
Cold storage warehouse equipment: Original rule: 150 GWP limit for new equipment with 200 or more lbs.","Original TTR

The EPA finalized its original TTR in 2023, under the authority of the AIM Act of 2020. The rule established sector-based GWP limits across all key HVACR-related equipment sectors that use high-GWP HFC refrigerants.

The framework of the original TTR was the culmination of a decade-long process of phasing down HFCs globally and in the U.S. As a result, it incorporated direct feedback and recommendations from stakeholders across all sectors, including food retail, where many are actively working toward their own corporate sustainability goals.

Per the TTR’s compliance deadlines, some key regulations have already taken effect in 2025. These include the 700 GWP limit on residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump equipment, and the 150 GWP limit on self-contained refrigeration.

Recent data suggests that these sectors have not only transitioned successfully to lower-GWP refrigerants but are also experiencing associated business benefits. For example, Heating, Air-conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International (HARDI) reported that as of July, 82% of air conditioning and heat pump shipments were for A2L-based equipment — up from 13% in January. A recent ATMO report also noted that 4.6 million self-contained R-290 cabinets are installed in North America.

Although the new EPA proposal upholds the sector-based GWP limits of those that have already taken effect, it recommends significant delays for transitions that had been planned for the next several months.

Proposed TTR

The EPA’s proposed changes to the TTR extend compliance deadlines five to six years, while raising GWP limits across key sectors in the interim. Some of these changes are detailed below.

Retail food, supermarket racks:

Original rule: 150 GWP limit for new supermarket systems with 200 or more lbs. of refrigerant and 300 GWP limit for less than 200 lbs., starting January 1, 2027.

Proposed changes: 1,400 GWP limit for new supermarket systems, starting January 1, 2027; 150 to 300 GWP limit (depending on charge size), starting January 1, 2032.

Retail food, condensing units:

Original rule: 150 GWP limit for new condensing unit systems with 200 or more lbs. of refrigerant and 300 GWP limit for less than 200 lbs., starting January 1, 2026.

Proposed changes: 1,400 GWP limit for new condensing units, starting January 1, 2026; 150 to 300 GWP limit (depending on charge size), starting January 1, 2032.

If implemented in retail food sectors, the interim 1,400 GWP limit would allow HFCs such as R-448A/R-449A to be used through 2032. R-448A/R-449A is considered a lower-GWP HFC alternative to R-404A, which was phased down through previous state-led efforts.

Cold storage warehouse equipment:

Original rule: 150 GWP limit for new equipment with 200 or more lbs. of refrigerant and 300 GWP limit for less than 200 lbs., starting January 1, 2026.

Proposed changes: 700 GWP limit for new equipment, starting on January 1, 2026; 150 to 300 GWP limit (depending on charge size), starting on January 1, 2032.

For residential and light commercial air conditioning and heat pump systems, the proposed changes call for removing the installation and/or sell-through restrictions of legacy HFC manufactured or imported before January 1, 2025.

In addition, the new EPA proposal included modifications to the following sectors:

Refrigerated transport — intermodal containers: changes the exemption temperature from -50°C to -35°C.

Industrial process refrigeration: extends the compliance date for equipment with a refrigerant charge of 100 lbs. or less used in the manufacture of semiconductors, from 2026 or 2028 to 2030. Also extends compliance dates for refrigerated centrifuges and laboratory shakers from 2026 to 2028.

Notably, the EPA did not propose changes to the original rule for other sectors, which still face near-term GWP reductions:

Stationary variable refrigerant flow (VRF) air conditioners and heat pumps: 700 GWP limit with an installation compliance date of January 1, 2027;

Data centers, computer room air conditioners, and information technology cooling: 700 GWP limit as of January 1, 2027;

Automatic commercial ice machines (smaller sizes): 150 GWP limit as of January 1, 2026;

Food processing and dispensing equipment: 150 GWP limit as of January 1, 2027; and

Ice cream makers: cannot use 38 restricted refrigerants as of January 1, 2028.

Industry Challenges

The new TTR proposal raises concerns over the ability to align demand for HFCs with the global phasedown schedule, particularly in the retail food refrigeration sector. Extending compliance across key sectors to 2032 as proposed — with a 1,400 GWP threshold for food retail — would directly conflict with the global HFC phasedown established under the AIM Act.

The next step in the HFC phasedown will be in 2029, which will mandate a reduction of supplies down to 30% of the baseline levels. If implemented as proposed, these competing policies could cause demand to outpace supply. Rather than mitigating future refrigerant shortages and price spikes, extending HFC usage another five to six years could have the opposite effect, including:

Potentially intensifying refrigerant pricing and availability pressures for servicing existing systems throughout their useful lifecycles; and

Increasing the potential for stranded assets and early equipment obsolescence.

This raises the question: will there be enough new 1,400 GWP (i.e., R-448A/R-449A) supplies to satisfy increased demand, while staying under the HFC phasedown cap? Refrigerant recovery efforts would need to be practiced and enforced much more rigorously.

Although industry stakeholders can comment on this proposal through November 17, much of the industry has already prepared for the January 1, 2026, compliance deadlines of the final rule, which are currently in effect. For example, new lower-GWP remote condensing units are already entering the distribution channel as planned to meet the January 1, 2026, installation date requirement. If this timeline is delayed by six years as proposed, it could create confusion and potentially strand much of the lower-GWP inventories, as demand for these units might decrease.

From a manufacturing standpoint, the wheels supporting a transition to lower-GWP equipment are already in motion. Significant advancements and investments have been made in the past five years, including an improvement in the efficiency and performance of CO2 refrigeration systems. The industry is also preparing to launch A2L-optimized racks and condensing units.

Most manufacturers in the equipment supply chain have begun sunsetting their legacy HFC offerings. Reworking and restoring these production/manufacturing lines during the interim extension period could incur significant additional costs, which could ultimately be passed on to the end users of this equipment.

Balanced Path

As the EPA states in their reconsideration of the TTR, their goal was to provide flexibility by extending compliance deadlines.

This marks the EPA’s first enforcement action and settlement with a company for violations of the 2020 rule.

The Accidental Release Reporting Rule, promulgated by the CSB in February 2020 and codified at 40 C.F.R. Part 1604, is part of the chemical accident prevention requirements under section 112(r) of the CAA. The rule requires owners and operators of stationary sources to report to the CSB, within eight hours, any accidental release of regulated or other extremely hazardous substances into the ambient air (including the atmosphere inside or outside a stationary source) that results in fatality, serious injury, or substantial property damage. Reporting a release to the National Response Center (NRC) does not satisfy the rule but does enable streamlined reporting to the CSB. Although the CSB promulgated the rule, the EPA maintains the authority to enforce it.

The announced settlement alleges that on June 8, 2023, an accidental release of natural gas from a Pacific Gas and Electric Company (PG&E) facility pipeline in San Jose, California caused a serious injury to a PG&E employee. PG&E reported the release to the NRC the same day, provided a follow up report to NRC two days later, and filed an incident report with the Pipeline Hazardous Materials Safety Administration on July 3, 2023, and a final revision of that report later in 2023. However, according to the settlement, PG&E did not report the release to the CSB within eight hours, as the rule requires. The CSB’s press release on the settlement states that the company’s failure to report timely occurred “[d]espite being advised by the CSB that the company was required to report the release.” The settlement states PG&E submitted its report to the CSB on April 2, 2025. Under the settlement, which takes the form of a Consent Agreement, PG&E will pay a civil penalty of $45,273 for the violation of the timely reporting requirement.

The EPA’s press release quotes EPA Deputy Assistant Administrator Cecil Rodrigues for the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance: “This settlement clearly signals that EPA will hold companies accountable for not providing CSB with essential information, which can lead to the potential for loss of life, injury, or property damage.” The press release also notes, “Failure to report incidents such as these hinder the CSB’s ability to investigate accidental releases, determine probable causes of those releases, and recommend measures to prevent future occurrences.” And finally, “This settlement further reinforces the partnership between the CSB and EPA in promoting chemical safety and preventing accidental releases.”

Earning the favor of 70% of voters in Tuesday’s election, Proposition 4 requires the state to allocate $20 billion for water projects over the next two decades.

Those can include flood mitigation, new water sources, wastewater treatment plant expansions and conservation.

While significant, the new money is not enough for needs across the state though it will play a major role in keeping water affordable, said Dan Buhman, Tarrant Regional Water District general manager, after election results.

“State funding has saved us millions of dollars,” he said. “It’s an important investment that the state makes in our water supply reliability and affordability.”

In the weeks approaching the election, local officials expressed concern about the need to do more to secure new water sources.

“(Prop 4) is only a drop in the bucket,” said state Rep. Ramon Romero, D-Fort Worth, during the Fort Worth Report’s recent 1 Million & Counting Growth Summit. To keep up with the city’s increasing population, he stressed, “We have a long, long way to go.”

Among the largest challenges to securing water supplies are costs and the amount of authority given to local officials, Buhman said at the event.

The local water district’s resources provide water to 2.5 million residents in the North Texas area, but that’s not enough to keep up with needs, according to state projections. Tarrant County will need over 673,000 acre-feet of water — which is about four times as large as the capacity of Eagle Mountain Lake — by 2080.

The state’s new funds to address that need will help overcome some of the cost as that money goes to the Texas Water Fund, which was created by lawmakers in 2023 to address the state’s rapidly growing population, water demands and aging transmission lines.

However, building expensive new reservoirs — the natural or human-made lakes used to store water — may still be difficult to accomplish. Such projects, which can top billions of dollars, often face opposition due to land acquisitions and environmental impacts.

“What we saw this last legislative session is the desire to invest money, but also a desire to kill water ideas,” Buhman said at the event.

For example, a failed bill would have required the Texas Water Development Board — the agency responsible for statewide water planning — to scrap reservoirs from planning if construction had not begun within 50 years.

That would have included the Marvin Nichols Reservoir, a project that’s been in planning for the Dallas-Fort Worth area since the 1960s but has faced ongoing pushback from communities in the East Texas area of the state where it is planned to be built.

Tarrant County officials consider projects in other parts of the state, but costs for new water resources skyrocket the further they are, Buhman urged.

“Our duty is to provide water at a reasonable cost,” he said at the summit. “If the state can invest money … and participate in that increased cost … that makes a lot of sense to me.”

How does Proposition 4 work?

By 2027, officials must allocate the first $1 billion of state revenue that exceeds $46.5 billion in sales taxes annually to the Texas Water Fund.

About half of that money set aside each year will be dedicated for major projects, such as fixing leaky transmission lines, wastewater and desalination plants, flood control and new reservoirs.

The Texas Water Development Board administers the Texas Water Fund, directing dollars toward projects for local communities.

Texas’ population is projected to grow by 53% between 2030 and 2080, from 34 million to 52 million, according to state estimates.

Securing resources and fixing broken or deteriorating water systems are among the state’s greatest needs, according to a report from nonprofit think tank Texas 2036. Addressing those needs requires $154 billion in funds within the next 20 years.

Now, state water board officials must determine which communities have the greatest need for the new fund, creating competition.

Earning a chunk of the annual $1 billion could largely help some of the new projects being planned at the water district, such as new reservoirs and out-of-state resources.

“All of those (projects) are eligible,” Buhman said. “It will just be a question of which ones the (state) wants to fund.”

Millions of American homeowners may not be aware that key financial incentives and tax credits will no longer be available at the end of this calendar year.

On Dec. 31, 2025, federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire. American Home Shield breaks down what is changing and how homeowners can ensure they lock in savings before the end of the year.

What was the Inflation Reduction Act?

The IRA of 2022 was a landmark act designed to address climate change by investing in clean energy and manufacturing through tax incentives, grants, and loan programs.

Tax credits authorized by the IRA have helped everyday American households and businesses afford energy-efficient upgrades, including HVAC systems and other big-ticket items.

According to Energy Star, homeowners can claim 30% of project costs up to $2,000 for qualifying energy efficiency home improvements like heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves, or up to $1,200 for qualifying water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and central AC units.

What has changed?

The IRA’s federal tax incentives for energy-efficient installations and upgrades were originally supposed to last until 2032, but the federal government is ending them early. The program will now expire on Dec. 31.

There is now only a limited time left for homeowners to take advantage of these tax credits.

Why is it important to act now?

Qualifying HVAC systems must be purchased and installed by Dec. 31. Documentation is key — homeowners should keep invoices or receipts with dates, contractor plans and permits. They should be able to clearly show when the work was completed and when the service was turned on so that if audited, they can prove it was finished by the end of 2025.

What are some signs an HVAC needs to be replaced?

Even the highest quality HVACs will need to be replaced at some point, making the expiring federal tax credits even more valuable to act on now.

“AC units typically last 10 to 15 years. If homeowners know their unit is getting close to that timeframe, or there are signs of decline, they should start researching replacements,” said Micah Sherman, a virtual HVAC expert with American Home Shield.

“A few signs to look out for include strange sounds coming from the unit, hot or cold spots in the house, or refrigerant leaks. Sometimes the cost of repairing these problems warrants considering a new system altogether,” said Sherman.

The end of the federal tax credits program is a change consumers need to be aware of, but if they act quickly, there is still time to capture savings before it expires.

Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear.","Fossil fuels still power much of the world, even though renewable energy has become cheaper in most places and avoids both pollution and the climate damage caused by burning coal, oil and natural gas.

To understand this paradox, it helps to look at how countries – particularly major greenhouse gas emitters, including the U.S., China and European nations – are balancing the pressures of rising electricity demand with the global need to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are warming the planet.

US embraces fossil fuels

The United States makes no secret of its fossil fuel ambitions. It has a wealth of fossil fuel reserves and a politically powerful oil and gas industry.

Since President Donald Trump took office in January, his administration has been promoting oil and gas drilling and coal production, pointing to rising electricity demand to justify its moves, particularly to power artificial intelligence data centers.

Reviving the “drill, baby, drill” mantra, the Trump administration has now embraced a “mine, baby, mine” agenda to try to revive U.S. coal production, which fell dramatically over the past two decades as cheaper natural gas and renewable energy rose.

The Department of Interior on Sept. 29 rolled out a plan to “unleash American coal power” by opening 13 million acres of federal land to mining. The Department of Energy also pledged $625 million to try to make coal competitive. It includes lowering the royalty rates mining companies pay and extending the operating lifespans of coal-fired power plants.

However, these initiatives further lock communities with coal plants into a carbon-intensive fossil fuel. Coal’s resurgence would also have public health costs. Its pollution is linked to respiratory illness, heart disease and thousands of premature deaths each year from 1999 to 2020 in the United States.

The Trump administration is also ceding the clean energy technology race to China. The administration is ending many renewable energy tax credits and pulling federal support for energy research projects.

I work in the Climate Policy Lab at The Fletcher School of Tufts University, where we maintain a suite of databases for analyzing countries’ energy research budgets.

The Trump administration’s 2026 U.S. budget request would slash funding for energy research, development and demonstration to $2.9 billion — just over half the budget allocated in 2025. These energy research investments would fall to levels not seen since the mid-1980s or early 2000s, even when accounting for inflation.

China’s clean energy push – and coal expansion

While the United States is cutting renewable energy funding, China is doubling down on clean energy technologies. Its large government subsidies and manufacturing capacity have helped China dominate global solar panel production and supply chains for wind turbines, batteries and electric vehicles.

Cheaper Chinese-manufactured clean energy technologies have enabled many emerging economies, such as Brazil and South Africa, to reduce fossil fuel use in their power grids. Brazil surged into the global top five for solar generation in 2024, producing 75 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity and surpassing Germany’s 71 TWh.

The International Energy Agency now expects global renewable energy capacity to double by 2030, even with a sharp drop expected in U.S. renewable energy growth.

However, while China expands clean energy access around the world, its production and emissions from coal continue to rise: In the first half of 2025, China commissioned 21 gigawatts (GW) of new coal power plants, with projections of over 80 GW for the full year.

This would be the largest surge in new coal power capacity in a decade for China. Although China pledged to phase down its coal use between 2026 to 2030, rising energy demand may make the plan difficult to realize.

China’s paradox — leading in clean energy innovations while expanding coal — reflects the tension between ensuring energy security and reducing emissions and climate impact.

Europe’s scramble for reliable energy sources

The European Union is pursuing strategies to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels amid the ongoing geopolitical tensions with Russia.

Russia’s invasion of Ukraine exposed many countries to supply disruptions and geopolitical turmoil, and it triggered a global energy crisis as countries once reliant on Russian oil and gas scrambled to find alternatives.

In June 2025, the European Commission proposed a regulation to phase out Russian fossil fuel imports by the end of 2027, aiming to enhance energy security and stabilize prices. This initiative is part of the broader REPowerEU plan. The plan focuses on increasing clean energy production, improving energy efficiency and diversifying oil and gas supplies away from Russia.

Renewables are now the leading source of electric power in the EU, though natural gas and oil still account for more than half of Europe’s total energy supply.

The EU’s fossil energy phaseout plan also faces challenges. Slovakia and Hungary have expressed resistance to the proposed phaseout, citing concerns over energy affordability and the need for alternative supply sources. Hungarian Prime Minister Victor Orbán said Hungary would continue importing Russian oil and gas. Cutting off these supplies, he asserted, would be an economic “disaster” and immediately reduce Hungary’s economic output by 4%.

The path to reducing Europe’s dependence on fossil fuels thus involves navigating internal disagreements and incentivizing long-run sustainable development. Europe does appear to be gaining in one way from the U.S. pullback from clean energy. Global investment in renewable energy, which hit a record high in the first half of 2025, increased in the EU as it fell in the U.S., according to BloombergNEF’s analysis.

Brazil: Torn on fossil fuels as it hosts climate talks

This month, representatives from countries around the world will gather in Brazil for the annual United Nations climate conference, COP30. The meeting marks three decades of international climate negotiations and a decade since nations signed the Paris Agreement to limit global temperature rise.

The conference’s setting in Belém, a city in the Amazon rainforest, reflects both the stakes and contradictions of climate commitments: a vital ecosystem at risk of collapse as the planet warms, in a nation that pledges climate leadership while expanding oil and gas production and exploring for oil in the Foz do Amazonas region, the mouth of the Amazon River.

Thirty years into global climate talks, the disconnect between promises and practices has never been so clear. The world is not on track to meet the Paris temperature goals, and the persistence of fossil fuels is a major reason why.

Negotiators are expected to debate measures to curb methane emissions and support the transition from fossil fuels. But whether the discussions can eventually translate into a concrete global phaseout plan remains to be seen. Without credible plans to actually reduce fossil fuel dependence, the annual climate talks risk becoming another point of geopolitical tension.

Responsibly sited and operated land-based wind energy projects are essential to safeguarding the future of birds and people.","The 2025 U.S. State of the Birds report revealed that birds are suffering rapid population declines across the United States from impacts like habitat loss. Audubon’s science shows that two-thirds of North American bird species are at risk of extinction unless we take bold action to cut pollution and slow the rise in global temperatures. Increasingly extreme weather conditions and shifting seasons are already altering ecosystems and threatening species’ survival.

When done responsibly, developing more land-based wind energy can help protect birds from these escalating threats. As demand for energy continues to grow, it is essential that we plan thoughtfully for how to meet those needs. Wind energy is one of many ways that human activities interact with bird populations and habitats, with other structures like buildings having greater impacts, and research efforts over the last several decades have continued to improve understanding to avoid or minimize risks. That's why Audubon advocates for planning and siting projects based on the best available science and working with local communities to ensure that development benefits both people and wildlife.

The latest publication from the Renewable Energy Wildlife Institute (REWI), Wind Energy Interactions with Wildlife: Answers to Frequently Asked Questions Based on the State of the Science, provides a comprehensive summary of publicly available information about how land-based wind power interacts with birds and bats in North America. It also highlights the latest strategies to avoid and minimize impacts like collisions and habitat degradation, underscoring that early and meaningful engagement with state wildlife management agencies, careful planning, research, and collaboration can help advance the clean energy projects we need.

Responsible Land-Based Wind Development

Responsible wind development involves siting and operating projects in ways that advance renewable energy while reducing risks to birds and other wildlife. Best practices and advanced mapping are used to identify low-conflict areas and avoid sites that are critical for birds. Collision-reducing technologies, conservation offsets for any unavoidable impacts, and rigorous monitoring before and after construction also help ensure that projects continue to minimize impacts to birds over time.

Audubon is a founder and Board member of REWI, an independent nonprofit convening renewable energy companies, conservation and science organizations, and public agencies to develop and leverage peer-reviewed science on renewable energy, wildlife, and ecosystems. With over 120 years of conservation science, Audubon works with developers and decision-makers on responsible land-based wind energy development.

For example, Audubon’s collaboration with wind projects in the Tehachapi Mountains of California resulted in experimentation with advanced technologies to detect Golden Eagles and California Condors if they enter a project area in order to turn the turbines off in around 30 seconds. Many of the wind projects also provided conservation benefits to California Condors in advance through captive breeding programs and other measures through a U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) permit that provides conservation before any Condors have been harmed. Since then, no Condors have been killed or injured at a wind project and the population has grown through the permit.

Key Takeaways from the REWI Summary

In recent decades, extensive research has examined how land-based wind energy interacts with wildlife and their habitats. Audubon has been part of these efforts since the first meeting of the National Wind Coordinating Collaborative (NWCC), a precursor to REWI, in 1994. REWI’s summary synthesizes publicly available, peer-reviewed, scientific studies conducted by professional biologists and analyzed using rigorous, impartial methods.

For many birds, the current rate of estimated mortality from wind turbines would not be expected to have a population-level impact. The species most frequently affected by turbine collisions tend to be common perching birds like Mourning Doves with large populations and high reproductive rates. For these species, the impact from wind turbines is typically less than 0.02 percent of their total population, which is remarkably low compared to other, far more widespread causes of bird mortality such as building collisions.

However, some bird species are more vulnerable to population level impacts than others. Species with declining populations that are sensitive to any additional sources of mortality or disturbance, such as Greater Sage-Grouse, Ferruginous Hawk, and Lesser Prairie Chicken, are a high priority for Audubon when engaging on a wind project. A 2020 report from USFWS revealed that populations of Golden Eagles are stable, but cumulative impacts from various stressors like lead poisoning, shooting, and electrocution on power lines may contribute to further declines. Because Golden Eagles have relatively small populations and slow reproductive rates, any additional mortality from turbine collisions can have a greater impact on their overall population trajectory.

New technologies are currently deployed at wind projects to minimize the risks for those species that could have elevated levels of impact from wind energy. For example, camera-based systems coupled with machine vision algorithms can detect and classify raptors like Golden Eagles in real time and can substantially reduce fatalities by automatically shutting down turbines. Research continues in additional technologies and operating practices that may avoid and minimize harm to birds like contrast painting of turbine blades.

Responsibly sited and operated land-based wind energy projects are essential to safeguarding the future of birds and people. Researchers, conservationists, and industry partners are working together to develop and implement strategies to avoid, minimize, monitor, and offset impacts. With the best available science, continued collaboration, and community input, we can build a clean energy future that benefits the climate, people, and conservation.",https://media.audubon.org/2025-10/WEB_Aud_Manzana-Wind_240206-0310_Photo-Sydney-Walsh.jpg?width=1200&height=630&auto=webp&quality=90&fit=crop&enable=upscale,N,,2025-11-05 15:20:35.450024

Storage revenue surges

Nevada-based Ormat is an independent power producer that operates a 1.6-GW portfolio of geothermal, waste heat recovery, solar and energy storage resources with assets in the United States, Kenya, Latin America and Southeast Asia. It aims to nearly double its energy generation and storage capacity by the end of 2028, executives said on a third-quarter earnings call Tuesday.

Ormat earned $24.1 million profit in the third quarter, up 9.3% from $22.1 million a year ago. Its Q3 2025 revenue was $249.7 million, an increase of nearly 18% from the third quarter of 2024.

Ormat saw strong performance in its products and energy storage segments, which respectively account for 25% and 8% of its total sales. Storage was the standout, posting 108% growth year over year thanks to favorable seasonality and higher capacity prices in the PJM Interconnection.

The electricity segment accounts for 67% of Ormat’s sales. It was noticeably weaker this quarter due to a September storm that knocked out the grid near the company’s southern California assets, curtailments related to transmission upgrades in Nevada and lower energy prices in Hawaii.

On Tuesday, Ormat Chief Financial Officer Assaf Ginzburg said the curtailments could cost Ormat $40 million to $50 million this year. But CEO Doron Blachar characterized the issues as one-offs and said the company did not expect a repeat in 2026.

Ormat expects to book about $167 million from tax equity financing and tax credit transfer transactions this year, higher than previously forecast. It sees $50.4 million in net tax benefits from the investment and production tax credits for energy storage and geothermal authorized by the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 and extended in full through 2033 by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act of 2025.

Ormat expects to grow its energy generation and storage capacity by 15% to 17% annually through 2028. In its core electricity segment, it sees 162 MW of solar growth and 240 MW to 340 MW of geothermal growth. Though a significant portion of its planned geothermal additions are slated for non-U.S. markets like Indonesia, Blachar said Ormat feels good about its projects in resource-rich Nevada despite a recent 10-fold increase in geothermal proposals entering NV Energy’s interconnection queue.

Updates on two enhanced geothermal partnerships

Ormat announced enhanced geothermal, or EGS, partnerships with SLB and Sage Geosystems earlier this year.

“We have achieved significant progress in advancing our EGS strategy,” Blachar said on Tuesday. He cautioned, however, that the partnerships likely would not accrue to Ormat’s capacity pipeline until after 2028.

The SLB partnership is a joint venture that Blachar said would blend SLB’s drilling and subsurface engineering expertise with Ormat’s thermal power plant design, development and operation. The first phase is a pilot project that could be operational in late 2026 at Ormat’s Desert Peak plant in Nevada — a significantly shorter headway than building a new facility for the project. If successful, Ormat and SLB would jointly develop commercial-scale power plants for independent power producers, utilities and large industrial customers.

The Sage pilot would follow a similar timeline, but the Texas-based startup is still deciding on a site, Blachar said. In August, Sage CEO Cindy Taff told Latitude Media that it was considering three sites in Nevada and Utah. If the pilot pans out, Ormat could then develop, build, own and operate geothermal power plants and energy storage facilities — including long-duration storage — using Sage’s EGS technology.

In both cases, Blachar said, each commercial-scale EGS facility could have hundreds of megawatts of capacity, compared with a few tens of megawatts at most traditional geothermal sites.

Strong energy storage growth and pipeline

Revenues in Ormat’s energy storage business more than doubled in the third quarter, albeit from a low base.

But that base is growing quickly as Ormat plans to add 660 MW to 760 MW of capacity over the next three years, upsizing its storage portfolio from 290 MW today to as much as 1,050 MW by the end of 2028. Ormat commissioned a 60 MW/120 MWh project in Texas last quarter and plans to bring an additional 175 MW/580 MWh online across three projects in California and Texas by the end of 2026.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s foreign sourcing rules remain a concern for Ormat given industrywide dependence on Chinese components, Blachar said. The company had “safe-harbored whatever we could” to reduce the near-term impacts on tax credit eligibility, he added, referring to the practice of beginning work on energy projects to grandfather them into existing tax rules.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/EIyLtm66cSdYNqYzvzA2Prfwdk-beVWHkw6gZS2HpQs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Pcm1hdF9nZW90aGVybWFsLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-05 14:05:43.609292

The court also used the doctrine to reject other elements of the Biden administration’s agenda, including its efforts to address the Covid-19 pandemic and student debt.
The court’s commitment to the doctrine will be tested in its approach to the tariffs program.","Opponents of President Trump’s tariffs program and the federal appeals court that rejected it both said it ran afoul of the “major questions doctrine,” which requires Congress to use plain and direct language to authorize sweeping economic actions by the executive branch.

The 1977 law that Mr. Trump relies on, the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, might seem to fail that test, as it does not feature the word “tariffs” or similar terms like “duties,” “customs,” “taxes” or “imposts.”

There is no question that the tariffs will have vast economic consequences, measured in the trillions of dollars. The sums involved are far larger than the roughly $500 billion at issue in President Joseph R. Biden Jr.’s student loan forgiveness program, which Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr., writing for the majority, called “staggering by any measure” and struck down for running afoul of the major questions doctrine.

The doctrine, a judicially created principle of statutory interpretation, is of relatively recent vintage. It follows the premise that Congress does not “hide elephants in mouse holes,” as Justice Antonin Scalia put it in a 2001 opinion. That is to say, if Congress wants to give the president power to take major economic action, it will say so plainly.

The actual words “major questions doctrine” did not appear in a majority opinion until 2022, when Chief Justice Roberts cited them to curtail the Environmental Protection Agency’s power to address climate change. Without “clear congressional authorization,” he wrote, the agency could not act.

That ruling was part of a trend. The court also used the doctrine to reject other elements of the Biden administration’s agenda, including its efforts to address the Covid-19 pandemic and student debt.

The court’s commitment to the doctrine will be tested in its approach to the tariffs program.

In a concurring opinion in June in an unrelated case, however, Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh proposed a distinction that could lay the groundwork for a decision in Mr. Trump’s favor despite the doctrine.

“The major questions canon has not been applied by this court in the national security or foreign policy contexts,” he wrote, adding, “The usual understanding is that Congress intends to give the president substantial authority and flexibility to protect America and the American people.”",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/05/multimedia/05scotus-tariffs-major-questions-bvjp/05scotus-tariffs-major-questions-bvjp-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 14:06:36.145138

The Lake Boudreaux project, located between Dulac and Chauvin, was made possible through funding from the Louisiana Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority FY24 Conservation and Restoration Partnership Fund and a grant from TC Energy. The effort was carried out in partnership with the Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw, as well as landowner Apache Louisiana Minerals LLC and the Terrebonne Parish Consolidated Government.

A fall site visit showed strong survival and growth of the Baccharis and marsh elder shrubs planted on the terraces.

“We were excited to see that the plants took to the drier soils of the terraces so well,” said Andrew Ferris, CRCL’s Native Plants Program senior coordinator. “Terraces are a great form of coastal protection, and adding plants to them adds to their effectiveness.”

The terraces themselves, constructed by the parish, are designed to reduce wave energy, encourage sediment accumulation, and minimize storm surge. Vegetative plantings enhance these benefits by stabilizing soils and supporting wetland habitats.

CRCL, a nonprofit focused on restoring Louisiana’s coast, has planted more than 1 million trees and shrubs through its Native Plants Program and recycled over 15 million pounds of oyster shells to build reefs that provide habitat and slow land loss. The organization also hosts the biennial State of the Coast conference and runs educational programs including the Coastal Leadership Institute and Future Coastal Leaders program.

This fall, CRCL is continuing its collaboration with the Grand Caillou/Dulac Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw at LUMCON in Cocodrie, building an oyster reef using shell recycled from New Orleans and Baton Rouge restaurants.

Instead of focusing on the electric vehicle as a breakthrough technology, Washington framed it as an environmental issue — one that remains politically divisive.
Electric vehicles are not just clean cars, but rather computers on wheels, connected to data, chips and infrastructure.
Losing the electric vehicle race means losing leverage over critical technology standards, supply chains and industrial jobs.
In China, electric vehicles are now at the center of innovation.","While Beijing built gigafactories, the United States debated tax credits. China saw electric vehicles as an industrial strategy — we saw them as climate policy. Now, China commands 60 percent of global battery electric vehicle sales and dominates the battery supply chain that will power tomorrow’s cars, trucks and buses. America barely reaches 16 percent.

It didn’t have to be this way. It was an American company — Tesla — that reintroduced electric vehicles into modern driving. In 2009, Tesla announced its first all-electric Model S, and began delivering them four years later. Affluent American consumers rushed to buy this new “it” car — but most Americans balked at its high price tag. China jumped at the opportunity to industrialize: it took the concept pioneered by Tesla and transformed it into a mass-market revolution.

By 2015, China had already surpassed the United States in domestic battery electric vehicle sales. Although many of these were Teslas, China’s early adoption signaled where the industry was heading.

That same year, Beijing launched “Made in China 2025,” an industrial policy to accelerate advanced manufacturing capabilities and reduce foreign dependence. But China’s leaders had identified “new energy vehicles” as a strategic sector long before that — as early as 2006 — and followed up with a National Energy-Saving and New Energy Vehicle Development Plan in 2012. When “Made in China 2025” elevated electric vehicles as a national priority, the industry exploded.

Meanwhile, the U.S. took a wrong turn. Instead of focusing on the electric vehicle as a breakthrough technology, Washington framed it as an environmental issue — one that remains politically divisive.

American policy solutions suffered as a result. The $3,400 federal tax credit introduced in 2005 — later raised to $7,500 — was the most ambitious measure we had. (It expired on Sept. 30.) States added rebates and HOV lane access, but these incentives aimed to change consumer behavior, not to strengthen American manufacturing. That narrow framing had global consequences. While we debated environmental incentives, China was building the foundations of a new industrial order. Today, the world’s leading electric vehicle producers are increasingly Chinese.

Electric vehicles are not just clean cars, but rather computers on wheels, connected to data, chips and infrastructure. Losing the electric vehicle race means losing leverage over critical technology standards, supply chains and industrial jobs. This isn’t just about automakers; it’s about national power and the future of our tech ecosystem.

In China, electric vehicles are now at the center of innovation. Companies are integrating augmented reality entertainment systems, artificial intelligence-assisted driving, and even rooftop drone installations, alongside advances in fast charging and battery design. Beijing is now rolling out its intelligent connected vehicle strategy that integrates vehicles with roads and cloud systems through AI-driven networks. If China exports this ecosystem globally, non-connected U.S. and allied vehicles risk being locked out of future markets.

The U.S. must start treating electric vehicles as an advanced technology sector central to our economic competitiveness and innovation power. National leaders should move beyond purchase subsidies to focus on industrial build-out, software-defined vehicle research and development, and secure data infrastructure.

And we don’t have to do it alone. Allies from Japan to Germany face the same challenge. Joint battery production, shared industrial standards, and coordinated investment can strengthen all our industries — together.

Electric vehicles aren’t a climate accessory. They’re the next platform for global technological power. America can’t afford to sit in the passenger seat.

TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Teva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd. (NYSE and TASE: TEVA) today reported results for the quarter ended September 30, 2025.

Mr. Richard Francis, Teva's President and CEO, said, “Our innovative portfolio driving the 11th consecutive quarter of growth in the third quarter reflects the accelerating momentum of our transformation and the strength of our innovation-led Pivot to Growth strategy. Our key growth drivers—particularly our innovative medicines—delivered a 33% increase in local currency, underscoring their impact on both patient outcomes and our financial performance. As we continue executing our strategy, we remain firmly on track to reach our 30% non-GAAP operating profit margin by 2027 and ~$700 million of net savings target.”

With our talented team and unwavering commitment to patients, we are confident about Teva’s future and our ability to deliver enduring value to all our stakeholders.”

Pivot to Growth Strategy

In the third quarter of 2025, we continued to execute on the four key pillars of our “Pivot to Growth” strategy, announced in May 2023. As part of this strategy, in the second quarter of 2025 Teva entered its ""Accelerate Growth"" phase, during which we expect to focus on growing our innovative portfolio, aligning capital allocation to invest in activities we expect to have the highest value, and modernizing our organization and operations to drive both efficiency and cost savings.

Delivering on our Growth Engines - on the first pillar, our key innovative brands – AUSTEDO, AJOVY and UZEDY – continued to demonstrate strong performance. Collectively, these products grew ~33% in Q3 2025 YoY in local currency. For AUSTEDO, we are raising the 2025 revenue outlook by $50 million - $100 million to a new range of $2,050 million - $2,150 million. For AJOVY and UZEDY, we are reaffirming our previous outlooks of $630 million - $640 million and $190 million - $200 million, respectively. The conclusion of the IRA pricing negotiations reinforces confidence in our long-term outlook for AUSTEDO. We are on track for our 2027 revenue target of >$2.5 billion for AUSTEDO and peak year revenue target of >$3 billion. During the third quarter of 2025, the FDA approved an expansion of AJOVY's indication, to include its use as an anti-CGRP preventive treatment for pediatric episodic migraine in patients aged 6 to17 years who weigh 45 kg or more. This approval marks an important step in Teva’s efforts to advance care for neurological conditions.

Stepping Up Innovation - on the second pillar, we continued to accelerate the development of certain key pipeline assets. For olanzapine LAI, we presented new long-term safety data from the SOLARIS Trial with no PDSS observed and anticipate filing its New Drug Application (NDA) in Q4 2025. Teva’s investigational therapy emrusolmin (TEV-56286) received U.S. FDA Fast Track designation for the treatment of Multiple System Atrophy (MSA), a rare and progressive neurodegenerative disease with no approved treatments to slow its progression —another step forward in Teva’s commitment to advancing innovative neuroscience therapies. Phase 3 programs for duvakitug (anti-TL1A) in UC and CD were initiated by Sanofi and Teva in October 2025; on track to achieve target enrollment levels in the adult and pediatric populations for DARI’s (Dual-action Asthma Rescue Inhaler) Phase 3 trial at the end of 2025.

Sustaining Our Generics Powerhouse - on the third pillar, we remain focused on strengthening our world-class global generics business with a streamlined portfolio of high-value complex generics and biosimilars, a robust pipeline, and an integrated global manufacturing and commercial footprint. In the U.S., we received FDA approval and launched liraglutide injection (the generic version of Saxenda®), the first-ever generic GLP-1 treatment indicated for weight loss. This milestone strengthens Teva’s complex generics portfolio, expanding access to effective weight management options for adults and adolescents. Our recently launched biosimilars – SIMLANDI® (adalimumab-ryvk), SELARSDITM (ustekinumab-aekn) and EPYSQLI® (eculizumab-aagh) – continue to grow as does our legacy biosimilar portfolio.

Focusing our Business - Lastly, on the fourth pillar, to accelerate our growth, we are actively transforming and modernizing our business through Teva Transformation programs. On May 7, 2025, we announced that these programs are expected to generate ~$700 million of net savings through 2027. We are on track to achieving our targeted savings for 2025.

Teva continues in its effort to sell its active-pharmaceutical ingredient (API) business. Exclusive discussions with a selected buyer on the sale have terminated. Teva is initiating a renewed sales process, maintaining its strategic intention to divest its API business. On December 31, 2024, Teva classified the business (including its R&D, manufacturing and commercial activities) as held for sale.

Third Quarter 2025 Consolidated Results

Revenues in the third quarter of 2025 were $4,480 million, an increase of 3% in U.S. dollars, or 1% in local currency terms compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly due to higher revenues from AUSTEDO and from generic products including biosimilars in our U.S. segment, partially offset by lower revenues from generic products in our International Markets segment due to the divestment of our business venture in Japan, from generic products in our Europe segment, and from certain other innovative products in all of our segments, as well as lower year-over-year proceeds from the sale of certain product rights.

Exchange rate movements during the third quarter of 2025, net of hedging effects, positively impacted revenues by $106 million, compared to the third quarter of 2024.

Exchange rate movements during the third quarter of 2025, including hedging effects, had a positive impact of $21 million on our operating income and non-GAAP operating income compared to the third quarter of 2024.

Gross profit in the third quarter of 2025 was $2,304 million, an increase of 7% compared to $2,148 million in the third quarter of 2024. Gross profit margin was 51.4% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 49.6% in the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP gross profit was $2,475 million in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 6% compared to $2,327 million in the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP gross profit margin was 55.3% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to 53.7% in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in both gross profit margin and non-GAAP gross profit margin was mainly due to higher revenues from AUSTEDO.

Research and Development (R&D) expenses, net in the third quarter of 2025 were $256 million, an increase of 7% compared to $240 million in the third quarter of 2024. Our higher R&D expenses, net in the third quarter of 2025 compared to the third quarter of 2024, were mainly due to an increase in immunology projects, partially offset by a decrease in our late-stage innovative pipeline in neuroscience (mainly neuropsychiatry), which was also impacted by a reimbursement from our strategic partnerships in the third quarter of 2024.

Selling and Marketing (S&M) expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were $656 million, an increase of 5% compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly to support revenue growth in our key innovative products and in generic products.

General and Administrative (G&A) expenses in the third quarter of 2025 were $317 million, an increase of 6% compared to the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly due to costs related to optimization activities of Teva’s global organization and operations in connection with Teva’s Transformation programs, as well as a negative impact from exchange rate fluctuations.

Other loss in the third quarter of 2025 was $7 million, compared to other income of $21 million in the third quarter of 2024. Other income in the third quarter of 2024 included a capital gain from the sale of a business in our International Markets segment.

Operating income in the third quarter of 2025 was $882 million, compared to an operating loss of $51 million in the third quarter of 2024. Operating income as a percentage of revenues was 19.7% in the third quarter of 2025, compared to an operating loss as a percentage of revenues of 1.2% in the third quarter of 2024. This increase was mainly due to the goodwill impairment charge and higher legal settlements and loss contingencies recorded in the third quarter of 2024. Non-GAAP operating income in the third quarter of 2025 was $1,294 million representing a non-GAAP operating margin of 28.9% compared to $1,214 million representing 28.0%, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. The increase in non-GAAP operating margin in the third quarter of 2025 was due to higher gross profit margin, partially offset by an increase in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues.

Financial expenses, net in the third quarter of 2025 were $237 million, mainly comprised of net-interest expenses of $209 million. In the third quarter of 2024, financial expenses, net were $272 million, mainly comprised of net-interest expenses of $225 million and a negative exchange rate impact, driven mainly from currencies which we were unable to hedge.

In the third quarter of 2025, we recognized a tax expense of $214 million, on a pre-tax income of $646 million. In the third quarter of 2024, we recognized a tax expense of $69 million, on a pre-tax loss of $324 million.

Non-GAAP tax rate in the third quarter of 2025 was 14.7%, compared to 16.0% in the third quarter of 2024. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the third quarter of 2025 was mainly affected by changes in deferred tax balances due to statutory tax rate changes and interest and inflation adjustments related to the agreement with the Israeli Tax Authorities. Our non-GAAP tax rate in the third quarter of 2024 was mainly affected by the generation of profits in various jurisdictions with different tax rates, an adjustment to Teva’s corporate tax rate in Israel on losses related to non-qualified tax incentive activities in Israel, recording of valuation allowance with respect to certain carry over credits outside of Israel, as well as infrequent or non-recurring items.

We expect our annual non-GAAP tax rate for 2025 to be between 15%-18%, slightly higher than our non-GAAP tax rate for 2024, which was 15.3%, mainly due to a net tax benefit related to deferred tax assets resulting from intellectual property-related integration plans in 2024.

Net income attributable to Teva and diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2025 were $433 million and $0.37, respectively, compared to a net loss attributable to Teva and loss per share of $437 million and $0.39, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024. This change was mainly due to higher operating income in the third quarter of 2025, partially offset by higher income taxes, as discussed above. Non-GAAP net income attributable to Teva and non-GAAP diluted earnings per share in the third quarter of 2025 were $910 million and $0.78, respectively, compared to $798 million and $0.69, respectively, in the third quarter of 2024.

Adjusted EBITDA was $1,394 million in the third quarter of 2025, an increase of 5%, compared to $1,327 million in the third quarter of 2024.

As of September 30, 2025 and 2024, the fully diluted share count for purposes of calculating our market capitalization was approximately 1,184 million shares and 1,167 million shares, respectively.

Non-GAAP information: non-GAAP adjustments for non-GAAP net income attributable to Teva and non-GAAP diluted EPS in the third quarter of 2025 were $478 million and consisted of the following adjustments:

Amortization of purchased intangible assets of $144 million, of which $134 million is included in cost of sales and the remaining $10 million in S&M expenses;

Impairment of long-lived assets of $79 million;

Legal settlements and loss contingencies of $60 million;

Contingent consideration expenses of $16 million;

Equity compensation expenses of $34 million;

Restructuring expenses of $29 million;

Financial expenses of $7 million;

Other non-GAAP items of $51 million; and

Corresponding tax effects and unusual tax items of $58 million.

We believe that excluding such items facilitates investors’ understanding of our business including underlying trends, thereby improving the comparability of our business performance results between reporting periods.

For a reconciliation of the U.S. GAAP results to the adjusted non-GAAP figures and for additional information, see the tables below and the information included under “Non-GAAP Financial Measures.” Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacement for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Cash flow generated from operating activities during the third quarter of 2025 was $369 million, compared to $693 million in the third quarter of 2024. The lower cash flow generated from operating activities in the third quarter of 2025 was mainly due to timing of sales and collections, as well as higher legal settlement payments, partially offset by lower tax payments and higher profit.

During the third quarter of 2025, we generated free cash flow of $515 million, which we define as comprising $369 million in cash flow generated from operating activities, $274 million in beneficial interest collected in exchange for securitized accounts receivables (under our EU securitization program) and $8 million of proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets, partially offset by $136 million in cash used for capital investment. During the third quarter of 2024, we generated free cash flow of $922 million, which we define as comprising $693 million in cash flow generated from operating activities, $339 million in beneficial interest collected in exchange for securitized accounts receivables (under our EU securitization program) and $38 million in divestitures of businesses and other assets, partially offset by $148 million in cash used for capital investment. The decrease in the third quarter of 2025 mainly resulted from lower cash flow generated from operating activities, as well as a decrease in proceeds from divestitures of businesses and other assets.

As of September 30, 2025, our debt was $16,790 million, compared to $17,783 million as of December 31, 2024. This decrease was mainly due to repayment at maturity of $1,812 million of our senior notes, partially offset by an increase of $791 million due to exchange rate fluctuations. Additionally, during the second quarter of 2025, we repurchased $2,290 million aggregate principal amount of notes upon consummation of a cash tender offer, and issued $2,298 million of senior notes, net of discount and issuance costs. The portion of total debt classified as short-term as of September 30, 2025 was negligible compared to 10% as of December 31, 2024. Our average debt maturity was approximately 5.85 years as of September 30, 2025, compared to 5.5 years as of December 31, 2024.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

This press release contains certain financial information that differs from what is reported under accounting principles generally accepted in the United States (""GAAP""). These non-GAAP financial measures, including, but not limited to, non-GAAP operating income, non-GAAP operating margin, non-GAAP gross profit, non-GAAP gross profit margin, Adjusted EBITDA, free cash flow, non-GAAP tax rate, non-GAAP net income (loss) attributable to Teva and non-GAAP diluted EPS, are presented in order to facilitate investors' understanding of our business. We utilize certain non-GAAP financial measures to evaluate performance, in conjunction with other performance metrics. The following are examples of how we utilize the non-GAAP measures: our management and board of directors use the non-GAAP measures to evaluate our operational performance and, to compare our results against work plans and budgets, and ultimately to evaluate the performance of management; our annual budgets are prepared on a non-GAAP basis; and senior management’s annual compensation is derived, in part, using these non-GAAP measures. See the attached tables for a reconciliation of the GAAP results to the adjusted non-GAAP measures. Investors should consider non-GAAP financial measures in addition to, and not as replacements for, or superior to, measures of financial performance prepared in accordance with GAAP. We are not providing forward looking guidance for GAAP reported financial measures or a quantitative reconciliation of forward-looking non-GAAP financial measures to the most directly comparable GAAP measure because we are unable to predict with reasonable certainty the ultimate outcome of certain significant items including, but not limited to, the amortization of purchased intangible assets, legal settlements and loss contingencies, impairment of long-lived assets and goodwill impairment, without unreasonable effort. These items are uncertain, depend on various factors, and could be material to our results computed in accordance with GAAP.

Cautionary Note Regarding Forward-Looking Statements

This press release contains forward-looking statements within the meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995, which are based on management’s current beliefs and expectations and are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties, both known and unknown, that could cause our future results, performance or achievements to differ significantly from that expressed or implied by such forward-looking statements. You can identify these forward-looking statements by the use of words such as “should,” “expect,” “anticipate,” “estimate,” “target,” “may,” “project,” “guidance,” “intend,” “plan,” “believe,” ""outlook"" and other words and terms of similar meaning and expression in connection with any discussion of future operating or financial performance. Important factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include risks relating to:

our ability to successfully compete in the marketplace, including: that we are substantially dependent on our generic products; concentration of our customer base and commercial alliances among our customers; competition faced by our generic medicines from other pharmaceutical companies and changes in regulatory policy that may result in additional costs and delays; delays in launches of new generic products; our ability to develop and commercialize additional pharmaceutical products; competition for our innovative medicines; our ability to achieve expected results from investments in our product pipeline; our ability to successfully execute our Pivot to Growth strategy, including to expand our innovative and biosimilar medicines pipeline and profitably commercialize the innovative medicines and biosimilar portfolio, whether organically or through business development, and to sustain and focus our portfolio of generics medicines, and to execute on our organizational transformation and to achieve expected cost savings; and the effectiveness of our patents and other measures to protect our intellectual property rights, including any potential challenges to our Orange Book patent listings in the U.S.;

our significant indebtedness, which may limit our ability to incur additional indebtedness, engage in additional transactions or make new investments; and our potential need to raise additional funds in the future, which may not be available on acceptable terms or at all;

our business and operations in general, including: the impact of global economic conditions and other macroeconomic developments and the governmental and societal responses thereto; the widespread outbreak of an illness or any other communicable disease, or any other public health crisis; effectiveness of our optimization efforts; significant disruptions of information technology systems, including cybersecurity attacks and breaches of our data security; interruptions in our supply chain or problems with internal or third party manufacturing; any impact of a prolonged government shutdown; challenges associated with conducting business globally, including political or economic instability, major hostilities or terrorism, such as the ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine and in the Middle East; our ability to attract, hire, integrate and retain highly skilled personnel; our ability to successfully bid for suitable acquisition targets or licensing opportunities, or to consummate and integrate acquisitions; and our prospects and opportunities for growth if we sell assets or business units and close or divest plants and facilities, as well as our ability to successfully and cost-effectively consummate such sales and divestitures, including our planned divestiture of our API business;

compliance, regulatory and litigation matters, including: failure to comply with complex legal and regulatory requirements and changes; the effects of governmental and civil proceedings and litigation which we are, or in the future become, party to; the effects of reforms in healthcare regulation and reductions in pharmaceutical pricing, reimbursement and coverage, including as a result of the One Big Beautiful Bill signed into law in the U.S. in July 2025 (“OBBBA”), which is expected to result in stricter Medicaid eligibility requirements and work requirements, which may result in reduced Medicaid enrollment and a resulting decline in coverage for purchases of our medicines, and U.S. Executive Orders issued in April and May 2025 intended to reduce the prices paid by Americans for prescription medicines, including most-favored-nation pricing; increased legal and regulatory action in connection with public concern over the abuse of opioid medications; our ability to timely make payments required under our nationwide opioids settlement agreement and provide our generic version of Narcan® (naloxone hydrochloride nasal spray) in the amounts and at the times required under the terms of such agreement; scrutiny from competition and pricing authorities around the world, including our ability to comply with and operate under our deferred prosecution agreement (“DPA”) with the U.S. Department of Justice (“DOJ”); potential liability for intellectual property right infringement; product liability claims; failure to comply with complex Medicare, Medicaid and other governmental programs reporting and payment obligations; compliance with sanctions and trade control laws; environmental risks; and the impact of sustainability issues;

other financial and economic risks, including: our exposure to currency fluctuations and restrictions as well as credit risks; potential impairments of our long-lived assets; the impact of geopolitical conflicts including in the Middle East and in Russia and Ukraine; potential significant increases in tax liabilities; the effect on our overall effective tax rate of the termination or expiration of governmental programs or tax benefits, or of a change in our business; our exposure to changes in international trade policies, including the imposition of tariffs in the jurisdictions in which we operate, and the effects of such developments on sales of our products and the pricing and availability of our raw materials; and the impact of any future failure to establish and maintain effective internal control over our financial reporting;

and other factors discussed in this press release, in our Quarterly Report on Form 10-Q for the third quarter of 2025 and in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended December 31, 2024, including in the sections captioned ""Risk Factors” and “Forward Looking Statements.” Forward-looking statements speak only as of the date on which they are made, and we assume no obligation to update or revise any forward-looking statements or other information contained herein, whether as a result of new information, future events or otherwise. You are cautioned not to put undue reliance on these forward-looking statements.

Power decision not to build $1B gas plant at industrial park,"Erica Butler, CBC News",,,,,https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/conservationists-nbpower-power-plant-rural-industrial-9.6966570,"The rationale behind N.B.
In December 2024, N.B.
It's much better in an area where there's already industrial development.” The decision to build in Centre Village didn’t become public until N.B.
Scoudouc, Centre Village topped list of choices In its “location analysis” report, N.B.
Power report.","The rationale behind N.B. Power’s controversial decision to build a gas-fired power plant on a 550-acre woodlot is outlined in a recent report from the utility, but critics aren’t buying it.

In December 2024, N.B. Power told reporters the major new gas plant would likely be built in the Scoudouc Industrial Park, about 22 kilometres northeast of Moncton.

But according to the two-page report, the utility decided just two months later that it would instead go with property near Centre Village in rural Tantramar.

N.B. Power and ProEnergy, the U.S. company hired to build and operate the plant, are now building a 1.5-kilometre road to get to the chosen site.

But local conservation groups say a gas plant makes much more sense in an industrial park than in the middle of the Chignecto Isthmus.

“I think that we have to, as New Brunswickers, raise our standards a little bit about where we put these kinds of projects,” said Melanie Jellett, conservation manager with the New Brunswick chapter of the Canadian Parks and Wilderness Society.

“A project of this size should not be built in an ecologically sensitive area like this. It's much better in an area where there's already industrial development.”

The decision to build in Centre Village didn’t become public until N.B. Power formally announced its plans in July 2025, inspiring an outcry from local residents and conservation groups.

Scoudouc, Centre Village topped list of choices

In its “location analysis” report, N.B. Power listed 10 sites that it considered, including Coleson Cove, Lepreau, Millbank, Belledune and Dalhousie. The utility quickly narrowed the field to five worthy of “detailed review.”

Eel River, Bayside, and Memramcook were ruled out because of “transmission constraints” and lack of “proximity to natural gas pipelines.”

That left Scoudouc and Centre Village offering “the greatest value and most suitable conditions.""

Both properties are crossed by N.B. Power transmission lines and the Maritimes and Northeast natural gas pipeline.

Both could also “support the 500-megawatt capacity with minimal transmission investment,” and both are in the southeast, where they could address growing energy demand and “support eastward transfers (to Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island),” according to the N.B. Power report.

N.B. Power says it studied the ""regulatory context” for both sites in the summer of 2024, something that would be a key factor in the utility’s decision to go with Centre Village.

The report concluded the Scoudouc site has more wetland than Centre Village, which could require Fisheries Act authorization, resulting in a delay of up to 18 months.

It also notes the “discovery of evidence of pileated woodpecker nests” on the Scoudouc site. That would mean a 36-month waiting period under Canada’s Migratory Bird Convention Act.

N.B. Power said the potential delays at the Scoudouc site were major considerations, and “critical to ensuring project completion by 2028,” when the utility is projecting energy shortfalls in the province.

Speed as a deciding factor questioned

“The biggest thing that's pushing them is this timeline,” said Barry Rothfuss, director of the Atlantic Wildlife Institute, which lies about four kilometres away as the crow flies.

“Everything that they're talking about … has to do with them being able to build an infrastructure project in an expedited manner,” he said.

The Scoudouc and Centre Village sites are “not even comparable” from a biodiversity perspective, said Rothfuss.

“This is a far more ecologically sensitive habitat.”

And the Centre Village site likely contains habitat for important species such as the pileated woodpecker, Rothfuss said.

“We've had photographic evidence and also GPS co-ordinates sent identifying that there is pileated woodpecker activity on this site,” he said.

Centre Village is also a central location on the Chignecto Isthmus, which Jellett said has been identified as an “important area for ecological connectivity” because of wildlife such as moose, bear and lynx that migrate across the land bridge between Nova Scotia and New Brunswick.

Jellett also questioned the report’s conclusions about wetlands, noting that the access road under construction at Centre Village cuts across Harper’s Brook.

A provincial environmental impact assessment is underway for the project, and a technical review committee has issued 97 comments and questions, some still to be answered by ProEnergy.

Even so, Environment Minister Gilles LePage has already ruled out a possible “comprehensive” assessment process.

Rothfuss agreed that “there's no need for a long, extensive EIA process.”

“They've already started a process that should be ended,” Rothfuss said. “This EIA process is tainted for a variety of different reasons, everything from false information about Indigenous activities to the fact that we're finding out that the sensitivities that they're identifying here aren't really accurate.”

Jellett wants more scrutiny of the project, which is expected to cost well over $1 billion.

“I would like to know that it's not based on poor information, and that we're looking at it from all angles.""","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/812b755e-938b-4254-8715-d2b208ecfd0b,1762287948496/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C0%2C2048%2C1152%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-05 13:08:08.309824

""We're going to raise the fuel tax, but we're going to lower the sales tax.

The legislation, which takes effect in January, aims to address road infrastructure issues without raising new money at the pump, according to Republican lawmaker Tom Kunse. ""We are not trying to raise new money at the pump. So we just want to take all the money, pay it at the pump and put it on the roads,"" Kunse said.

Kunse believes the shift will be revenue neutral, as the sales tax is reduced to zero. ""We're going to raise the fuel tax, but we're going to lower the sales tax. We took the sales tax to zero. So our goal was to make this revenue neutral,"" he explained.

Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, noted that the change might not be immediately noticeable to drivers due to the cyclical nature of Michigan's gas prices. ""The way Michigan's gas prices work is they cycle every week and a half to two weeks. They make a big jump up just like they did earlier this week when prices jumped up to $3.29. So you probably won't notice on January 1st, a big jump,"" De Haan said.

According to De Haan, if prices at the pump remain what they are today, people will pay an additional seven cents per gallon.

De Haan also pointed out that the state will not benefit from higher gas prices as it did with the percentage-based sales tax. ""The state will not benefit when gas prices reach $4 or $5. Typically, with that percentage-based sales tax, the state would come out way better when gas prices were much higher,"" he said.

In addition to the fuel tax changes, a fixed rate for hybrid and electric vehicles will be implemented when they register.

Most states do not have a double tax like Michigan's current system, making this overhaul a notable shift in the state's approach to fuel taxation.",https://midmichigannow.com/resources/media/aa3b98e8-c25f-46a1-ba88-285fbe3022e3-GasPrices2.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 17:00:52.146000

The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) today announced over $7 million has been awarded to projects that co-locate solar and agricultural operations in New York State. Through NYSERDA’s Environmental Research Program, over $2 million was awarded to four projects to demonstrate the potential impacts and benefits of using the same land for renewable energy generation from solar panels and active farming, also known as agrivoltaics. Additionally, a $5 million grant was awarded to Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences to construct agrivoltaics projects at its agricultural experiment stations. Together, the demonstration of and research findings gained from these projects will support a broader understanding of the costs, benefits, and market potential for agrivoltaics as part of New York State’s clean energy transition and economic growth.

NYSERDA President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “We are proud to partner with farmers, developers, and research partners to advance projects that support solar as a resource to produce energy in New York State while sustaining agriculture operations for economic growth. By examining different means of integrating agriculture operations and clean energy siting, we will build our understanding of the costs, benefits and market potential of locating two essential industries in the same space.”

Agriculture is a critically important sector of New York's economy, with over 33,000 farms across approximately 20 percent of the state's land area, or close to 7 million acres. Farmers, many who are struggling, have expressed interest in the potential for solar energy to provide an additional revenue stream to help stabilize farm income and sustain farm operations. The New York State Farmland Protection Working Group , overseen by New York State Department of Agriculture and Markets (AGM), recommended that the State study co-utilizing land for renewable energy generation and agricultural production with the potential to play an important role in meeting New York State’s future energy and agricultural development needs. These awards demonstrate NYSERDA’s commitment to developing information and tools that support decision-making in communities and engaging property owners who are considering co-utilization opportunities for agriculture and renewable energy generation to help them keep their land and stay in business.

Agrivoltaics Demonstration Awards

The awards support integrating both new or retrofitted solar and farm operations such as those with grazing, forage or specialty crop production. Researchers, solar developers, farmers, non-profit organizations and local governments were eligible to submit proposals that include a solar site design, marketable agricultural commodity, estimates of expected agricultural production and solar generation.

The awarded projects include:

Capital Region

New York Power Authority was awarded $750,000 to develop a 1,200-1,500-kilowatt solar array that can power approximately 230 New York homes per year on close to 14 acres of State University of New York College of Agriculture and Technology at Cobleskill campus in Schoharie County, using elevated panels for cattle grazing in rotation with growing corn, spaced to accommodate traditional harvesting equipment.

Finger Lakes

K&MH Martens Farms was awarded $185,000 to incorporate agrivoltaics into the development of a 300-kilowatt solar array for a microgrid to support an on-site grain processing operation. The project also seeks to use the solar array to maximize shade benefits for grazing dairy cattle, enhance productivity of the soil and extend the growing season for cool-season grasses while using construction processes that protect soil and farmland pasture in Yates County.

Hudson Valley

Lightstar Renewables was awarded over $515,000 for a 3,200-kilowatt solar array to produce electricity to be provided to the grid, which is equivalent to that used by approximately 725 New York homes per year. The construction features wider spacing of solar panels to enable the continuation of hay production and harvest on one to two acres of new vegetable operations in Orange County.

Southern Tier and Western New York

United Agrivoltaics was awarded $750,000 to demonstrate adding pigs, poultry, and specialty crops at existing solar sites in Cortland, Schuyler, Tompkins, and Niagara counties that already produce 15,850 kilowatts of community solar and cover a total of more than 100 acres.

These projects enable NYSERDA and researchers to understand the costs, benefits, and lessons learned related to agrivoltaics and share data that can be used to develop best practices. NYSERDA convenes the New York State Agricultural Technical Working Group (A-TWG), an independent advisory body comprised of farmers and farming stakeholders, solar developers, state agencies and non-governmental organizations, to advise and steer efforts in advancing solar energy development in a responsible way that supports New York State's agricultural operations, lands, farmers and communities. The A-TWG commissioned the report Growing Agrivoltaics in New York State published in 2023 that identified opportunities and constraints associated with the increasing uptake of agrivoltaics projects in New York State. The A-TWG also provides input on the Smart Solar Siting Scorecard which is used to evaluate applications for utility scale solar projects for their avoidance and mitigation of agricultural and forest lands. NYSERDA in ongoing consultation with the AGM and the A-TWG will study the results of the awarded agrivoltaic projects to understand the opportunities and market potential for agrivoltaics in New York State.

$5 Million Agrivoltaics Construction Projects

NYSERDA also announced that it has awarded a $5 million grant to Cornell University's College of Agriculture and Life Sciences (CALS) to construct agrivoltaic projects at its Agricultural Experiment Station sites in the Hudson Valley and Finger Lakes. These sites will conduct long term research on the dual-use of solar operations and agriculture practices across a range of growing conditions and crops relevant to state agricultural producers.

CALS Hudson Valley Research Lab, in the hamlet of Highland, will construct an approximately 300-kilowatt solar array on about two acres, above high-density apple orchards. Specialized sensors and controls will enable solar panel manipulation for sun and shading preferences and for crop protection from frost and hail weather events. Electricity produced will be used to power research lab operations and surplus power will be supplied to the local electric grid.

Additionally, CALS will construct an approximately 900-kilowatt solar array on the Cornell University campus in the town of Ithaca, and will utilize a tracking system, on about seven acres. Plantings within the solar array will include traditional annual vegetable, field and perennial forage crops. Designed to mimic conditions in a variety of solar array configurations, the system will enable research across a range of disciplines including plant genetics, soil health, and water management strategies associated with agrivoltaics. Electricity produced from the solar array will provide power to Cornell’s campus electric grid. CALS will also evaluate constructing agrivoltaics at its Cornell Agri-Tech research farm in the city of Geneva.

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “Agrivoltaics projects balance the need for additional renewable energy capacity and the preservation of arable farmland. Farmers are the backbone of New York’s rural communities, and funding support for projects like these is important as we aim to strengthen our understanding of this innovative technology that can enhance agricultural productivity while contributing to the energy diversity of our state’s grid.”

State Agriculture Commissioner Richard A. Ball said, “There is a real opportunity here before us as we work to support our farmers while furthering our State’s clean, renewable energy agenda. These projects will help us gain a better understanding of how a farm business and solar can co-locate and allow us to learn best practices along the way to ensure agrivoltaics are a beneficial option for our farmers moving into the future. We look forward to seeing these innovative projects and accompanying research across the State take shape.”

SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. said, “SUNY applauds this investment by Governor Hochul and NYSERDA to move forward on our state’s ambitious clean energy and sustainability goals, and to open up additional sources of income for farmers by incorporating technology into agricultural operations. We are especially pleased that SUNY’s Cornell College of Agriculture and Lifestyle Sciences will play a key role in this initiative, with the generous support of $5 million funding, as well as SUNY Cobleskill’s partnership with NYPA to help support the power needs from solar arrays on the campus’ property.”

Senator Kevin Parker, Chair of the Senate Committee on Energy and Telecommunications, said, ""In the face of gridlock and dysfunction in Washington, I am proud that New York continues to lead by example when it comes to building a sustainable and equitable clean energy future. While others debate, we deliver. I commend NYSERDA for their steadfast commitment to innovation and their ability to keep moving this state forward investing in our farmers, our environment, and our economy. These projects prove that even in challenging times, New Yorkers rise to the occasion, working together to turn bold ideas into real progress. That’s what leadership looks like.""

Senator Michelle Hinchey, Chair of the Senate Committee on Agriculture, said, “Agrivoltaics gives us hope as we confront growing challenges to our food supply and energy future, and we’re thrilled that the Hudson Valley—one of our country’s most important agricultural regions—is leading the way on this innovative solution. This major investment in the Hudson Valley Research Laboratory, and other projects across New York, will pioneer the research and science-backed guidance we’ve been advocating for to co-produce food and clean energy on the same land. Congratulations to all awardees, and thank you for keeping New York at the forefront of sustainable innovation.”

Senator Peter Harckham, Chair of the Senate Committee on Environmental Conservation, said, “The use of agricultural land for solar energy projects is not a false choice, as their co-use now helps keep many family farms in operation statewide and also lowers electricity costs for ratepayers. NYSERDA’s newly announced investments in agrivoltaics demonstration projects around New York stand as forward-thinking efforts toward a shared sustainable future.”

Assemblymember Didi Barrett, Chair of the Assembly Energy Committee, said, “As Chair of the Assembly’s Energy Committee, and a member of the Agriculture Committee, I have been a longtime advocate for agrivoltaics. Our state has world class soils which have fed New York families for generations and agrivoltaics enables farms to keep growing food while concurrently increasing our renewable energy production. These newly funded demonstration projects push the envelope to expand our understanding of what agrivoltaics can do, and I thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for their support of these initiatives.”

Assemblymember Donna Lupardo, Chair of the Assembly Agriculture Committee, said, “NYSERDA’s investment in agrivoltaics will dramatically improve our understanding of the potential for dual-use solar on NY farmland. As Chair of the Committee on Agriculture, keeping farmland in production is a top priority, including the co-location of solar arrays with long-established farming commodities. Today’s announcement complements the work we have supported through the Ag & Market budget at Cornell University and will allow other projects to proceed as well. As we navigate NY’s clean energy transition, agrivoltaics could prove to be a viable option for farmers to consider.”

Assemblymember Deborah Glick, Chair of the Assembly Environmental Conservation Committee, said, “Agrivoltaics recognizes the importance of both renewable energy and the critical role of our farmers and farmland. This significant environmental and farm investment will promote sustainability, increased land efficiency, and enable much needed diversified revenue sources for New York farmers. I'm equally pleased that the vital work done by institutions of higher education, like Cornell University, is being recognized and supported at a time when the federal government has withdrawn support and denigrated the essential research partnership universities provide.”

Alliance for Clean Energy New York Executive Director Marguerite Wells said, “Agrivoltaics will play an important role in New York's agricultural future. Agriculture and solar do not need to compete for land; we can produce a range of crops alongside solar panels, adding more value for farmers. These projects demonstrate the cutting edge of this field and will spur further innovations. We thank Governor Hochul and NYSERDA for recognizing and encouraging this opportunity as we continue our energy transition.""

American Farmland Trust New York and New Jersey Regional Director Linda Garrett and National Smart Solar Director Ethan Winter said, “American Farmland Trust commends NYSERDA for their substantial investment in agrivoltaics research and demonstration. This funding will advance our understanding of potential for integration of solar energy with agriculture, informing policy makers and communities on beneficial pathways for meeting New York’s ambitious clean energy and regional economic development goals. AFT is a long-time collaborator with New York State and we look forward to engaging the innovators selected for this investment in agrivoltaics.”

Lightstar Chief Strategy Officer Lucy Bullock-Sieger said, “These Lightstar projects represent a shift in what is possible for solar and farmers in New York. This is a new choice that doesn't have to be overly complicated. Let farmers farm and we will start to see how agriculture and solar can work together in concert.""

United Agrivoltaics Owner Caleb Scott said, “At United Agrivoltaics, we see every solar project as more than just clean energy—it’s an opportunity to grow food, strengthen farms, and bring new life to the land. With this support from NYSERDA, we will showcase how farmers and developers can work together to maximize a site’s potential, producing renewable power alongside wholesome local food. Our goal is to share with the world a model that proves solar can serve both our communities and our agricultural future.”

K&MH Farms Owner Klaas Martens said, “Farming is inherently the collection and conversion of sunlight into things that people need. We are excited to test a system that allows us to collect that sunlight both for the production of food and for the production of energy. No farmland is being taken out of production with this project.”

Cornell University’s College of Agriculture and Life Sciences Ronald P. Lynch Dean Benjamin Houlton said, “Cornell CALS is proud to partner with NYSERDA to pioneer agrivoltaic research across New York’s diverse agricultural landscapes, including the Hudson Valley and Finger Lakes. These projects reflect our mission to deliver purpose-driven science that explores new possibilities for food and energy production. By studying how solar arrays interact with crops and growing conditions, we will pioneer new tools and technologies to inform optimal siting practices, protect prime farmland, and support dual-use food and energy solutions. It’s a powerful step forward in service of our Land-Grant mission—advancing innovation through collaboration and research, serving the needs of New York’s communities.”

For more than fifty years, NYSERDA has been a trusted and objective resource for New Yorkers, taking on the critical role of energy planning and policy analysis, along with making investments that drive New York toward a more sustainable future. NYSERDA conducts policy and analysis-oriented environmental research to provide pertinent information on the impacts and opportunities of clean energy choices and arising energy options. NYSERDA also supports New York State’s farmers in managing their energy use through no-cost technical assistance through the Agriculture Energy Audit Program.

Funding for this initiative is provided through the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative.

New York State's Climate Agenda

New York State's climate agenda calls for an affordable and just transition to a clean energy economy that creates family-sustaining jobs, promotes economic growth through green investments, and directs a minimum of 35 percent of the benefits to disadvantaged communities. New York is advancing a suite of efforts to achieve an emissions-free economy by 2050, including in the energy, buildings, transportation, and waste sectors.

The problem with the narrow geographic scope of data center locations is that it reinforces existing inequities and accelerates the gap between digital “haves” and “have-nots.” Data centers are crucial for future economic development.","Artificial intelligence is the transformative technology of our time. As argued in the Brookings Press book, “Turning Point: Policymaking in the Era of Artificial Intelligence,” it is powering applications in finance, health care, education, transportation, defense, and e-commerce, among other sectors. AI’s ability to process large amounts of information and act independently on that basis is altering communications, service delivery, financial transactions, administrative processing, and a host of other areas.

Undergirding this growing use of AI is the need for state-of-the-art data centers. This paper examines the future of these entities. It examines what they are, their numbers and distribution, the different types of centers, financial investments, barriers to development, workforce impacts, economic implications, and considerations for guiding their future growth. Briefly, we argue for a framework for data centers that addresses challenges such as access to critical minerals, workforce shortages, community benefits, permitting reforms, energy and water needs, electric grid investment, national security considerations, and geographical placement. Improvements in these areas will be crucial to ensuring a smooth transition to a digital economy.

What are data centers?

Data centers host a large number of file servers and networking equipment that can store, process, and analyze text, images, code, and other information sources. Guided by large language models (LLMs) and machine learning, data centers can parse through these materials and act autonomously upon the derived insights. The applications that are hosted at these facilities can summarize text, edit photos or videos, examine data, code software, and perform many administrative and financial tasks in real time. These applications offer tremendous convenience, efficiency, and effectiveness to consumers, businesses, and governments.

“Hyperscale” data centers typically have more than 5,000 file servers within their facilities and can house equipment utilized by many different organizations. With the large-scale growth of generative AI, there is tremendous reliance on data centers that process information quickly and with low latency to enable the use of a wide range of AI services and agents. It is estimated that the generative AI market is accelerating around 40% a year and is projected to increase from $43.9 billion in 2023 to nearly $1 trillion in 2032. This high AI growth rate, generated by skyrocketing digital demand, makes it imperative to expand data centers.

Types of data centers

There are different kinds of data centers. One type is data centers for generative AI, which are based on graphics processing units (GPUs) that can deal with vast amounts of information. These facilities process extraordinary amounts of data in text, numeric, or graphic forms and power LLMs and machine learning. They scour the internet, find logical patterns, summarize information, and act on these insights in real time. AI-directed data centers require high computing power and are energy-intensive. As interest in generative and agentic AI has skyrocketed and major tech companies roll out new AI products, there has been a substantial growth in these types of operations. Data center facilities can be enterprise systems operated on behalf of a specific organization or co-location centers that host the platforms of multiple organizations.

One of the most sensitive developments has been high-security centers for military and intelligence gathering. Governments have substantial security needs and require online platforms that house their most confidential secrets, including information on defense applications, battlefield logistics, foreign adversaries, or domestic terrorists, as well as proprietary systems provided by private firms. Processors need to be super-fast to analyze incoming material and super-secure from hackers, malcontents, and enemies. President Trump’s recently launched AI Action Plan directs the Department of Defense and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) to develop new technical standards for government entities.

“Edge centers” are situated close to particular activities they support, in order to reduce the latency of computation and networking. Applications such as autonomous vehicles, stock trading, or manufacturing facilities with widespread use of robots need fast communications. These systems don’t want too much of a lag between a query and its implementation. Human lives may also depend on speed in analyzing certain risks, so these kinds of centers need to be very close to where people are utilizing their services.

Energy and water requirements for data centers powering AI

Data centers supporting AI applications require a considerable amount of electrical power and water for their computer storage and processing. In particular, LLMs and other forms of generative AI need a tremendous amount of power. In 2023, data centers consumed around 4.4% of America’s electrical power, and that percentage is expected to rise substantially in the next years. According to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, energy growth is likely to increase between 6.7-12% by 2028. Around the world, it is projected that AI’s energy needs could account for as much as 21% of all electricity usage by 2030. According to McKinsey, American data centers will utilize 35 gigawatts of electricity by the end of this decade.

Water is a problem as well. Some data centers consume as much as 500,000 gallons per day, making them a substantial draw on what is a limited resource in many communities. Data centers require a lot of water to cool the buildings and the computers inside. Electronic devices heat up during processing, and when thousands of file servers are grouped in a small area, the cooling needs increase dramatically.

Clean water is in short supply in a number of places. This is especially a challenge in the Rocky Mountain states and on the West Coast. In numerous cities and communities, water rates are rising substantially to deal with short supply and increasing demand. One county in Georgia is raising its rates by 33%, far higher than the usual low single-digit increase, which critics attribute to data center needs. New advances in microfluidics, where coolants are applied directly to chips, may improve our ability to cool semiconductors and make data centers more sustainable and less energy-reliant, but much is still unknown about the efficiency of such advances.

As data centers expand, the question is how to generate the energy and water they need. The bulk of American electricity currently comes from fossil fuels such as natural gas (43%) and coal (16%), followed by wind, solar, and thermal (21% together), and nuclear energy (18%). Diversifying energy sources will be essential to meeting the growing demands of data centers, which cannot operate reliably without significant improvements in U.S. energy production.

Nuclear power appears to be rising as a possible energy source, with AI companies planning to open or reopen new plants in the United States. It offers the advantage of not generating the byproducts of fossil fuel consumption while being available all the time once facilities go online. The Three Mile Island plant suffered a partial meltdown in 1979, but it is planned to reopen in 2028 to power Microsoft’s data centers, provide 3,400 jobs, and generate billions in new tax revenue.

This increase in energy needs is occurring against the backdrop of rollbacks on clean energy sources. One organization estimates there will be 344 gigawatts of lost generating power over the next decade linked to the 2025 federal budget bill. Provisions in the bill, particularly changes to tax credits, undermine the financial viability of solar and wind generators and make it harder for consumers to afford the electricity they generate. At a time of dramatically rising energy needs, it is short-sighted for the Trump administration to cut back on renewable energy sources, especially those that will be needed to operate data centers.

Overall, it is clear that the United States will need a substantial boost to electrical production to meet the increased demand of AI and data centers. Companies may mitigate these needs by developing more efficient cooling, lighting, and semiconductor processors. Greater transparency about their energy and water use would also enable policymakers and researchers to better understand the scope of the challenge and plan for sustainable growth.

Number and distribution of data centers

It is hard to get complete information on the number of data centers because of the ambiguities in how they are both defined and perceived by the market. Since there is no central clearing house regarding the numbers in operation, under construction, or in the planning stage, it is imperative that some type of future dashboard be developed. But according to the available data shown below, therearenow an estimated11,800 data centers around the world, powering AI and the digital economy. The United States leads the world in the number of centers as of June 2025, followed by Germany, the United Kingdom, China, and France.Around two-thirds of existing data centersare located in the United States, China, or Europe, and only a small number are foundin Africa, Latin America, India, or other regions in the Global South.As is outlined later in the paper, geographic inequities will be crucial in assessing the global impact of data centers.

Table 2 breaks down data center numbers by U.S. state, based on two different sources: DataCenterMap.com and Aterio. As with the global estimates, the overall numbers vary considerably depending on how data centers are defined, the stage of construction and operations, and the time period being covered. Some inventories appear to include small-scale centers, while others stick to larger facilities.

The state of Virginia has the largest number of data centers, followed by Texas and California. Northern Virginia has emerged as the “Silicon Valley” of data centers because of its proximity to federal government agencies, which make extensive use of data storage and processing, in addition to the availability of land, energy, and water sources that support data center operations.

Table 2 also makes clear that the number of newly announced data centers continues to grow. States and localities are actively competing to attract these facilities in pursuit of economic growth.Several states view data centers as essential to establishing themselves as digital hubs for AI and other emerging technologies.

Copper, steel, and aluminum requirements

Some of the most important barriers to data center expansion involve the critical components used for their construction and deployment. These facilities need a considerable amount of copper, steel, and aluminum for the building and equipment, as well as semiconductors, electronics, fiberoptics, and wiring for file servers, storage devices, and networking equipment.

President Trump’s decision to impose tariffs on many commodities has dramatically raised the price tag of data centers. This year, the administration imposed tariffs of 50% on copper and raised rates from 25 to 50% on steel and aluminum. These measures dramatically increase the construction and operating costs for data centers.

The costs of semiconductors and electronic equipment imported into the U.S. have also increased by 25%. These increases are meant to boost domestic production and reduce trade deficits with major trading partners. This could eventually happen, but it is hard to construct new facilities and redirect supply chains in a short period of time, especially simultaneously with the expansion of data centers. While tariff negotiations with individual countries continue, the uncertainties associated with this policy remain a drag on data center construction in the United States.

One worrisome policy concern is that while President Trump’s AI Action Plan prioritizes data center construction, his approach to tariffs makes this effort far more expensive. Alternative U.S. suppliers that could reduce costs are also limited, highlighting the inconsistencies between AI national goals and policy implementation. If the United States is to sustain its global leadership in AI, any barriers to data center development (whether stemming from trade policy or supply chain) will impact the timing and sustainability of construction. Despite billions in investments, logistical and permitting obstacles continue to delay data center buildout and operations, as discussed later in this paper.

The need for critical minerals

A major limiting factor in semiconductor manufacturing is China’s control over critical minerals needed for their production. Materials such as gallium, germanium, antimony, tungsten, tellurium, bismuth, indium, and molybdenum are vital for many products and are not readily available from domestic sources.

Furthering the problem is that getting mining permits in the U.S. and Europe can take many years, while countries such as Canada, Australia, and China have far shorter timelines. The length of time required for U.S. and European mining permits limits domestic production of semiconductors and electronics and harms the ability to expand data centers. In the U.S., there is a growing urgency to expedite mining permits and justify the domestic expansion and construction of data centers. Without reliable access to prime materials, overbuilding is a possibility, and in the absence of long-term commitments from AI companies, vast amounts of land could become “data center deserts” if cheaper alternatives emerge elsewhere.

Workforce shortages

Data centers will spur labor demand, particularly in construction and engineering, where there might be a groundswell in job opportunities and subcontracts. However, the current workforce simply does not have the necessary supply of technical workers. The Trump administration’s current immigration and deportation policies compound this workforce problem, especially when it comes to the software engineers needed to power data centers. While the lack of homegrown talent could be resolved with workers from other countries, the current administration has moved in the opposite direction, deporting workers and slowing the supply of foreigners coming into the U.S.

There aren’t enough electricians in the U.S. to meet the demand for laying wires and construction workers to build data centers. There are also shortages of construction workers, which typically include a large number of immigrant workers. It has been estimated that roughly 30% of construction workers in the U.S. are immigrants, including some who are undocumented. However, mass deportations limit the growth of data centers by draining the supply of individuals needed to build and wire such facilities. In every sector involved in data center development, from tech to blue-collar and trade, the Trump administration’s immigration crackdown works against its stated goals of furthering American leadership in AI and expediting the construction of the data centers supporting it. This approach contradicts an early commitment made to the major AI companies, which expect reciprocity for their support of the broader Trump agenda.

To redress the labor shortages threatening data center expansion, the U.S. should expand its job training and vocational education programs. More flexible licensing of workers in the trades should be encouraged across states; for example, electrician certifications could be made easily transferable, allowing for more geographic mobility of workers with the necessary skills. The U.S. Department of Labor, in coordination with state workforce agencies, could support a temporary or flexible labor initiative tailored to large-scale data center construction. A stronger national commitment to the skilled trades overall would go far toward closing existing workforce gaps.

When workers can be found, housing problems are an additional concern. Housing costs have skyrocketed in many places, and trade workers will need affordable and reasonable accommodations, especially in expensive areas where data centers are concentrated, like Northern Virginia. Some firms already provide mobile homes as temporary housing for these individuals; based on the expeditious and lofty agenda to build data centers, this could be a viable option.

Finally, most states require inspectors in construction with the duty to keep workers safe. Many places don’t have enough inspectors, slowing down facility development. Even if completed, projects will be stalled until inspectors certify each facility. This is yet another sign that greater coordination between state and local agencies to address these worker shortages is necessary.

Permitting reforms

Obtaining state and local permitting for data centers can take a long time. There are mandated checks for the environment, worker safety, and community well-being. Companies need to get easements and right-of-way privileges to move forward. Some community groups have organized to stop construction. In Northern Virginia, for example, which is home to a sizeable percentage of the world’s data centers, neighbors of adjoining properties have complained in recent years about water shortages, light pollution, and air conditioning noise. Companies need to make sure their sites are safe and clean, and do not endanger community residents.

In its AI Action Plan, the Trump administration is pushing for expedited permitting. Republican lawmakers have repeatedly voiced that current processes are unnecessarily slow and more needs to be done to help companies that want to build technology facilities. The administration is likely to authorize building sites on federal lands under a fast-track system designed to reduce approval times, freeing up unused terrain for large-scale data centers and helping companies move more quickly from permitting to construction.

Another proposal is to exempt data center projects from certain review requirements dictated by the National Environmental Policy Act, the Clean Water Act, and the Clean Air Act. Another is to have national permits for data centers as opposed to locally required ones. While these measures might expedite construction, communities may still oppose the projects, especially if residents are not involved from the beginning.

Electric grid and transmission line investment

Among the most critical infrastructure priorities are modernizing transmission lines and ensuring that the electric grid can operate at the required scale, stability, and reliability. With the dramatic increase in electricity needed for data centers, upgrades to the grid will be necessary. It can sometimes take up to 10 years to build the transmission lines that move electricity from region to region. Such transmitters rely upon steel and aluminum, but researchers say materials such as carbon fiber would be lighter and could move larger amounts of electricity. The U.S. Department of Energy intends to upgrade 100,000 miles of new transmission lines this decade, though AI companies are seeking to build many of these data centers on a much shorter timeframe.

With the growth of AI and the design of new materials, there are new tools that will make transmission lines operate more efficiently. AI can improve operations and facilitate a more efficient and sustainable electrical system, preventing loss of power as electricity is moved geographically. In addition, data centers can use “closed cooling systems” that require less water and keep file servers at the temperatures needed for effective operation. These measures will reduce energy costs and keep water and energy demands down.

It is also possible that there will be improved efficiencies in other areas. The Chinese firm DeepSeek, for example, claims it can process tremendous amounts of information with reduced processing power, lower costs, and fewer electrical requirements. A recent peer-reviewed Nature article co-authored by a company leader said DeepSeek’s “reasoning-focused R1 model cost $294,000 to train and used 512 Nvidia H800 chips,” which is a fraction of what most Western models require to operate. While it is not clear how seriously to take such claims, digital technologies have a tradition of becoming more efficient over time; it is possible that design and processing improvements will increase financial and energy sustainability, thereby easing the current pressures facing data centers. AI companies will face many of the same regulatory and state-level hurdles that energy companies do, as was the case in the expansion of 5G technology, when colocation of radios and power generators became a concern. Securing access to modern and resilient power systems may prove one of the stickier points for AI companies.

Data center costs

Many factors go into the costs of data centers, including acquiring land, construction, equipment, labor, heating and cooling, security, power consumption, permitting, operations, and more. Jeff Howell of Encor Advisors has examined this issue in-depth and found that “construction costs for data centers are estimated to average at approximately $9.5 million per megawatt” in the U.S., and once facilities are built, annual operating expenses can range from $50,000 to $100,000 for a small center to $10 to $25 million for a larger facility.

Recent hyperscale data centers that feature thousands of servers were found to cost $1 billion or more to build. They can cover more than a million square feet of land and feature sophisticated computer processing power. In addition to being very expensive, such facilities have huge upfront costs. Many of these expenditures, such as land and construction labor, vary tremendously within the United States, and the same is true for different places around the world. How close installations are to supply chains affects overall costs, as do transportation, logistics, energy, and taxes.

Billions of dollars are currently being invested in AI, cloud computing, and the data centers that power digital applications. Money is flowing from the top tech firms, investment funds, sovereign wealth funds from other countries, financial institutions, industry partnerships, and more. As of 2024, the financial investment required for data centers reached hundreds of billions of dollars, and that number is expected to increase into the trillions by 2030.

Who pays?

Barring major advances in efficiency, the big question is who pays for the increased data center capacity. Right now, ratepayers shoulder some of these costs. Consumer bills have risen in a number of places, fostering resentment about the additional expenses. David Klaus and Mark MacCarthy have argued that since the major technology companies are building data centers and will benefit from their services, they should shoulder more of the costs. They note that the top AI firms have a market value “seven times that of the entire S&P 500 Utility Sector” and therefore have the financial means to pay for the increased electrical power. As an illustration of how this could work, the Public Utilities Commission of Ohio has proposed that firms operating data centers larger than 1 gigawatt should pay 85% of their electricity costs, up from the current 60%. This change would shift a greater share of financing to technology firms with the capacity to absorb it.

To guard against the consumer backlash over rising electrical bills, several companies are using bonds to finance their long-term investments. Meta, for example, has floated $26 billion in bonds to pay for its new data centers. That allows the company to gain access to capital upfront, with expected revenue gains from AI applications paying for the bonds overtime. That model puts the payment onus more on companies but also assumes the cash flow from new AI revenue will be sufficient to cover bond repayments. If AI accelerates as currently are projected, that should be a relatively safe bet.

Because of the high investment costs, many of the current hyperscale data centers are set up by the large technology firms themselves. According to the scholars at Vanderbilt University, platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud Platform own around two-thirds of the cloud computing market, which serves as the digital infrastructure for the data center sector. Data centers rely upon cloud storage and processing facilities to power AI and other emerging applications, making it essentialy to ensure these markets function efficiently and effectively.

Who benefits?

Consumers, businesses, and government actors will likely benefit if the development of large-scale data centers spurs advancements in AI applications, machine learning, data analytics, and robotics, which in turn could lead to more efficient manufacturing, autonomous transportation systems, the development of new drugs, personalized learning, and much more. There will be faster broadband for ordinary consumers and greater processing power for businesses, governments, and health and educational institutions, especially if the assets of telecommunications companies are effectively leveraged.

Our goal should be to extend the benefits of the digital revolution to everyone, allowing people to share in technological innovation without facing exclusion or harm.

This is where the question of community benefits for residents living near data centers must be made clearer. For example, can local electrical grids be upgraded as part of the broader infrastructure improvements needed to power these facilities? Could irrigation systems be modernized in areas slated for data center construction? Who decides what community investments are made, and how are tech companies and the government working to support local education and workforce development so that residents can access new trade and professional opportunities?

As more data centers are built, multiple stakeholders, spanning AI companies to civil society organizations, should consider the risks of accelerated growth. There should be community surveys to understand people’s concerns and ways for public utility commissions to gather feedback from affected neighbors and incorporate that information into their rate decisions. In other words, communities should not view these buildings as isolated entities, but rather as valued assets that bridge local dynamics with global concerns, as well as an opportunity for local development.

Job impact

One area of community benefit that might be less promising is job creation. Even in large-scale centers, construction jobs often total around 1,500 skilled trade workers and 100 operational jobs. Since centers largely consist of file servers and networking equipment, it does not take a lot of employees to staff them. Hyperscale data centers may comprise a million square feet of space and cost a billion dollars to build, but they are not likely to create a large number of jobs outside of construction, which is why other community benefits may be more salient for regions expanding their data center footprint.

Climate and environmental risks

Natural disasters are major threats to data centers. The prevalence of U.S. data centers in places such as Texas, California, and Virginia makes them susceptible to hurricanes in the Southeast, floods in Texas and Virginia, and earthquakes along the West Coast.

As climate change fuels more destructive floods and storms, companies must carefully select the construction sites of new data centers. In disaster-prone areas, it is also crucial to build in data and operational redundancy in case particular centers go down due to weather problems.

National security considerations

Increasingly complicated geopolitical dynamics are affecting data centers. Shifting alliances and the polarization of global relations alter the United States’ risk profile. Competition with China has intensified, and so have concerns about national defense, cybersecurity, and international competitiveness. Decisions about where to build data centers carry national security implications, raising questions about the nature of a host nation’s relationship with the United States and its level of democratic governance. Careful deliberation about these subjects is necessary, as the implications on intelligence gathering and defense are significant.

On the hardware side, the Biden administration dealt with some possible security threats by limiting chip exports to adversarial countries. It imposed controls on the kind and sophistication of semiconductors that American firms could sell to Chinese entities, for example. It invested in domestic manufacturing capabilities through the CHIPS and Science Act, in order to boost American capabilities and make sure U.S. companies had access to chips in case of any disruptions in production in Taiwan and South Korea, where the most advanced chips are made.

Trump has altered that strategy in two ways. He has weakened support for CHIPS Act funding and loosened restrictions on chip sales to China. The administration’s argument is that it is better to have foreign competitors reliant on American products than for them to develop their own domestic capabilities. The belief is that these actions will protect American security, while still maintaining export markets to China and elsewhere.

Data portability

It is important for organizations to avoid data center “lock-in” and have the means to move their information and models from platform to platform. While this was a problem in the early days of some social media sites, companies can now export their data and switch to another platform if they choose.

There should be a similar mechanism for convenient data migration so that individuals and organizations are not locked into individual sites with limited migration options. Both the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of the European Union and the California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) give people control over their own data and mandate the data portability rights of any individual or organization. This requirement should be extended throughout the U.S. to give people more choices and greater control over their personal information and applications. In the future, more interoperability could be built into data centers to ensure more seamless data coordination.

Europe's distinctive challenges

Europe faces some distinctive challenges in building out data centers, owing to the inadequacy of its current power grid, permitting obstacles, and poor access to capital in order to scale its businesses.

It is expensive to build data centers in many European nations. There are high land costs, cumbersome permitting procedures, high labor and tax costs, and infrastructure development barriers.Similar to the U.S., the members of the European Union must address these obstacles and ensure their businesses have access to the data centers that will power the AI economy.

In general, the European Union has been slow to overcome barriers to data center development and is building these facilities at a far slower rate than the United States. A similar challenge could emerge domestically if U.S. states diverge in how they support data center construction. However, as Table 2 indicates, state-level approaches in the United States have so far remained consistent, enabling effective coordination with federal initiatives to advance these projects.

Investing in the US hinterland and Global South

Most data centers now reside in American states on the East or West coasts or in developed countries that already have ample financial resources. There is a real risk that the U.S. hinterland will be left behind, as well as the Global South, including substantial parts of Africa, Latin America, and Asia. Table 1, for example, shows that there are no African countries with a substantial number of data centers, and the only Global South nations among the top 16 places were Brazil and Mexico.

The problem with the narrow geographic scope of data center locations is that it reinforces existing inequities and accelerates the gap between digital “haves” and “have-nots.” Data centers are crucial for future economic development. It will be hard for nations to be competitive if they do not have their own data centers or if their AI applications lag due to insufficient infrastructure. We need a geographical distribution of data centers that promotes economic growth in the Global South and enables AI for the public good around the world.

To deal with equity issues, Daniel Goetzel of Harvard University has discussed “AI economic zones” as ways to diversify the geography of AI and data centers. The idea is that cities could establish areas similar to urban economic zones where public and private investment could facilitate technology developments and make it easier for those without much access to capital to develop their ideas. Similar approaches may work globally through the World Bank or other international development agencies.

In summary, several obstacles and barriers must be addressed to enable data centers—and, by extension, AI applications—to reach their full potential and support economic flourishing. Challenges involving critical minerals components, workforce shortages, permitting reforms, energy and water needs, electric grid investment, national security, and geographical distribution are allcritically important. Improvements in all these areas will be crucial to the international competitiveness and economic prosperity of the United States.This paper is part of a broader research effort to monitor these and other emerging areas and track community benefits and risks, while measuring progress toward national and international goals.

That includes when it might bring a cheaper EV to our shores, like the newly revealed Honda 0 α.
While the EV strategy is getting admittedly ""difficult,"" according to Mibe, the company will instead try to grow its hybrid business.
""For the time being, we will base our business on hybrid vehicles, and then make decisions about battery EVs,"" Mibe said.
Like so many other things in Honda's world right now, Mibe says it might come along in 2030 or later.","Like every other automaker, Honda is having a bit of a tough time navigating what to do with its electric vehicle plans. During a sit-down with media members ahead of the Japan Mobility Show, CEO Toshihiro Mibe talked at length about the various issues Honda is now facing in this area, thanks to changes to the industry implemented by President Trump and his administration. One of the most notable, of course, is the fact that he killed off the $7,500 vehicle tax credit, and it's forcing Honda to rethink its EV timeline. That includes when it might bring a cheaper EV to our shores, like the newly revealed Honda 0 α.

""With the Trump administration in place, we have the sense that EV growth has been moved back out by maybe five years or so into the further future,"" Mibe said through a translator. ""So, if we think about whether do we have to really come up with an affordable EV right away, we get the feeling not really.""

Full Disclosure: Honda paid for my flights, food and hotels while I was in Japan.

Now, Honda is looking toward 2030 as a new inflection point for whether or not it'll begin to consider bringing cheaper EVs to our shores. At that point, Trump will (theoretically) be out of office, and the company will have a better understanding of what U.S. politics and policies are surrounding EVs. It's also looking toward the results of the election held on November 4 of this year to see where things may be headed, but until the end of the decade, we're going to have to make do with the more expensive 0 Series Saloon and SUV. Of course, we don't have pricing for those vehicles yet, but I don't expect them to be comparable to the Accord and CR-V.

""We are, of course, aware that affordable EVs are important for the U.S. market as well. So, in the past, going back several years, we have had a history where we have considered affordable EVs together with GM,"" Mibe said. ""However, when it comes to bringing down the cost of EVs considerably, we need to think about the battery strategy, so unless the battery cost is significantly lower, the total cost of the EV cannot be reduced significantly. That's the reality.""

While the EV strategy is getting admittedly ""difficult,"" according to Mibe, the company will instead try to grow its hybrid business. In 2027, Honda plans to launch a revamped hybrid drivetrain that will be more powerful and efficient than the one currently on sale, and it should bring production costs down about 20%. To help with tariffs, Honda is also planning to increase the amount of U.S.-made content within its hybrids.

""For the time being, we will base our business on hybrid vehicles, and then make decisions about battery EVs,"" Mibe said. At a different point during the sit-down, Mibe talked about decades far in the future, like 2040 or 2050, when electrification would have to ""move faster."" It sure sounds like Honda isn't planning for the total EV revolution to come anytime soon.

In the nearer future, Mibe says hybrid volume will continue to increase through 2030. Right now, Honda sells about 800,000 hybrids per year. The goal is to get that number over 2 million by 2030.

Still, none of this means Honda is changing its plans for the 0 Series lineup. When asked if it is considering offering its flagship EVs with hybrid powertrains, Mibe quickly dismissed the idea, saying the 0 Series was specifically designed as an EV platform, so there's no plan to add any sort of hybrid component.

Currently, Honda has shown three different 0 Series models, and because Honda believes the 0 α Prototype is too small and too cheap to come here, it leaves me wanting a third car in the U.S. lineup. Well, while Mibe wouldn't go so far as to confirm a larger 0 Series SUV, he did say the automaker was doing research and development on the next generation of EVs on a different platform, and perhaps one of those could be a large SUV.

""We will want to come up with a full kind of platform product lineup. We do have plans to come up with those,"" Mibe said. ""However, it won't be soon that we come up with a larger EV."" Like so many other things in Honda's world right now, Mibe says it might come along in 2030 or later.",https://www.jalopnik.com/img/gallery/hondas-ev-plans-have-been-pushed-back-maybe-five-years-by-trumps-policies/l-intro-1762292881.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 13:08:29.653741

“We’re proud to partner with B&W, a company with nearly 160 years of proven leadership in power generation,” said Wes Cummins, chairman and CEO of Applied Digital.
In September, the company partnered with energy transition investment firm Denham Capital to convert former coal-fired power plants into natural gas-fired plants to power data centers in the US and Europe.
Applied Digital is a developer of AI and HPC data centers in the US.
The capacity has been leased out to CoreWeave, which inked a 400MW capacity agreement with the company.","The full contract is expected in Q1 2026, with operations slated to begin in 2028. The company also expects to sign a long-term parts and services agreement once the plant becomes operational. The exact data center that the power plants will serve was not disclosed.

“We’re proud to partner with B&W, a company with nearly 160 years of proven leadership in power generation,” said Wes Cummins, chairman and CEO of Applied Digital.

“Their advanced boiler and steam turbine technology delivers efficiency on par with the simple-cycle gas turbines we evaluated – while enabling faster deployment. This partnership enhances our ability to add more capacity to current and future sites, giving Applied Digital a distinct speed-to-market advantage in bringing power generation online.”

B&W claims that its steam-based generation systems can be deployed faster than traditional simple- or combined-cycle gas plants, offering an alternative for AI data centers facing power constraints.

“B&W has designed and installed thousands of boilers and has more than 400GW of installed generating capacity at utility and industrial plants around the world,” said Kenneth Young, B&W chairman and CEO.

“Our solutions for AI Data Centers are proven technologies that utilize natural gas efficiently while providing reliable, redundant, and readily available power faster than combined-cycle or simple-cycle plants.”

Young went on to state that the company’s experience in engineering, construction, and project management will support the “fully integrated” delivery. The company also said that it expects to sign a long-term parts and services agreement once the plant becomes operational.

“B&W also has extensive engineering, technology, construction, and project management expertise, earned through decades of successfully executing some of the largest power projects in the global market,” said Young. “Our proven track record, as well as our broad experience in power plant operations and maintenance, will help assure a completely integrated, seamless solution for our customer from start to finish.”

The $120+ million project combines powerful computing capacity with a groundbreaking approach to carbon-neutral heat recovery, making Lansing a national model for sustainable technology and clean energy innovation.
Deep Green designs and operates ultra-efficient, high-density data centers that capture and reuse the heat they produce with negligible water use.
“Our mission is to accelerate the decarbonization of heat for the benefit of people and the planet,” said Mark Lee, chief executive officer of Deep Green.
Deep Green also plans to design the site to integrate seamlessly into Lansing’s downtown environment, with an emphasis on safety, aesthetics and community collaboration.","Deep Green, a global leader in sustainable, high-performance computing infrastructure, today announced plans to build a first-of-its-kind 24-megawatt (MW), ultra-efficient data center in downtown Lansing.

Deep Green designs and operates ultra-efficient, high-density data centers that capture and reuse the heat they produce with negligible water use. The company will partner with the Lansing Board of Water & Light (BWL) to supply free, carbon-neutral heat directly into BWL’s hot water system, cutting carbon emissions and creating lasting community benefits.

Benefits the Lansing community can expect from this development include:

A $120+ million capital investment generating $1 million in additional annual revenue to the city from its partnership with the BWL, as well as significant property tax revenue.

Delivering over $1.1 million in annual natural gas savings to the BWL through reduced demand, equivalent to 5,000 homes and more than 310,000 MCF.

Reducing carbon emissions through recycled heat at a rate equivalent to removing 3,000 cars from the road each year.

Creating good-paying union and high-tech jobs during construction (35+ jobs) and operations (15+ jobs) that drive long-term economic impact.

Supporting local nonprofits and charities with a contribution of $6,000 per MW of contracted data center usage, up to $120,000 annually, with portions going to programs like Pennies for Power, which supports families struggling to pay their utility bill.

“Our mission is to accelerate the decarbonization of heat for the benefit of people and the planet,” said Mark Lee, chief executive officer of Deep Green. “By capturing and reusing heat that would otherwise be wasted, this project transforms Lansing’s energy landscape, turning technology into a local sustainability solution. We’re proud to partner with the city of Lansing and the Board of Water & Light to make this vision a reality.”

The facility will have a negligible impact on water use thanks to a closed-loop cooling system with hyper-efficient performance and near-silent operation. Deep Green also plans to design the site to integrate seamlessly into Lansing’s downtown environment, with an emphasis on safety, aesthetics and community collaboration.

“Economic development and repurposing surface parking lots continues to be a priority. Deep Green’s proposal to develop and better utilize these city lots will provide not only urban infill and density, but will also be a major investment and dynamic innovation in our downtown,” said Lansing Mayor Andy Schor. “This project will generate more than $1 million in additional revenue per year for Lansing, which could be used for so many city needs - from police officers and fire fighters, to corridor improvement and assistance to those that need social services. At the same time, it will meet sustainability goals while reducing future utility rate increases. This unique project will strengthen our local economy, support good-paying jobs, and move us closer to a cleaner, more resilient high-tech future.”

For Lansing BWL General Manager Dick Peffley, the project is an ideal partnership.

“Working with Deep Green allows us to take another big step forward in cutting carbon emissions and reducing natural gas use for our hot water system, which will minimize future rate increases for those customers, and also increase our return on equity to the Lansing community,” said Peffley. “At the same time, we’re able to support attracting a business that is truly the foundation of our region’s high-tech economy.”

Deep Green’s Lansing data center will initially operate within the BWL’s existing generation capacity, eventually transitioning to new, cutting-edge technology on-site, ensuring reliable, efficient service without adding costs to current customers. Construction is expected to begin in the spring of 2026, provided that final approvals are secured from local and state partners.",https://www.lbwl.com/themes/bwl/images/social-image--logo-square.png,N,,2025-11-05 12:11:23.123649

“In the final days of the Biden-Harris Administration, the EPA put their far-left allies ahead of the American people, giving away Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund grants worth nearly $30 billion to recipients who were not equipped to receive such large amounts of funding,” said Chairmen Guthrie, Joyce, and Palmer. “By requesting documentation about this grant process from the EPA, Republicans on the Committee on Energy and Commerce are continuing our work to root out waste, fraud, and abuse while being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

This letter follows requests sent to eight nonprofits who were awarded more than $20 billion earlier this year through the GGRF.

Key excerpt from the letter:

“The Committee finds the potential for financial mismanagement particularly worrisome, as some of the grantees’ previous revenues were only a small fraction of the GGRF funds they received, which raises questions about whether the grant recipients can adequately manage grant amounts that are significantly larger than their previously documented revenue.”

“The Committee seeks to ensure that the federal government is a good steward of taxpayer dollars and to continue supporting EPA’s efforts in combatting waste, fraud, and abuse within the GGRF program. To assist with the Subcommittee’s investigation of GGRF and support the Administration’s efforts, the Committee requests the following documents no later than November 19, 2025:

The complete grant file for the three NCIF grantees and the five CCIA grantees, including the application submitted by the organization with all supporting documentation and appendices, any additional information requested by EPA, and any memos on changes to the grant terms and conditions.

The scoring breakdown and rational for each score for all the NCIF and CCIA applicants included in the final rankings lists for the top-ranked applications, including any changes to scoring or rescores and rationale for why those changes occurred.

Any checklist or guidance for EPA grants employees on what steps they should be taking to conduct appropriate pre-award due diligence and to ensure all required paperwork and documentation is submitted and verified. This should include briefing materials used to advise the Administrator, Deputy Administrator, Chief of Staff, General Counsel, Associate Administrator for Mission Support, and Associate Administrator for the Office of Air and Radiation about the selection of NCIF grantees and CCIA grantees.

Any reports received from Citibank or the U.S. Treasury regarding the account balances or transactions histories of the GGRF accounts for the three NCIF grantees and the five CCIA grantees and any of their sub-awardees.

Any progress reports received from the three NCIF grantees and the five CCIA grantees.

The names of all panel chairs, senior review panels, selection officials, and all individuals involved in the review panels for all the NCIF and CCIA applicants included in the final rankings lists for the top-ranked applications.”

Background:

The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) authorized the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to create and implement a $27 billion GGRF program. Of this appropriation, $20 billion was awarded to just eight grant recipients; with $14 billion awarded to three grant recipients under the National Clean Investment Fund (NCIF) program and $6 billion awarded to five grant recipients under the Clean Communities Investment Accelerator (CCIA) program.

Governors-elect and current Reps. Abigail Spanberger (D-VA) and Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) made energy affordability a centerpiece of their campaigns in two seminal off-year elections. The cost of living continued to be a top-of-mind issue for the public, according to recent polling in both Virginia and New Jersey. This was an especially salient concern in both states, as residential customers saw the average price of electricity increase by nearly 13 percent in Virginia and by nearly 21 percent in New Jersey, compared with energy bills the prior summer. This is due in part to soaring fuel costs and the need for grid upgrades to keep up with both an increasing number of extreme weather events and new artificial intelligence data centers. These factors are causing cost problems across the country, but the issue came into the spotlight in these two key states.

Energy affordability and utility costs also featured heavily online and in campaign messaging. According to AdImpact, Republicans devoted nearly 30 percent of all ad spending in the New Jersey gubernatorial race to energy and climate issues, while Democrats spent nearly 26 percent. Additionally, analysis from the Center for American Progress Action Fund finds that, throughout 2025, progressive social media pages routinely outperformed conservative ones in terms of engagement on posts about rising energy costs.

As energy costs have surged, voters are seeking leaders with clear plans to lower bills in the short term while securing long-term stability and clean, affordable energy. In contrast, the Trump administration is only making energy costs worse. Since returning to office, the administration has drastically stymied efforts to deploy reliable renewable energy and halted critical infrastructure projects around the country, threatening jobs, grid reliability, and clean air all at once. To date, more than 100 million in canceled or delayed clean energy investments have been lost in Virginia and more than $2.6 billion in clean energy investment and nearly 8,000 jobs were put at risk in New Jersey, according to Climate Power. The Republican opponents in the state races also repeated the false choice between climate-oriented policies and affordability, which turned out to be a losing argument with voters.

Policy and messaging

In Virginia, Spanberger framed energy affordability as part of a broader plan to make the state’s economy work for families again. Her “Affordable Virginia Plan” called for addressing utility bills by expanding energy-efficiency programs, modernizing the grid, and ensuring data centers don’t drive up costs for Virginians. She argued that when these actors drive up demand, they should also help fund the infrastructure upgrades that keep the grid reliable. “It is about ensuring that there is a statewide strategy recognizing the trajectory we are on for our energy needs and that Virginia is able to pursue greater independence by generating much more energy to meet the needs of our community now and our communities into the future,” she said.

During the campaign, Spanberger repeatedly warned that the Trump administration’s Big Beautiful Bill would drive up costs for Virginians by cutting federal investments in clean energy. In debates and interviews, she pointed to the administration’s withdrawal of Norfolk, Virginia’s wind project as an example of how these cuts threaten local jobs and stall economic growth.

Following the Trump administration’s lead, Spanberger’s Republican opponent, Lt. Gov. Winsome Earle-Sears, attacked the landmark Virginia Clean Economy Act and committed to staying out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI). “The RGGI’s energy tax also made it impossible for Virginia’s natural gas plants to compete with producers in states without an energy tax,” said Earle-Sears, claiming the policy had hurt Virginia’s consumers. Despite this, initial analysis indicated that Virginia’s clean energy sector could support thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment statewide.

Spanberger presented affordable energy not only as a climate policy but as a fairness issue for families already paying more for groceries, gas, and housing. Her approach recognized clean energy as a tool to stabilize prices over time rather than as a competing priority.

As energy costs have surged, voters are seeking leaders with clear plans to lower bills in the short term while securing long-term stability and clean, affordable energy.

In New Jersey, Sherrill placed affordability at the center of her campaign. “I’ll get right to it—our utility bills have gone up by 20% this summer. New Jerseyans are hurting. And I hear it from families all around the state,” said Sherrill. Her campaign focused on reducing household energy costs and improving utility transparency for ratepayers. She proposed declaring a state of emergency on utility costs and freezing rates for one year to give families immediate relief while the state works to accelerate the shift to cleaner, more reliable power—and to hold their utility companies and grid operators accountable. The proposal underscored the view that short-term affordability and long-term energy reform must go hand in hand.

Sherrill also tied rising costs to the Trump administration’s Big Beautiful Bill, calling it an “attack on our economy” that would raise utility prices by hundreds of dollars a year. Throughout the campaign, from solar farm visits to televised debates, she argued that the bill’s cuts to clean energy investments would jeopardize projects, eliminate jobs, and leave New Jersey families paying more.

Sherrill’s Republican opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, advanced proposals that echoed the Trump administration’s calls to dismantle clean energy standards rather than invest in modernizing the grid. Ciattarelli’s fossil fuel-dependent energy plan would have raised energy prices for families in New Jersey by nearly $900 per year, according to a report from Greenline Insights. If elected, Ciattarelli also would have pulled New Jersey out of the RGGI, repealed electric vehicle standards, repealed energy efficiency standards for appliances, and reversed the state’s offshore wind goals.

On the other hand, Sherrill’s message tied affordability to economic growth, arguing that a reliable, modern energy system attracts business investment and creates good-paying jobs. She emphasized that lowering costs and advancing climate goals can happen together when policy is guided by long-term savings and consumer protection.

Together, the Spanberger and Sherrill approaches demonstrated how clean energy policy can be successfully framed through affordability and economic security while keeping sight of long-term climate and clean energy goals.

What policymakers should know

While it remains to be seen how campaign commitments turn into specific policy, other states and the federal government will face similar challenges. The Center for American Progress, in collaboration with the Natural Resources Defense Council, found that residents across 49 states, excluding Hawaii, are facing potential increases in their utility bills—some as high as $60 per month. Across the country, electricity prices have risen at nearly double the rate of inflation over this past year. Energy affordability is a worry for Americans: A recent poll found that electricity bills are a major source of stress for 36 percent of Americans.

Federal policymakers should act to lower energy burdens for Americans while still ensuring a reliable electric grid that meets rising energy demand and resilience needs. Spanberger’s Affordable Virginia Plan states that data centers should pay their fair share of the costs to generate and distribute the electricity they need—and that these costs should not be passed onto other customers. At the federal level, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission should require rates that make data centers pay their fair share.

Residents across 49 states, excluding Hawaii, are facing potential increases in their utility bills—some as high as $60 per month.

In addition, drawing on Sherrill’s call for direct consumer relief in her state of emergency declaration, the federal government should support working families by lowering energy burdens for American households. This could be accomplished through federal funding for local governments to reduce utility costs for their residents or the distribution of relief checks for households. And as Spanberger has emphasized through her focus on community solar and local clean-energy production, the federal government could offer funding to accelerate community choice aggregation to lock in an affordable price for clean electricity for Americans and to provide technical assistance to jurisdictions.

Lastly, as emphasized by both governors-elect in their clean energy proposals, improvements to the electric grid are needed. The electric grid is aging and susceptible to vulnerabilities such as extreme weather and inefficiencies. At the same time, dependence on volatile fossil fuels that continue to rise in price and affect the price of electricity in the market should be decreased. Policymakers must build a resilient and modern electric grid while investing in clean energy sources that are cheap and quick to deploy.

Conclusion

The 2025 gubernatorial races in Virginia and New Jersey revealed a growing truth in American politics: Policies that align clean energy with affordability are politically attractive. Policymakers should commit to short- and long-term solutions that demonstrate to voters that lawmakers will tackle the energy affordability crisis effectively and efficiently, bringing costs down for American families nationwide.

“We’re in a huge mess,” said Bill Hare, a longtime climate scientist who founded the policy institute Climate Analytics.
“I think what’s upcoming is a major test for the Paris Agreement, probably the major test.
“The question is whether we are better off by virtue of the Paris Agreement,” he said.
Worldwide clean energy investments are now twice as much as fossil fuels spending, according to the International Energy Agency.","The United States has quit the deal — twice. President Donald Trump is throttling green energy projects at home and finding allies to help him undermine climate initiatives abroad, while inking trade deals that commit countries to buying more U.S. fossil fuels.

Europe remains on track to meet its climate commitments, but its resolve is wavering, as price-weary voters and the rise of far-right parties raise doubts about how quickly the bloc can deliver its pledge to turn away from fossil fuels.

Paris has helped ingrain climate change awareness in popular culture and policy, led countries and companies to pledge to cut their carbon pollution to zero and helped steer a wave of investments into clean energy. Scientists say it appears to have lessened the odds of the most catastrophic levels of warming.

On the downside, oil and gas production hasn’t yet peaked, and climate pollution and temperatures are still rising — with the latter just tenths of a degree from the tipping point agreed in Paris. But the costs of green energy have fallen so much that, in most parts of the world, it’s the cheapest form of power and is being installed at rates unthinkable 10 years ago.

World leaders and diplomats who are in Brazil starting this week for the United Nations’ annual climate talks will face a test to stand up for Paris in the face of Trump’s opposition while highlighting that its goals are both necessary and beneficial.

The summit in the Amazonian port city of Belém was supposed to be the place where rich and poor countries would celebrate their progress and commit themselves to ever-sharper cuts in greenhouse gas pollution.

Instead, U.S. contempt for global climate efforts and a muddled message from Europe are adding headwinds to a moment that is far more turbulent than the one in which the Paris Agreement was adopted.

Some climate veterans are still optimists — to a point.

“I think that the basic architecture is resistant to Trump’s destruction,” said John Podesta, chair of the board of the liberal Center for American Progress, who coordinated climate policy under Obama and former President Joe Biden. But that resistance could wilt if the U.S. stays outside the agreement, depriving the climate movement of American leadership and support, he said.

“If all that’s gone, and it’s gone for a long time, I don’t know whether the structure holds together,” Podesta added.

Other climate diplomats say the cooperative spirit of 2015 would be hard to recreate now, which is why acting on Paris is so essential.

“If we had to renegotiate Paris today, we’d never get the agreement that we had 10 years ago,” said Rachel Kyte, the United Kingdom’s special climate representative.

“But we can also look to these extraordinary data points, which show that the direction of travel is very clear,” she said, referring to growth of clean energy. “And most people who protect where their money is going to be are interested in that direction of travel.”

The Paris paradox

One thing that hasn’t faded is the business case for clean energy. If anything, the economic drivers behind the investments that Paris helped unleash have surpassed even what the Paris deal’s authors anticipated.

But the political will to keep countries driving forward has stalled in some places as the United States — the world’s largest economy, sole military superpower and historically biggest climate polluter — attacks its very foundation.

Trump’s attempts to undermine the agreement, summed up by the 2017 White House slogan “Pittsburgh, not Paris,” has affected European ambitions as well, French climate diplomat Laurence Tubiana told reporters late last month.

“I have never seen such aggressivity against national climate policy all over because of the U.S.,” said Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement. “So we are really confronted with an ideological battle, a cultural battle, where climate is in that package the U.S. government wants to defeat.”

The White House said Trump is focused on developing U.S. oil and engaging with world leaders on energy issues, rather than what it dubs the “green new scam.” The U.S. will not send high-level representatives to COP30.

“The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his commonsense energy agenda,” said Taylor Rogers, a spokesperson. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Trump is not the only challenge facing Paris, of course.

Even under Obama, the U.S. insisted that the Paris climate pollution targets had to be nonbinding, avoiding the need for a Senate ratification vote that would most likely fail.

But unlike previous climate pacts that the U.S. had declined to join, all countries — including, most notably, China — would have to submit a pollution-cutting plan. The accord left it up to the governments themselves to carry out their own pledges and to push laggards to do better. An unusual confluence of political winds helped drive the bargaining.

Obama, who was staking part of his legacy on getting a global climate agreement, had spent the year leading up to Paris negotiating a separate deal with China in which both countries committed to cutting their world-leading pollution.

France, the host of the Paris talks, was also determined to strike a worldwide pact.

In the year that followed, more than 160 countries submitted their initial plans to tackle climate change domestically and began working to finish the rules that would undergird the agreement.

“The Paris Agreement isn’t a machine that churns out ambition. It basically reflects back to us the level of ambition that we have agreed to ... and suggests what else is needed to get back on track,” said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions and a negotiator for the United Kingdom during the Paris talks. “Whether countries do that or not, it’s essentially then a matter for them.”

Catherine McKenna, Canada’s former environment minister and a lead negotiator of the Paris Agreement’s carbon crediting mechanism, called the deal an “incredible feat” — but not a self-executing one.

“The problem is now it’s really up to countries as well as cities, regions, companies and financial institutions to act,” she said. “It’s not a treaty thing anymore — it’s now, ‘Do the work.’”

When green turns gray

Signs of discord are not hard to find around the globe.

China is tightening its grip on clean energy manufacturing and exports, ensuring more countries have access to low-cost renewables, but creating tensions in places that also want to benefit from jobs and revenue from making those goods and fear depending too much on one country.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former United Nations climate envoy, eliminated his country’s consumer carbon tax and is planning to tap more natural gas to toughen economic defenses against the United States.

The European Union spent the past five years developing a vast web of green regulations and sectoral measures, and the bloc estimates that it’s roughly on track to meet those goals. But many of the EU’s 27 governments — under pressure from the rising far right, high energy prices, the decline of traditional industry and Russia’s war against Ukraine — are now demanding that the EU reevaluate many of those policies.

Still, views within the bloc diverge sharply, with some pushing for small tweaks and others for rolling back large swaths of legislation.

“Europe must remain a continent of consistency,” French President Emmanuel Macron said after a meeting of EU leaders in October. “It must step up on competitiveness, but it must not give up on its [climate] goals.”

Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk, in contrast, said after the same meeting that he felt vindicated about his country’s long-standing opposition to the EU’s green agenda: “In most European capitals, people today think differently about these exaggerated European climate ambitions.”

Worldwide, most countries have not submitted their latest carbon-cutting plans to the United Nations. While the plans that governments have announced mostly expand on their previous ones, they still make only modest reductions against what is needed to limit Earth’s warming since the preindustrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Exceeding that threshold, scientists say, would lead to more lives lost and physical and economic damage that would be ever harder to recover from with each tenth of a degree of additional warming.

The U.N.’s latest report showing the gap between countries’ new pledges and the Paris targets found that the world is on track for between 2.3 and 2.5 degrees of warming, a marginal difference from plans submitted in 2020 that is largely canceled out when the U.S. pledge is omitted. Policies in place now are pointing toward 2.8 degrees of warming.

“We need unprecedented cuts to greenhouse gas emissions now in an ever-compressing timeframe and amid a challenging geopolitical context,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.

But doing so also makes sense, she added. “This where the market is showing that these kind of investments in smart, clean and green is actually driving jobs and opportunities. This is where the future lies.”

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a video message Tuesday that overshooting the 1.5-degrees target of Paris was now inevitable in the coming years imploring leaders to rapidly roll out renewables and stop expanding oil, gas and coal to ensure that overshoot was short-lived.

“We’re in a huge mess,” said Bill Hare, a longtime climate scientist who founded the policy institute Climate Analytics.

Greenhouse gas pollution hasn’t fallen, and action has flat lined even as climate-related disasters have increased.

“I think what’s upcoming is a major test for the Paris Agreement, probably the major test. Can this agreement move forward under the weight of all of these challenges?” Hare asked. “If it can’t do that, governments are going to be asking about the benefits of it, frankly.”

That doesn’t mean all is lost.

In 2015, the world was headed for around 4 degrees Celsius of warming, an amount that researchers say would have been devastating for much of the planet. Today, that projection is roughly a degree Celsius lower.

“I think a lot of us in Paris were very dubious at the time that we would ever limit warming to 1.5,” said Elliot Diringer, a former climate official who led the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions’ international program during the Paris talks.

“The question is whether we are better off by virtue of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “I think the answer is yes. Are we where we need to be? Absolutely not.”

Green technology defying expectations

In addition, the adoption of clean energy technology has moved even faster than projected — sparking what one climate veteran has called a shift in global climate politics.

“We are no longer in a world in which only climate politics has a leading role and a substantial role, but increasingly, climate economics,” said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015. “Yes, politics is important; no longer as important as it was 10 years ago.”

Annual solar deployment globally is 15 times greater than the International Energy Agency predicted in 2015, according to a recent analysis from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a U.K. nonprofit.

Renewables now account for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added globally every year, BloombergNEF reported. China is deploying record amounts of renewables and lowering costs for countries such as Brazil and Pakistan, which has seen solar installations skyrocket.

Even in the United States, where Trump repealed many of Biden’s tax breaks and other incentives, BloombergNEF predicts that power companies will continue to deploy green sources, in large part because they’re often the fastest source of new electricity.

Costs for wind and batteries and falling, too. Electric vehicle sales are soaring in many countries, thanks in large part to the huge number of inexpensive vehicles being pumped out by China’s BYD, the world’s largest EV-maker.

Worldwide clean energy investments are now twice as much as fossil fuels spending, according to the International Energy Agency.

“Today, you can actually talk about deploying clean energy technologies just because of their cost competitiveness and ability to lower energy system costs,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at the research institution Energy Innovation. “You don’t actually even have to say ‘climate’ for a lot of them, and that just wasn’t true 10 years ago.”

The economic trends of the past decade have been striking, said Todd Stern, the U.S. climate envoy who negotiated the Paris Agreement.

“Paris is something that was seen all over the world, seen by other countries, seen in boardrooms, as the first time in more than 20 years when you finally got heads of government saying, ‘Yes, let’s do this,’” he said. “And that’s not the only reason why there was tremendous technological development, but it sure didn’t hurt.”

Still, limits exist to how far businesses can take the clean energy transition on their own.

“You need government intervention of some kind, whether that’s a stick or a carrot, to push the economy towards a low-carbon trajectory,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general of policy at the International Chamber of Commerce. “If governments press the brakes on climate action or seriously start to soft pedal, then it does have a limiting effect.”

Brazil, the host of COP30, says it wants to demonstrate that multilateralism still works and is relevant to peoples’ lives and capable of addressing the climate impacts communities around the world are facing.

But the goal of this year’s talks might be even more straightforward, said Guilanpour, the former negotiator.

“If we come out of COP30 demonstrating that the Paris Agreement is alive and functioning,” he said, “I think in the current context, that is pretty newsworthy of itself.”",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F2f%2F05%2F0e5a211d4a9aa51b3c6077b4d94c%2Ftrump-climate-paris-agreement-03855.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:11:37.793805

Climate change is a public health matter, affecting the air we breathe, the food we grow and the transmission of disease as global temperatures continue to rise. Extreme heat, severe storms, air pollution, wildfires and the spread of mosquito- and tick-borne diseases threaten the physical and mental health of communities around the globe.

Some populations are disproportionately affected by the health risks associated with climate change, such as people living with disabilities and chronic illnesses, communities of color, people experiencing homelessness and outdoor workers.

Awards are presented in three categories: to APHA-Affiliated public health associations, an APHA member group and individual APHA members who are championing healthy, sustainable and equitable climate solutions.

The Tennessee Public Health Association was selected for an award for its work to build climate resilience among rural communities, with a specific focus on extreme heat adaptation and flood mitigation strategies. Through grant funding provided by the National Association of County and City Health Officials, the Tennessee Public Health Association developed a “train the trainer” curriculum, equipping community leaders with the knowledge of climate’s impacts on health so they could then offer the training to their communities.

TPHA isn’t slowing down either — it’s ramping up its preparedness workshops and expanding its curriculum to include the most up-to-date information on climate projections for the state.

The South Carolina Public Health Association was recognized for its work to address heat and energy challenges in Columbia, South Carolina. Through the Smart Surfaces Project, SCPHA partnered with APHA and the Smart Surfaces Coalition to promote technologies that help cool cities and improve resilience to extreme heat. The association launched a mini-grant program that supported local organizations, students and researchers in implementing or studying Smart Surfaces.

SCPHA’s future plans include continuing its tree planting initiative, aimed at creating cooling green spaces; expanding work with the Gills Creek Watershed Association on creating rain gardens at community libraries; and collaborating with the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services on the “Breathe Better” program, which educates students about the importance of air quality on school campuses.

The Intersectional Council’s Climate Change and Health Topical Group received an award for its focus on collaborative efforts in climate, health and equity, bringing APHA members from across Sections together through monthly meetings, annual webinars and events.

The ISC Climate Change and Health Topical Group is creating a strong network of public health professionals committed to climate action. Its future plans include continuing to hold monthly meetings and organizing a roundtable session and social event at APHA’s 2026 Annual Meeting.

Individual awards went to:

Y. Tony Yang, endowed professor of health policy and associate dean for health policy and population science at George Washington University’s School of Nursing, for making climate change a public health priority through policy leadership, scholarship and a deep focus on equity. In 2024, he was named one of 18 next-generation research leaders for his project “For People, For Planet,” which improves the sustainability of health research in the U.S. and U.K.

Jo Kay Ghosh, director of research and evaluation at Heluna Health, for her outstanding contributions to addressing the health impacts of climate-related disasters such as wildfires, extreme heat, flooding and power outages, with a focus on community preparedness.

Bottom line for investors and entrepreneurs Budget 2025’s tax credits aren’t just fiscal fine print — they’re strategic tools for growth.","The 2025 federal budget introduced a series of tax incentives designed to stimulate investment, innovation and productivity — particularly in sectors tied to clean technology, manufacturing and research.

While many of these measures aim to strengthen Canada’s long-term competitiveness, they also create new opportunities for investors and small businesses to improve cash flow and lower taxable income.

From accelerated write-offs for equipment purchases to expanded credits for clean-tech manufacturing and R&D, the updated framework rewards companies that reinvest in growth and modernization.

Here’s how investors and entrepreneurs can apply these tax tools to strengthen their financial position and position for future gains.

1. Invest in growth now — and write it off immediately

The new Productivity Super-Deduction announced in the Budget 2025 gives businesses a powerful reason to invest before 2030.

Under this rule, companies can immediately expense the full cost of eligible assets — including machinery, manufacturing equipment and clean-energy systems, instead of depreciating them over several years.

For small business owners, optimal tactics include:

Time major capital purchases before the program phases out

Combine the deduction with provincial grants or green financing for maximum leverage

Consider upgrading production lines or fleet vehicles to clean-energy models — both qualify

Investor insight

Companies that reinvest early will report stronger after-tax profits and higher operating efficiency, especially in manufacturing, logistics and construction sectors. So, watch for firms announcing capital reinvestment plans — it’s a bullish signal that they’re taking advantage of this incentive.

Why it matters: Immediate expensing lowers taxable income in the year of purchase, freeing up cash flow that can be reinvested in operations, staff or technology upgrades.

2. Ride the wave of clean economy investment credits

Budget 2025 cements Canada’s Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits, offering 15% to 60% credits on spending in clean tech, hydrogen, carbon capture and manufacturing of renewable components.

Good tactics for businesses include:

Partner with clean-tech suppliers or retrofit your facilities using qualifying technologies (solar, geothermal, energy storage)

Stack credits by pairing clean-tech equipment investments with the Productivity Super-Deduction

Investor insight

Green infrastructure firms, utilities and clean manufacturing companies stand to benefit. Look for publicly traded companies scaling their decarbonization strategies — their future returns may be partially government-funded.

Why it matters: These credits drastically reduce the effective cost of clean-energy investments — making Canada more competitive with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act incentives.

3. Tap into critical mineral and manufacturing credits

The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC) now covers 12 new minerals, expanding opportunities for exploration and extraction. The Clean Technology Manufacturing Credit further boosts producers involved in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, solar panels, and semiconductor components.

For business owners cosider whether or not your company supports this sector (e.g., logistics, engineering, component supply) — and partner early. Government incentives often ripple through the entire value chain.

Insight for small-cap investors

Junior miners exploring nickel, lithium, graphite, or rare earths are poised to benefit

Look for exploration companies with eligible projects under the expanded CMETC

Green-tech manufacturers could see higher valuations as production credits lower costs and speed up scaling

Why it matters: These credits aim to develop a full domestic clean-tech supply chain — from resource extraction to finished products — positioning Canada as a leader in EV and renewable manufacturing.

4. Reclaim R&D spending through the SR&ED Program

The Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) credit remains one of Canada’s most generous incentives for innovation.

Budget 2025 confirms enhanced refundable credits of 35% on up to $3 million in annual R&D expenditures for small firms.

Tactics for small businesses include:

Track R&D-related labour, materials, and subcontractor costs meticulously — many companies underclaim eligible work

Use the SR&ED refund to reinvest in intellectual property, automation, or scaling production

Investor insight

Tech firms that lean on SR&ED can sustain innovation without excessive dilution or borrowing. Pay attention to management commentary in quarterly reports — firms that regularly claim SR&ED credits often show stronger long-term margins.

5. Accessibility Credits as a Market Opportunity

The Home Accessibility Tax Credit (HATC) and Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) won’t directly apply to most businesses, but they create a strong consumer market signal: Canadians are spending to retrofit homes for accessibility and aging-in-place.

If you own or operate a firm that operates in the construction, renovation, or healthcare services business, then positioning your products to meet CRA’s eligible renovation list could increase demand and eligibility under these programs — and increase your firm's bottom line.

Investor insight

Companies producing modular ramps, adaptive construction materials or smart-home medical tech are positioned for growth. Investors can look for suppliers or exchange-traded fund (ETFs) targeting senior housing, accessibility technology, or healthcare innovation.

6. Shift from carbon rebates to business incentives

With the Canada Carbon Rebate winding down in 2025, the focus is shifting toward industrial decarbonization and business-led sustainability.

A good tactic for businesses is to audit your energy use — replacing high-emission equipment now can yield compounded savings under both clean-tech and productivity tax programs.

Investor insight

The policy pivot suggests a medium-term opportunity in industrial retrofits, energy auditing, and emissions tracking technology — all positioned for growth as carbon policy shifts toward enterprise responsibility.

Why it matters: Firms that invest early in emissions-reducing technology may now receive direct federal support, rather than consumers getting rebates at the pump.

Bottom line for investors and entrepreneurs

Budget 2025’s tax credits aren’t just fiscal fine print — they’re strategic tools for growth. Small businesses can immediately lower taxable income and fund expansion through targeted deductions and clean-tech incentives.

For investors, the winners will be those companies leveraging these programs to accelerate innovation, efficiency, and sustainability.

In short, Budget 2025 rewards proactive capital allocation — whether that’s a small firm investing in new equipment today, or a savvy investor backing the next generation of Canadian clean-tech leaders tomorrow.",https://media1.money.ca/a/137468/investors-and-small-businesses-budget-2025_social_media_thumbnail_1200x628_v20251104231210.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:12:15.185351

Energy marketers have often had to weather the whiplash of competing political ideologies, from incentives to promote cleaner energy and regulate traditional energy sources on one side to deregulation efforts on the other. In the face of these debates, renewable propane remains a vibrant, blooming branch on the larger tree that is the propane industry.

Although there is fascinating research being put forward on renewable propane production, from exploring creative biomass fuel sources to tinkering with ways to bring the experimental fuel up to scale, renewable propane faces major questions on the ground.

Can the fuel be scaled? Is there a real market for renewable propane? In a political landscape that oscillates between carbon emissions regulation and deregulation, where does renewable propane belong? And where, exactly, does renewable propane stand right now?

The Current Landscape of Renewable Propane

The Trump administration has explicitly expressed support for and released executive orders that call for increased conventional energy production. The propane industry has welcomed these moves. But what about some of the harder-to-define areas of the energy sector — more “gray” spaces that are occupied by experimental energy sources like biomass fuels? There’s a saying I’ve come to appreciate as I’ve grown older: Follow the money.

To understand the current opportunities for renewable propane, it’s helpful to take stock of the current funding across the energy sector. Here are some of the tangible ways the current administration is investing — and divesting — in renewable propane.

Department of Energy Notice of Funding Opportunity

In December 2024, the Department of Energy (DOE) Bioenergy Technologies Office (BETO) announced its intentions to establish a funding opportunity — up to $23 million — for research and development of renewable chemicals and fuels, including renewable propane. The funding opportunity is a rare example of a clean energy initiative that has not been retracted or struck down by the Trump administration.

According to DOE, the notice of funding opportunity “will support BETO’s conversion technologies program area priorities by advancing innovative technology pathways for affordable fuels and products, leveraging renewable resources and generating domestic jobs to accelerate the U.S. bioeconomy.”

Applicants for the funding were required to submit full applications by May 30, with selections taking place in October (selections had not been made at press time). Each research project is eligible to receive up to $2.5 million, granted it meets the following expectations:

ASTM D1835 specifications

Have a system energy consumption of no more than 50% of higher heating value of the finished LPG

Achieve a reduction of net greenhouse gases relative to fossil LPG of at least 70%

It remains uncertain whether the full funding amount will be awarded to applicants and by what standards the current administration will select award recipients.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act

The Trump administration’s momentous spending bill, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), passed by a thin margin and was signed into law July 4. It is likely the largest and most prevalent piece of legislation that will directly impact the energy sector in the near future. Sweeping in nature, the impacts of the bill on the energy sector — and on the propane industry, specifically — will likely only be fully understood and appreciated with time.

Highlights include:

Increased rate of mandatory gas and oil lease sales on federal lands, while eliminating the Biden administration’s requirements for renewable energy leasing

Reinstated 100% bonus depreciation for qualifying property

Postponed methane emissions fee that exceeds certain thresholds to the calendar year 2034

Extended the clean fuel tax credit through 2029

Accelerated phase-out periods for various Inflation Reduction Act clean energy programs, including the Residential Clean Energy Credit, Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, New and Used EV Tax Credit, Clean Electricity Investment and Production Credits and the Alternative Fuel/Refueling Property Credit

To reiterate, it’s likely impossible to assess how OBBBA’s changes to the energy landscape will play out for renewable propane production. While some changes might seem to obstruct or hurt renewable propane production — insofar as the bill implements changes that largely target most renewable and clean energy initiatives — the reality for renewable propane and even conventional propane is likely far more complicated.

For example, while the bill makes a point of targeting electric, solar and wind energy tax incentives, it remains relatively silent when it comes to directly addressing clean fuels. In fact, OBBBA extends the Clean Fuel tax credit through 2029, a tax credit that has benefitted the propane autogas and renewable propane industries, among others.

But to make matters more complicated, actions that appear to directly impact electrification efforts alone might additionally impact the more niche propane and renewable propane markets. OBBBA phases out both the Residential Clean Energy Credit and the Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit. Under the latter, certain propane water heaters qualified for a tax rebate.

OBBBA also phases out the Alternative Fuel/Refueling Property Credit, a program that has benefitted both electric vehicle production and propane autogas production. Besides allowing autogas sites to directly qualify for credits for refueling infrastructure, increased electric vehicle use and a demand for charging stations presents an opportunity for propane and renewable propane manufacturers to step in as a solution — rather than merely a competitor — to the strained demands on the electric grid, especially in remote, rural areas (see BPN’s August 2024 Beyond the Mains column for more information).

That being said, it is nevertheless true that OBBBA seems to largely benefit fossil fuel production. Where the act addresses renewable and clean energy initiatives, it is, for the most part, to phase out such programs. If OBBBA ushers in an overall decline in credit and grant opportunities for renewable research, this raises the question of where renewable propane stands. This is especially the case in light of the other ways the Trump administration has gone about defunding renewable energy.

Miscellaneous Clean Energy Cuts

Amid the flurry of activity that marked President Donald Trump’s first months in office, the DOE and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) have announced funding cuts to many clean energy programs. Funding cut announcements include:

$7.56 billion in financial awards for 223 energy projects across states that voted for Kamala Harris in the 2024 presidential election

2026 Budget Proposal cuts, including:

$2.5 billion from DOE Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy department

$80 million in Department of Interior renewable energy programs

Cuts EPA grants to nongovernmental organizations

Similar to OBBBA, the main target of these proposed cuts are clean energy projects involving hydrogen, wind, solar and electric energy. Once again, cuts like these raise the question of what incentives will exist for renewable propane development in the future.

Recent cuts in clean energy development have directly impacted ExxonMobil, which was in the process of researching and developing clean hydrogen. Chevron owns and operates one of the major renewable propane programs in the country. In an environment where experimental fuels largely depend on government investment and the powerful infrastructure of established companies, it is unclear the extent to which these cuts will impact the “main players” in the fuel space going forward and their motives to develop fuels like renewable propane.

Why Should Propane People Care?

In light of the generally favorable ways in which the Trump administration is streamlining business permits, increasing land access for fossil fuel companies and potentially decreasing operational costs, why should we care about what’s happening in the clean energy space? There’s a temptation to relegate clean energy concerns to the sidelines — and likely for good reason. Some clean energy spaces may seem, after all, to be in many ways in direct competition with our own.

Most in the propane industry deal with traditional propane sourced from crude oil. In the course of a typical propane industry member’s workday, renewable propane may rarely come up as a topic, and when it does, it may be treated as a hypothetical rather than a tangible product. It makes sense that the push for the deregulation of conventional propane and its related market applications tends to rule the day.

Yet if history has taught us anything, it’s that new technologies and shifting values and concerns tend to bubble up whether we want them to or not. It can’t hurt to be an industry that is primarily curious. As Propane Education & Research Council President Tucker Perkins often says, we need a “wide path” approach to energy, one that appreciates innovation and sees opportunity where it might be tempting to see threats.

In fact, innovation has been at the center of the propane industry ever since the chemist Walter O. Snelling discovered that gases dispersed from gasoline could be liquefied and converted into a new type of fuel: “liquefied” petroleum gas. Or as it would come to be called, “propane.”",https://bpnews.com/sites/default/files/main_image/feat1-Fiscalpolicyresponsegovernmentinterventionineconomicrecessionbudgetanalysisflatdesignillustration.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:12:23.106998

Imagine running a hospital emergency department where a critical challenge is staffing. You need the correct number of emergency physicians and nurses available 24/7 to handle unpredictable patient surges. If you overstaff, costs become unsustainable. If you understaff, patients suffer.

Hospitals use historical data and predictive models to forecast staffing needs — they know that Mondays typically see more patients than weekends, that flu season creates predictable surges and that summer brings more trauma cases. Based on these patterns, they create staffing schedules months in advance. But hospitals must also maintain flexibility to handle unexpected events like multi-car accidents or a pandemic outbreak that can overwhelm even the best-laid plans.

This combination of systematic planning and operational flexibility shares similarities with what grid operators face every day as they manage our electricity infrastructure. Instead of patients needing immediate medical care, they’re dealing with millions of homes, businesses and critical facilities that need power exactly when they require it — not a moment too late. Rather than managing healthcare professionals, they’re coordinating a complex network of power plants, renewables and energy storage systems, each with different operating characteristics and availability patterns that must work together to maintain reliable service.

What is ELCC?

This is where effective load carrying capability, or ELCC, becomes indispensable. Much like a hospital forecasts patient volumes during different times of the year, grid operators forecast when they expect the greatest system stress — typically during peak demand periods when electricity usage is highest. They then evaluate how much each power source will contribute during these critical periods and assign each resource a reliability score based on its forecasted availability when the grid needs it most.

Unlike traditional reliability metrics that measure how often a power source comes on over the course of a month or year, ELCC specifically measures its contribution during peak stress periods. This distinction is crucial because the grid’s reliability depends not on total energy production, but on having an adequate supply precisely when demand is highest.

Solar and wind have a much lower ELCC than nuclear or natural gas due to their intermittency and the fact that they can’t be relied upon during peak stress hours (e.g., solar power is unavailable on a cold, dark winter evening). Consider that a 100-MW solar farm might have an ELCC of only 30%, meaning that across the hours with the greatest reliability risk, grid operators forecast an average production of 30 MW. Meanwhile, a 100-MW natural gas plant might have a 75% ELCC, providing 75 MW of dependable capacity during those same critical moments.

Grid operators face a similar planning challenge: baseload power sources like nuclear and fossil fuels provide a high degree of consistent capacity around the clock, while renewables face inherent limitations.

Renewable growth and short-duration energy storage

Driven by economics and speed to deploy, wind and solar capacity are on track to triple by 2030. But due to the intermittency noted above, their value is limited if they are not paired with another resource. Battery energy storage systems, or BESS, provide a solution to the intermittency challenge of renewables, capturing excess renewable energy when generation exceeds demand, and then discharging that stored energy during periods when renewable generation falls short of demand.

Lithium-ion batteries have become the initial workhorses of the energy storage revolution, typically providing four hours or less of storage. Until recently, this has aligned well with peak emergency periods — relatively short but intense surges in late afternoon and early evening when the grid faced its highest stress. As a result, four-hour batteries have had high ELCC values to date.

This high ELCC, combined with falling lithium-ion hardware costs, has driven dramatic growth in battery deployment. U.S. battery storage capacity increased by 66% in 2024, bringing operating capacity to 26 GW, while costs fell 80% over the past decade. Costs are projected to decline further, making battery storage competitive with natural gas peaker plants. Battery storage paired with solar is also one of the most competitive new sources of electricity.

However, the grid is evolving rapidly, and shorter-duration storage resources face challenges ahead.

The case for longer duration energy storage

As more short-duration storage gets deployed, the shape of the grid challenge is changing. Short, sharp demand peaks for a couple of hours have evolved into longer plateaus of sustained high demand relative to renewable generation. This transformation occurs because short-duration batteries effectively lop off the top of demand peaks. What that leaves you with is a scenario where the number of hours that constitute the new peak is longer (i.e., a flat-topped mountain).

Adding to this challenge, the explosive growth in electricity demand — particularly from data centers that require 24/7 power — is creating longer periods of sustained high demand rather than brief peak periods. Grid operators now face 8-12 hour sustained periods of high net demand that extend well beyond what existing four-hour batteries can cover.

The implications for ELCC values are profound and happening faster than many anticipated. The first 5 GW of four-hour storage might achieve 80% to 90% ELCC, but by the time 15 GW is deployed, new installations can drop below 40% ELCC. Essentially, those same four-hour assets become de-rated because they cannot be relied upon to provide power when the grid needs it most over those 8+ hour stretches.

Read More in Grid Security & Reliability

This decline in ELCC isn’t a failure of technology — it’s evidence of success in creating new requirements. The initial batteries solved the original problem so effectively that they revealed the next challenge: the need for longer-duration storage that can adapt as grid conditions continue to evolve.

Longer-duration storage addresses the fundamental need to carry a renewable-powered grid through extended periods of low generation. A typical four-hour battery might handle an evening peak but cannot sustain the system through a day or more of below-average renewable production.

Rather than simply deploying more four-hour batteries, optimal planning requires matching storage durations to the full spectrum of grid needs. In order for a resource to provide the same amount of ELCC, the duration must match the actual length of the high-demand period.

Flexible duration thermal energy storage

The declining ELCC of short-duration batteries creates a planning dilemma for utilities that’s difficult to solve with traditional storage technologies. What if grid conditions change and the optimal duration shifts from 10 hours to 15 hours to 20 hours over time? This creates a classic “Goldilocks problem” where utilities either have to build something now that provides perfect ELCC for the time being but falls short down the road, or they can overbuild a battery that’s providing enough ELCC in 20 years — but that means they’ve spent a lot of money on something that they don’t need quite yet. It’s too much or too little, but never just right.

Flexible duration thermal energy storage can address this problem head-on. Thermal battery systems offer a different approach to energy storage by storing electricity as heat in inexpensive materials, like carbon. Unlike electrochemical batteries that degrade with cycling, these thermal systems can handle thousands of charge-discharge cycles with minimal performance loss.

By separating power conversion from energy storage, storage capacity can be added incrementally at a fraction of the initial cost. The result is a storage system that can grow with changing grid needs. Instead of buying too little or buying too much, the utility can future-proof the capacity value of the battery by adding incremental capacity at a later date.

This flexibility tackles the ELCC challenge directly. For example, if a 10-hour battery starts losing ELCC value as grid conditions change, additional storage hours can be added at just 20% of the installation cost. This scalability responds to the dynamic nature of grid planning, allowing storage assets to grow with evolving needs rather than becoming stranded investments.

The declining ELCC of short-duration batteries isn’t a problem to solve — it’s a signal of successful renewable integration and a roadmap for what comes next. The challenge requires storage systems that can adapt to changing grid conditions while maintaining economic viability.

The broader context is important: every time you build a battery or any other asset, somebody is paying for that. And that somebody is a ratepayer. The solution requires optimizing the technology mix rather than simply building more of the same resources.

We don’t have to choose between renewables and reliability. By understanding ELCC and investing in adaptable storage solutions, we can build a grid that powers our critical infrastructure sustainably for generations, ensuring that when people depend on electricity, the power will always be there. The key is recognizing that successful renewable integration creates new challenges and requires developing storage technologies flexible enough to meet them.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/A_J__TrphjouOtaPTNvS1GbWajnEVDs_lE7BJTggLR4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9UZXhhc19wb3dlcl9saW5lcy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-05 13:08:17.101420

My colleagues and I have defended ILUC as a vital safeguard to address land use change from biofuels. I sent countless technical comments, I’ve written technical articles, and helped organize letters from scientists on this topic to the California Air Resources Board (CARB), the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and environmental policymakers in the European Union. But the approach we’ve defended is not working as well as it should, and it is time to think about how to make land use protections stronger.

This week the CARB is holding a workshop to consider the latest science on land use change from biofuels. This is overdue, since the analysis in California’s fuel regulations has not been updated in a decade. Recent analyses find important flaws with the GTAP economic modeling framework CARB used to develop its current ILUC estimates, and an important new analysis from Chen, Sexton and Smith finds that the global growth in vegetable oil-based fuels has accelerated deforestation with very large climate impacts. Despite concerns about land use change, recent actions of the Congress and the Trump administration are poised to dramatically increase consumption of vegetable oil-based fuel in the United States. The bottom line is that land use change remains a very real problem for biofuels.

In addition to the consideration of these scientific and modeling questions, I find myself thinking about lessons learned for policy design. The Low Carbon Fuel Standard (LCFS) framework relies on adjusting lifecycle carbon intensity (CI) scores based on ILUC analysis to send market signals to discourage deforestation. This ILUC accounting framework is complex and controversial, and it has not been universally embraced by other jurisdictions. The challenges are both technical and political. The complex and opaque collection of models required to assign emissions to specific fuels leaves ample opportunity to manipulate the process to get politically motivated results. And the high stakes and political power of the relevant interests mean they can and have shaped the outcomes of the analysis. As a result, ILUC determinations are often made on political rather than technical grounds.

The lesson I take is that the complexity and opacity of the existing ILUC framework are undermining its efficacy as a land use safeguard. Studies like the one from Chen, Sexton and Smith tell us that the expansion of vegetable oil-based fuels from 2002 to 2018 was very harmful, and the most direct way to address this harm is to check further expansion of these fuels. Going forward, directly regulating the amount of vegetable oil or other resources used to make biofuels may be a more effective way to structure a policy safeguard than the current ILUC framework of adjusting CI scores.

Background

On November 6th, CARB is holding a public forum on biofuels and land use change. This workshop is a follow-up to the 2024 amendments to the LCFS. The workshop was called for in a board resolution, issued as part of the process of board approval of the 2024 amendments to the LCFS. The resolution calls for a public forum covering two major topics:

Review the latest science on land use change and relevant models, and

Consider how to mitigate risks of harmful land use change or food market conflicts for future updates to the LCFS.

This workshop will only tackle the first part of the board’s direction, reviewing the latest science on land use change and relevant models. The question of how best to mitigate risks, including potential changes to policy design, will have to wait for another day (hopefully soon). I’m disappointed by this omission, because policy changes are needed to effectively mitigate the harm caused by the massive ongoing expansion of biofuel use.

The LCFS relies on lifecycle analysis to address concerns about land use change

The primary LCFS safeguard to address concerns about land use change is the inclusion of an estimate of land use change emissions (called indirect or induced land use change emissions or ILUC) in the carbon intensity (CI) assigned to crop-based biofuels. When this approach was initially proposed in 2007 by Alex Farrell and Dan Sperling[1], it was offered as a short-term measure until an “internationally accepted methodology for accounting for land use change” could be developed. Unfortunately, no consensus on methodology has been reached, and it appears increasingly unlikely it ever will.

In 2010 CARB convened an expert workgroup, on which I served, which informed updates to CARB’s ILUC calculations that were finalized in 2015. CARB’s ILUC analysis is based on the GTAP model, and a different version of the same model was subsequently used by the Argonne Lab to create an ILUC module of the GREET model, which projects ILUC emissions that are much lower than the original CARB study. The GTAP framework has been criticized for many technical deficiencies, and comparisons with other models suggest the GTAP approach substantially underestimates ILUC emissions.

In 2022, I served on a committee of the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine that reviewed Current Methods for Life-Cycle Analyses of Low-Carbon Transportation Fuels in the United States. My experience on this committee reinforced that there is not now, nor will there ever be, a consensus approach in the expert community on how to do lifecycle analysis of transportation fuel. One important finding of the committee was that CI scores used for policies like the LCFS combine two dissimilar kinds of lifecycle analysis, one focused on attributing responsibility for emissions to individual actions and actors in the biofuel supply chain (called an attributional analysis), and a second that evaluates the global consequences of a policy or change (called a consequential analysis). The resulting CI score is a hybrid that does not answer any well-defined question. An alternative approach that resolves this methodological problem is to use different types of analysis for different elements of the policy, with a consequential analysis used to shape decisions of fuel producers, and a consequential analysis used to inform safeguards that directly mitigate risks or problems the analysis identifies.

New analysis points to a major problem with vegetable oil-based fuels

Much of the debate since 2008 over land use change has focused on corn ethanol. But for the last decade, most of the growth of biofuel consumption in the US has been from vegetable oil-based biofuels like biodiesel and renewable diesel. A new analysis by Chen, Sexton and Smith from UC Davis and Berkeley finds that that using vegetable oils for biofuel accelerates tropical deforestation and increases carbon emissions. This new analysis takes a different approach than GTAP, relying more heavily on empirical data to reduce the dependence of the results on assumptions and model structure. They find that the global expansion of bio-based diesel made from vegetable oil has fueled massive deforestation in Indonesia and Malaysia. The extent of deforestation and associated emissions outweigh any climate benefits from replacing petroleum fuels.

A key finding of the analysis of Chen, Sexton and Smith is that the extent of deforestation is largely independent of which specific source of vegetable oil is used to make biofuel. This is not surprising, because vegetable oils are all close substitutes in the global food market. But this finding is in tension with the structure of ILUC implementation, which assigns differentiated ILUC scores to specific types of feedstock. For example, the LCFS assigns ILUC emissions of 71.4 g CO2e/MJ to palm oil, 29.1 g CO2e/MJ to soybean oil, and 14.5 g CO2e/MJ to canola oil and zero to inedible corn oil, used cooking oil or animal fats like tallow. These different ILUC scores create differentiated incentives that have had a big impact on the fuel market, as biofuel producers supplying California have scoured the globe to secure feedstocks with the lowest CI scores[2].

Not surprisingly, biofuel and vegetable oil producers reject the finding that using any source of vegetable oil has a similar impact on global markets. They argue it is unfair to hold midwestern soybean oil accountable for palm oil related deforestation in Indonesia. They have been successful at persuading federal policymakers to change the parameters of federal biofuel policies in a manner that favors major US crops, first by pressuring regulators to reduce ILUC values assigned to these crops and most recently by excluding consideration of ILUC from federal tax credits and restricting biofuel incentives to domestic fuels and feedstocks[3]. The resulting incentive structure of federal policies could have a big impact on California fuel markets in years to come. The strategies California has used to discourage the use of vegetable oil fuels will become less effective because of these changes in federal policy.

Fixing biofuel policies depends on the federal government, but California can help

The federal government bears the primary responsibility for the global harm caused by US biofuel policies. Federal policy has expanded the use of vegetable oil-based fuels to levels that far exceed the availability of US feedstocks to produce those fuels, with large and counterproductive impacts on global trade and land use. The result is that an increasing share of US biofuels have been coming from imported feedstocks or fuels. The administration wants US biofuel policies to focus on US fuels and feedstocks, but rather than scaling back biofuel mandates in line with domestic feedstock availability, they have proposed enlarging the mandates and layering on incentives for domestic feedstocks that will lead to costly and counterproductive shuffling of feedstocks and fuels.

I’ve called on the Environmental Protection Agency to scale back its biofuel policy proposal in line with a realistic assessment of feedstock availability. I also explained in a recent talk (video and slides) that because biofuels have a bigger impact on agriculture than transportation, biofuel policies should be designed with agriculture in mind. In particular, the ambition of US biofuel policies should be based on a realistic assessment of domestic feedstock availability and safeguards should ensure biofuels don’t exceed this level and expand the footprint of agriculture in the US or around the world.

California can’t fix problems caused by federal policies, but it can provide an essential laboratory for policy innovation, which is even more critical with federal science sidelined by the Trump administration. California’s LCFS model has been adopted by other states and will hopefully someday inform federal fuel policy reform. The LCFS wisely recognizes that shifting to renewable electricity for transportation is vital to phasing out petroleum and encourages all fuel producers to reduce their supply chain emissions. But before the LCFS can be a scalable model for federal fuel policy reform, California needs to grapple with the land use change challenge that has hung over the LCFS since its inception.

Learning from failed experiments, building safeguards that work in the real world

Scientists often learn more from failed experiments than they do from successes. But to learn these lessons one must acknowledge when an experiment has failed. California’s LCFS is an elegant policy that has a lot to recommend it, but its efforts to safeguard against harmful land use change have struggled. ILUC adjustments to CI scores are uncertain, technically complex, and prone to political interference. And with multiple overlapping policies affecting markets, adjustments to CI scores have an indirect and uncertain impact on land use.

The essential question policy makers must answer is how much of the vegetable oil, corn, animal fat, and other resources that can be used to make biofuels should be made available for fuel use. This requires an examination of resource availability, competing uses, impacts on land use, deforestation and food markets. With safeguards in place to avoid excessive diversion of these resources to fuel use, the LCFS can create an incentive structure that supports transportation electrification, encourages all fuel producers to reduce emissions and requires steady progress from the transportation fuel sector as a whole.

The availability of these secondary sources is much lower than vegetable oil on a global scale, and the data on their production and use is limited. But these feedstocks make up a large share of the California bio-based diesel market. The substitution that links primary vegetable oils will also occur with tallow, used cooking oil or inedible corn oil, but not in precisely the same way. These secondary fats and oils are used to make soaps and detergents or as animal feed, and when they are diverted to fuel production, they will be replaced with other resources. Over the last few years, consumption of these feedstocks for biofuel has grown so large that the indirect impacts of their use merit further study.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/aerial-palm-oil-plantation-indonesia.gif,N,,2025-11-05 12:11:46.997300

The carbon capture industry — including fossil fuel corporations — is banging on the doors of Congress, demanding even more support for carbon capture.
Along with more tax incentives, they also want to fast-track dangerous carbon pipelines and other carbon capture infrastructure.","Despite a long history of failure and fraud, U.S. leaders are cranking open the 45Q cash spigot for the carbon capture climate scam.

Forty years after boosters began promoting carbon capture and storage (CCS), the technology remains a failure. Yet lawmakers have dedicated more public funds to this scam than ever. They are ignoring carbon capture’s history of waste and fraud — and all the ways that polluters can and do exploit incentives.

CCS technology promises to capture carbon dioxide (CO2) from smokestacks or the air and permanently keep it out of the atmosphere. It enables a fantasy where dirty energy can be made clean with the right technology; where we can fight climate change while continuing to drill and burn fossil fuels.

While federal support for renewables plummets under Donald Trump, our leaders are expanding 45Q, a lucrative tax incentive program for the CCS climate scam. Worse, 45Q just got a major bump from Trump’s Big Ugly Bill to incentivize more oil drilling.

Lawmakers are making more funds available to polluters, while failing to guard these funds from exploitation. As our new research shows, this amounts to throwing our taxpayer dollars down oil and gas wells and into fossil fuel execs’ pockets.

Billions of Dollars Spent on CCS With Nothing to Show for It

The federal government has already spent decades and billions of dollars on the carbon capture pipe dream. It began with federal “clean coal” efforts, which aimed to use the technology to reduce coal’s climate harm. From 1984 to 2006, the federal government spent $7 billion developing this technology with nothing to show for it.

The Energy Department was also dumping cash into another fossil fuel technology branded as carbon capture: enhanced oil recovery (EOR), a drilling technique using captured carbon. With EOR, drillers inject CO2 into oil wells to bring the last dregs of oil to the surface.

Like the debunked “bridge fuel” messaging around natural gas, proponents claimed EOR would help develop carbon capture into a real climate solution, without oil production.

This has not come to pass. In fact, almost 90% of CO2 captured in the U.S. is still used for EOR. And this does more harm to the climate than help. In fact, burning the oil produced through EOR emits more CO2 than is injected during the process.

Carbon capture then got another $3.4 billion boost with the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. The result? Cost overruns and canceled projects, which have only continued to plague the industry since.

With billions of dollars and forty years of tinkering, carbon capture’s climate impact is laughable. As of September 2023, total U.S. CCS capacity — if run at maximum capacity — could capture only 0.4% of all our emissions. Piling more subsidies onto carbon capture is a waste, especially given the rapidly shrinking timeline we have to downsize emissions and avert climate chaos.

Lack of Oversight Allows Fraud and Abuse to Run Rampant in 45Q

Not only have carbon capture subsidies failed to scale the technology — they’ve also been mismanaged, allowing exploitation to run rampant. The Government Accountability Office reported that the Energy Department’s handling of carbon capture, all the way back to the George W. Bush administration, was riddled with accounting errors. The Department also continued to fund projects that missed targets and violated agreements.

Today, the 45Q program is hidden behind a smokescreen. We don’t even know what specific facilities claim the credit or the maximum funds the federal government will distribute through the program.

Moreover, no single government agency has full access to the data used to implement 45Q. This reduces oversight. Both the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and Internal Revenue Service (IRS), which administer different parts of 45Q, operate with incomplete knowledge of the projects that recieve the credit.

Furthermore, there’s not enough accountability in how companies report the CO2 they “capture.” To “verify” companies’ captured CO2, the IRS depends on numbers that the companies themselves report to the EPA, without checks from either agency.

All this contributes to the fraud and waste that runs rampant in 45Q. In 2020, the Treasury Department found that companies had improperly claimed nearly $1 billion in 45Q credits. These companies failed to give proof that the CO2 was effectively stored.

How did lawmakers respond? By boosting 45Q tax credits through the Inflation Reduction Act.

And now, Trump has further expanded the pie for fossil fuel corporations to get 45Q dollars. His administration is also gutting oversight and clearing the way for more abuse. It has fired government watchdogs for federal agencies and is slashing staff at the EPA and IRS.

45Q Lavishes Big Bucks on Fossil Fuel Facilities With Dubious Climate Benefit

The biggest scandal of 45Q? Many of the dollars for a so-called “climate solution” are awarded to polluters for polluting the same as they always have. Oil drillers and gas processors have used 45Q to claim tax benefits without changing anything about their existing operations.

Crucially, Trump’s Big Ugly Bill provided a huge boost to the 45Q tax credit for enhanced oil recovery, the main use of captured CO2. This has unlocked a potential $210 billion in additional subsidies, just for oil drillers to continue drilling.

The program also rewards natural gas processing facilities for disposing of their waste in the same way they always have. Drilling for methane gas brings up waste that includes CO2; processors have long separated out that CO2 and then injected it underground. By simply reclassifying these injection wells, gas processors can access 45Q dollars. We estimate that now 60% of the reported CO2 captured in the U.S. comes from gas processing facilities.

To make matters worse, CO2 needs to stay underground for thousands of years to benefit the climate, but long-term storage is far from guaranteed. Storage technology is riddled with issues that lead to leaks.

45Q rules require companies to give back credits for leaked CO2 — but this only lasts for four years. Anything that leaks after that? Companies get to keep the money. This gives them no incentive to ensure CO2 stays in the ground long enough to actually help the climate.

We are just paying the fossil fuel industry to pollute, with no climate benefit to show for it.

Congress Must Stop Wasting Money on the CCS Climate Scam

The messaging on carbon capture incentives centers the idea that we need to incentivize climate solutions so they can scale. But the truth is, we don’t need to scale carbon capture because we already have the solutions we need. Renewables are vastly cleaner, more climate-friendly, and less expensive than fossil fuels combined with carbon capture.

Researchers have broadly concluded that 100% renewable electricity in the U.S. is not only feasible, but also comparable to or cheaper than our current grid. A 2025 study found that the cost of electricity with 100% renewables would be nearly half the cost in the “business as usual” fossil fuel scenario.

Subsidies for carbon capture would only make a fossil-fueled future even more expensive. Under 45Q, capturing every single U.S. CO2 emission at the source would cost us $3.4-4.8 trillion over the 12 years that projects can claim the credit.

The carbon capture industry — including fossil fuel corporations — is banging on the doors of Congress, demanding even more support for carbon capture. Along with more tax incentives, they also want to fast-track dangerous carbon pipelines and other carbon capture infrastructure.

The industry’s history of fraud, waste, abuse, and resounding failure should be a blaring alarm. We should not be giving carbon capture and fossil fuel companies even more subsidies for a technology that will hurt the climate. And we definitely shouldn’t be doing it at the expense of supporting real climate solutions like renewables.

Congress must change course on 45Q, end CCS subsidies, ban the buildout of CCS infrastructure, and invest in our 100% renewable future.",https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Pollution-Money-1024x427.png,N,,2025-11-05 12:12:19.608985

HAGA, Japan (Reuters) -Honda Motor said on Thursday it is developing a platform centred on mid-size hybrid cars and a hybrid system for large vehicles, as the Japanese automaker seeks to boost competitiveness amid a slower shift to fully electric cars.

The new platform, to be deployed in vehicles from 2027 or later, will be designed for hybrids but can also accommodate petrol-only models. Honda said the platform will be about 90 kg (200 lb) lighter than current designs.

Japan's second-biggest automaker after Toyota has stepped up efforts to grow in the U.S. as it faces intense competition in China and other markets, while also grappling with import tariffs and pricing pressure in North America.

The automaker aims to have more than 60% of parts shared across different models using the platform and adopt a modular architecture, aiming to cut costs and speed up development. It said the changes will improve driving stability and handling.

Honda will position batteries on the platform around the centre of vehicles instead of at the rear, and adjust load-bearing for different vehicle weights using fewer unique parts.

The company also unveiled a prototype large-size hybrid system it is considering for models in the D-segment or larger by 2030, potentially targeting the North American market where demand for bigger vehicles remains robust. D-segment models are mid- to large-size cars.

Honda said it aims to boost fuel efficiency by more than 30% compared with similar petrol models, while improving acceleration and towing capacity for objects such as boats and trailers.

The unveiling comes after Honda said in May it plans to launch 13 next-generation hybrid models globally in the four years from 2027.

evening that seeks to bring down home energy bills both immediately and in the long term for residents, while holding large utility corporations accountable.

“Families across the state are struggling to make ends meet, and federal actions like Trump’s budget bill have done nothing but raise prices and cut jobs. We aren’t going to sit idly by while Illinoisans are forced to choose between turning their lights on and feeding their families—we’re going to offer solutions,” said Avelar.

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket. Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further—resulting in $9.5 billion in increased state energy costs. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) puts Illinois on better footing to counteract rising energy prices by tapping into:

● Capturing clean energy: By capturing and redistributing energy already being produced, including from home solar panels, Ameren and ComEd customers can see immediate relief on monthly costs.

● Increasing battery storage: By building out our grid to increase the state’s battery storage, power systems will become more reliable and affordable to power millions of Illinois homes.

● Investing in energy efficiency programs: Senate Bill 25 directly expands energy efficiency programs for residents, lowering electricity prices by reducing overall demand, and improves equity in programs by allocating a minimum amount of funds to support low-income customers.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill— including over 50,000 lost manufacturing jobs in Illinois. As

utility demands increase during the fall and winter months, Senate Bill 25 will play a significant role in meeting the state’s energy needs, strengthening reliability and helping manage untenable

costs for customers for both short- and long-term relief.

“The hard-working citizens that the Trump administration promised to support are the ones who are suffering. But Illinois is stepping up for our communities,” said Avelar. “This bill is crucial to support not only our residents and families but for our seniors on fixed incomes. Utilities are not, and should never, be a luxury for the working class.”",,N,,2025-11-05 11:01:18.027099

Cold Creek facility will generate 430 MW of clean energy for the Texas grid

Bechtel, a global leader in engineering, construction, and project management, has been selected by Doral Renewables to design and build the Cold Creek Solar+Storage project in Schleicher and Tom Green counties, Texas.

The facility is expected to generate approximately 430 megawatts (MW) of clean energy using more than 850,000 solar modules. The Cold Creek project will also feature a 340 megawatt-hour (MWh) battery energy storage system to capture and store excess energy generated during the day and deliver it to the Texas electricity grid when consumer demand peaks.

“The Cold Creek project highlights the power of an all-of-the-above energy strategy,” said Scott Austin, Bechtel General Manager of Renewables & Clean Power. “Texas continues to lead the nation in blending traditional and renewable resources to strengthen its grid. By combining 430 MW of solar generation with 340 MWh of storage, Cold Creek will make the Texas grid stronger and more reliable for years to come. We are proud to bring Bechtel’s experience to this important project and support Doral Renewables’ mission to deliver reliable, homegrown power to Texas.”

“The Cold Creek project is a major milestone for our company’s growth,”said Jason Van Deusen, Doral Renewables VP of Project Management.“We are thrilled to extend our partnership with Bechtel. The strong relationship forged between the two organizations through collaboration, transparency, and shared values of community engagement, local workforce participation, safety, quality, and environmental stewardship has set the stage for continued success. We are excited to continue this momentum as we embark on another significant project and contribute to the vision of a diverse energy portfolio and resilient grid in America.”

Key highlights of the project include:

Bechtel will provide engineering, procurement, and construction services for the solar and storage facilities across the two counties, which will deliver power to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas grid.

At peak construction, the Cold Creek project is expected to create more than 500 jobs, offering training opportunities and stimulating economic activity that will benefit the regional economy and surrounding communities.

Engineering is already underway, with commercial operations expected to begin in 2028.

Bechtel is building three key phases of the Mammoth Solar program in Indiana for Doral Renewables.

Cold Creek is Bechtel’s second project with Doral Renewables and its fifth utility-scale solar facility in Texas. Across the United States, Bechtel has a robust and growing renewables portfolio at various stages of development and delivery.

Executive orders and new regulations from the US president, many diametrically opposed to the core values of sustainable investors (diversity and inclusion, equality, the need to combat climate change), have been coming thick and fast. This has affected the prospects for renewables and the energy transition to a much lower carbon economy over the next three to five years.

The biggest impact comes from the reversal, or the abrupt curtailing, of many renewable tax incentives for wind, solar, electric vehicles and green hydrogen which were included in Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). A combination of executive orders as well as the so called One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) – signed into law on 4th July 2025 – have been used to do this.

There will be an accelerated phase out of key tax credits, with solar and wind projects needing to be in service by the end of 2027, rather than 2032 previously. However, projects that begin construction within one year of the OBBBA’s enactment will qualify so long as they are in service by 2030 and show evidence of continuous construction.

The market has punished renewable energy stocks since President Trump won the election in late 2024, but the final bill is considered to be much more benign for the sector than the worst-case scenario many feared. The fact that projects can be completed by 2029 or 2030 and still qualify for tax credits is better than the market was expecting.

US wind favours onshore vs. offshore

We believe that the US onshore wind industry will see a significant pull forward in demand between now and 2026, where industry participants are incentivised to begin projects that qualify for the legacy tax credits and the returns on investment are highest. This is confirmed by management teams such as Vestas, who expect installation of onshore wind in the US to be strong in the next year or so. We then expect a demand lull post 2026 in the US. Demand outside the US generally remains strong over next five years and beyond.

This is unhelpful as it puts a strain on the supply chains which have to cope with super-normal demand followed by more muted demand.

Offshore wind in the US has stalled as a technology option. The Trump administration has mounted legal challenges to offshore wind projects which are planned to be built, as well as legal challenges to projects close to completion. Whilst offshore wind is likely to double in Europe in the coming years, it’s not a viable technology in the US at present given the position of the US administration.

Renewable energy remains economically competitive over the longer term

If we instead look at the prospects for renewables over a longer-term horizon, given these subsidies won’t be a factor in the US beyond 2030, the economic viability of renewable energy remains very compelling.

The relative economics of different electricity generation technologies is often measured by working out the levelized cost of energy (LCOE). This includes the cost of building, funding and operating that generation type over the life of the asset and is measured in a cost per unit of energy produced ($/MWh). The most cost competitive technology has the lowest LCOE and the most expensive form of electricity generation has the highest LCOE.

Even after the complete removal of the tax credits, wind and solar are still economically competitive versus all other generation types. So there is a future for them in the US but the economics for developers and operators will be lower, while industrial consumers of this electricity will likely pay more.

Solar underpinned by data centre demand

If we consider solar energy in greater detail, this sector is likely to benefit from huge demand from developers of data centres. There is 9GW of data centres currently under construction and with capital expenditure in this area elevated, the demand for electricity to power data centres used to house AI architectures is expected to remain elevated as well.

Owners and operators of these data centres want three main things from their electricity supplies: power delivered soon, available all the time, and with low carbon impact.

No single energy source ticks all these boxes without caveat, but solar is the clearest winner on these metrics – it can be constructed quickly and is cost competitive. When storage is added the cost is higher, but these customers are less price sensitive.

We therefore expect solar to see a lot of demand growth in the next five years from the AI-led build out.

If we look at the hyper-scalers in Amazon, Microsoft, Google, Meta, Oracle and Apple, they are expected to spend more than $2 trillion on data centre capex between 2025-2030. To put this into context, according to Bloomberg, AI and data centre power demand will increase from 4.4% of US power demand to 17% by 2030.

Despite all the negative press around renewables in the US, growth rates for the solar industry in the US are set to accelerate, providing an attractive backdrop for these companies.

Conclusion and investment impacts

Trump’s bonfire of green taxes has had a very negative effect on the US energy transition. Supply chains will be placed under strain this year due to super-normal demand from renewable projects brought forward to qualify for credits before they are removed. It is then expected that renewable energy build out in the US will slow through to 2030.

While the outright energy winners are areas retaining the previous tax incentives – like exploration and production of fossil fuels – which we don’t invest behind, there are still sustainable options such as utility scale solar and battery storage whose attractions are largely unaffected by recent legislation.

Importantly, the removal of tax subsidies is less aggressive than originally feared and the longer-term economics underpinning growth in renewables demand remain intact.

Even without subsidies, wind and solar projects are still viable and will inevitably provide much of the new electricity to meet rising demand for electricity in the US. Renewables in the US are down as a result of Trump’s actions but are far from out.

KEY RISKS

Past performance does not predict future returns. You may get back less than you originally invested.

We recommend this fund is held long term (minimum period of 5 years). We recommend that you hold this fund as part of a diversified portfolio of investments.

The Funds managed by the Sustainable Investment team:

Are expected to conform to our social and environmental criteria.

May hold overseas investments that may carry a higher currency risk. They are valued by reference to their local currency which may move up or down when compared to the currency of a Fund.

May hold Bonds. Bonds are affected by changes in interest rates and their value and the income they generate can rise or fall as a result; The creditworthiness of a bond issuer may also affect that bond's value. Bonds that produce a higher level of income usually also carry greater risk as such bond issuers may have difficulty in paying their debts. The value of a bond would be significantly affected if the issuer either refused to pay or was unable to pay.

May encounter liquidity constraints from time to time. The spread between the price you buy and sell shares will reflect the less liquid nature of the underlying holdings.

May invest in smaller companies and may invest a small proportion (less than 10%) of the Fund in unlisted securities. There may be liquidity constraints in these securities from time to time, i.e. in certain circumstances, the fund may not be able to sell a position for full value or at all in the short term. This may affect performance and could cause the fund to defer or suspend redemptions of its shares. May invest in companies listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM) which is primarily for emerging or smaller companies. The rules are less demanding than those of the official List of the London Stock Exchange and therefore companies listed on AIM may carry a greater risk than a company with a full listing.

May, under certain circumstances, invest in derivatives, but it is not intended that their use will materially affect volatility. Derivatives are used to protect against currencies, credit and interest rate moves or for investment purposes. There is a risk that losses could be made on derivative positions or that the counterparties could fail to complete on transactions. The use of derivatives may create leverage or gearing resulting in potentially greater volatility or fluctuations in the net asset value of the Fund. A relatively small movement in the value of a derivative's underlying investment may have a larger impact, positive or negative, on the value of a fund than if the underlying investment was held instead. The use of derivative instruments that may result in higher cash levels. Cash may be deposited with several credit counterparties (e.g. international banks) or in short-dated bonds. A credit risk arises should one or more of these counterparties be unable to return the deposited cash.

Do not guarantee a level of income.

The risks detailed above are reflective of the full range of Funds managed by the Sustainable Investment team and not all of the risks listed are applicable to each individual Fund. For the risks associated with an individual Fund, please refer to its Key Investor Information Document (KIID)/PRIIP KID.

,EVs,2025-11-05 15:01:43+00:00,electrive.com,CAM study shows electric cars to see significant growth in 2025,"Chris Randall, Image: CAM",,,,,https://www.electrive.com/2025/11/05/cam-study-shows-electric-cars-to-see-significant-growth-in-2025/,"This category includes pure electric vehicles, but also electric vehicles with range extenders and cars with plug-in hybrid drives.
In second place, with 3.44 million units, are plug-in hybrids, which also include REEVs (Range Extended Electric Vehicles).
The government’s decision to remove electric cars from the list of strategic industries and thus no longer promote them as strongly therefore makes perfect sense.
In 2024, only 269,931 new electric cars were registered on the island in the first nine months.
A total of 600,000 electric cars and plug-in hybrids were registered – an increase of 46.6 per cent.","Internationally, e-mobility has been experiencing a considerable upswing so far this year. This is shown by the latest ‘Electromobility Report’ from the Centre of Automotive Management (CAM) in Bergisch Gladbach, Germany. In the world regions most important to the automotive industry, namely China, Europe and the USA, approximately 12.8 million highly electrified vehicles were sold between the beginning of January and the end of September. In addition to battery-electric cars, this also includes plug-in hybrids. This represents growth of around 30 per cent compared to the same period last year.

NEVs dominate in China

This development continues to be driven primarily by the Chinese market. In the first three quarters, a total of 8.89 million so-called NEVs, short for New Energy Vehicles, were registered in the People’s Republic. This category includes pure electric vehicles, but also electric vehicles with range extenders and cars with plug-in hybrid drives. BEVs clearly dominate with 5.45 million units. In second place, with 3.44 million units, are plug-in hybrids, which also include REEVs (Range Extended Electric Vehicles).

Overall, NEVs achieved a market share of 52.4 per cent during this period, compared to 45.3 per cent in the first three quarters of last year. The development of pure electric cars is particularly encouraging, with growth of 32 per cent and a market share of 32.1 per cent, separate from plug-in hybrids. In the same period last year, the figure was 26.2 per cent. Externally chargeable hybrids, on the other hand, are growing at a much slower pace, with an increase of only 14 per cent.

Pure BEVs are therefore playing an increasingly dominant role in China. In addition, most of these are already being produced by domestic manufacturers. The government’s decision to remove electric cars from the list of strategic industries and thus no longer promote them as strongly therefore makes perfect sense.

A certain degree of consolidation can already be observed in the local market: 70 per cent of new registrations are accounted for by the ten best-selling car companies – led by BYD with a market share of 14.2 per cent. In contrast, 93 of the 169 car manufacturers active in China have a market share of less than 0.1 per cent, which means they are likely to sink into insignificance in the long term.

Although the Volkswagen Group still ranks second in terms of total sales in China, the German automaker’s electric models are not particularly popular in the Middle Kingdom. While battery-electric drives are clearly on the rise, the Wolfsburg-based company, including the Group brands available in China, has seen a 51.3 per cent decline in NEV registrations. While BYD has a market share of 28.7 per cent in this category and Geely has 12.3 per cent, the former number one in China is far behind with 0.9 per cent.

Europe remains the second most important market

While the overall market in Europe is stagnating, strong growth in electrification is also evident here. In the first nine months of this year, 2.72 million highly electrified passenger cars were newly registered across all countries. Compared to the first quarter of 2024, this represents an increase of 27.7 per cent. The market share of pure electric cars and plug-in hybrids is 27.4 per cent. This means that Europe remains the second-largest market for BEVs and PHEVs after China.

Even if plug-in hybrids are excluded, the picture for e-mobility in Europe is encouraging. Vehicles with purely electric drives recorded growth of 24 per cent in the first three quarters of the year. However, BEV sales are anything but evenly distributed across the continent. While battery electric vehicles account for very high shares well above the 30 per cent mark in the Scandinavian countries, and this type of drive is already well established in Central and Western Europe, it still has a niche existence in other regions such as Eastern Europe and the Balkans.

The three largest European markets also present a far from homogeneous picture. In France, new EV registrations fell by nine per cent from 316,000 last year to 289,000. However, this is mainly due to the declining popularity of plug-in hybrids, with sales of purely electric vehicles remaining stable at 216,000. The BEV market share is 24 per cent, down from 25 per cent in the first few months of 2024. One of the reasons for the slowdown is that the French government has tightened the criteria for subsidies.

In the UK, on the other hand, e-mobility is on the rise. A total of around 522,000 BEVs and PHEVs were registered, representing an increase of around 32 per cent over the previous year. The market share of highly electrified vehicles thus rose from 26 to 33 per cent. Pure electric cars account for the lion’s share of this, with 349,414 units. In 2024, only 269,931 new electric cars were registered on the island in the first nine months. This growth is mainly driven by a significantly expanded range of models, lower prices and various government and municipal support measures relating to charging infrastructure and vehicle fleets.

After a weak 2024, e-mobility is achieving the strongest growth of the three countries in Germany this year. A total of 600,000 electric cars and plug-in hybrids were registered – an increase of 46.6 per cent. The market share of the two electrified drive types is 28 per cent, compared to 19 per cent in the same period last year. Pure BEVs accounted for 382,000 units. CAM attributes the positive figures on the domestic market primarily to manufacturers’ electric model offensives, shorter delivery times and increasing acceptance of this drive type in company fleets.

“In Europe, despite strong growth in 2025, the ramp-up of electric mobility is in a critical transition phase with uneven development. The current discussion surrounding the increasingly ideological debate about a possible softening of the so-called ‘2035 combustion engine ban’ is causing considerable uncertainty among consumers and is hampering the rapid market ramp-up necessary for scaling,” summarised Stefan Bratzel, founder and director of CAM.

The US market is developing much more slowly

The renaissance of the electric car was kicked off by Tesla in the US, but compared to Europe and China, growth there has been modest this year. New registrations of electric cars and plug-in hybrids rose by only eight per cent to 1.22 million vehicles between the beginning of January and the end of September. This put the market share at 10 per cent in the first three quarters. In the same period last year, it was 9.7 per cent. For purely electric vehicles, it rose from 8.0 to 8.2 per cent.

After the tax credits for electric cars expired on 1 October, there was another rush for battery-powered vehicles in September. A decline is expected in the fourth quarter due to the significantly worsened market conditions under the Trump administration.

Geely posts 90 per cent BEV growth

Not only in China itself, but also globally, the BEV market is shifting in favour of Chinese manufacturers. BYD had already overtaken Tesla as the world’s largest electric car manufacturer. In the first three quarters, the group increased its deliveries by 37 per cent to 1.61 million vehicles. The share of BEVs in total sales grew from 43 to 56 per cent. Geely even increased by almost 90 per cent to 943,000 BEVs. Tesla, on the other hand, lost ground slightly, with deliveries falling by 5.9 per cent to 1.22 million vehicles.

While things are going downhill in China, the outlook for German carmakers is somewhat better globally. The Volkswagen Group increased its worldwide electric car sales by 42 per cent to 717,500 vehicles, mainly due to high popularity in the European market. BMW’s BEV business grew moderately by 10 per cent to 323,000 cars, while Mercedes-Benz remained slightly below the previous year’s level with 118,000 units, representing a one per cent decline. The Stuttgart-based company’s market share declined modestly to 8 per cent.

“Duke is one of a very few Ph.D. programs that offers an interdisciplinary approach to integrate policy, economics and energy. And the opportunity to work with faculty member Dalia (Patino-Echeverri) was the perfect fit,” he said.

His research at Duke grew out of North Carolina’s carbon planning process, where he was involved in a pivotal research question: how quickly solar projects could be connected to the grid. Norris began studying how interconnection policies shape the pace of renewable deployment, an inquiry that quickly expanded nationwide.

In 2023, he co-authored a white paper on rethinking interconnection and load growth, just as artificial intelligence and data centers began driving massive new electricity demand.

“By early 2024, it was clear that something very different was happening,” Norris said. “Large load growth was reshaping energy planning, and that this was going to have very significant implications for the power system.”

Through the Nicholas Institute for Energy, Environment & Sustainability and with faculty member Tim Profeta, Norris was involved in a Duke convening focused on large load growth. That event led directly to the groundbreaking paper — the most downloaded in the institute’s history.

The paper proposed a paradigm shift: planning the grid around flexible loads, such as data centers that can adjust electricity consumption in response to system needs.

“We’ve never planned the system this way before,” Norris explained. “But flexibility could help maintain reliability, control costs and reduce emissions.”

Regulators, utilities and companies across the country have taken notice. Norris testified on the research before the U.S. House Energy subcommittee of the Committee on Energy and Commerce. “Organizations are now exploring proposals for large-load demand response programs. California has begun scaling similar programs from the distribution level to the transmission grid,” Norris said.

A Bipartisan Path Forward

The idea has found support across political lines.

“The full U.S. House passed an appropriations bill calling on the Department of Energy to study large-load flexibility alongside FERC, national labs and universities,” Norris noted. “It’s been gratifying to see that this has maintained a bipartisan posture.”

The paper’s influence, coupled with Norris’s clear-eyed optimism, caught the attention of policymakers, academics and industry leaders. Google offered him a role developing new approaches to clean energy deployment; he begins this month while finishing his Ph.D.

For Norris, the experience underscores the power of entrepreneurship and innovation. “Sometimes it’s helpful to come in with a fresh, independent perspective and apply first principles thinking,” he reflected. “If you’re too deep inside an existing system, it can be hard to imagine doing things differently.”

What started as a Ph.D. research project is now influencing national energy policy and industry practice.

“Honestly,” he said, “I was shocked that no one had done this analysis before. It can be easy to get intimidated by the complexity of an issue, and you might have imposter syndrome, because you think you’re not a deep expert. But I think there’s so much value in bringing fresh perspectives and looking at a problem from the bottom up and trying to think about a different type of solution.”",https://today.duke.edu/sites/default/files/styles/1200_x_630px/public/2025-11/Norris%20DT.png?itok=Ie9byUBy,N,,2025-11-05 12:13:40.107171

Good morning everyone.

It’s a pleasure to be here although I have spent the past 15 months as Energy Minister reading Cornwall Insight’s insights and it is therefore with some trepidation I step into the breach to speak to you.

But now is a good time to be talking about energy.

Your insights often focus not just on what is changing in our energy system, but on why it matters.

Not just taking the pulse of energy in the UK, but turning that into foresight.

And there has surely not been a time in recent memory when energy is such an active topic of conversation, not just among us nerds, but in the press, and the public discourse, and yes, on social media too – although I would discourage you from reading the variety of offensive replies I get almost every day.

Energy matters.

Not just energy bills, energy shocks, but some of the more technical stuff once found only in the pages of industry journals.

The future of our energy mix, the transmission network, long duration energy storage, energy jobs, our North Sea, the current focus on energy points to a wider truth.

As a country we are at a fork in the road, and face some major decisions about our future.

The system that has powered our homes and businesses, kept the lights on, underpinned the fabric of everyday life, was constructed, both physically and ideologically, in the 20th century.

And it is not working for working people as it once did, not just because the infrastructure is ageing, but because, ideologically, the idea that we can have energy security while dependent on fossil fuels whose prices are set globally has come crashing down.

We need an energy system for this new era of global insecurity.

But we face choices, huge choices, about how we get there.

There are 2 paths ahead of us.

Frequently in our political discourse today is the yellow brick road of the easy answer. The mirage of nostalgia, prolonging the status quo a little longer. And we all know where that road leads – to stagnation, managed decline, and never tackling the deep rooted, complex challenges that hold our country back.

And, on the other hand, the hard work of renewal – accepting the reality that there are no easy answers, or quick fixes, and that the status quo isn’t working, and hasn’t been for far too long.

And this choice applies to the 3 fundamental questions I face as energy minister, which I am going to talk to you about today.

Where will our energy come from?

How will we get it to where it’s needed?

And how will we take the country with us as we transition to a 21st century energy system?

Where will our energy come from?

Let me start with the first one.

Not just because ‘where will our energy come from’ is a fairly fundamental question for the Minister for Energy, but because it is critical for the future of our country.

For a very, very long time most people on these islands haven’t thought very much about what happens when they flick on the light switch. Electrons flow, the system responds.

But in truth, behind the curtain, the system is struggling as a result of decades of underinvestment and a lack of strategic planning. Neglect. Decline.

We are still heavily reliant on gas, and yet half our existing fleet of gas plants is more than 20 years old with many approaching retirement in less than 10 years.

The year before I was born was the last time a UK government took a decision to build a new nuclear power station that is currently generating electricity – 1987.

We haven’t brought a new nuclear power station onto the system since I started primary school.

Our transmission system is creaking under the weight of demand it cannot meet and the failure to invest over decades.

Now some – those seekers of the easy answer – would suggest we simply generate more electricity with gas, and worry about the threat of climate change another time.

They compare the wholesale cost of gas without any of the capital costs of construction with the total cost of building new renewable generation and hope nobody notices the difference.

But in truth, our ageing gas fleet means that we would need to rebuild a new, more expensive version of our existing power system and impose the costs onto consumers, while leaving us more exposed than ever to the global price of fossil fuels, over which we have no control.

Showing that we have learned nothing from the hardship people up and down the country have suffered since the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Without taking a penny off our bills, we would be turning our back on every climate commitment that a succession of governments of all parties have made over the last 20 years. Abandoning our children and grandchildren, who will have to face the effects of the climate crisis, and swimming against the unstoppable global tide, where $2 trillion is now being invested in clean energy each year - twice as much as fossil fuels.

The path of decline, stagnation, easy answers.

But our answer is a different plan.

Homegrown clean power.

Solar and wind power are substantially cheaper to install and run than new gas.

And supported by nuclear, storage and other technologies, our clean power system will:

reduce our exposure as a country to fossil fuel price hikes

help us to take back control of our energy

cut our bills by reducing the wholesale costs of electricity

protect our way of life for future generations by tackling the climate crisis, and

push Britain to the front of the global race to clean power, so that we can seize the jobs and opportunities of the future

That is why we have been sprinting to achieve clean power.

Deploying renewables at a scale that will push gas off as the price setter and bring down bills – in the first 15 months approving enough projects to power 7.5 million homes.

Investing in the biggest nuclear building programme in half a century, and making sure the UK is at the forefront of new nuclear technology.

Establishing our first publicly owned energy champion in 70 years in Great British Energy

And kickstart our hydrogen and carbon capture industries across the country.

And we are just getting started.

How will we get our energy to where it’s needed?

But this leads me to the second question.

How do we get this power to where it’s needed?

Here we inherited a familiar tale of ambition turned to stagnation.

Much of our electricity grid was built in the 1960s and hasn’t been upgraded since.

The National Grid was the first of its kind in the world, a product of 20th century big government through ambitious intervention, building things to improve people’s lives. A spirit that has been replaced by a shrug of the shoulders and blinkered short-termism.

But we can’t afford to be short-termist as a country any longer.

We have arrived at the age of electric vehicles, data centres and artificial intelligence, and a demand for electricity demand that is expected to more than double by 2050.

Do we take the easy road?

Patch up what we have, hope it lasts to the next election and leave it to someone else to sort?

If we do, then consumers will need to help pay up to £4 billion in constraint payments by 2030.

If we do we will fail to meet the economic growth opportunities coming our way in the years ahead.

We’ll fail to keep up with the coming electricity demand.

So, we are taking the second road.

We choose to build, reform, innovate and invest.

We have ended the first come first serve grid connections queue.

We have introduced the biggest reform of planning in a generation.

And we know that the way the electricity market works needed to change.

That is why, this summer, we announced a new Reformed National Pricing Programme which, along with the upcoming Strategic Spatial Energy Plan, will allow us to reform our power market and build a power system based on centralised, strategic, big-picture planning, instead of slow and uncoordinated fragmentation.

So that new energy sources are built where they’re needed most, and as the power grid grows, it will keep up with the energy we’ll need and send it where it needs to go.

This is how we will deliver security, prevent volatility, cut constraint payments for consumers, encourage investment, and build a network for the 21st century.

How will we take the country with us?

For any of this to work, however, we need to take people with us.

How we do that is the third question.

We as a country are still coming to terms with the consequences of sudden change that happens to communities, rather than for them, and with them.

Deindustrialisation has left its scars, and they run deep across our old industrial heartlands.

So let me make one point abundantly clear.

If we accept that a historic moment of industrial change is needed, then the lessons from the past must be learned. We must build a Britain for the British people.

Take the North Sea. The oil and gas workers there have helped to power our country and the world for more than half a century and will continue to do so for decades to come, with oil and gas retaining an important role within our energy system.

But we cannot accept the status quo, barely managed decline of the last decade, which has seen more than a third of jobs in this industry lost and other countries getting ahead in the technologies that should be safeguarding our energy future.

If we want to create new good jobs and revitalise our industrial regions, then we must build on their legacy and the expertise of these workers to make Britain a world-leading centre of clean energy.

The momentum is with us.

According to the CBI, the net zero sector is now growing 3 times faster than the overall UK economy.

And employment in clean energy sectors is up 10%, with those jobs paying 15% higher than average.

I’ve been lucky enough to see what that means in reality, up and down the country, from the proud offshore workers in Scotland and the North East of England, pursuing new opportunities in new industries, to the new nuclear projects from Suffolk to Hartlepool, launching fantastic careers for young people right at the forefront of energy innovation, without having to move hundreds of miles from home.

This is the second path, the path to a brighter future, in action.

And last week, we published our Clean Energy Jobs Plan, showcasing not just the hundreds of thousands of good jobs that you in the room here today and others are already supporting in this sector, but the jobs of the future, as we aim to almost triple the number in Scotland, double the number in Wales, Northern Ireland and almost every region of England, and reach 860,000 clean energy jobs by the end of the decade.

Conclusion

Sometimes, amidst the comments, the headlines, the sound and the fury of the debates around what our energy future should look like, we forget that we all want the same thing - a modern energy system that can make our lives better.

So, the 2 paths I set out today are not divided by intention, they are separated by their levels of ambition.

The ambition we are offering is huge. It will be hard. It is hard.

But the role of government is to do hard things.

Perhaps after years of stagnation, we have forgotten that.

But this government has a mission to seize the opportunities of clean energy, and we will do the difficult things to achieve it.

Let me leave you with this, for those who doubt whether we can achieve our mission.

A few weeks ago, if you happened to be awake at 3:30am and turned the light on to find your phone or check on the kids, then you were making use of the first 100% low-carbon electricity this country has ever had.

For 1 hour we were generating enough from renewables, nuclear, and biomass alone to meet our entire national electricity demand.

The first time, but not the last.

If we all work together, we can get there.

And we can write the next chapter in this country’s proud energy history.

But only if we marry action with ambition, and take the road that goes forward, not backwards, to a fairer, more secure, more prosperous future.

Thank you.",https://www.gov.uk/assets/frontend/govuk-opengraph-image-4196a4d6333cf92aaf720047f56cfd91b3532d7635fc21ebcf0d5897df6b5f77.png,N,,2025-11-05 12:11:33.153256

In 2021, when Taiwan faced its worst drought in 56 years, the world confronted an uncomfortable reality: the chips powering our phones, cars, and satellites rely on a resource that nature no longer guarantees—water.

This vulnerability stands in stark contrast to the industry’s origins. In the 1980s, amid Taiwan’s declining chemical sector, Morris Chang was invited to return to Asia to lead a critical project that would lay the foundation for the semiconductor industry. In 1987, he founded the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC). Today, Taiwan’s economy is at the epicentre of the global semiconductor industry, with the sector valued at $165.6 billion in 2024. One key factor in its success lies in the pure-play foundry model, which is manufacturing chips for clients rather than designing its own.

TSMC’s manufacturing success comes at an ecological cost. The company accounts for around 150,000 tonnes of water per day and 6.4% of the national electricity consumption. With the challenges posed by climate change, experts are raising concerns about its impact on water scarcity. This intensity brings us to the water-energy nexus, where water and energy are interdependent. In essence, the semiconductor industry demands enormous volumes of water to generate energy, while its water supply also depends on a constant energy source. This situation thus raises a question: can TSMC continue to dominate the industry while ensuring sustainable water usage?

The Water-Energy Nexus in TSMC

In semiconductor fabs, water is an equally crucial resource for cleaning wafers, thin, flat slices of silicon that serve as the foundation for microchip fabrication. They depend on each other: water is extensively used to cool machines and clean semiconductors, while electricity powers the systems that circulate water, purify it, and generate energy from it.

96.6% of water used in semiconductor manufacturing comes from natural freshwater sources, while only 3.2% is recycled. In other words, most of the water is used once and discharged, rather than being continuously reused. Meanwhile, roughly 84% of the electricity powering fabs still originates from fossil fuels, linking chip production to both carbon emissions and hydrological stress. At TSMC, this interdependence is intensified by its pure-play foundry model: as global demand for technology rises, so does the pressure on Taiwan’s limited water and energy resources.

The 2021 drought made this tension visible. With fewer typhoons and irregular rainfall, reservoirs supplying Hsinchu Science Park—the heart of Taiwan’s semiconductor cluster—fell to historic lows. Scientists also attributed the shortage to rising temperatures.

Progress and Barriers Toward Sustainability

To address these vulnerabilities, TSMC has invested heavily in advanced water management. In 2022, the company launched the Southern Taiwan Science Park (STSP) Reclaimed Water Plant, which converts treated wastewater into an industrial-grade supply. By 2026, this facility is expected to support up to 36,000 tonnes of reclaimed water daily, enough to meet 60% of the company’s local demand by 2030. While this marks significant progress, it also underscores how dependent fabs remain on external water sources. Yet even this success leaves a 40% reliance on traditional reservoirs—a vulnerable reliance as Taiwan faces longer dry seasons and fewer typhoons.

In 2024, TSMC introduced the Ammonia Nitrogen Wastewater Diversion and Processing Inspection System. This system sorts wastewater based on ammonia nitrogen levels, sending low-concentration water to biological treatment and high-concentration water to a degassing membrane process. At Fab 20 Phase 1, this has already resulted in a 40% reduction in discharged wastewater conductivity and a 30% cut in chemical reagent use. These advances show that incremental innovation can reduce harm. But they also show the scale of the problem, that is, the sector’s overall expansion outpaces each fab’s progress. Beyond Taiwan, TSMC’s 15-acre Industrial Water Reclamation Plant at its manufacturing complex in Phoenix, Arizona—scheduled to begin operations by 2028—illustrates how the water-energy dilemma follows the industry. Located in the drought-stricken Colorado River Basin, the facility aims to recycle nearly all on-site water, positioning it as a model for adaptation in arid environments.

While the semiconductor industry has made progress toward sustainability, there is still a gap between adopting clean energy and fully integrating it across all operations. Many existing manufacturing facilities need major upgrades to handle renewable energy, which comes with high upfront costs. For example, TSMC’s new expansion in Arizona has led to higher construction costs and the need for specialised worker training. As these structural challenges intensify, the focus shifts from technological capability to governance, encompassing institutional frameworks, policy alignment, and regulatory coordination necessary to support a sustainable industrial transition.

Renewable energy itself also has challenges. Solar and wind power are variable, and semiconductor fabs need a steady, reliable supply of electricity. Even though solar energy is growing rapidly worldwide, the International Energy Agency recently lowered its global renewable power capacity forecast by 248 gigawatts to 4,600 GW by 2030, mainly due to policy changes in the U.S. and China. This shows how difficult it can be to ensure a consistent and sufficient energy supply.

The global semiconductor supply chain adds another layer of complexity. Implementing clean energy across the entire supply chain is challenging. Even though global chipmakers like TSMC, Intel, and Samsung pledge to power operations with 100% renewable energy, these targets may not be reached until 2030 or later. The path remains steep. Semiconductor manufacturing remains highly resource-intensive, with fabs now requiring costly retrofits. Global electricity demand for chip production is expected to reach 237 terawatt-hours by 2030, contributing to rising greenhouse gas emissions.

Can Growth and Sustainability Coexist?

TSMC’s efforts show that technological solutions can ease the strain, but they do not erase the underlying vulnerability. Water recycling plants, wastewater innovations, and overseas facilities may reduce pressure, yet their sustainability strategy cannot fully insulate them from ecological volatility. At the same time, the slow pace of renewable integration and the high demands of chip manufacturing mean that sustainability depends on more than corporate initiatives — it ultimately depends on national infrastructure reform, regional cooperation, and diversified energy sourcing.

In the long run, TSMC’s ability to dominate the industry will depend on its capacity to achieve sustainable water and energy management. Without deeper structural reform in these systems, its long-term leadership may be undermined by the very resources it consumes.

SCOTUS Quick Hits

The justices will hear argument today in Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump, on whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act authorizes the president to impose tariffs.

SCOTUSblog is hosting a live blog during today’s oral arguments starting at 9:30 a.m. EST. The live blog will be shared on C-SPAN, Amy Howe appeared on that network earlier this morning, and Zachary Shemtob will be interviewed on C-SPAN after the arguments have ended.

Also after the tariffs argument, the Advisory Opinions podcast will be available on SCOTUSblog. Host Sarah Isgur will be joined by Amy, David French, Roman Martinez, and David Lat.

Additional briefs in Trump v. Illinois, on Trump’s authority to federalize and deploy the National Guard in Illinois, are due by Monday, Nov. 10.

There have been a great deal of questions about whether, given the government shutdown, the public is able to attend oral arguments. On its website, the court states that “[s]eating for the oral argument session will be provided to the public, members of the Supreme Court Bar, and press.”

Morning Reads

Trump Tariffs Fate Rides on Supreme Court Justices He Picked (Greg Stohr, Bloomberg)(Paywall) — Justices Neil Gorsuch, Brett Kavanaugh, and Amy Coney Barrett, who were all appointed to the Supreme Court by President Donald Trump, “will play pivotal roles as the court considers the fate of his signature global tariffs Wednesday,” according to Bloomberg. “[T]o varying degrees, the Trump appointees have hinted that they aren’t sure bets to back him as he seeks unprecedented authority to levy tariffs in the name of addressing national emergencies.”

Trump’s not going to the Supreme Court hearing on tariffs. But his treasury secretary will be there (Fatima Hussein, Associated Press) — While Trump won’t be at today’s oral arguments, one of his top economic advisers will be. U.S. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said on Monday that he will “hopefully [be] in the front row and … have a ringside seat” for the discussion, according to the Associated Press. “I am there to emphasize that this is an economic emergency,” Bessent said.

Texas county book ban could go to SCOTUS (Asher Price, Axios) — Four years ago, officials in Llano County, Texas, “ordered 17 books removed from libraries after conservative activists alleged they were ‘pornographic filth,'” according to Axios. That order led to a dispute between officials and a group of county residents over whether such book removals violate free speech. “A federal judge in Austin in 2023 ruled for the residents, ordering the county to return to the public library system books they removed and allow them to be checked out again.” But then in May, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit said the “removal of certain books was government speech — and not subject to free speech challenges.” The residents have asked the Supreme Court to review that decision as controversies over book bans persist nationwide.

Slur or free speech? Willamette hosts band at the center of landmark Supreme Court case (Paul McKean, Willamette University) — The rock band The Slants recently visited Willamette University to give a “lecture-performance … about Asian American identity, art, and free speech,” as well as their experience in front of the Supreme Court, according to the school’s coverage of the event. In 2017, the band was at the center of a case on free speech and trademark rights, in which the court held that the U.S. Patent and Trademark Office’s refusal to register the band’s name due to concerns about it being derogatory violated the First Amendment. “People said that we were this band that turned stereotypes upside down,” band member Simon Tam said. “We had to fight back.”

The Tariff King and the Supreme Court (The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board)(Paywall) — In a column on the tariffs case, The Wall Street Journal Editorial Board called on the court to reject the Trump administration’s claims about the president’s foreign-policy authority and embrace a much more limited view of “presidential tariff power.” “Few conservatives are more deferential to presidential overseas authority than we are,” the board wrote. “But the power of the purse still belongs to Congress and can’t simply be wished away with the words ‘foreign policy.’ Tariffs are taxes on Americans.”

A Closer Look: The Major Questions Doctrine

The major questions doctrine, a judicial principle that courts have used to scrutinize expansive claims of statutory authority by executive agencies, will likely be an important part of today’s oral arguments on Trump’s sweeping tariffs implemented under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Ultimately, in accordance with this doctrine, the court may ask: Did Congress really give the president power to make decisions of “vast economic and political significance” without explicitly saying so? As Chief Justice John Roberts put it in West Virginia v. EPA, courts should “hesitate” to greenlight “extravagant” claims of power based on (seemingly) vague statutory language.

Some scholars maintain that the major questions doctrine has been around for some time. But this doctrine arguably entered the public discourse in the 2000 case of FDA v. Brown & Williamson Tobacco Corp., where the court rejected the Food and Drug Administration’s attempt to regulate tobacco products – ruling that Congress had not granted the FDA that authority under the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act of 1938. As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote the following year when referencing the case, Congress does not “hide elephants in mouseholes,” meaning they wouldn’t delegate such broad authority through ambiguous phrases. In this way, the doctrine may act like a backstop to the Constitution’s separation of powers: Congress makes the big calls on taxes, regulations, and trade, and can’t punt those to the executive branch (or at least the executive agencies) without explicit instructions.

In early 2022, the court in a 6-3 ruling in National Federation of Independent Businesses v. OSHA stopped a vaccine-or-test mandate for large employers, reasoning that shoehorning pandemic rules into a 1970 workplace-safety law was too big a stretch. Later that year, West Virginia v. EPA weakened the Environmental Protection Agency’s regulation of coal-plant emissions, with Roberts warning that shifting the nation’s energy grid demanded more than the agency relying on an “ancillary provision” in the Clean Air Act. And in 2023’s Biden v. Nebraska, the court “ruled that the Biden administration overstepped its authority” in attempting to cancel roughly $400 billion in student loans under a higher education law, calling the scope of this “staggering” and unprecedented.

Critics of the major questions doctrine have argued that it allows judges to substitute their policy preferences for Congress’ intent, especially when what constitutes “major” feels like a moving target. As Justice Elena Kagan, dissenting in West Virginia, argued, the doctrine can be used to ignore how modern statutes often use broad terms precisely because Congress can’t manage everything. But supporters like Justice Neil Gorsuch see it as essential to “protect[ing] foundational constitutional guarantees.” And Justice Amy Coney Barrett has endorsed the major questions doctrine as an important interpretive tool.

In the tariffs fight, the Trump administration is expected to claim, among other things, that its actions were clearly authorized under IEEPA and that the doctrine doesn’t apply in the foreign policy context or to the president (as opposed to the executive agencies). But, in the view of Adam White, who recently wrote for SCOTUSblog, “In the end … arguments over the technical application of a major questions doctrine may simply be a red herring. Whether or not the court explicitly invokes the major questions doctrine by name, or if it simply undertakes its own best reading of IEEPA’s use of the term ‘regulate’ with a measure of skepticism toward Trump’s unprecedented claims of power, the sheer magnitude of power claimed by the president, and its practical effects, should give it pause.”

SCOTUS Quote

JUSTICE ALITO: Mr. Ginzburg says that all the courts — almost all the courts of appeals have decided this question against you, and the leading commentators take the opposite position. How do you account for that?

MS. BLATT: … And I think just last term you ruled against a case I argued when all the courts had gone our way.

The Other Arguments in Trump’s Tariffs Case

When the Supreme Court hears oral arguments today in the challenges to Trump’s tariffs, they will hear from three different lawyers representing small businesses, a group of 12 states, and – defending the tariffs – the Trump administration. But when they vote on the case, the justices will also have considered 44 “friend of the court” briefs filed on behalf of members of Congress, trade experts, legal scholars, think tanks founded by former Vice President Mike Pence and presidential adviser Stephen Miller, the watch industry, and a vineyard owner. The briefs cover a wide range of topics, from the impact of the tariffs to the history of trade law. Learn more about them by reading Amy’s analysis.

The Tariffs Case and Whether Amicus Briefs Matter

Erwin Chemerinsky also analyzed the amicus briefs filed in the tariffs case in his latest Courtly Observations column and highlighted what stood out to him in the filings. He noted that there were notably fewer briefs overall than in other recent high-profile cases, and that “it also was striking how many of the amicus briefs against the Trump administration were filed by conservative groups.”

This lack of distinction is only making ""sustainable business"" initiatives seem less achievable than they actually are.
The company that cried green is not just one tale of a company that lied, and the consumers who believed them; the company that cried green is a trend.","It's better to dress something down than to fake it up. Yet most of us are taught the opposite: When entering a new space, we try to fit in, play the part and meet the standard. This ""fake it until you make it"" mentality is not only harmful to ourselves but also to our physical environments, corroding the integrity of the spaces we're trying to fit into and threatening their future existence.

I'm talking about greenwashing, a term for false claims made by a company about the environmental benefits of its practices or products. Think back to the 2009 Volkswagen scandal: the company marketed its cars as ""clean diesel cars,"" while cheating emissions tests to the Environmental Protection Agency behind the scenes.

Greenwashing is worse than a company that openly prioritizes profitability over sustainability. At least that’s honest. Giants like Exxon or JPMorgan should stop pretending to be environmental champions and admit that no consumer truly favors them because of their environmental consciousness, philanthropic goals or stringent codes of ethics. It's time for these corporate companies to stop pretending to be something they're not and start owning the fact that they will never try to be anything else.

That's not to say that to be successful, a company cannot have a genuine commitment to charity; in fact, for some companies, this is a reality. Take Newman's Own, for example, a successful nonprofit organization committed to giving all profits to children's charities. If success is measured by outreach and scale, then Newman's Own surpasses those standards while meeting its humanitarian goals. Looking at this company, I have to consider the question: why aren't more companies putting ethics and success in conversation with one another?

The answer is more nuanced than you'd think. While there may exist some gaps between ethical compliance and profitability, the bigger problem lies in the culture. Between greenwashing campaigns, the implementation of ""ethical"" courses in business schools, such as the newly introduced AI and Ethics course in UMass Amherst’s Isenberg and a growing social impact crusade consuming college campuses, it's becoming increasingly challenging to differentiate truth from marketing. This lack of distinction is only making ""sustainable business"" initiatives seem less achievable than they actually are.

Ethics and charity should be chosen, not imposed. It's vital that, rather than an institutional body requiring them to, people take the first steps themselves. At the Stanford Graduate School of Business, for example, the Sustainability Strategies Program offers students the opportunity to engage with the environmental and social impacts of business practices and learn how to mitigate effects such as pollution and resource overconsumption. Here, students aren’t just learning, they’re applying. Unlike a typical lecture hall, the program is dynamic, and encourages students to develop their own sustainable initiatives for case studies and projects. Giving students the option to choose their engagement with sustainability is a wake-up call that business programs requiring sustainability credits to graduate must hear. Even if it looks good on paper, sustainability courses shouldn't be offered to students unless there is a demand for them, or else they run the risk of being treated as accessories that only work to beautify universities.

The same argument applies to social impact clubs at Cornell that are treated as niche resume boosters rather than experiences that shape long-term initiatives and goals. In both cases, groups are wielding sustainability as a mighty marketing sword, sharpened by the idea that in doing so, companies, clubs and other institutions will seem more attractive.

The company that cried green is not just one tale of a company that lied, and the consumers who believed them; the company that cried green is a trend. It's a cyclic pattern of false marketing, and diluted hope that any ethical goals — sustainability, diversity in the workplace and other charitable initiatives — will ever be supported in the long-term. Companies, whether they truly apply these goals or not, must face the fact that if nothing changes soon, one day consumers and future employees alike will stop believing them.

Experts warn that eliminating the right to file air nuisance complaints weakens Ohio’s enforcement of pollution measures at an already perilous moment for environmental regulation.
In 2020, the first Trump administration’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed Ohio’s air nuisance rule, Waggoner noted.","As of Sept. 30, Ohio lawmakers eliminated a key legal tool used to rein in air pollution from power plants and industrial sites. Now, advocates are suing to restore that right.

For decades, environmental groups in Ohio and elsewhere have used air nuisance rules in state plans as a catchall way to enforce the federal Clean Air Act. Ohio’s version let people take legal action against companies whose emissions ​“endanger the health, safety or welfare of the public, or cause unreasonable injury or damage to property.” The rule dates back more than 50 years.

Environmental groups have used air nuisance rules to file or threaten lawsuits against coal-burning power plants, iron and steel facilities, coke plants, and other industrial operations, which emit not only planet-warming greenhouse gases but also harmful pollutants like nitrogen dioxide, sulfur dioxide, and lead.

Defendants in cases brought under Ohio’s version of the rule have included Suncoke Energy, AK Steel–Middletown Works, Georgia-Pacific Corp., and Phthalchem. Consent decrees and settlements have produced orders or agreements to stop alleged nuisances, clean up waste, and expand monitoring.

But a last-minute addition to the state’s 3,156-page budget bill, House Bill 96, told the Ohio Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to cut that protection out of the state’s Clean Air Act plan.

“The air nuisance rule is the tool that Ohioans have to hold polluters accountable,” said Neil Waggoner, the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign manager for the Midwest. ​“This is the state government saying … we’re going to take this away from you in the most secretive fashion possible.”

The Sierra Club is a plaintiff in the lawsuit, along with the Ohio Environmental Council, SOBE Concerned Citizens, and the Freshwater Accountability Project. The fifth plaintiff, Donna Ballinger, is a Middletown resident who lives close to iron and steel operations, which she claims cause nuisance conditions. An August report by the Environmental Integrity Project documented likely air quality problems in that area.

Experts warn that eliminating the right to file air nuisance complaints weakens Ohio’s enforcement of pollution measures at an already perilous moment for environmental regulation.

For months, the Trump administration has been rolling back federal pollution standards and making huge personnel cuts to the staff charged with enforcing the remaining rules and permits. The Ohio EPA has authority to enforce the Clean Air Act but doesn’t always pursue alleged violations.

“Both at the federal and state level, we’re seeing less enforcement,” said Miranda Leppla, who heads Case Western Reserve University’s Environmental Law Clinic and represents the Ohio Environmental Council and the Sierra Club in the lawsuit. ​“If Ohioans don’t have the ability to bring these enforcement actions on their own through the air nuisance rule, there’s a very serious concern that air quality will continue to degrade and Ohioans’ health will get worse.”

Echoing a recent law in Louisiana, HB 96 also blocks the Ohio EPA from acting on data that groups may collect through community air-monitoring efforts. Such data can fill important gaps and alert communities and enforcement officials to problems that may not be detected by EPA monitors miles away.

Ohio’s limits on using the data will particularly harm fence-line communities, Leppla said.

“At a time when Ohio is seeing renewed industrial building, including new facilities like data centers, as well as a greater federal push for more fossil fuels, it is more important than ever that Ohioans preserve their right to both collect air pollution data themselves and use that data to file suits against harmful air nuisances,” said Chris Tavenor, general counsel for the Ohio Environmental Council.

The complaint, filed on Oct. 24 in the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, asserts that lawmakers violated the single-subject rule in the Ohio Constitution when they tacked the air pollution provisions onto the massive budget bill.

“This is fundamentally unrelated to the main purpose of the biennial budget,” Waggoner said. ​“And it was stuck in here in an intentional way so that folks would not have an opportunity to see it, talk about it, or debate its merits.”

The Sierra Club, Ohio Environmental Council, and other groups raised a similar argument two years ago after eleventh-hour changes to a bill about poultry included a new definition of natural gas as ​“green energy.” That case, also at the Franklin County Court of Common Pleas, has been briefed, and parties are waiting for Judge Kimberly Cocroft to issue her ruling.

A 2019 decision in Paulding County, Ohio, rejected a challenge to the late amendment in the 2014 budget bill that tripled property-line setbacks for turbines on wind farms. That case wasn’t appealed and would not bind the court in Franklin County.

Despite the similarities, the new lawsuit is different because the ban goes beyond how state agencies operate, Leppla said. ​“The air nuisance rule was created specifically to allow Ohioans who are suffering from noxious air pollution and nuisances to protect themselves when the government does not act.”

HB 96 is not the first attempt to take away Ohioans’ right to bring air nuisance claims. In 2020, the first Trump administration’s U.S. Environmental Protection Agency removed Ohio’s air nuisance rule, Waggoner noted.

The Ohio Environmental Council, the Sierra Club, Ballinger, and another Sierra Club member mounted a successful challenge in federal court, but due to delays in agency action it wasn’t until this February that the rule became effective again.

“And now here we are with the Ohio legislature attempting to remove it again, when it had already been found to be illegal to do so,” Leppla said.

To prevent another lapse, the plaintiffs in the new lawsuit have asked Judge Julie Lynch to grant a preliminary injunction against removing the rule while the case proceeds.

As defendants, the State of Ohio and the director of Ohio EPA have 28 days to file responses after the complaint was served. What happens next will depend on those filings and the judge’s rulings on any motions.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1244387963.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=51b02f771fbda5cb429f317fd1aa5e81,N,,2025-11-05 12:12:04.780987

It’s even lobbying Europe to ban new ICE vehicles by 2035.","An EV revolution has been trumpeted for decades, but while Asia and Europe jumped in headfirst, America is still having trouble dipping its toes in the water. After an initial surge in market share, EVs have slowed and even stalled, making up just 7.4% of total vehicles as of June 2025, according to CarEdge. The well-known federal tax credit that gave new EV buyers up to $7,500 has also been eliminated, meaning the EV sales boom of July, August, and September 2025 was likely a blip of people taking advantage of the credit while they could.

There are many reasons for the slow adoption of EVs stateside, including high costs and depreciation, concerns about long-term performance, and a lack of EV charging infrastructure in more public and private rural areas. Either way, consumer demand has been far below what many automakers anticipated when they invested big dollars in their EV programs. Because of this, and aided by other factors like increased tariffs and relaxed emissions regulations, some automakers are scaling back or even eliminating their EV plans in favor of vehicles with traditional internal combustion engines (ICEs).

All the automakers in question cited low sales and/or lack of profits as the main reason for the shift. As the old saying goes, follow the money, and that’s what automotive manufacturers are doing. We’re going to follow that trail and examine some companies that have significantly scaled back their EV plans, and what they’re focusing on instead.

Ford

The Blue Oval was all-in on EVs for the first half of the 2020s, introducing the Mustang Mach-E, F-150 Lightning, and E-Transit in short order. However, the New York Times reports that since 2023, the Ford EV division is $12 billion in the hole. That’s a number even a worldwide conglomerate like Ford can’t ignore. In September 2024, Ford announced that its Oakville, Ontario assembly factory would switch its planned focus from electric sports cars and SUVs to ICE pickup trucks. Demand has increased for the very profitable Ford Super Duty, and the automaker responded in kind. Ford also delayed the release of two new all-electric pickups.

However, in August 2025, Ford announced what it called its “next Model T moment” in the form of a new universal EV platform and a new universal EV production system to build it. This platform’s first vehicle will be an as-yet-unnamed midsize electric pickup priced around $30,000, which will go on sale in 2027. That’s comparable to the existing Ford Ranger. The new platform uses significantly fewer parts and fasteners, and more large aluminum components to speed assembly. Despite being an EV, its wiring harness is 4,000 feet shorter and 22 lbs lighter than the Mustang Mach-E, reports Jalopnik.

It takes years to develop new models, especially such a revolutionary platform and a new production line to build it. It seems likely that Ford was already quite committed to this when the winds of EV enthusiasm changed, and it was too late to back out. Still, if Ford succeeds in producing more EVs that are comparable to or better than current ICE offerings, they could make EV adoption more palatable for those who are still against it.

General Motors

As another early captain on the EV bandwagon, GM said back in 2018 that its goal was to have 50% of its new vehicles all-electric by 2030 and 100% by 2035. To that end, it has released many EVs under several marques, including the Chevy Silverado EV, GMC Hummer EV, and Cadillac LYRIQ.

Now, though, it seems those lofty goals are in jeopardy. The opening of a new Orion assembly plant in Detroit, which was supposed to make the Silverado EV, has now been delayed twice and won’t make its first vehicle until at least mid-2026. They also put the brakes on the first Buick PHEV with no official date in sight. In April 2025, GM reversed course on plans to convert its Toledo, Ohio, plant into a full-scale EV drive unit hub, increasing production on ICE parts instead to support higher light-duty truck output at its Fort Wayne, Indiana, location. More recently, GM said it would reduce production of its Cadillac EVs. Because of the low demand, it has been temporarily laying off workers and even shuttering existing EV plants for weeks at a time. These are major moves for a company that seemed so committed to EVs.

However, after discontinuing the Bolt in 2023, Chevrolet is bringing it back for the 2027 model year. It has a revised interior, and while the outside got little more than a facelift, it is the first Chevy to utilize the NACS charging port pioneered by Tesla. It can fast charge at 150 kW, 2.5 times faster than the previous Bolt, and can charge from 10% to 80% in just 26 minutes. Though priced just under $30,000, the similarly priced 2026 Nissan LEAF exceeds the new Bolt’s capabilities in almost every way. It’s not clear why GM brought the Bolt out of retirement with some significant improvements, but still not enough to keep up with the competition.

Volvo

At one point, Volvo had perhaps the most aggressive EV plan. In 2021, it set a goal of making its entire vehicle lineup all-electric by 2030, and trumpeted its credentials with SUVs like the EX90 full-size and EX40 compact.

In September 2024, though, Volvo officially abandoned those all-electric plans. The new goal is to have 90% of the lineup either EV or PHEV by 2030, meaning gas-powered engines will be in the picture for the foreseeable future, even if hybrids. On the most recent World EV Day, Volvo positioned PHEVs as the vehicle of now, trumpeting them as the perfect bridge to an eventual EV world.

Volvo hasn’t abandoned EVs, having just begun production on the much-anticipated ES90. It’s even lobbying Europe to ban new ICE vehicles by 2035. But in the meantime, Volvo is putting more effort into its gas-only fleet, such as significantly refreshing the XC90 crossover. It’s also hinted at moving the XC90 and XC60 production to the U.S. to avoid tariff costs.

Volkswagen

Like its fellow V marquee, Volkswagen initially talked a big game about EVs. In 2018, it said it would no longer build combustion engine cars by the end of 2026. Plenty of EVs have followed suit, like the ID.4 sedan and the long-awaited ID.Buzz minibus.

How times have changed. VW is putting plenty of resources into EVs, but gasoline cars aren’t going anywhere. In 2022, it revised its full-electric plans for Europe until 2033, and now it may not even hit that target. Then, in June 2024, the Volkswagen Group said it would pour $65 billion into internal combustion engine development to remain competitive with other brands. This year, VW assured customers that the famous Golf GTI hatchback will remain gas-powered until sometime into the 2030s, though it also hinted at a hybrid setup.

Other Volkswagen subsidiaries are following the same path. Porsche announced the current V8 Cayenne will be sold alongside the EV edition until at least 2030, and multiple other EVs like the 718 are reportedly delayed. Bentley has delayed its full transition from 2030 to 2035 and won’t release its first EV until 2027. Porsche, Bugatti, and Lamborghini are also exploring synthetic fuels as an EV alternative.

Other EV Rollbacks

Several other automakers don’t have enough news on their EV scale-backs for a full section, but are nonetheless worth mentioning. Here are five more companies that have modified their plans in the past two years.

Mercedes-Benz: Slow EV sales have caused the luxury automaker to pull back on its all-EV-by-2030 plans. Mercedes-Benz is also dropping the EQ badging and styling, keeping future EVs more in line with the overall brand aesthetic.

Honda: The Japanese automaker no longer has a timeline for electrifying a certain percentage of vehicles. For now, it will emphasize hybrids instead of EVs.

Aston Martin: The first Aston Martin EV has been postponed until 2027, and it will now sell ICE cars until the 2030s. That said, some Aston Martin models could be hybridized in the meantime.

Jaguar Land Rover: They originally were going to have six Land Rover EV models by the end of 2026, but now will only offer four by then. The Jaguar nameplate will remain electric-only for the time being.

Dodge: The electric future Dodge planned for the Charger has not worked out. After a change in management, Dodge has gone all-in on the HEMI V8, making it the only available engine in the Durango and hinting at plans to stuff it into the current Charger after clearly stating it would not.

The Changing Landscape of Vehicle Power

With how much time and money it takes for an automaker to implement any sort of strategy, major shifts aren’t taken lightly. The fact that so many manufacturers are retooling factories, extending ICE production life, and delaying vehicle launches shows how bumpy the road to EVs has gotten. I have a feeling there are many more chapters to be written in this story. Companies will follow the money, and who knows when or if the long-term money will point to an all-EV world.",https://www.autoinfluence.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/The-EV-Rollback-2025-Ford-Mustang-Mach-E-Rally-Tan.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 10:20:11.856167

The wide-ranging slate of changes could reshape taxes, education, public safety and infrastructure in the Lone State State.

This year, Texans saw one of the most amendment-packed ballots in state history. Voters had a chance to weigh in on 17 possible changes to the Texas Constitution, with proposed amendments ranging from property tax cuts and judicial reform to new investments in research and workforce development.

Without a big race like the presidency or a high-profile statewide office on the ballot, voter turnout appeared modest across much of the state. Overall, more than 1.4 million Texans cast a ballot this year according early totals from the Texas Secretary of State’s office. That’s just under 8% of the state’s nearly 18.5 million registered voters. By comparison, about 2.5 million Texans voted during the state’s last constitutional amendment election in 2023.

Read on for a breakdown of each proposition Texas voters gave the nod to this year — and what those changes might mean for you.

A variety of amendments to lower property taxes

Taxes were a primary focus of this year’s constitutional amendment election, accounting for more than half of the 17 amendments on the ballot. Of those proposals, six were directed at lowering property taxes for specific groups.

Most consequential among them are ballot Proposition 13, which increases the homestead exemption for all homeowners from $100,000 to $140,000, and Proposition 11 which gives senior citizens and those with disabilities an extra $60,0000 exemption.

The push to get this plan on the ballot was made by nearly all state lawmakers earlier this year. Taken together with other recent efforts to reduce property taxes, Texas will spend more than $50 billion on this during the state’s next budget cycle.

Additional amendments that passed are Proposition 10, which gives homeowners whose homes were destroyed by fires an exemption, as well as Proposition 7 that creates exemptions for widows of veterans whose death was a result of service.

Property taxes will also go down for landlords and business owners under Proposition 9.

Another measure — Proposition 17 — will give Texans who live along the southern border a property tax break for building projects on their land if they’re related to border security.

Texans make investments in water infrastructure, dementia prevention and technical education

Voters showed strong support for measures aimed at strengthening the state’s future. Proposition 1 creates two new funds to help Texas’ network of technical colleges grow — money that can be used toward buying land, building new classrooms and labs, repairing campus buildings and updating equipment.

Meanwhile, Proposition 4 will direct up to $1 billion a year for fixing old pipes, building reservoirs and shoring up the state’s water supply against future droughts. While supporters say it’s a drop in the bucket compared to what’s needed, the money will begin to address the state’s aging infrastructure.

And through Proposition 14, Texans approved the creation of a $3 billion investment to create a Dementia Prevention and Research Institute — modeled after the state’s cancer research program — to focus on Alzheimer’s and related diseases.

Additional tax exemptions and bans

Under Proposition 2, Texas voters banned a capital gains tax, a move supporters say protects investors and encourages economic growth. Meanwhile, Proposition 6 prohibits certain taxes on financial service providers like stock exchanges and broker dealers. While ultimately successful, more Texans voted against Prop 6 than any other proposal.

Voters also approved Proposition 8, which bans inheritance taxes in the state, ensuring lawmakers cannot impose a tax on estates or inheritances in the future, even though the state currently has none.

Finally, Proposition 5 creates a tax exemption for animal feed held in retailers’ inventories, an effort to lower livestock production costs and support Texas agriculture.

Tougher bail rules and judicial oversight

Amendments reshaping parts of the state’s criminal justice system also saw strong support from Texas voters.

Proposition 3 requires judges to deny bail in some violent and sexual offense cases if there’s clear evidence the person poses a danger or might flee — a move supporters say closes loopholes that’ve allowed repeat offenders to walk free.

Also approved was Proposition 12, which overhauls the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, giving it more power “to more effectively sanction judges for judicial misconduct” and change how its members are appointed. Supporters, like Gov. Greg Abbott, say the measure will make the judicial system more transparent.

How other amendments faired

Two other amendments focus on social and election issues. Proposition 15 puts parents’ rights directly into the state constitution, giving them more say over their kids’ education, healthcare and upbringing. Supporters say it protects families; critics worry it could complicate child welfare cases.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4589baf/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+213/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F7f%2Fd0%2Ffbb101604aabb10bb164a605de3e%2Ftexacapitol-mm-2023.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 12:13:36.076783

Jharkhand needs around Jharkhand $256b from 2026 to 2070 to support its shift from fossil fuel-dominant sectors without disrupting the social infrastructure, according to a new report by the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA).

“This shift entails phasing out carbon-intensive assets, building new low-carbon capacity, and mobilising unprecedented levels of capital,” said Shantanu Srivastava, IEEFA’s research lead, sustainable finance and climate risk and co-author of the report “Jharkhand’s Just Transition: A roadmap for economic growth and diversification.”

IEEFA said that the long-term benefits in terms of new revenues, jobs, and industrial ecosystems will far outweigh the significant upfront costs.

“Jharkhand’s vast renewable energy potential, combined with its industrial base and critical mineral reserves, positions the state to emerge as a hub for low-carbon manufacturing, ranging from EVs, solar panels and battery energy storage systems (BESS) to green hydrogen production,” the report read.

“At the same time, natural farming and other, nature-based solutions can strengthen rural livelihoods, open opportunities in carbon markets, and enhance climate resilience,” it added.

The study noted that whilst public funds will play a catalytic role, most of the required financing will need to come from private investment, multilateral concessional capital and innovative blended finance structures. In return, this should be supported by clear and consistent policies to attract billions in private and concessional capital.

The UK could add thousands of jobs, retain economic value and lead the world in energy with the right policies, collaborative action, and a focus on an integrated energy workforce, according to OEUK’s 2025 Workforce Insight.

Providing a blueprint for decision-makers and those navigating the expansion to a broader energy mix, OEUK presents the latest employment data and details steps to equip the workforce for its essential role in supporting a low-carbon economy across oil and gas, offshore wind, carbon capture & storage (CCS) and hydrogen.

Highlighting the potential to grow jobs, ensure good jobs and guard existing jobs, OEUK calls for timely intervention to support a robust domestic energy sector, warning that inaction will lead to an unprecedented exodus of supply chain capability, continued job losses, further loss of critical expertise, and hinder progress toward the UK’s net zero targets.

In the past year, more than 55% of the UK’s offshore energy firms have reduced their staff headcount according to a Pulse survey OEUK conducted in October 2025 to quantify the impact of the fiscal regime. Looking ahead, nearly 45% of surveyed companies are expecting to cut jobs further over the next 12 months if the current policy environment continues.

Ahead of the Budget, OEUK has urged the government to reform the fiscal regime to secure investment, safeguard jobs and strengthen the UK’s homegrown energy future, arguing that the choice is not between economic growth and climate ambition but how to deliver both.

Katy Heidenreich, OEUK’s supply chain and people director said:

“The government’s Clean Energy Jobs Plan presents an ambitious goal as the country works towards net zero emissions, energy security, and a strong economy. It’s vital that we ground ambition in reality. The windfall tax is costing jobs and investment and reducing tax revenues that support families, communities and vital services across the UK. Nine out of ten supply chain companies believe growing their business is only possible by finding new markets outside the UK. Many of the renewable energy sector jobs will not materialise before 2030 and we must act now to avoid losing the skilled people who are essential to achieving the UK’s climate ambition.

“We have an incredible opportunity, as we expand and diversify our energy mix across oil and gas, wind, hydrogen, and carbon capture and storage (CCS). We should build the energy jobs of the future on the shoulders of energy workers today.

“With the right policies and investment, the UK can achieve a net addition of jobs, growing the offshore energy workforce from 154,000 today to over 212,000 by 2030, with continued growth in oil and gas playing a central role. OEUK and its members are ready to lead but success depends on decisive action from government, industry and academia.”

The report addresses the common misconception that separate workforces exist for clean energy and oil and gas. Around 90% of the offshore energy workforce is employed by UK supply chain companies and most of these have expanded into and are already active across multiple energy sectors.

As a leading force in supporting strategic priorities for employment and skills, OEUK is committed to highlighting good practice and turning insight into action. OEUK’s Workforce Insight 2025 provides a blueprint for government and industry to deliver the energy jobs of the future. OEUK’s Calls to Action cannot be overstated: they are critical to unlocking growth, integrating the energy workforce, and ensuring the UK leads the world in clean, secure energy.

The Calls to Action are:

Grow Jobs: Unlock investment, expand the sector, and use energy workforce modelling to plan for the future.

Good Jobs: Embed fair pay, high standards, and inclusion across all energy sectors.

Guard Jobs: Retain skills, support new entrants, and protect communities.

Christopher Payne/Esto In a suddenly inhospitable climate for EVs, there’s nothing automatic about building and selling the cars.","When I traveled to Ellabell, Ga., in May to report on Hyundai Motor Group’s hyperefficient Metaplant—a US $12.6 billion boost to U.S.-based manufacturing of EVs and batteries—the company’s timing appeared solid. At this temple of leading-edge factory tech, Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 SUVs marched along surgically spotless assembly lines, giving the South Korean automaker a defensible bulwark against the Trump administration’s tariffs and onshoring fervor.

But dark clouds were already gathering. Consumer adoption of EVs had started slowing. The U.S. federal government’s $7,500 clean-car tax credit, which had helped hundreds of thousands of people make the leap to EVs, was being phased out.

Held securely on a yellow jig, a three-row Ioniq 9 SUV glides from station to station in the assembly hall. A view from below shows its generous, 110.3-kilowatt-hour battery pack, which, as in most EVs, sits below the floor of the car. The pack, which is shielded to prevent or limit damage in a collision, is part of an advanced 800-volt architecture for ultrafast DC charging. Christopher Payne/Esto

Near the Savannah-area factory, I drove a smartly designed Ioniq 9, a three-row SUV tailored to the United States’ plus-size tastes. I also saw a battery plant taking shape: a $4.3 billion joint venture between Hyundai and LG Energy Solution, on track to produce lithium-ion cells for Hyundai, Kia, and Genesis models in 2026. That facility is one of 11 low-roofed buildings that encompass 697,000 square meters (70 hectares), their pale green walls designed to blend into the Georgia countryside.

Backed by $2.1 billion in state subsidies, the Metaplant is the largest public development project in Georgia’s history. Covering 70 hectares, it is the centerpiece of Hyundai’s $12.6 billion total investment in the state, including the battery factory built with LG Energy Solution that ICE and other agents raided in September. Christopher Payne/Esto

That battery plant made headlines in September, when U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agents staged a workplace raid that led to more than 300 South Korean workers being detained and deported.

The episode highlighted the transnational cooperation—and tensions—inherent in importing a leading-edge manufacturing operation, a duality that might be familiar to anyone old enough to recall Japan’s game-changing entry into the U.S. automobile market in the 1970s and ’80s. The Metaplant is the largest publicly backed project in Georgia’s history. Its creation was accelerated by the Biden administration’s pro-EV policies, and it was also the centerpiece of Republican Gov. Brian Kemp’s bid to make his state “the electric mobility capital of the country.” Now, it was suddenly the latest flashpoint in an ongoing culture-and-trade war.

Automakers roll with the punches because they have no choice

An automated guided vehicle (AGV) prepares to pick up a rack of windshields from an automated trailer unloader, for “just in time” delivery to an assembly line where Ioniq 5 EVs are being built. There is no human intervention from the time parts arrive at the Metaplant’s loading docks to their installation. Christopher Payne/Esto

Robots perform myriad tasks, yet human hands are still best for precision work. Jerry Roach, the Metaplant’s assembly manager, says, “I want my people doing craftsmanship. I want to pay people well for the things humans do well, and take away the stuff that’s tedious and boring.” Christopher Payne/Esto

As with other EV makers facing hurricane-force headwinds, including the U.S. rollback of pollution and fuel-economy rules, Hyundai has chosen to forge ahead with its long-laid plans. Company executives call the Metaplant North America’s most automated car factory and the most advanced full-scale factory among Hyundai Motor Co.’s 12 global manufacturing facilities. It rivals or surpasses Japan’s most advanced plants, such as the best operated by Toyota. Compared with the near-Dickensian Detroit auto factory that I toiled at in the 1980s, the stunning facility is a veritable MOMA: a modern museum of manufacturing art.

To have any chance of one-upping China, car factories elsewhere must become hyperefficient, which includes enlisting armies of AI-controlled robots—robots that can potentially work 24/7 and never ask for a raise or a lunch break.

The factory may eventually employ 8,500 people directly, and 7,000 satellite workers, for an annual capacity of 500,000 cars—more than Tesla’s Texas Gigafactory but less than Tesla’s Shanghai plant. This past summer, just 1,340 humans were sufficient to send a constant stream of two Ioniq models down these gleaming assembly lines. The “Meta Pros” working on those lines were earning on average $58,100 a year, which is 35 percent higher than the average in Bryan County, Ga.

Clearly the days of Ford’s River Rouge complex, which employed more than 100,000 in the 1930s, are gone. As in many new factories, you’ll see surprisingly few people beyond the assembly line itself. During my visit, I spotted less than two dozen in a cavernous welding hall, where 475 robots were piecing together car chassis in a whirling, metallic dance. A steel stamping plant was so quiet that no ear protection was required, even as robots stamped out roofs and other body panels, and then stowed them in overhead racks.

Outside, human workers parked their cars beneath solar roofs that generate up to 5 percent of the plant’s electricity. Meanwhile, a fleet of 21 hydrogen fuel-cell trucks, from the Hyundai-owned Xcient, carries parts from suppliers, emitting zero tailpipe emissions. The automaker’s goal is to obtain 100 percent of the Metaplant’s energy from renewables by 2030.

An Ioniq 9 body-in-white, the basic steel skeleton of an automobile, leaves the “main buck” section of the body build line. This line is where the vehicle’s floor and sides meet to form a recognizable car. The line adapts to changing production mixes to meet customer orders, with built-in flexibility to assemble future models.Christopher Payne/Esto

Sparks fly as welding robots piece together the Ioniq 9’s “body-in-white,” the industry term for the basic steel skeleton of a car, prior to the addition of subassemblies such as the suspension, power train, body trim, and interior. The Metaplant’s welding shop houses about 500 industrial robots.Christopher Payne/Esto

Robotic welders have revolutionized car manufacturing, joining the parts of an auto body with levels of speed, precision, and safety that humans can’t match. Such advantages reduce labor costs and scrapped materials. Hyundai is also now experimenting with humanoid robots to perform welding tasks.Christopher Payne/Esto

“Body-complete” robots mount front doors onto Ioniq 5s, using machine vision and laser-measurement systems to ensure an exact fit of movable panels on each body. The robots also install mounting bolts to exact torque specifications, all validated to ensure their work meets safety and quality standards.Christopher Payne/Esto

Smart, silent robots unload trucks

When those trucks roll into docks at the Metaplant, some of the factory’s 850 robots promptly unload their parts. About 300 automated guided vehicles, or AGVs, glide silently across the factory floor with no tracks required, trained to smartly stop for humans. An AGV rolls beneath a finished Hyundai, squeezes the wheels in its robotic arms, then swiftly hoists and ferries the car where it needs to go. A companion AGV further down the line executes the exact same moves. I’ve never seen so many robotic sleds like these, or a tag team move with more efficiency and grace. Within an AI-based procurement-and-logistics system, the AGVs allocate and deliver parts to workstations for “just in time” delivery, avoiding wasted time, space, and money as they stockpile components.

An automated guided vehicle ferries dashboards for the Hyundai Ioniq 9 SUV, including each dashboard’s pair of 30-centimeter display screens. AGVs are programmed to navigate the factory, using cameras and sensors to slow or stop to avoid collisions, and emit spoken warnings to human workers in their path.Christopher Payne/Esto

“They’re delivering the right parts to the right station at the right time, so you’re no longer relying on people to make those decisions,” says Jerry Roach, senior manager of general assembly at the Metaplant.

Roach prefers that his skilled humans focus on craftsmanship, doing jobs with tactile precision that only human hands and vision can accomplish. The idea is to free people from those elements of factory work that are physically taxing, unfulfilling, and, well, robotic, so workers can use their brains and take pride in their specialized skills.

Left: Adjustable-height carriers elevate an Ioniq 5 for easy access to the central fasteners and plugs that will position suspension components and the high-voltage battery, prior to the “marriage” between the upper and lower sections of the vehicle. Those carriers provide flexibility for automated functions and manual operations by the human workers at the plant (whom Hyundai calls Meta Pros). Right: On the final assembly line, an Ioniq 9’s “top hat”—including body panels—is married to the lower “skateboard” structure, which includes the electric motors, battery, and suspension. A finished car then undergoes various tests, including a water bath to check for leaks and a quick road test outdoors. Christopher Payne/Esto

Robots, Roach says, are best tasked with heavy lifting and repetitive tasks, or those that demand digitized speed and accuracy. One example is a “collaborative” robot, sophisticated enough to work safely in close proximity to people, despite its mammoth strength. For the first time at a Hyundai factory, such a robot is installing bulky, heavy doors on the assembly line—a notoriously tricky task to perform without scratching the glossy paint or damaging surrounding panels.

Hyundai is proud of its collaborative robots, including one that can precisely install a heavy door, a tricky task for humans to perform without damaging the panels. Those robots require advanced control systems so that they can work alongside human workers without needing to be fenced off or otherwise isolated.Christopher Payne/Esto

“Guess what? Robots do that perfectly, always putting the door in the exact same place,” Roach says. “So here, that technology makes sense.”

Man’s best friend, or its mechanical counterparts, stroll the factory floor: Spot, the robotic quadrupeds from Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, use camera vision, sensors, and what Boston Dynamics calls “athletic intelligence” to sniff out potential welding defects.

Spot, the robot dog designed by Hyundai-owned Boston Dynamics, inspects body welds on an Ioniq 5 for defects. Equipped with a sensor suite, the quadruped bot can recharge autonomously, dynamically work around fixed or moving obstacles, and get back on its feet if it falls. Christopher Payne/Esto

Those four-legged bots may soon have a biped master: Atlas, the humanoid robot, also from Boston Dynamics. The humanoid’s physical dexterity is uncanny, with a 360-degree swiveling head that allows it to walk forward and backward without turning its body. One look at these Atlases crawling, cartwheeling, or breakdancing during testing and you might reasonably conclude they’re a potential Terminator of jobs. Hyundai executives insist that’s not the case, even as they plan to put Atlases to work in their global factories. Boston Dynamics is training these robots to sense their environments and manipulate and move parts in complex sequences.

At this backup station, high-voltage battery fasteners can be installed in an Ioniq 5. The station ensures that the assembly line keeps running even if an automated production system requires servicing. Christopher Payne/Esto

From nearby Interstate 16, Georgia drivers can see freshly painted Ioniq 5s and 9s moving along a conveyor on a windowed bridge—an intentional glimpse of what’s happening inside. They can also see their tax dollars at work, after $2.1 billion in state subsidies. Hyundai is already building a second battery plant in Georgia, and a steel plant in Louisiana, part of an expanded pledge of $21 billion in U.S. investment through 2028.

After their frames are fully welded, Ioniq 5s move along a conveyor [in the background] to an environmentally friendly paint shop. From there, the cars will travel along an elevated bridge, visible from nearby Interstate 16 in Ellabell, Ga., toward final assembly.Christopher Payne/Esto

An Ioniq 5 arrives at its final inspection station. Immediately after, a human driver gets to drive the pristine car for the first time, on a test track just outside the factory. The first Ioniq 5 rolled off the Metaplant line on 3 October 2024, with the larger Ioniq 9 kicking off production in March 2025. Christopher Payne/Esto

Merck, the German life sciences and electronics giant, has signed a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement with SK Innovation E&S to supply 16 megawatts of renewable electricity capacity to its life science manufacturing sites in Daejeon and Songdo, South Korea.

The agreement represents the company's longest renewable energy commitment in the Asia-Pacific region and is scheduled to become operational in December 2027.

Once active, the PPA will deliver approximately 21,000 megawatt-hours of electricity annually, covering around 75% of the electricity demand for Merck's life science operations in South Korea.

What is a Power Purchase Agreement?

A Power Purchase Agreement (or PPA) is a long-term contract between an electricity generator and a buyer for the purchase of electricity. These agreements are often used to finance renewable energy projects, allowing businesses to buy power at a fixed price for a set period (often between 10 and 25 years) without having to build or operate their own power plants.

""This agreement reflects our long-term commitment to manufacturing sustainability,"" says Tim Jaeger, Chief Strategy and Transformation Officer for Merck's Life Science business.

""By adding renewable electricity to the grid for our operations in South Korea, we are taking further measures to reduce our environmental impact and enabling our customers do the same.""

The deal forms part of Merck's expanding global renewable energy portfolio, which includes virtual PPAs across Europe and North America alongside various onsite installations worldwide.

Merck's 2030 sustainability targets

Merck's new agreement in South Korea will support the company's 2030 sustainability target of sourcing 80% of purchased electricity from renewable sources, a goal the firm now expects to hit well ahead of schedule.

Merck first established its group-wide sustainability strategy in 2020 and aligned all of its commitments with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, having its targets ratified by the SBTi along the way.

The strategy centres on three core commitments:

Advancing human progress for more than one billion people through sustainable science and technology by 2030

Fully integrating sustainability into value chains by 2030

Achieving climate neutrality whilst reducing resource consumption by 2040

Importantly, Merck's commitment to climate neutrality extends across Scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions, with interim targets of a 50% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 emissions and a 30% reduction in Scope 3 emissions by 2030, compared to a 2020 baseline.

How is Merck performing against its targets?

Merck's 2024 data shows 182 metric kilotons of CO₂ equivalent in combined Scope 1 and 2 emissions, representing a 43% reduction compared to 2020 levels.

However, Scope 3 emissions stood at 1,538 metric kilotons of CO₂ equivalent in 2024, marking only a 2% reduction from the 2020 baseline.

The disparity in progress between Scope 1 and 2 emissions versus Scope 3 emissions highlights the greater challenge companies face in reducing indirect emissions across their value chains compared to direct operational emissions.

Merck's broader sustainability framework includes commitments to sustainable product innovation, with a target for 10% of its portfolio to consist of 'Greener Alternative Products' by 2030.

The company employs SHAPE, its design for sustainability framework, alongside DOZN, a freely available online green chemistry evaluator tool, to assess and improve the sustainability profile of chemicals and products throughout their life cycle.

How Merck approaches supply chain sustainability

Beyond emissions reduction, Merck's sustainability strategy encompasses supply chain transparency and packaging improvements.

By 2030, the company aims for a 10% reduction in packaging weight per unit sales compared to baseline figures, with all new packaging designed following circularity principles and all fibre-based packaging sourced from deforestation-free materials.

The South Korea PPA adds renewable capacity directly to the grid, a model that differs from purely financial virtual PPAs by creating new clean energy infrastructure that benefits the broader electricity network.

This approach aligns with growing emphasis on ""additionality"" in corporate renewable energy procurement, where companies prioritise agreements that result in new renewable generation capacity rather than merely purchasing certificates from existing projects.

Merck generated sales of €21.2bn (US$24.4bn) across 65 countries in 2024, with operations spanning life science, healthcare and electronics sectors employing over 62,000 people globally.

The “Halliburton loophole” — part of comprehensive energy legislation Cheney guided from concept to signing ceremony in 2005 — is the most famous part of the bill. It may also be the most exaggerated.

Since it exempted fracking from a top environmental law, it’s been both credited and blamed for unleashing the flood of oil and gas production that put the United States at the top of the world’s leaderboard. The exemption bears the name of the oilfield services firm Cheney led before landing in the West Wing, but his specific role in putting it in law remains unclear 20 years later. In all those years he didn’t boast about it, nor did he disavow it.

The provision took fracking out of the hands of EPA before the agency, dreaded by the oil industry, could begin to regulate it in earnest. Cheney and the administration of then-President George W. Bush could reasonably take credit or blame for setting in motion oil, gas and coal policies that President Donald Trump now seeks to put in hyperdrive. Cheney’s death was announced Tuesday by his family. He was 84.

“From leading Halliburton to serving as vice president, he exemplified steady leadership and helped shape America’s energy and security,” American Petroleum Institute CEO Mike Sommers said in a social media message.

The White House and Halliburton did not respond Tuesday to requests for comment. While both men were avid supporters of the oil and gas industry, President Trump clashed with Cheney and his daughter, former Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.), who helped lead a probe into Trump’s actions around the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021.

In addition to a long and storied career in government, Cheney had served as chair and CEO of Halliburton before joining Bush in the White House. It was the first time two oilmen held the top two jobs in the country. Bush had founded an oil exploration company early in his business career.

Bush and Cheney made a hard turn from the Democratic administration of former President Bill Clinton, who sought to build an environmental legacy late in his second term by preserving Western public lands and putting them off-limits to oil and gas development.

Bush campaigned on drilling in Alaska’s Arctic National Wildlife Reserve and increasing production on other public lands. “Drill, baby, drill,” though, didn’t become a Republican slogan until 2008, when the two oilmen were on their way out the door.

Bush was only nine days into his presidency when he assigned Cheney to develop a new national energy policy. The task force Cheney created for the job became famous for closed-door huddles with energy companies and a refusal to release records.

The report his panel produced some 108 days later drew howls from environmentalists and predictable praise from fossil fuel interests. But as much as it was a strong push to the right, it pales in comparison to Trump’s drive for fossil fuel “energy dominance” and renewable energy submission.

At the time, the United States produced a fraction of the oil and gas it does today, but Cheney’s report declared no unilateral emergencies and also advocated for renewable energy sources like wind and solar. It embodied the Republican side of the “all-of-the-above” rhetoric employed by both parties until Trump’s first term.

The aging document from the National Energy Policy Development Group provides hints of the drilling boom to come. The report mentioned hydraulic fracturing, with a faint nod to how important advances in the technology known as fracking would become.

It discussed fracking to produce natural gas from coal seams, which are far shallower than the deep formations that would be tapped in Pennsylvania, North Dakota and Texas in the drilling boom. It predicted fracking into coalbeds would most likely face added controls and costs to ensure environmental protection.

The document did not explicitly call for any exemption for fracking to be written into law.

Instead, the National Energy Policy Development Group said the Energy and Interior departments should “promote enhanced oil and gas recovery from existing wells through new technology.”

Energy Policy Act

Much of the report’s discussion about fracking sounded pretty milquetoast. Far more attention was paid to increased leasing and drilling on federal lands, primarily for gas.

The report pointed to the federal public lands of the Rocky Mountain West, saying 40 percent and some 137 trillion cubic feet of natural gas was restricted. The report recommended that the Interior Department take another look at those restrictions, still using careful federal language: “consistent with the law, good environmental practice, and balanced use of other resources.”

Federal public lands, then and now, produce far less oil than needed to meet American consumption. And those lands alone don’t produce enough natural gas to supply a massive export industry. Overall, the United States becamea net petroleum exporter in 2020, the last full year of Trump’s first term.

Still, it’s impossible to say that Cheney had no idea what might lay ahead. Halliburton had lobbied for an exemption from environmental restrictions for hydraulic fracturing when he ran the company. The Halliburton Oil Well Cementing Co. performed the first “frack job” on March 17, 1949.

By then, fracking pioneer George Mitchell had developed the “slickwater” mixture of horizontal drilling and high-pressure underground injection in Texas that would later drive the boom. But the promise of the technology wasn’t widely known. Mitchell would sell his company to Devon Energy in 2002 for about $3.5 billion.

Publicly, Cheney courted controversy at times. Environmentalists howled when he dismissed energy conservation as a “personal virtue,” but “not a sufficient basis” for comprehensive energy policy. But unlike Trump, he didn’t shut down any active offshore wind energy projects. And much of the Bush-Cheney energy agenda waited on Congress, while Trump has put the pedal down and left Congress in the dust.

It took four years, two wars and one presidential election after Cheney’s report was issued for Congress to produce the Energy Policy Act of 2005. While it extended the length of daylight saving time, observers say the effect of the rest of the bill is hard to measure.

The 550-page bill was packed with incentives for nuclear, fossil and renewable energy. There were grid reliability regulations and siting provisions later pushed aside by court decisions.

But one paragraph exempted hydraulic fracturing from the Underground Injection Control (UIC) provisions of the Safe Drinking Water Act. The UIC regulations cover holes drilled to inject contaminants deep underground and wells used to force oil and gas to the surface.

Hydraulic fracturing was never widely regulated under the safe drinking water law. But in 1997, a federal appeals court had ruled that the UIC provisions of the law applied to fracturing in Alabama. The exemption in the 2005 law ended that and prevented the precedent from spreading to other states.

Opponents linked the exemption to Halliburton when the bill was debated in 2005. And Cheney’s former company became a target of critics during the Iraq war. In 2007, Halliburton unloaded its remaining interest in KBR, which was a major military contractor in Iraq.

The “Halliburton loophole” eventually stuck, though it doesn’t show up in the LexisNexis news archive in the context of oil and gas until May 2009.

As Mitchell’s slickwater shale drilling process revolutionized the American energy landscape and opposition grew, critics increasingly took to linking the exemption with Halliburton.

Some of those critics were quick to remember Tuesday how they viewed Cheney’s energy legacy.

“More than any other person Dick Cheney is responsible for the veil of secrecy and lies that surround fracking operations, and they are enshrined into law that he created,” Sandra Steingraber, senior scientist at the Science and Environmental Health Network, posted on social media.

The oil and gas industry has often said the fracking provision wasn’t even an exemption, much less a “loophole,” because EPA had not regulated fracturing under the Safe Drinking Water Act outside of Alabama.

“But tip your cap to the activists for constructing an entire mythology around it,” said Chris Tucker, who runs the energy practice in the strategic communications portion of FTI Consulting and helped develop the industry’s program for rapid response to fracking critics, known as Energy In Depth. “They had us on the defensive there for a while.”

Tucker is among those who say Cheney was not the driving force behind what the other side calls a loophole.

“The former vice president was just as surprised as anyone to have this thing, of all things, ascribed to him and his former company,” Tucker said. “It was one of those stories that was too good to check, I think.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/2d/42/dca1df854429af018045d8fae159/https-delivery-gettyimages.com/downloads/96976160,N,,2025-11-05 09:59:30.421936

An additional five permanent jobs will be tied to maintaining the geothermal network.
After considering the options, town leaders chose to equip the site with a campus-wide geothermal energy network.
That means most of those high-paying geothermal jobs are done by people like Billy Baker, a driller who honed his skills over a 15-year career in the oilfields.","This is the third story in a three-part series, ‘Greener Pastures,’ which explores climate workforce development in rural Colorado.

There’s a field near the airport in the tiny town of Hayden, Colorado, that may look like just a flat expanse of patchy grass and dirt. But exciting things are happening there—if you look below the surface.

“You wouldn't even be able to see our project,” said town manager Matthew Mendisco. “Because it's all underground, basically.”

That project is the start of a major geothermal energy network built earlier this year.

“We just completed the first phase,” Mendisco said. “We'll be entering the second, third, fourth phase over the next three years.”

This renewable, carbon-free technology will eventually heat and cool up to 800 thousand square feet across 20 buildings in the new business park the town is developing at the site. The town expects it to attract new businesses—and jobs—in industries from manufacturing to outdoor recreation. The idea is to help Hayden weather economic disruption as the nearby coal mine and related coal-fired power plant shut down, and the town transitions away from its traditional coal economy over the next few years.

“The business park was built by the town as a coal transition project to help boost jobs,” Mendisco said.

Town officials hope businesses moving into the development will create 75 permanent jobs in the community. An additional five permanent jobs will be tied to maintaining the geothermal network.

After considering the options, town leaders chose to equip the site with a campus-wide geothermal energy network. With multiple state and federal incentives for geothermal factored in, it made the most financial sense for the town. The network will allow them to provide extremely efficient and low-cost heating and cooling to potential business park tenants.

“Over time, we get to save them anywhere from 50 to 70% of their HVHC costs,” Mendisco said. “How do you bring business to a rural area? We had to try to be as competitive as possible at every development avenue.”

The system works by drilling a complex of boreholes in the ground, up to 1,000 feet deep, to tap into stable subterranean temperatures. Pipes circulate water between the borefield and the buildings in the network. Heat pumps in the buildings exchange thermal energy with the circulating water to regulate indoor air temperatures.

Thanks to many of the same incentives that supported the project in Hayden, these types of thermal systems appear set to take off across Colorado.

“There are dozens of feasibility and design studies happening right now,” said Lauren Suhrbier, the strategic development director at Clean Energy Economy for the Region (CLEER), a Northwest Colorado climate advocacy group.

Most of those projects are still in pre-development. But communities where they’re percolating are eager to usher their geothermal plans into reality.

“They have climate goals and they have very high utility bills,” Suhrbier said. “When you combine the two—we are looking to decarbonize and we have extremely high utility bills, and we have grant money, it’s kind of the perfect storm.”

To date, Colorado has doled out more than $23 million in geothermal incentives to communities from Durango to Joes, a small town on the eastern plains. The activity was spurred on by Governor Jared Polis’s “Heat Beneath Our Feet” geothermal initiative and a series of bills passed in the statehouse between 2022 and 2023. Policymakers support geothermal as an important climate solution and, crucially, a way to create jobs in communities like Hayden, in the process of transitioning away from the coal economy.

“There is potential for a lot of growth of jobs—high paying jobs,” Suhrbier said, though most of those jobs won’t materialize until more geothermal development starts breaking ground, which is likely to happen over the next few years.

Workers poached from fossil fuel

Right now, most geothermal companies fill their rosters by poaching workers with directly transferable skills from the fossil fuel and water well drilling industries. That means most of those high-paying geothermal jobs are done by people like Billy Baker, a driller who honed his skills over a 15-year career in the oilfields.

He left the oilfields a few months ago to take a job as a geothermal driller with Bedrock Energy, the company hired to build the network in Hayden. The pay is good, Baker said, a little better than the oil and gas wages he used to earn. The work is also interesting, and not far off from what he’s used to doing.

“It still uses the same skillset that was used in the previous oil and gas world,” Baker said. “It’s just much more stable and it's better for the environment. It feels better to be a part of it.”

But some in the geothermal world are concerned that the industry will eventually outgrow this ready-made skilled workforce. Under President Biden, the Department of Energy called for a dramatic expansion of geothermal drilling. The Trump administration has embraced it, too. Policymakers have identified workforce availability as a key obstacle.

“If you're looking to scale the industry rapidly, you just have this massive bottleneck that it's more or less impossible to pass people through,” said Andrew Iliff, the policy director at HEET, a Boston-based geothermal nonprofit.

According to Iliff, it takes years of experience to become a licensed driller, but so far, no one is intentionally cultivating that workforce outside.

“There is neither a particularly formal training process nor a particularly scalable one,” he said. “That is not set up to bring new entrants into the industry.”

Several industry groups, including HEET and the Geothermal Drillers Association, propose to solve the workforce pipeline problem by forming a network of Geothermal Drilling Centers of Excellence across the country. The vision is for a system of mobile geothermal education centers that could partner with unions, community colleges and other institutions to offer expertise along with credentials, to make geothermal training more accessible to industry newbies.

“If this takes off in the way that we hope that it will,” Iliff said. “Ten to 15 years from now, folks at technical high schools and community colleges see it as an option.”

That would be good for geothermal-forward communities like Hayden, where Mendisco says there will be plenty of geothermal construction work in the future. The town has big plans to expand well beyond its first project at the business park and hopes to convert all municipal buildings to geothermal heating and cooling.

The city recently established a municipal utility to be the central geothermal developer and operator in the area. Even private developers have started showing interest in connecting to publicly owned geothermal infrastructure.

Building that infrastructure could be an opportunity to tap into Hayden’s native workforce as part of the town’s coal transition activities.

“Coal transition means we're thinking long term about workers and skill sets,” Mendisco said. “We have some of the most amazing, hardworking people in our community that work at the power plant and coal mines. All their skills are transferable to come do this.”

As the coal transition generation turns over in the coming decades, job opportunities in the geothermal industry will continue gaining traction.

“I think about the economics of this all the time because we're trying to build a diverse economy,” Mendisco said.

Americans across parties and ages support converting coal plants into nuclear power plants. Q: How much would you support or oppose converting retired coal-fired power plants into nuclear power plants, if it could help provide cleaner and more reliable energy? Showing total for ""Strongly support"" and ""Somewhat support"". 1,003 national respondents. +/-3% margin of error.

Strong Support for Converting Retired Coal Plants Into Nuclear Facilities

In a striking sign of momentum, nearly three-quarters of Americans (73 percent) say they support repurposing retired coal-fired power plants into nuclear facilities to deliver clean, reliable electricity. Support cuts across party lines, with a strong bipartisan consensus of 77 percent. Generationally, older adults (65+) lead the way at 78 percent support, with younger adults (18–24) close behind at 71 percent.

Rising Public Support for Nuclear Power

Public support for nuclear energy continues to rise nationwide. Nearly three in five Americans now favor nuclear power (58 percent), up from 49 percent in 2018. Support is particularly strong among Republicans (68 percent), males (66 percent), and older adults (65 percent).

Growing Support Across Motivations

Americans’ reasons for backing nuclear are broad and expanding. Reliability stands out as the top motivation, with 74 percent of respondents saying nuclear power generates electricity reliably. Other leading reasons include its ability to strengthen U.S. competitiveness, reduce pollution, and enhance energy independence. Support for these reasons has grown consistently since 2018, demonstrating durable bipartisan appeal.

Bipartisan Support for Nuclear R&D

Support for next-generation nuclear research and development remains strong, with nearly three in five Americans (58 percent) favoring increased federal investment. Among energy options, nuclear R&D shows the least partisan divide, underscoring common ground between Democrats and Republicans compared to more divisive sources like oil, coal, or natural gas.

Waning Concerns About Nuclear

Concerns about nuclear energy continue to decline across the political spectrum. While health and safety and waste disposal remain top issues, both have seen significant drops since 2018, particularly among Democrats and Independents. This downward trend suggests Americans are becoming more comfortable with nuclear as part of the clean energy transition.

“Public perception plays a major role in how energy technologies are chosen, but perception often deviates from scientific reality,” said Guido Nuñez-Mujica, director of data science for Anthropocene Institute. “That’s why we track perception: it should be informed by science, not shaped by scary movies, headlines, or PR from competing technologies. We conduct this survey every year to understand where public opinion stands so we can help align it with the facts and move toward evidence-based energy solutions.”

The potential agreement underscores Tesla’s increasing shift toward Korean partners as the United States looks to reduce dependence on Chinese battery supply chains, according to a Korea Herald report.

Tesla executives finalize multi-Year deal

Sources cited in the report stated that Tesla executives from its Energy Storage Systems (ESS) division visited South Korea last week to finalize discussions with Samsung SDI. The companies are said to be closing in on a multi-year contract to supply around 10 gigawatt-hours (GWh) of lithium iron phosphate (LFP) battery cells annually, starting as early as 2026. The deal could bring in between 1 trillion and 1.5 trillion won in yearly revenue for Samsung SDI.

Production Planned at Indiana Facility

As per the report, the battery cells are expected to be manufactured at Samsung SDI’s joint venture facility with Stellantis in Indiana, US, which will reportedly convert part of its existing EV battery capacity to focus on ESS production. These cells are likely destined for Tesla’s Megapack assembly lines in California, where they’ll be integrated into the company’s large-scale energy storage systems.

Boost for Samsung SDI Amid weak financials

Industry experts quoted in the report noted that the potential deal could significantly improve Samsung SDI’s performance following recent financial headwinds. The company posted a 22.5% year-on-year revenue decline in Q3, with sales falling to 3.5 trillion won and recording an operating loss of 591.3 billion won. A long-term contract with Tesla, they say, would provide much-needed stability and position Samsung SDI more firmly in the expanding ESS market.

“Securing Tesla as a client would be a breakthrough moment for Samsung SDI,” said Lee Ho-geun, a professor of automotive engineering at Daeduk University. “It will not only boost credibility but also help strengthen the company’s complete ESS portfolio, including solutions like the Samsung Battery Box for the US market.”

Korean battery makers strengthen grip

Samsung SDI’s domestic rival, LG Energy Solution (LGES), has already signed a deal with Tesla to supply 20 GWh of LFP ESS cells per year, with ongoing discussions to expand that volume by 50% to 30 GWh. If both supply arrangements proceed, the combined contribution from Korean firms could total around 40 GWh annually for Tesla’s energy storage needs.

The report further noted that Samsung SDI’s Indiana plant is currently underutilized, operating at less than 50% capacity due to a slowdown in the US EV market. Winning Tesla’s business could help maximize output from the joint facility, particularly as the demand for ESS systems accelerates globally.

Musk outlines chip roadmap

Meanwhile, Tesla’s CEO Elon Musk recently commented on X (formerly Twitter) that the company’s next-generation AI5 and AI6 chips would be produced at both TSMC and Samsung, with high-volume production targeted for 2027. While unrelated to the battery deal, the comment reflects Tesla’s growing reliance on Samsung for advanced technology components.

Tesla’s pivot to Korean suppliers comes as part of a wider effort to diversify its sourcing away from China’s CATL, which has been its main provider of cost-efficient ESS batteries. Tesla’s Nevada plant, which uses CATL technology, currently delivers about 10 GWh annually — a small fraction of its target to scale ESS capacity to 100 GWh within the next three years.

With new US tariffs and incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, Korean-made LFP cells could soon reach cost parity or even become cheaper than Chinese alternatives, further strengthening the case for Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution as key players in Tesla’s long-term energy strategy.",https://img.republicworld.com/all_images/samsung-sdi-1762332508893-16_9.webp,N,,2025-11-05 10:20:15.473131

The case will not only decide the fate of one of the president’s signature policies but will also carry far broader implications for presidential power over international trade and even climate policy.

If the Supreme Court rules for Trump, it will enable a future president to use tariffs to advance a wide range of domestic policy goals. Among other things, such a power would likely enable a president to unilaterally adopt a longstanding policy priority of the climate movement: a tariff on imported carbon-intensive products known as a carbon border adjustment.

The case Learning Resources, Inc. v. Trump asks whether the his tariffs are legal under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Congress passed the act in the late 1970s to empower presidents to use economic sanctions to address “unusual and extraordinary” national emergencies.

For nearly half a century, this power was used sparingly to impose targeted economic sanctions in response to discrete foreign threats, like prohibiting transactions with the Taliban and restricting enriched uranium.

That all changed after Trump returned to office this year. In April, Trump declared that “large and persistent annual U.S. good trade deficits” constitute “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy.”

This declaration provided the legal justification under the act for Trump to impose tariffs on virtually all imports. According to the Tax Foundation, the president’s tariffs will increase federal taxes this year by nearly $175 billion and reduce gross domestic product by 0.8 percent.

Trump’s use of the act is unprecedented in multiple ways, as my colleagues and I explain in a brief filed with the Supreme Court.

For one, no president had used the statute to enact a wide-ranging program covering nearly all imports. For another, no president had used the statute to impose tariffs, as the statute authorizes the president to “regulate” foreign transactions but does not reference taxation. Our brief argues that this lack of historical antecedent counsels against the president’s claim of such sweeping authority.

The case presents an early test of the Supreme Court’s approach to actions of the Trump administration that conflict with such longstanding conservative principles as limited government. But the case’s stakes extend well beyond the current White House occupant.

If the Supreme Court greenlights the president’s expansive use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, future administrations could use the statute to pursue other ambitious policy goals. A carbon border adjustment is a likely candidate.

Carbon border adjustments impose tariffs on imports based on their greenhouse gas emissions. This policy has multiple advantages, including reducing emissions from imported products and putting domestic producers on equal footing with foreign producers that do not invest in green practices.

The European Union enacted carbon border adjustments in 2023, and the idea is now catching on with Democrats and some Republicans in Congress seeing it as an opportunity to address climate change and boost domestic manufacturing.

But new legislation would be unnecessary if the Supreme Court sanctions the president’s broad tariff authority under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act. Under such a ruling, a president could declare that climate change generally — and the import of goods not subject to rigorous climate standards specifically — constitutes “an unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and economy” that triggers the law’s broad powers.

After all, the Defense Department has recognized that climate change has significant implications for U.S. national security, “increasing the risk that crises cascade beyond any one country or region.” Then, the president could “regulate” under the statute by imposing tariffs based on a product’s carbon footprint.

This may not be the optimal way to impose carbon border adjustments — if imposed by statute, rather than by presidential declaration, the policy would be more durable and democratic.

Nonetheless, the use of the International Emergency Economic Powers Act for carbon border adjustments could have many benefits. The U.S. could negotiate reciprocal arrangements with allies to harmonize climate policies and embed climate considerations into the global trading system. Other countries may even adopt or strengthen climate-pollution standards.

But just because carbon adjustments are good policy does not mean they are authorized under a 50-year-old law aimed at international emergencies. In fact, as our brief explains, Trump’s claim to newfound and broad authority merits skepticism.

The Supreme Court will effectively decide in Learning Resources whether the International Emergency Economic Powers Act confers such broad authority, and a win for Trump in that case could open up a new playbook for bold climate action.

Proponents of Trump’s expansive use of executive authority should learn from this example: Power once expanded is difficult to later confine. If the court blesses these new powers today, a future president could wield them for different very ends.

Chargers

Walmart deploys 400-kW Alpitronic HYC400 chargers (the company hinted at ABB as its second hardware supplier). The chargers feature two charging ports — one NACS (SAE J3400) and one CCS1 for maximum compatibility. It means that half of the stalls are CCS1 and the other are NACS.

We don’t have data about the number of stalls per location, but usually, there should be at least a few bays.

The Walmart app is essential for initiating a charging session and paying for charging (the payment method must be set for the user account). Pricing is displayed in the Walmart app before the start of the session (it varies by location and/or time of day) and remains locked for the duration of the session.

Hungary, Slovakia and Poland voted against the agreement, despite other nations agreeing to key compromises including allowing flexibility for member states to buy carbon credits internationally to reach their emissions targets and for the EU to reassess its climate policy depending on economic performance. The agreement also allows for postponing a new carbon trading plan covering transport and heating, a central demand of Poland.

Environmentalists criticized the deal for provisions that will allow the EU to buy carbon credits from less-developed countries, effectively outsourcing the bloc’s obligations. “The use of offshore carbon laundering to meet this nominal target means the EU’s own commitment is much lower, and that commitment means even less with a baked-in clause to dilute the target every two years,” said Greenpeace EU climate campaigner Thomas Gelin. Jeroen Gerlag, Europe director at the nonprofit Climate Group, said that “while the EU keeps its 90% commitment on paper, in effect it’ll be offshoring some of its emission reductions – making it someone else’s problem.”

The agreement was hammered out between EU climate ministers in a marathon session overnight into Wednesday morning. Before it becomes a legally-binding document, the European Parliament will vote on it and negotiate its contents with the European Council.

“This is exactly the signal that Europe has to send in these times,” said Swedish climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari, who thanked Finland, Germany, Spain and the Netherlands for pushing for high emissions cuts in the debate.

Wopke Hoekstra, the European Commissioner for Climate, Net-Zero and Clean Growth, said the agreement is strong compared to those of allies in the Pacific, Europe and North America, but that some compromise was necessary amid current geopolitical and economic tension.

“On this continent, we will continue with climate action, but it has to be bridged, it has to be married with independence and competitiveness. Not one without the other. All three are essential,” he said.

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some see climate regulations as shackling the economy, while others say Europe will either make and sell renewables or be forced to buy energy or green products from countries like China.

Texas’ independent grid is meeting a large portion of the state’s rising electricity demand through its growing fleet of solar facilities, wind power generators and batteries, according to the US Energy Information Administration (EIA).

In the first nine months of 2025, the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) saw record demand on the grid compared with the same period in previous years.

The Texas grid also had the fastest electricity demand growth among US electric grids between 2024 and 2025, a trend expected to continue through next year. ERCOT is tracking more than 200 gigawatts of large load interconnection requests—large energy users like data centers and industrial facilities looking to connect and buy power from Texas’ wholesale electricity market.

Utility-scale solar has led the growing number of renewable energy sources helping ERCOT meet its skyrocketing demand. Together, wind and solar generation met more than one third of ERCOT’s electricity demand in the first nine months of this year, according to the EIA.

Solar power has generated 45 terrawatt hours of electricity so far this year—50 percent more than the same period in 2024 and nearly four times more than the same period in 2021.

The availability of solar generation in ERCOT also has reduced the need for gas-fired generation during midday hours, according to the EIA. This energy production comes despite attempts by some Texas lawmakers earlier this year to restrict renewable development across the state.

For Dennis Wamsted, an energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis, ERCOT’s growing share of renewables shows that it’s the preferred resource type when an energy market is open, like Texas’ deregulated market.

“People are going to build solar and wind, and now battery storage, essentially as quickly as they possibly can,” Wamsted said. “It’s economic—it is what customers want.”

ERCOT has become the place to build power projects quickly in the US. Because it’s the grid with the fastest interconnection process, developers are able to get projects online within a few years.

The friendly regulatory environment has made it the norm for some generators to not only sell to the ERCOT market, but to also sell their power privately to companies through power purchase agreements. It allows both the generator and the company to lock in a price, offering them both cost security for years from an otherwise shifting ERCOT market. These options make ERCOT the grid to build renewables in bulk, Wamsted said.

“It wouldn’t be happening if they weren’t also reliable and cost effective,” Wamsted said of renewables. “Nobody’s running out to build something that’s overpriced and can’t be counted on.”

Throughout the next five years, supply should be able to keep up with the quick pace of demand coming to ERCOT, said Nathalie Limandibhratha, BloombergNEF’s US power analyst. But BloombergNEF’s forecasts show that in 10 years, Texas’ supply will no longer be able to keep up. There will be an imbalance if demand continues to march on at the same pace, said Limandibhratha.

While solar and storage are expected to maintain similar growth rates, part of the supply shortfall is due to the decline of thermal energy additions after 2030, Limandibhratha said. Meanwhile, in the last year, BloombergNEF’s forecast for solar and storage was revised upward significantly as the market moves quickly, she said.

While natural gas remains the largest source of electricity within ERCOT, meeting 43 percent of 2025 demand, its generation has flattened in recent years, according to the EIA. In the first nine months of 2023 and 2024, natural gas powered 47 percent of the state’s electricity.

Wind generation this year through September totaled 87 terrawatt hours, up 4 percent compared to the same period in 2024 and 36 percent since 2021. This growth comes despite political headwinds against the resource type.

A new study from researchers at Northern Arizona University and Duke University tackles this claim head-on. The research, published in the journal PLOS Climate, confirms the “upfront carbon cost” of an EV is real, but finds that it’s completely erased after just two years of driving. This matters because it provides a clear break-even point, showing that over a vehicle’s lifetime, a gas-powered car causes at least twice as much environmental damage as an EV.

The researchers didn’t shy away from the messy side of EV production. They analyzed the energy-intensive manufacturing process, including the mining of lithium for batteries. Their analysis found that in the first two years, an EV is indeed responsible for 30% higher carbon dioxide emissions than a gasoline vehicle. This initial carbon “debt” is the core of the skeptical argument against EVs.

The study’s crucial finding, however, is how quickly that debt is paid. According to study co-author and Duke professor Drew Shindell, while there is a bigger footprint in the “very short term,” an EV driver “very quickly you come out ahead in CO2 emissions by year three.” After that break-even point, the EV is “far ahead” for the rest of its life, resulting in a “cumulatively much lower carbon footprint.” The researchers’ models found that over their entire lifespans, gasoline vehicles cause at least double the environmental harm of their electric counterparts.

The researchers didn’t just look at today’s power grid; they modeled four different scenarios for EV adoption and clean energy growth through 2050. They found that the EV’s environmental advantage is set to widen significantly as solar and wind power replace fossil fuels. “When you add a bunch of electric vehicles, nobody’s going to build new coal-fired power plants to run these things because coal is really expensive compared to renewables,” Shindell said. This means that as the grid gets cleaner, so does every EV that’s plugged into it.

This research lands at a challenging time for EVs in the United States. The study’s authors note that while their findings show a “really clear way” to reduce climate change and air pollution, the current administration’s policies are “really misguided.” President Donald Trump has reversed the previous administration’s 2030 EV targets, and Congress has terminated federal tax credits for EV purchases. While outside experts noted the study didn’t address the separate issue of battery recycling or disposal, its central conclusion directly contradicts the policy push for fossil fuels, confirming that the switch to EVs is a key strategy for decarbonizing transportation.",https://dataconomy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/researchers-find-electric-cars-erase-their-carbon-debt-in-under-two-years.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 09:18:14.315229

The deal among nearly 200 nations offered a potential “turning point for the world,” then-U.S. President Barack Obama said. Eventually, almost every country on Earth signed the 2015 Paris Agreement, a pact whose success would rest on peer pressure, rising ambition and the economics of a clean energy revolution.

But 10 years later, the actions needed to fulfill those hopes are falling short.

The United States has quit the deal — twice. President Donald Trump is throttling green energy projects at home and finding allies to help him undermine climate initiatives abroad, while inking trade deals that commit countries to buying more U.S. fossil fuels.

Europe remains on track to meet its climate commitments, but its resolve is wavering, as price-weary voters and the rise of far-right parties raise doubts about how quickly the bloc can deliver its pledge to turn away from fossil fuels.

Paris has helped ingrain climate change awareness in popular culture and policy, led countries and companies to pledge to cut their carbon pollution to zero and helped steer a wave of investments into clean energy. Scientists say it appears to have lessened the odds of the most catastrophic levels of warming.

On the downside, oil and gas production hasn’t yet peaked, and climate pollution and temperatures are still rising — with the latter just tenths of a degree from the tipping point agreed in Paris. But the costs of green energy have fallen so much that, in most parts of the world, it’s the cheapest form of power and is being installed at rates unthinkable 10 years ago.

World leaders and diplomats who are in Brazil starting this week for the United Nations’ annual climate talks will face a test to stand up for Paris in the face of Trump’s opposition while highlighting that its goal are both necessary and beneficial.

The summit in the Amazonian port city of Belém was supposed to be the place where rich and poor countries would celebrate their progress and commit themselves to ever-sharper cuts in greenhouse gas pollution.

Instead, U.S. contempt for global climate efforts and a muddled message from Europe are adding headwinds to a moment that is far more turbulent than the one in which the Paris Agreement was adopted.

Some climate veterans are still optimists — to a point.

“I think that the basic architecture is resistant to Trump’s destruction,” said John Podesta, chair of the board of the liberal Center for American Progress, who coordinated climate policy under Obama and former President Joe Biden. But that resistance could wilt if the U.S. stays outside the agreement, depriving the climate movement of American leadership and support, he said.

“If all that’s gone, and it’s gone for a long time, I don’t know whether the structure holds together,” Podesta added.

Other climate diplomats say the cooperative spirit of 2015 would be hard to recreate now, which is why acting on Paris is so essential.

“If we had to renegotiate Paris today, we’d never get the agreement that we had 10 years ago,” said Rachel Kyte, the United Kingdom’s special climate representative.

“But we can also look to these extraordinary data points, which show that the direction of travel is very clear,” she said, referring to growth of clean energy. “And most people who protect where their money is going to be are interested in that direction of travel.”

The Paris paradox

One thing that hasn’t faded is the business case for clean energy. If anything, the economic drivers behind the investments that Paris helped unleash have surpassed even what the Paris deal’s authors anticipated.

But the political will to keep countries driving forward has stalled in some places as the United States — the world’s largest economy, sole military superpower and historically biggest climate polluter — attacks its very foundation.

Trump’s attempts to undermine the agreement, summed up by the 2017 White House slogan “Pittsburgh, not Paris,” has affected European ambitions as well, French climate diplomat Laurence Tubiana told reporters late last month.

“I have never seen such aggressivity against national climate policy all over because of the U.S.,” said Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Agreement. “So we are really confronted with an ideological battle, a cultural battle, where climate is in that package the U.S. government wants to defeat.”

The White House said Trump is focused on developing U.S. oil and engaging with world leaders on energy issues, rather than what it dubs the “green new scam.” The U.S. will not send high-level representatives to COP30.

“The Green New Scam would have killed America if President Trump had not been elected to implement his commonsense energy agenda,” said Taylor Rogers, a spokesperson. “President Trump will not jeopardize our country’s economic and national security to pursue vague climate goals that are killing other countries.”

Trump is not the only challenge facing Paris, of course.

Even under Obama, the U.S. insisted that the Paris climate pollution targets had to be nonbinding, avoiding the need for a Senate ratification vote that would most likely fail.

But unlike previous climate pacts that the U.S. had declined to join, all countries — including, most notably, China — would have to submit a pollution-cutting plan. The accord left it up to the governments themselves to carry out their own pledges and to push laggards to do better. An unusual confluence of political winds helped drive the bargaining.

Obama, who was staking part of his legacy on getting a global climate agreement, had spent the year leading up to Paris negotiating a separate deal with China in which both countries committed to cutting their world-leading pollution.

France, the host of the Paris talks, was also determined to strike a worldwide pact.

In the year that followed, more than 160 countries submitted their initial plans to tackle climate change domestically and began working to finish the rules that would undergird the agreement.

“The Paris Agreement isn’t a machine that churns out ambition. It basically reflects back to us the level of ambition that we have agreed to … and suggests what else is needed to get back on track,” said Kaveh Guilanpour, vice president for international strategies at the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions and a negotiator for the United Kingdom during the Paris talks. “Whether countries do that or not, it’s essentially then a matter for them.”

Catherine McKenna, Canada’s former environment minister and a lead negotiator of the Paris Agreement’s carbon crediting mechanism, called the deal an “incredible feat” — but not a self-executing one.

“The problem is now it’s really up to countries as well as cities, regions, companies and financial institutions to act,” she said. “It’s not a treaty thing anymore — it’s now, ‘Do the work.’”

When green turns gray

Signs of discord are not hard to find around the globe.

China is tightening its grip on clean energy manufacturing and exports, ensuring more countries have access to low-cost renewables, but creating tensions in places that also want to benefit from jobs and revenue from making those goods and fear depending too much on one country.

Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney, a former United Nations climate envoy, eliminated his country’s consumer carbon tax and is planning to tap more natural gas to toughen economic defenses against the United States.

The European Union spent the past five years developing a vast web of green regulations and sectoral measures, and the bloc estimates that it’s roughly on track to meet those goals. But many of the EU’s 27 governments — under pressure from the rising far right, high energy prices, the decline of traditional industry and Russia’s war against Ukraine — are now demanding that the EU reevaluate many of those policies.

Still, views within the bloc diverge sharply, with some pushing for small tweaks and others for rolling back large swaths of legislation.

“Europe must remain a continent of consistency,” French President Emmanuel Macron said after a meeting of EU leaders in October. “It must step up on competitiveness, but it must not give up on its [climate] goals.”

Poland’s Prime Minister Donald Tusk, in contrast, said after the same meeting that he felt vindicated about his country’s long-standing opposition to the EU’s green agenda: “In most European capitals, people today think differently about these exaggerated European climate ambitions.”

Worldwide, most countries have not submitted their latest carbon-cutting plans to the United Nations. While the plans that governments have announced mostly expand on their previous ones, they still make only modest reductions against what is needed to limit Earth’s warming since the preindustrial era to 1.5 degrees Celsius.

Exceeding that threshold, scientists say, would lead to more lives lost and physical and economic damage that would be ever harder to recover from with each tenth of a degree of additional warming.

The U.N.’s latest report showing the gap between countries’ new pledges and the Paris targets found that the world is on track for between 2.3 and 2.5 degrees of warming, a marginal difference from plans submitted in 2020 that is largely canceled out when the U.S. pledge is omitted. Policies in place now are pointing toward 2.8 degrees of warming.

“We need unprecedented cuts to greenhouse gas emissions now in an ever-compressing timeframe and amid a challenging geopolitical context,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.

But doing so also makes sense, she added. “This where the market is showing that these kind of investments in smart, clean and green is actually driving jobs and opportunities. This is where the future lies.”

U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said in a video message Tuesday that overshooting the 1.5-degrees target of Paris was now inevitable in the coming years imploring leaders to rapidly roll out renewables and stop expanding oil, gas and coal to ensure that overshoot was short-lived.

“We’re in a huge mess,” said Bill Hare, a longtime climate scientist who founded the policy institute Climate Analytics.

Greenhouse gas pollution hasn’t fallen, and action has flat lined even as climate-related disasters have increased.

“I think what’s upcoming is a major test for the Paris Agreement, probably the major test. Can this agreement move forward under the weight of all of these challenges?” Hare asked. “If it can’t do that, governments are going to be asking about the benefits of it, frankly.”

That doesn’t mean all is lost.

In 2015, the world was headed for around 4 degrees Celsius of warming, an amount that researchers say would have been devastating for much of the planet. Today, that projection is roughly a degree Celsius lower.

“I think a lot of us in Paris were very dubious at the time that we would ever limit warming to 1.5,” said Elliot Diringer, a former climate official who led the Center for Climate and Energy Solutions’ international program during the Paris talks.

“The question is whether we are better off by virtue of the Paris Agreement,” he said. “I think the answer is yes. Are we where we need to be? Absolutely not.”

Green technology defying expectations

In addition, the adoption of clean energy technology has moved even faster than projected — sparking what one climate veteran has called a shift in global climate politics.

“We are no longer in a world in which only climate politics has a leading role and a substantial role, but increasingly, climate economics,” said Christiana Figueres, executive secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change in 2015. “Yes, politics is important; no longer as important as it was 10 years ago.”

Annual solar deployment globally is 15 times greater than the International Energy Agency predicted in 2015, according to a recent analysis from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit, a U.K. nonprofit.

Renewables now account for more than 90 percent of new power capacity added globally every year, BloombergNEF reported. China is deploying record amounts of renewables and lowering costs for countries such as Brazil and Pakistan, which has seen solar installations skyrocket.

Even in the United States, where Trump repealed many of Biden’s tax breaks and other incentives, BloombergNEF predicts that power companies will continue to deploy green sources, in large part because they’re often the fastest source of new electricity.

Costs for wind and batteries and falling, too. Electric vehicle sales are soaring in many countries, thanks in large part to the huge number of inexpensive vehicles being pumped out by China’s BYD, the world’s largest EV-maker.

Worldwide clean energy investments are now twice as much as fossil fuels spending, according to the International Energy Agency.

“Today, you can actually talk about deploying clean energy technologies just because of their cost competitiveness and ability to lower energy system costs,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at the research institution Energy Innovation. “You don’t actually even have to say ‘climate’ for a lot of them, and that just wasn’t true 10 years ago.”

The economic trends of the past decade have been striking, said Todd Stern, the U.S. climate envoy who negotiated the Paris Agreement.

“Paris is something that was seen all over the world, seen by other countries, seen in boardrooms, as the first time in more than 20 years when you finally got heads of government saying, ‘Yes, let’s do this,’” he said. “And that’s not the only reason why there was tremendous technological development, but it sure didn’t hurt.”

Still, limits exist to how far businesses can take the clean energy transition on their own.

“You need government intervention of some kind, whether that’s a stick or a carrot, to push the economy towards a low-carbon trajectory,” said Andrew Wilson, deputy secretary general of policy at the International Chamber of Commerce. “If governments press the brakes on climate action or seriously start to soft pedal, then it does have a limiting effect.”

Gov. Mike Braun has pledged to be the entrepreneurial governor, but that vision will require reliable, affordable electricity to come to fruition, and the infrastructure to carry it.

That means building more power plants and the transmission lines needed to transport the electrons to economic demand centers. But while Indiana and other Midwestern stakeholders have engaged in a years-long evaluation of infrastructure solutions to meet the region’s needs, culminating in a transmission portfolio that will deliver historic benefits, out-of-state interests are now seeking to block the very development needed to enable entrepreneurial growth.

The Midwestern grid operator (MISO) is a national leader in transmission planning and has developed a plan to meet the region’s needs. After 300 meetings and 40,000 hours of staff time in development, MISO approved a portfolio of power lines in late 2024 that will help ensure reliable, affordable power for decades to come. That decision followed rounds of feedback and expansive stakeholder outreach among the states in the region, including Indiana.

All told, the portfolio is expected to deliver $72 billion in net benefits over the power lines’ first two decades in service, saving residents up to $3 for every dollar invested. In Indiana, the projects are expected to create upwards of 7,100 direct local jobs and spur up to $2.6 billion in total economic output.

Opposition states

Yet the public service commissions in Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Dakota, and Montana filed a federal complaint seeking to derail the portfolio, arguing MISO used a flawed cost-benefit analysis. The filing comes nearly eight months after the grid operator approved the portfolio and nearly two years after planning was underway with the methodology in question. Notably, the southern states will not pay for the projects, as their costs will be distributed only among the states where they are constructed.

This complaint serves only as an attempted roadblock to halt the projects Indiana needs. Our governor has warned that the state does not have enough power to meet growing demand. And power bills are skyrocketing. From 2024 to 2025, Indiana families saw a 17.5% increase on their monthly power bill, about $28 more on average.

Constructing these lines is critical to positioning Midwestern states to “attract investment, create jobs, and maintain leadership in emerging technologies and industrial innovation,” as Indiana’s Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski told federal regulators. She also touted Indiana’s steadfast support of the portfolio, acknowledging it will avoid “costly inefficiencies” and enable access to all generation resources across the Midwest.

These resources are critical to sustaining economic growth. With manufacturing comprising more than 26% of the state’s GDP, Indiana’s industrial sector is the greatest electricity-consuming industry. Our state is the national leader in steelmaking as well as vehicle manufacturing, having produced about 84% of recreational vehicles sold in 2023. Further growth in these energy-intensive sectors will require considerably more electricity. But without additional transmission capacity, that growth could strain the grid, resulting in even higher electricity prices and increased risk of power outages. Building a well-planned grid is imperative to meeting challenges for decades to come.

Enabling big business for the future will require smart infrastructure decisions now. Continued investment depends upon the availability of reliable, affordable electricity that will help ensure Indiana remains an attractive place for entrepreneurial leaders.

Ultimately, Indiana joined other Midwestern stakeholders to craft a plan that will serve our collective needs. Hoosier leaders are committed to ensuring reliable, affordable, secure power, and the federal government has no business stepping in the way of our forward progress. While other states may choose alternative energy solutions, Indiana remains committed to building a grid that will enable economic prosperity well into the future.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/electrical-pylons.jpeg,N,,2025-11-05 12:14:14.093523

SLINGERLANDS, N.Y., Nov. 05, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Plug Power Inc. (NASDAQ: PLUG), a global leader in comprehensive hydrogen solutions for the hydrogen economy, today announced it has started installation of its 5 MW electrolyzer for the H2 Hollandia project, the first decentralized green hydrogen hub initiative currently under construction in the Netherlands. Developed by Novar and Avitec, the project links the 115-MWp Vloeivelden Hollandia solar park directly to a Plug electrolyzer system, establishing a new model and serving as a path for localized, small and midscale renewable hydrogen production.

The electrolyzer at H2 Hollandia produces green hydrogen without placing any additional burden on the electricity grid. Because the system is directly connected to the adjacent solar farm, it can convert surplus solar generation, energy that would otherwise be curtailed, into hydrogen that can be stored and distributed for use in transport and industry

The project broke ground in early September and is scheduled to be operational in 2026. Upon completion, H2 Hollandia will be the first operational electrolyzer hydrogen hub in the Netherlands producing entirely green hydrogen and delivering roughly 300,000 kilograms annually for sustainable mobility and industrial use across the region.

“H2 Hollandia is a powerful example of how renewable energy and hydrogen production can be seamlessly integrated at scale,” said Jose Luis Crespo, President and Chief Revenue Officer of Plug. “The project demonstrates how Plug’s electrolyzer technology can help relieve grid congestion, strengthen energy resilience, and accelerate industrial decarbonization. This project is an important step in our broader European expansion, as we continue deploying commercial-scale systems that make clean hydrogen production both practical and scalable.”

“Plug’s electrolyzer technology is a key enabler of H2 Hollandia’s vision,” said H2 Hollandia representative. “By directly integrating Plug’s system with our solar park, we’re able to convert renewable energy into green hydrogen without adding stress to the grid. This is critical to realizing the Netherlands’ hydrogen hub ambitions. This collaboration shows what’s possible when advanced technology and strong regional partnerships come together to accelerate our clean energy transition.”

H2 Hollandia reflects the Dutch government’s broader hydrogen strategy, where public-policy support and regional cooperation join to advance the Netherlands as a major hydrogen hub in Northwest Europe. Clean hydrogen is essential to the energy transition, enabling new jobs, improved air quality, and reduction of carbon emissions across industry, mobility, and infrastructure. Through this approach, the region is building one of the Netherlands’ most advanced clean-energy ecosystems, positioning local industry, transport, and utilities to meet the Dutch government’s targets for hydrogen deployment, infrastructure readiness, and achieving long-term climate neutrality.

For Plug Power, the project marks a significant expansion of its presence in the Netherlands and follows the company’s ongoing operations at the Green Box facility in Hengelo, where Plug operates a demonstration site showcasing its PEM electrolyzer and integrated hydrogen systems. With H2 Hollandia now entering the installation phase, Plug transitions from demonstration to full commercial deployment in one of Europe’s most dynamic hydrogen markets. Plug Power continues to build a fully integrated hydrogen ecosystem—from production and storage to distribution and power generation—to help customers and partners achieve their business and sustainability objectives across industrial, transportation and energy sectors in North America and Europe.

Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions.
Even in wealthy countries, the poor face climate impacts It’s not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide.
People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.
With poverty ‘not budging,’ why focus on climate change?","RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — When summer heat comes to the Arara neighborhood in northern Rio, it lingers, baking the red brick and concrete that make up many of the buildings long after the sun has gone down. Luis Cassiano, who’s lived here more than 30 years, says he’s getting worried as heat waves become more frequent and fierce.

In poor areas such as Arara, those who can afford air conditioning — Cassiano is one — can’t always count on it because of frequent power outages on an overloaded system. Cassiano gets some relief from the green roof he installed about a decade ago, which can keep his house up to 15 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than his neighbor’s, but he still struggles to stay comfortable.

“The sun in the summer nowadays is scary,” Cassiano said.

As world leaders come to Brazil for climate talks, people like Cassiano are the ones with the most at stake. Poor communities are often more vulnerable to hazards like extreme heat and supersized storms and less likely to have the resources to cope than wealthier places.

Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions. They also need to find the political will to implement them, as well as come up with the billions of dollars needed to adapt everything from harvests to houses to better withstand human-caused climate change.

All of it is sorely needed for the 1.1 billion people around the world who live in acute poverty, according to the United Nations.

That’s why many have lauded the choice of Belem, a relatively poor city, to host these talks.

“I am pleased that we will be going to a place like this, because this is where climate meets poverty, meets demand, meets financing needs, and meets the reality of the majority of the population of this world that are impacted by climate change,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.

Even in wealthy countries, the poor face climate impacts

It’s not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.

People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.

They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.

“It’s not just, climate destroys buildings or bridges or property. It destroys the livelihoods of families. And if you don’t have savings, that’s really devastating,” Brandon said.

Crop yields suffer in many places, but worst in poor countries

Even relatively developed countries with more ways to adapt will see some farm yields drop significantly, according to a UNDP analysis of global agriculture under different warming scenarios.

But poorer countries will be more severely affected, said Heriberto Tapia, head of research and strategic partnerships advisor at the UNDP Human Development Report Office.

Tapia said Africa, with more than 500 million people in poverty, is a big concern. Many depend on crop yields for their livelihoods.

Most of the world’s 550 million small agricultural producers are in low- or middle-income countries, working in marginal environments and more vulnerable to climate hazards, said Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of CGIAR, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research.

Elouafi thinks technology can help ease the climate pressure on many of those farmers, but also noted that many can’t afford it. She’s not confident that this year’s COP will provide enough money to help with that.

Will holding COP30 in the Global South make a difference?

Brazilian officials thought Belem, on the edge of the Amazon and not a rich city, would be a forceful reminder for negotiators of the difficulty that climate change and rising extreme weather are bringing to millions of people every day.

“I heard there were a lot of negotiators who have been complaining of being put on a bunk bed, or in terms of sharing a room, but this is the reality of most people around the world,” said Nafkote Dabi, climate policy lead at global development organization Oxfam. “So I think it makes things real.”

But some experts were skeptical, despite the recent UNDP report saying the need to take action is urgent.

“I wish that they had said more about what exactly is the rapid action that needs to be taken, because I don’t think rapid action is going to come out of COP,” said Kimberly Marion Suiseeya, an associate professor at Duke University who studies how international policies impact people in rural and forested areas.

With poverty ‘not budging,’ why focus on climate change?

Although the public narrative has long been that humankind has generally been making progress on alleviating poverty, numbers show that now there’s a “stagnation,” said Pedro Conceição, director of the Human Development Report Office at the UNDP. “The numbers are high and they are not budging.”

In a memo ahead of COP30, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called for a shift from prioritizing reducing emissions to focus on reducing human suffering. On climate change, “there’s no apocalyptic story for rich countries,” he said. “The place where it gets really tough is in these poor countries.”

But Conceição said it’s wrong to think about poverty reduction and climate as a tradeoff.

The idea that climate is only a future problem, “or it’s about things out there like glaciers melting, needs to be completely thrown out and replaced with the notion that actually the two agendas are one and the same,” he said.

Canada’s critical minerals strategy under Defence Production Act: New policies guarantee buyers for domestic producers and hint at government-backed price floors to counter China’s supply chain dominance

C$6.4 billion investment in 26 mining projects: Funding supports extraction, processing and battery technology, with offtake deals for graphite, scandium, and rare earths

Global push for secure supply chains: Canada joins G7 allies in reducing reliance on China, with potential for a ‘buyers’ club’ and coordinated pricing benchmarks

The announcement, made at last week’s G7 Energy and Environment Summit in Toronto, reflects growing concern among Western nations about China’s dominance in the critical minerals supply chain, where it still accounts for roughly 70% of global refining capacity.

Energy and Natural Resources Minister Tim Hodgson outlined a first round of C$6.4 billion ($4.56 billion) G7 investment across 26 Canadian mining projects, aimed at supporting both extraction and downstream processing.

This includes offtake agreements with Rio Tinto at its scandium plant in Sorel-Tracy in Quebec and with Northern Graphite at its Lac des Iles graphite project near Montreal, Quebec. There’s also investment in rare earths and nickel and lithium-ion battery technology, as well as recycling.

While government offtake prices are being kept confidential, policymakers have hinted that future rounds could include guaranteed or floor-price mechanisms designed to give producers stronger long-term certainty.

The Canadian move comes amid heightened global attention on securing critical minerals, including for national security and defence. By combining direct investment, offtake arrangements and potential price support measures, Canada’s strategy aims to signal to investors that long-term domestic projects can be bankable despite competition from lower-cost Chinese producers.

The timing of the announcement also coincides with similar efforts in the United States and European Union, where governments are exploring subsidies, tax incentives and strategic stockpiles to reduce reliance on single-source suppliers.

For minerals such as scandium, which have historically faced small, volatile markets and high barriers to entry, the improvement to financing conditions could be immense. The policy is also seen as part of a broader international effort to reduce reliance on China, with preliminary discussions under way for a G7 ‘buyers’ club’ to coordinate procurement and potentially establish common pricing benchmarks among allied nations.

Demand-side projections further underline the stakes. Analysis by the Canadian Climate Institute estimates domestic demand for critical minerals could reach C$16 billion annually by 2040, driven by battery manufacturing, electric vehicle production, and clean energy infrastructure.

That surge in demand is creating pressure to secure a reliable, locally-controlled supply chain – particularly for minerals where Canada has known deposits but has historically lacked processing capacity.

Implications for producers and investors

For producers and investors, the key question is whether these initiatives will translate into accelerated project timelines. The combination of government-backed capital and offtake agreements could reduce risk for early-stage projects, allowing developers to move more quickly from exploration to production.

Challenges remain – environmental permitting, community consultations and technological hurdles could slow deployment even with financial incentives – but the bigger picture is positive.

As more allied nations roll out similar measures, more global supply sources could come online, easing China’s dominance and giving Canada and its partners new openings to scale quickly.

For the broader industry, the policy introduces a new layer of complexity. If implemented, guaranteed prices could anchor domestic production – but they may also affect global pricing dynamics if other G7 nations follow suit.

While offtake deals won’t establish tradable benchmarks, they could steady price expectations and encourage project financing – especially if allied governments adopt similar arrangements.

The key now will be how quickly projects move from exploration to production, and whether Canada’s approach can attract sufficient private capital to complement government support.

Perhaps more importantly, Canada’s strategy highlights a key trend: Western governments are increasingly willing to intervene directly in strategic mineral markets, signalling a shift from traditional laissez-faire commodity policies toward security-driven industrial planning.

For investors and producers in the sector, the next several years could be characterised by a flurry of activity as governments, miners and allied nations test the limits of this coordinated approach.

During the last decade, plans were made to retire two coal-burning units in Colorado, one in Pueblo and the other in Craig, by the end of 2025.

Now, those retirements are in doubt. It’s possible — some think likely — that in December the federal government will order utilities to continue operating the two coal units in 2026.

Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, the electrical provider for 15 cooperatives in Colorado, operates Craig 1. In an interview on Oct. 7, Duane Highley, the chief executive, said he had a “high degree of confidence, based on what I’m hearing from them today, that unless something changes, we are going to get an order to keep Craig 1 open past the end of the year.”

Highley had just returned from Washington, D.C., and meetings with officials from both the Department of Energy and the Energy Dominance Council.

On Oct. 29, Highley affirmed the same information. “I just talked with the White House this morning, and it’s still progressing.”

Xcel Energy owns and operates Comanche 2. In late August, Pueblo County announced it was seeking federal intervention to keep it operating. On Oct. 31, U.S. Rep. Jeff Hurd, whose congressional district encompasses both Craig and Pueblo, sent a letter to the Department of Energy asking it to order the plant to remain open beyond December. The letter also asks the DOE to order Xcel to operate Comanche 3 at full capacity until sufficient replacement generation is online.

Unlike Pueblo County’s request, which was couched as “just transition,” Hurd’s request was premised in the argument that the unit is needed for reliability.

Salient in Hurd’s letter was this statement: Xcel has “warned in formal filings that the state’s current resource plan does not meet industry standard reliability metrics.”

On Oct. 24, in brief remarks in Pueblo, Hurd had signaled that would be his argument.

“We’re facing a real reliability crisis here in Colorado,” he said.

He went on to say he hoped that Gov. Jared Polis and his administration would recognize that and agree to extend the life of Comanche 2 in light of the unexpected downtime for Comanche 3 in coming months.

“We have a reliability crisis, not only because the demand is going up, but also because unit 3 is down,” he said.

Does a reliability crisis truly exist in Colorado? If so, what caused it? And is federal intervention justified? In other words, has Colorado’s regulation of Xcel fallen short in some fundamental way, as Hurd’s letter and remarks suggest. Or instead, might this be a manufactured crisis, a ploy in the high-stakes poker game between regulators and the regulated?

Trump uses seldom-invoked law

The Trump administration clearly wants to keep coal plants operating. In September, for example, the Department of Energy announced $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate America’s coal industry.”

Part of that mission has been to delay retirement of coal plants or, in some cases, reopen them. This law may will be most pertinent to Colorado.

In late May, the Department of Energy cited a seldom-used provision in the Federal Power Act called 202(c) in ordering the 1,420-megawatt J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan to remain open a week before its scheduled closing. A week later, it cited the same law in ordering an oil-and-gas electrical plant near Philadelphia to continue operations. The plant was one day from closing.

The 1935 law, according to the Georgetown University Law Center, permits the use of emergency authority for only 90 days in the event of war, because of a sudden increase in the demand for electricity, or because of a shortage of electricity. The Department of Energy cited energy shortages as justification for use of 202(c) powers in Michigan and Pennsylvania.

The Georgetown center said such 202(c) orders had not previously been used by the federal government in violation of what the regional grid operator wanted. Colorado has no true grid operator, although Xcel Energy is one of two balancing authorities, The Western Area Power Administration is the other.

E&E News by Politico reported in a Sept. 25 story that the Trump administration was also considering use of a different law, the Defense Production Act, to justify continued operation of mostly uneconomical coal power plants operating across the country.

The same publication on Oct. 28 reported that the DOE had solicited outside legal expertise in “statutory interpretation, regulatory analysis, and challenges to agency actions under the Federal Power Act.” The budget for this outside legal help could run to $50 million.

In Pueblo on Oct. 24, at an Action Colorado conference, Hurd reported talking with Xcel Energy folks at the Comanche plant earlier that morning. They told him that demand that had been growing about 0.5% a year now has been projected to rise between 3% and 7%. That stress, said Hurd, a former attorney for Delta-Montrose Electric and other electrical cooperatives, was making “reliable energy a top issue.”

On Oct. 31, after Hurd announced his request, the Colorado Energy Office issued this biting response: “The Trump administration already illegally ripped away $600 million dollars for clean energy jobs-creating projects across the state. … It’s important to point out that wind and solar are cheaper for consumers than expensive and often unreliable coal-fired generation, and utility resource planning is subject to state — not federal — jurisdiction.”

That mirrored the statement from Polis provided to Big Pivots in mid-October:

“The Trump Administration wants to drag us backwards into an overreliance on a non-renewable resource creating a larger economic burden on the state and consumers. Orders like these would hurt Colorado ratepayers, and harm rural communities across the West who could be forced to absorb the unnecessary excess costs required to keep these unreliable plants operational.”

Looming in the background is the alliance of President Donald Trump with fossil fuel interests. In 2016, campaigning in Grand Junction, he vowed to bring coal back. He failed. Instead, prices of renewable energy plummeted and utilities readied plans to close coal plants.

In May 2024, according to the Washington Post, Trump told oil, gas and other fossil fuel executives that if they delivered $1 billion to his campaign, he’d help them out. All available evidence indicates he got less than asked but still substantial amounts, primarily from oil and gas.

Who decides what is needed?

The National Energy Dominance Council — one of the agencies visited by Highley on his trip to Washington — was created by Trump in February. In a story published in August, Politico said the new agency’s mission is to make the United States “energy dominant” by providing affordable, reliable energy to Americans while still generating enough electricity to power the boom in artificial intelligence.

Chris Wright, a Coloradan, is secretary of Energy and deputy director of the Energy Dominance Council. He was formerly the CEO of Liberty Energy, an oil and gas production services company based in Denver.

Highley said that Tri-State itself has excess generating capacity and does not need to continue operations of the coal-burning unit at Craig to ensure reliability. Supplies in the Western Interconnection Grid, of which Colorado is a part, have been tightening.

Sharing of electricity, however, remains hampered by lack of adequate transmission and organized markets. This is widely recognized in Colorado and beyond. The Western Governors Association held a conference in Denver just days before Hurd’s letter devoted to transmission.

Keeping the coal unit in Craig operating beyond its scheduled retirement will pose logistical challenges. The order under the 202(c) provision cannot be delivered until late this year, shortly before retirement. Further, the law allows orders for only 90 days, although they can be renewed.

Tri-State would have to procure the coal for the plant and have the workers in place to operate the plant. It has already announced plans to close the ColoWyo Mine, located about 20 miles south of Craig, late this year. However, Trapper Mine continues operations near the Craig plant as does Peabody’s Twenty Mile Mine between Hayden and Oak Creek.

Cost may be a greater issue. In January 2020, Highley announced Tri-State’s plans to get out of coal in Colorado. The reason, aside from state mandates, was cost. Coal has become the expensive fuel.

“How do we keep a coal plant operating for reliability of the overall Western Grid? Tri-State does not need it for our needs,” said Highley. “We have surplus capacity. But overall the Western grid does have some concerns about resource adequacy. So how do we keep a unit open that maybe isn’t in our financial interest but that the government says is in the national interest?”

“I’ve been asking, ‘Who’s going to pay for running this unit if we get an order that says it has to keep running,’” added Highley. “So far, no one has pulled out their checkbook. I hate for this burden to be placed on rural America. You know, our members, including farmers and ranchers, many are struggling to pay their bills today.”

Xcel Energy has been consistently restrained in its comments. It points to retirements approved by Colorado regulators: Comanche 2 in 2025, Hayden 2 in 2027, and Hayden 1 in 2028, followed by the retirement of Comanche 3 by the end of 2030. It is also replacing coal with gas at Pawnee.

In a brief interview on Oct. 29, Robert Kenney, the president of Xcel’s Denver-based division, Public Service Co. of Colorado, added a little more depth.

“We’ve been preparing to retire that plant (Comanche 2) by the end of the year since 2018, and so we’ll have to make sure that it is prepared to be able to run beyond the end of the year,” he said. “That’s going to obviously require some maintenance and some upkeep. If we get an order telling us to do that, we’ll have to examine the actual language of the order, understand what it requires of us. But we’ll comply with the law.”

Xcel also issued a statement on Oct. 31: “We are in regular conversations about Colorado’s energy future with various stakeholders, including federal, state and local elected officials. We are aware that there are members of the community that would like to see the plant’s life extended. ”

In ordering that fossil fuel plants remain open, the Trump administration assumes their value in providing baseload generation. In practice, no plants — coal, gas, and nuclear — operate without downtime for maintenance.

Unexpected outages can occur. Few coal plants have been as trouble-plagued as Xcel’s 750-megawatt Comanche 3. It was offline about 90 days each year during its first decade of operations, which began in 2010. Beginning in 2020, the unit was down for more than a year. Outages have been frequent since then.

In August, the unit went down again. This time, it’s not expected to resume operations until June 2026.

Comanche 2 — the unit scheduled for retirement in December — has had no comparable problems. It went online in 1975. Craig 1 has also had relatively few problems since operations began in 1980. They’re not 100%, but neither have they been lemons.

Plans laid in past decade

Retirements of both Comanche 2 and Craig 1 have been planned for years. In the case of Craig 1, Tri-State and its co-owners — Fort Collins-based Platte River Power Authority, Xcel Energy and also Salt River Project and PacifiCorp — were sued because of the contributions of the coal-burning units at Craig and Nucla to pollution that impaired air quality in the Mount Zirkel and other designated wilderness areas and national parks on the Western Slope. This deteriorated air quality violated the regional haze standards set by the EPA.

Tri-State and its co-owners could have installed equipment limiting emissions of nitrous oxide by 2021. Instead, they agree to close Craig 1 by 2025. Costs of wind, especially, but also solar were then plummeting, making continued operations of coal less attractive.

Comanche 2’s closing was planned in 2018. The order by the Colorado Public Utilities Commission said Xcel would close the 335-megawatt unit “no later than the end of 2025.”

That PUC decision had been preceded by a response to Xcel’s request for bids that in December 2017 had caused slackened jaws — not just in Colorado, but across the nation. The PUC decision noted that Xcel’s solicitation had “garnered an exceptional number of diverse and low-cost bids.” This, the PUC commissioners said, “provides a rare opportunity to capture some of the lowest resource bids ever experienced in Colorado.”

Of note were the low cost of wind but also, for the first time in Colorado, utility-scale battery storage. The approved plan called for Xcel to purchase two existing gas plants.

Among the signatories to that PUC decision was then-Commissioner France Koncilja, now Pueblo County’s attorney in Comanche matters.

The PUC decision was issued in August 2018, several months before the election of Polis, who had run for governor on a platform of renewable energy. He had launched his campaign in Pueblo at the Solar Roast Coffee.

A month after the election of Polis, Xcel Energy summoned many to the Denver Museum of Nature and Science for a major announcement: It believed it could achieve an 80% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030 (compared to 2005 levels) and 100% by 2050 in the eight states in which it operated.

Polis spoke, too. “Elections have consequences,” he said.

Xcel’s goals were enshrined in state legislation in May 2019.

The 2021 electric resource plan filed by Xcel Energy continued this planning. By October 2024, when Xcel filed its latest resource plan with the PUC, it noted an “inflection point” in its energy transition from coal.

From an average annual growth in demand of 0.7% during the previous five years, it was projecting a compounded annual demand growth of 4% from 2023 through 2031 in its base case. Even in a low-growth scenario, demand would grow 2.8% annually,

Meeting this demand, explained Xcel’s Jack Ihle, an Xcel vice president, would require Xcel’s generating capacity to expand from its existing 7 gigawatts to somewhere between 7.6 GW and 9.6GW by the end of 2031. Keep in mind Comanche 3’s capacity: three-quarters of one gigawatt.

The document mentioned “resource adequacy” more than a dozen times.

Resource adequacy

Worries about “resource adequacy” have mounted during the last two years. The Seattle Times reported on Oct. 21 of growth in electricity demand of 0.9% three years ago in the Pacific Northwest to now 3.2% per year. Energy + Environmental Economics, a consultant, found the most probable occurrence for a blackout would be a days-long cold snap during a year of relatively little hydropower production. That, however, was unlikely in the next five years.

Colorado has had no blackouts due to inadequate resources. Xcel, however, issued an orange alert on Aug. 7, warning its 1.5 million electrical customers in Colorado of a remote possibility for outages. A PUC staff member who analyzed the causes reported several problems, including less solar production than had been expected. That report also found that Xcel had 11 fossil fuel plants that had some amounts of unplanned outages. Of those, 80% were among coal plants.

Proponents of fossil fuel generation insist that coal plants will be needed for baseload generation. Undeniably it’s more reliable than solar power. Except, as in the case of Comanche 3, when it is missing in action for a year at a time. But all forms of generation — coal, natural gas and nuclear, too — have down time.

Do we have enough reserve margins in the grid? Trump in April directed the Department of Energy to analyze current and reserve margins of the nation’s three electrical grids. In issuing the report in July, the press release issued by the DOE said the analysis had revealed that retirement of fossil fuel plants and delays in adding new “firm capacity, driven by the radical green agenda of past administrations,” would lead to a surge in power outages and a growing discrepancy between electricity demand and supply. It cited growth in demand from data centers as a major cause of demand growth.

Green-leaning groups were skeptical. In a July appraisal, Ric OConnell, an analyst from GridLab, called the DOE report “problematic” because of questionable assumptions. Advanced Energy United, in August, said the DOE analysis was “rather a protocol for pursuing a preferred solution to addressing resource adequacy needs.”

Colorado Attorney General Phil Weiser joined eight other states in asking for a rehearing. Their motion mentioned retirement of both Craig and Pueblo this year.

“These retirements have been thoroughly vetted by state and regional authorities and approved only following an extensive examination of cost considerations and reliability impacts,” the motion said.

Xcel has been sounding an increasingly loud alarm about resource adequacy. A Feb. 11 letter from three senior officers at Xcel Energy’s Minneapolis headquarters warned that Colorado’s “resource planning process is proving too inflexible to meet needs in a dynamic environment.”

Xcel no longer met industry standard reliability metrics nor the reliability assumptions used in the planning process several years before, the letter warned. Even addition of a third gas-burning plant left Xcel in a “suboptimal position.”

Citing the Western Electricity Coordinating Council, Xcel reported that 76% of proposed resource additions from 2018 through 2022 had come online. In 2023, that figure fell to 53%. The rest were delayed or cancelled.

“The state of play is not only about load growth; generation retirements are outpacing new resources coming onto the grid. New resources are being delayed due to various factors and will aggravate the situation in the coming years. Demand is increasing, across the West.”

A different conclusion was drawn by the Colorado Energy Office in a report issued July 1.

Colorado utilities, the report said, have “adequate capacity to meet customer electricity needs.” That was an overall summary, though. Xcel’s component of that report mentioned that the utility expected to have a capacity shortfall of 88 megawatts in 2026, growing to 1,000 megawatts shortfall in 2030.

Two former PUC commissioners have also weighed in to support delayed retirements of coal plants. There are the comments and filings of Koncilja, a commissioner from 2016 to 2020, on behalf of the economic needs of Pueblo County. The county, with the notable exception of its steel plant, gets electricity from a utility other than Tri-State.

John Gavan, a commissioner from 2018 to 2022, has been more broadly raising concerns about resource adequacy. He cites the projected demands of data centers but also notes that some electric providers in Colorado are unregulated by the state in their resource planning, unlike Xcel and Tri-State.

The PUC regulates Xcel, Black Hills, and Tri-State but not municipal providers and other cooperatives, among them United Power, CORE Electrical Cooperative, and Holy Cross Energy.

Whatever concerns there were before, the Xcel’s report to the PUC in early October added urgency.

Environmental community

The environmental community in Colorado says the Trump administration has weak justification in using the 202(c) clause in the Federal Power Act. They point out that Colorado’s PUC has a rigorous process for ensuring that utilities have sufficient reserve margins. Xcel itself, in its October 2024 filing, noted Colorado’s “gold standard” for resource planning — although that was said while asserting the need to create a “new gold standard.

Groups also point out that peak demand in Colorado typically comes in summer, not winter, when the orders for the units at Craig and Pueblo may be issued.

“202(c) isn’t intended to be used for long-term resource planning,” said Matthew Gerhart, senior attorney for the Sierra Club at its Denver office. “It’s intended for use in war-time or similarly brief, sudden emergencies like natural disasters. Even if it were true that there are resource adequacy issues, 202(c) isn’t the proper vehicle for addressing those issues.”

For that matter, he said, electricity cannot be put on trucks like bananas or iPhones and shipped anywhere in the country. In electricity, Colorado remains much like an island, with limited transmission to other utilities in the West. Market mechanisms for electricity sharing are just now getting short, stubby legs — although that will change dramatically in the next five years.

“So, even if there were an electricity shortage in, say Washington or Idaho or California, that doesn’t mean that keeping Craig 1 online will help, given the lack of a West-wide electricity market and the transmission limitations and congestions,” Gerhart said.

Sarah Keane, an attorney with Kaplan Kirsch who represents Colorado Communities for Climate Action and others, pointed out that the need is more than bulk power. Technologies that have flexible ramping, including natural gas, can better respond to peak demands than can coal.

Erin Overturf, clean energy director for Western Resource Advocates, said if the grid faces an actual emergency, the Trump administration would be using every tool it had. Instead, it has been doing everything it can to stop renewable energy development. She calls it a “manufactured emergency.”

And, in the case of Craig 1, there is that sticky matter of complying with the federal laws limiting regional haze.

In Arizona, cost was the fulcrum for this issue, not environmental needs.

The Arizona Corporation Commission, that state’s equivalent of the Colorado PUC, pushed back at calls by Republican state legislators to the federal government to bring mothballed coal plants in Arizona out of retirement.

Kevin Thompson, the chair of the commission, said in a May 30 posting that bringing the recently closed Cholla plant in northern Arizona into compliance with federal environmental standards would cost a “staggering $1.9 billion — a cost to be borne by ratepayers of its owner, Arizona Public Service.”

In Arizona, the commission members are elected, not appointed by the governor, as is the case in Colorado. Thompson campaigned with the boast that he had “stopped the Green New Deal.”

“Managing highly intricate systems like our electrical grid is far more complicated than a slogan on a bumper sticker,” Thompson said.",https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/xcel-coal-Comanche_01.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 07:18:59.873730

Texas has plenty of energy stories. The harder part is finding the signal through the noise of endless filings. That is why Nat Bullard’s new venture, Halcyon, matters. It turns piles of ERCOT and PUC dockets into something manageable. It’s AI that makes dense regulatory filings sortable and understandable.

Meanwhile, Nat’s annual presentation has become must-read material for anyone trying to understand what’s happening in the world of energy: the market forces, capital shifts, and technologies driving global change. He looks at macro trends like EV adoption, clean-tech capital flows, global cost curves.

We talked about one of the main takeaways from this year’s edition: China’s dominance in EV manufacturing and exports

We also talked a lot about a recent study Halcyon did with GridLab to quantify the rapidly escalating costs of gas turbines. I asked what his biggest takeaway from compiling that research:

“The biggest one for me being at a $2,500 a kilowatt cost for a combined cycle gas plant. What other competing options are there for providing power?”

At that cost, there are many better options, including re-using older turbines as many of the data center developers are doing. Storage that can be sited quickly. Demand flexibility can meet much of the need. Solar is still going onto the grid at about a gigawatt per month. Targeted wires upgrades and fast local capacity can bridge the gap while long-lead assets work their way through the process.

I left this conversation thinking about how information itself is infrastructure. If we can see what’s changing — if the opaque can become more transparent — we can make better, more informed decisions.

Doug Lewin (00:05.42)

Welcome to the Energy Capital podcast. I’m your host, Doug Lewin. My guest this week is Nat Bullard. Nat is and has been for a long time one of the smartest guys on energy issues. I know I have been reading his stuff long before I knew him. He does a now famous slideshow, highly anticipated by folks in the energy space that comes out every January. The last one, as many of the ones before, 200 slides long. We talked a little bit about his process for pulling all that together. He was at New Energy Finance before it was acquired by Bloomberg, wrote a newsletter that was read by hundreds of thousands of folks. He is more currently the co-founder of Halcyon, an AI-assisted research and information platform focused on energy transition. I have started using it a lot. It is great for those of us that are tracking regulatory dockets, sometimes with their many hundreds or even thousands of filings within a single docket. It is a great way to quickly summarize some of those documents. Highly recommend folks check that out. We will have a link to that as well as his famous slideshow presentation in the show notes.

This conversation did go long. I love talking to Nat. And so we split this one into two. In this first one, you’ll hear a whole lot of discussion of China. He’s based in Singapore, including a whole lot on EVs and the future of the automotive industry, a whole lot more. I think you’re really going to enjoy this and then come back next week to listen to the other one. Also, please don’t forget to give us a five-star review wherever you listen to the podcast and also to subscribe to the Texas Energy and Power newsletter and to the Energy Capital podcast. This is a free episode. It is not free to produce. Becoming a paid member at Substack really helps support our activity. So please do that today if you haven’t already. And with nothing further, please enjoy the Energy Capital podcast with Nat.

Nat Bullard (02:05.634)

Doug Lewin, thank you for having me. What a treat. I was just listening to you on the treadmill yesterday, and here we are in the flesh, so to speak.

Doug Lewin (02:14.868)

It is, I can’t tell you Nat how gratifying it was to get an email from you. I can’t remember when you sent it a couple months ago, six months ago or something saying, really enjoying the newsletter. I said to my wife, I’m like, I got a note from Nat Bullard today. Of course she’s not in the energy world. So she’s like, who? And I told her, you’re a big deal. She needs to know who you are. Nat, for anybody in the audience that doesn’t know, Nat does this, I think everybody probably will, but this amazing annual presentation. I’m sometimes asked by people, Hey, you seem to know a thing or two. Like what are some of the sources you learn from? And you’re one I always name, especially for folks that kind of want to get a global perspective. So we’re going to talk about that. What you’re doing with the presentation, some of the major takeaways, what you’re looking at for next year. But first you’ve got this new venture, which sounds super exciting to me as somebody who spends a lot of time reading regulatory filings and trying to dig through regulatory filings, ERCOT, NPRRs and all that kind of stuff. Let everybody know what you’re up to with Halcyon before we jump into the rest.

Nat Bullard (03:19.662)

With pleasure, Doug. So I spent a long time in the energy and the decarbonization research business. I was 15 years at the startup and then a company that got acquired by Bloomberg, New Energy Finance that became Bloomberg New Energy Finance became BNEF. And when I finished and took some time out on my own, I realized that I still have a real yen for the information business and the information in and around energy and changes in the system. And I also realized that it was a moment where technology allows us to do things that are different. And there are teams of people that are willing to deploy it and interested in building something new around it that viewed all of the stuff that you just described, you know, ERCOT, NPRR, or thousands of large generator interconnection agreements as a feature input for large language model and AI-driven capabilities, as opposed to a bug of people having to just read stuff by hand, so to speak, over and over and over again. And so about two years ago now, my lead investor, Andrew Beebe at Obvious Ventures, connected me with my co-founders, Bruce Falk and Alex Shuris, who are both veterans of building and operating companies and information systems at real scale, like really, really big. Billion dollar company revenue lines. Who only knows how big an information system in terms of that size, but real platforms. And we said to each other, like, what can we do with today’s new technology to answer questions and solve information challenges that we know exist?

And what we settled on is that actually it’s all of that stuff. It’s everything that exists in an unstructured, as the saying would go, fashion that is all text, that is all public, at least at the initial phases, but is, as we joke about internally, a denial of service attack on getting your work done. You want to read everything in ERCOT? It’s public. Go for it. Here you go. Here’s a fire hose of tens of thousands of pages a week per institution. And there’s 50 of them plus one if you include the District of Columbia. Start including all the other things you need to include. The federal layers, the other state layers. We’re talking about on the order of probably hundreds of thousands of pages a week of information. And within those hills, there’s gold. It’s just that it’s not often conveyed in a way that is readable by machine in our old classical way of thinking about it. But with today’s technology, with AI in particular, you know, we move from computers that can compute, that can add and subtract and multiply to machines that can read and can allow us to start extracting information that we really need. If you want to find the price of something, if you want to find a change to a forecast, if you want to find how did this number turn into that number. It often exists. It’s just that you would find it in say the third response to a request for information in this part of a proceeding in that state without any change log.

Doug Lewin (06:22.048)

Nat, I am so into that right now. So Oncor is in the middle of its rate case and there’s exactly that going on. Environmental Defense Fund and Google and a coalition of cities in their third and fourth requests for information. And within those long questions and long replies, there’s so much good information, but man, it is hard to like download every document and scan through there for what’s actually important. This is one of those use cases for AI. When people say, what are you actually going to use it for? This is one of the first things I say is like, my goodness. It makes what is just a, like you said, denial of service attack. Perfect. Like it’s just an impossible thing to do. This makes it possible.

Nat Bullard (07:06.286)

It does make it possible with a couple of other wrinkles on it. One is that it’s all in one place. So what tends to happen is you have people that specialize for good reason in a market, a jurisdiction, a service territory, an interconnection, whatever it is. And they tend to know all of that. But their ability to compare across jurisdiction, service territories, whatever it might be, is essentially nil. They don’t have the literal or figurative information architecture to do that. That’s something we built. You want to go search Texas, you can do it just the way you search Oklahoma, you can do it just the way you search Arkansas. It’s all in one place. It’s all there. You can draw comparisons across these jurisdictions. You can also, and this is something we began building in the last three or four months, abstract it up a layer, if you will, into something that has structure. So our way of thinking about it is when we have search and query capability, which we do, that people are welcome to try out, when you begin to have repeated queries from different parties about the same thing, that’s an indication that you should begin systematizing and programmatizing this into something that has a subscription basis. So that’s why the first thing that we built was, just go in and tell me what’s actually happening at the verified, costed, priced, disclosed level in the universe of building gas plants in the US.

You know, when everybody’s there trying to basically debug what somebody said on stage at CERAWeek, we can get to the number. I realized we have sources for that, right? We have places that we can go and find that. And every month we run that as a set of routines. We run that as a data science project that then manifests into an actual output that has all the numbers in it. And it’s got more than the numbers, it’s got the text updates on like this date has been pushed back a little bit or so and so is making an objection or whatnot. And it’s all put into a fashion that matches the other use case, which is not discovery, not I’m curious about what’s going on, or I want to find what I need to know more about, but rather I know exactly what I’m looking for, just give it to me. So we’re sort of attacking information in these two planes. One is sort of open with free structure for people to come in and search. The other is defined and deliberate and delivered for them on a cadence. Where the AI and LLM element comes in on that is just speed. Like this is the kind of stuff that back in the day you might’ve been able to do quarterly because you’re trying to go find out what’s new, trying to find out what’s update, trying to in your head, maintain a change log of it. Now we do it monthly at the moment in the future. The goal will be that this is essentially a continuum, right? That this lives and breathes essentially in terms of what’s been updated and what’s been changing, what’s happening right now.

Doug Lewin (09:49.518)

Yeah. And you mentioned the tracker for gas plants. We’re going to talk about that as we get into there. But what I first wanted to talk to you about was the slide deck that you did, which if folks haven’t looked at it, of course, there’s the annual one in January. If you haven’t looked at that, definitely go look at that. Just a wealth of knowledge there. And you did, I don’t know if it’s a mid-year update or just like a separate thing. It’s kind of, I think a separate thing. Was it discontinuity, disparity, data, if I’ve got that right?

Nat Bullard (10:15.512)

You got it.

Doug Lewin (10:18.988)

You did it at New York Climate Week and you had a slide in there as you do in your annual slide deck. You had several about Texas. You had a couple in this one about Texas too. And it was something that is the topic of a whole lot of conversations in Texas, which is the wide disparity between what ERCOT is projecting for load growth and what the transmission system providers, the utilities are putting out there. So first of all, talk about that slide and what you found in your research. And again, how hopefully it’s going to become much easier to kind of track these things going forward.

Nat Bullard (10:51.832)

This is one of my favorites, and it’s one of those things that’s sort of hiding in plain sight, if you will. To its credit, ERCOT has great information availability. Mapping that information can sometimes be a little bit tough, but it’s pretty good about updating stuff frequently and publicly. One of the recent things that ERCOT did was show how the transmission service providers in Texas, and then the grid operator itself, is thinking about future load, what’s going to be added to the system. And what I love about this is that the sort of the general shape of these charts is roughly the same until you get to the data center element of it. And ERCOT itself says we expect about 22 gigawatts of new load by 2030 from data centers, which in and of itself is a very, very big number. Let’s be clear. The TSPs on the other hand say we expect 78 gigawatts. Now, one of these things is not like the other one. A nearly 4X larger forecast for data centers and transmission service providers is noteworthy. It also seems to be perhaps a bit of a stretch. What is the current summer peak right now in ERCOT? 85, 87?

Doug Lewin (12:00.174)

85.5.

Nat Bullard (12:03.446)

Okay, I was close enough. This assumption would say we’re going to reach 90% of the current summer peak load just from data centers by 2030. Now, when we put it like that, that seems to be aggressive, but it’s a good lesson in how the TSPs, transmission service providers versus the grid operator, think about this. Because as your previous guest, Travis Kavulla, pointed out, there are incentives in place for those who build infrastructure to want to build more to accommodate more growth. Indeed. Yes. There are equally incentives on the part of ERCOT to keep things, as they used to say, to least cost and best fit, to best adequately reflect the reality, but also to do so at the lowest cost and with the highest reliability. And what I enjoy about this is that these are both official in their way. It’s not that like one of these is like the shadow version of it. And it’s not that like one of these is like a rebuttal. These are both essentially official ways of looking at the same information and making the same, drawing the same assumptions, but also with different purposes in mind. And yes, to your point, there is all to play for in essentially taking this one and making it look like that one. In the long run, they do have to collapse into one frame that would be reality.

And the question is, which one of these things is going to have to do either the expansion or the contraction? It is possible that ERCOT’s forecast is too low. I would wager that the transmission service provider’s forecast is probably too high. But that’s because they’re given the incentive to assume that much growth and to try to build according for it. And what we need to do in the future is to do a lot of things. One, we need to follow these things just as the data evolve. And again, ERCOT’s very good about doing that. Watch what actually has been approved for energization, change over time. Watch what’s going into the study. Watch what’s going through approval processes. The other, and this is a bigger informational challenge that I look forward to digging into in the future, is what I would call deduping. A lot of the things that are in the TSP assumption are probably assets that are being either planned in multiple parts of the state, or say the same finite amount of compute is being planned in multiple places, or it’s being planned across jurisdictions, which is an even more complex thing to try to de-duplicate. It’s a development business after all. And I think your audience of all will know exactly what I mean, is that this is what developers do. It’s a feature of good development to go out and keep multiple places live at one moment on the assumption that not all of them will come through.

Doug Lewin (14:41.73)

Yeah. You know, it’s interesting, and this is one that will be a place to look for more information and folks can go and try out Halcyon to see what it brings up for you. But there’s 58480, I believe is the PUC control number. I’m doing this by memory. You can go look at the show notes and I’ll have the correct one in there. But I believe it’s 58480 is the load forecasting docket that is open at the PUC right now. The legislature passed Senate Bill 6 to kind of deal with this because during the session, they were getting testimony from ERCOT. And some of ERCOT’s own, right, they have this kind of range of projections anywhere from 22 up to, you know, I think they have one projection that puts it like at 138 by 2031 or something. So there’s even within ERCOT’s own projections, there’s sort of this range. And then they were getting information from the transmission system providers. It was going to be much higher to your point.

So they said, Hey, we need to actually like figure this out. We need to know how much of this is real. So there’s a load forecasting docket. There’s another one, which is I believe 58481, which is actually a financial assurance. They’re going to make the project developers and data centers actually put some money down to actually have an official study and then show some kind of documentation is still going to be worked out through rules that it’s actually a real project, some kind of spend somewhere along the way. And they have to report to your point Nat, if they are investigating multiple sites. So I think what we’re going to start to see is that queue start to come down to more like realistic levels, still rapid growth, right? But probably not doubling in the space of three to five years.

Nat Bullard (16:26.518)

And what you describe is the regulatory institutions doing their essential work. And I mean this like I’m delighted to see this happening. This is something that actually is not within the gift of companies themselves to do. Markets respond to incentives and the incentive here is created by the regulatory body to say, go ahead and do this. And it’s interesting. If you think about this as a leading indicator of where other markets and jurisdictions might go is the forced disclosure of duplication is fascinating. And that’s probably something that I can only imagine happening first in Texas because of its size and breadth. That could happen in some other big states. It probably scales according to the physical size of the state and the size of the electricity system, which means guess what’s going to be first?

It’s going to be Texas. But a great effort that, again, I would hope to see picked up by other regulators elsewhere over time. And in the process, something that we just need to drive through information channels as much as possible to do and bless you for going directly to the docket number for people who are looking it up. This is one thing I’ve had fun explaining. I’ve had fun explaining to some of my colleagues. I was like, when you reach final boss level of people who do this for a living, they’re going to go to a prompt and just punch in a number. They’re going to go to a state and a number. And that’s how they’re going to think. And that’ll be amazing when we get to that point. We have people working on both planes. One come in and tell me something about X. Another is an incredibly detailed and nested question pointed directly at a docket. I will give you a for instance here, while catching up on our Discord chat with the engineers, they’re like, somebody is firing in some crazy informed queries right now. I was like, that would be Doug. I looked at the querying log, and I was like, that would be Doug. So more of that, please. Okay, many such examples, please, from all of you out there listening.

Doug Lewin (18:22.766)

Definitely. No, I love that you guys have created this tool. I’m looking forward to using it. Cause yeah, like we’re just talking about it takes a lot of time for these things. Okay. So switching gears just slightly. Again, I am just a huge fan of your annual presentation. I obviously spent a lot of time with it in January when it came out. I’ve referred back to it several times since, but I actually took a good chunk of the day, went through it all again. It was just sort of, again, just blown away by the breadth and depth, but really the breadth of this 200 slide presentation that you put together every year.

Can you just talk a little bit about, I guess this is kind of a two-parter, my audience will be used to this, I usually ask like five part questions, Nat. But a couple different things here, one kind of your process for putting it together, because I think it’s again, just kind of, you’re obviously not putting it together the week before it comes out, you must be gathering this stuff all the time and like kind of fascinated with your process. Interested if there’s anything that stands out in your head as like, just sort of a major takeaway because I would imagine, because you have so much in there about what’s going on around the world, some of which is just really stunning, this stuff about Vietnam and just things that are happening around the world that we aren’t necessarily hearing about in American news media or European or wherever listeners might be. And then of course, I asked the question I think any Nat Bullard fan would want to ask, what’s coming in the next one? What can we look for? It’s only a couple of months away from the next iteration. So can you give us a sneak preview?

Nat Bullard (19:57.55)

Sure. Thank you for that nested two-part question. I’m going to take the first part first. The way that I do this process is probably not going to be the most satisfying answer for people. I keep a giant running file of screen caps, snips, tables, links, anything that I have seen come across as catching the eye, a point of takeoff, a point of inflection, something where there has been a big headline or a change and I deliberately apply no taxonomy to it at first. So when I sort of hit wrap on my intake process last year, I had 385 slides that I took down to 200. And in the process, I probably took it down to about 170 and then built it back up with things that I know I needed to fill in. So I’m just going out there and I’m doing this live. It’s one of my favorite things to do, but it’s also like a subroutine. It’s not in real time, particularly active. Sometimes I’ll sit down on like a Saturday or a Sunday morning and I will start assembling things into sort of a more full frame. A lot of them I’m just flagging to go check on later. So, you know, where there’s higher frequency data, if it’s interesting in April, I should probably go check and make sure that it’s still valid in November. And so I put it all together into one place and then starting right about now, I start to kind of layer the themes on top of it. And so that’s sort of 80% observational. These are the things that I’m seeing. And then it’s about 20% aspirational in terms of what do I want to have come in and fill in the rest of this? And it’s funny. It’s probably because they’re the last slides in the deck.

Nobody actually looks at them. But the things that I enjoy most are my slides that are data driven, but sort of asking a question or a look ahead for us at the very end. When I do a retro on this, those are the ones that I tend to be the happiest about because I’ve raised the question further up the ladder. They don’t tend to be the ones that people come in and ask me about in the process. But I’m in the flow of just assembling sort of with no fear and with no favor the things that I find interesting from a pretty broad brush. So I get a lot of things from socials. I get a lot of things sent my way, by referral. I routinely check certain sources to see what’s interesting. And I try to learn as much from smart conversations with other people that might direct me to go out and find something. That’s the aspirational part. You should go look at this. You should take a closer look at that. And I’m always looking for novelty in the truest sense of the word. Is this new? Is this something that might not be well known? And that, I think, is where people one way or another entrust me with information. That’s the part where I hope to have the most value is, let me bring you something that you didn’t know. You know, there are things that are well priced. You know trends, you know, we know the cost of the solar module. That’s well priced. Less well priced, trade flows of Chinese solar modules into Africa. So that’s an example of where we can move from well priced to less well priced, so to speak, informationally. Or thinking too, in terms of adjacency, what are markets or technologies or business models that potentially become more relevant over time? So that’s the part one. Now part two, if I recall correctly, is like, what am I looking ahead to? What am I thinking about? Is that right?

Doug Lewin (23:25.09)

Yeah, I’m also just wondering some of those that kind of stand out that like people, particularly even like astute American power observers might, you know, look at your slide deck and be like, Whoa, man, if there’s nothing that pops to mind, we could also just talk about what’s coming next.

Nat Bullard (23:40.782)

There is so much. One is the Chinese auto complex, which is how I refer to it in the last deck. Yeah. There are only 11 countries in the world that have a full stack of doing an auto business, basically every capability from soup to nuts. China is now first among them. China makes something like 40% of the world’s vehicles.

Doug Lewin (24:00.726)

And that is, I know this from your slide, I think like 20 years ago, it was like three or four percent.

Nat Bullard (24:05.494)

Yeah, it was at the beginning of the century. It was less than 5%. I want to say it is the world’s biggest maker of all vehicles. It’s the world’s biggest maker of cars. It’s the world’s biggest exporter of cars. It’s the world’s biggest maker of EVs. It’s the world’s biggest exporter of EVs. This trend is not reversing anytime soon. And it is resonating outward to pretty much every other large auto market in the world, with the exception of the United States. And I would also say Japan. And this is something that I bring up because there are many, many things folded into this. It is trade flow. It is trade balances. It is national competitiveness. It is national champion industries. Automobility has been a classic way to move a country’s industrial capability upwards and with it, cohorts of an economy into the middle class. What happens if that’s no longer going to be the case? Or is China going to be the way Japan was of manufacturing in Kentucky, in North Carolina? You know, are we going to find that kind of path that’s driven by a combination of policy and incentives, but also market access?

Or is China just going to dominate? I’ll give you an anecdote. I live here in Southeast Asia. I was recently on a family trip in Thailand. The drive from Suvarnabhumi Airport into downtown Bangkok is quite long. And the rest of my family was sound asleep. I was not, because I was just counting billboards. I want to count all the car billboards between the airport and downtown. And I did not see a single billboard on this nearly hour long drive that was for a non-Chinese company. And of those, only a couple that were not for an EV. And one of them that was not for an EV was for a, like essentially an extended range hybrid, so small internal combustion, very big battery car. Kind of like the inverse of the plug-in hybrids that we have in the US. This is one thing that I think is really important because a lot gets wrapped into this. And it is for many reasons kind of outside the frame of what we think about in the United States. We have a huge auto business. We sell a lot of autos to ourselves. We do export, but not nearly to the scale that like Japan or Germany does relative to output. And we’ve optimized our full stack of automobility for America essentially, and for other countries that want to buy cars in the fashion that we do. China does everything else. And that’s something that I think is largely invisible, but I will put a question to you and to your listeners. Like when’s the first time you’re going to see an extended range Chinese electric pickup on somebody’s ranch in Texas? You know, when is the street going to find a way that one of those things is going to show up to someone’s like, I’ve got 400 miles of battery range and I can run 220V power in the bed.

Doug Lewin (26:53.742)

I think we’re a long, long way away from that. To me, Nat, the more interesting, that’s an interesting question, but one I wouldn’t even hazard a guess for. I think the more interesting question is when will we see some sort of Chinese manufacturing? And that’s probably a long, long way away. I sort of lost the thread. There was that CATL factory that was going to be co-located with, was it Ford or GM in Michigan? And then that got squashed, I think.

Nat Bullard (27:22.822)

I’ll give, that was the case. I’m not that positive. Yeah.

Doug Lewin (27:25.368)

That may be if America wants to export to the world, you’re almost at this point, gonna have to do it with China? Like this kind of stuff to the point of why I think your presentation is so good, because it does lead you to thoughts that otherwise you’re not really thinking about, right? You’re just like you said, like we have this American manufacturing industry, it’s mostly here, it’s sort of like internal. So we just sort of stay protectionist and we just sell to ourselves. That’s probably what happens, honestly, for the next 10, 15 years. Probably the most likely outcome.

Nat Bullard (27:58.222)

It is. It leads me to ask a couple of things, which is like how well optimized will our vehicles be for different future paths, right? For exporting to somewhere else where people want smaller, longer range EVs, for instance. How much are we exposed to the technological frontier? You know, it was Jim Farley at Ford who had imported one of these vehicles, Xiaomi’s vehicles, sorry, in order to test and he was like, this is a great car. You know, it is.

Doug Lewin (28:23.082)

And it was probably like $20,000, had like entertainment screens all over it. I mean, I don’t think we’re probably gonna be able to compete with that. And that is the thing that like that whole incident, just terrible, right? The Georgia plant, the Hyundai plant with, you know, Korean workers being put in chains and stuff like that was a path for the United States and maybe still is if there’s some amazing diplomatic work done somewhere, but like Korean technology and like an American and South Korean obviously partnership could have maybe put us in a way to compete, but now that’s looking less likely too.

Nat Bullard (29:03.092)

It’s important that you mention that because this is an industry in which it’s more than just setting up a distributorship. This isn’t paint or televisions even. This is an industry wherein you need to have a great deal of integration almost at a country level and certainly at a country immigration policy level in order to do this kind of work. And is the willingness going to be there? This is something that the US encountered in the 1980s with Japan, with Japanese companies setting up. And it took time and it took a sense of durability for it to happen as well. Yes. I think you raised the right question, but like what other parts of that supply chain could you have companies setting up and doing before it’s a full vertically integrated factory stack? And then the other question is even when that’s done, at what point is it going to really be worth the tariff to just import something? Because it’s at a price point, the quality is there, the market is there.

You know, I give Singapore as a fascinating auto market because it is tiny. Astonishingly expensive to get a car, well disclosed and visible and with data updated every month. And in December, 2021 BYD had 0.1% market share here in Singapore. It is now the biggest single brand retailer of cars in Singapore. So in less than four years, bigger than Toyota. And that tells you something. My building is full of them and increasingly other Chinese brands are showing up as well. But it’s interesting to watch a market that, look, does not have an embedded auto industry. It only has importers and distributors. Wherein with that kind of uncovered level of competition, you see the interest in stuff like this happening. And you see it differentially elsewhere in, you know, in Sub-Saharan Africa, in parts of the Middle East, certainly in Southeast Asia, even in Australia, you know, the interest from these companies coming in with a competitive product at a competitive price and seeing where that meets the market.

Doug Lewin (30:57.582)

I want to jump back to power stuff, but before we do that, this is just a really interesting thread to pull on. We’ve been talking about electric vehicles for seven, eight, nine minutes, whatever. We haven’t mentioned Tesla. We’ve been talking about American manufacturers, right? Like Tesla obviously is still one of the largest manufacturers in the world, but you do have some slides about they seem to be kind of peaking in the last year or two. Now there’s a lot that is bound up obviously in politics and the, you know, controversies that Elon has gotten himself into. You know, Tesla is still this huge question mark because the, I think the cars are still great. They’re moving towards autonomous vehicles. He’s making all these MegaPacks. There’s all these connections to the grid. You know, it’s the Energy Capital podcast. I focus on Texas, a Texas headquartered company doing some lithium mining and processing in Texas. So hard to have that discussion, I think, without at least bringing up Tesla, but I don’t know, it raises a lot more questions. It makes me scratch my head because I don’t know, I don’t know what the trajectory of that company is.

Nat Bullard (31:54.828)

You know what? There’s many, many of these questions and I actually look back to only one, which is how new is the lineup? You know, we have new trims for some of the existing models, but we don’t have a brand new mass market model in quite some time. Yeah. The Cybertruck is brand new. It’s not mass market. No, the Model 3 and Y are relatively venerable at this point. They do have updates and because they are software driven, they have a way of, you know, sort of improving themselves over time, but it’s different than the cycle time of some of the other manufacturers in the US and certainly the manufacturers elsewhere in terms of how frequently they’re updating brand new models, not just trims, but like totally new models, new chassis, new everything. And that’s my only real question is like, how do we think about it from a brand perspective? This is the trickiest thing to do. You know, every other car company, you have to talk about it like a brand. Tesla has sort of always been more of like an identity and with all these other things wrapped into it. I try to keep it very spare and just think about it from a car perspective. You know, as a car company, which is still what it is primarily, how are those cars being received in the market? And with only updated trims of late, and especially with the sunsetting of the EV credit, how is this going to play in a market that is increasingly supplied with lots of other options?

Doug Lewin (33:08.332)

Yeah. And of course, they’re looking more and more to the power sector. MegaPack is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the company, which may be a good segue to get back into the power sector. I do think I love that whole discussion because to a certain extent to our detriment, we think of these things as being really distinct. Like here’s the auto industry and here’s the power industry. But these days, as transportation becomes electrified, those lines are quite blurred and we’re kind of talking about the same thing when we talk about this stuff. So it’s getting interesting, right?

Nat Bullard (33:38.336)

It is. I’ll give you one last thought on that and then we can move it forward, which is that I’m going to ask you a question. So I did this annual presentation. What percent of my viewers of it are in the US? Do you think?

Doug Lewin (33:50.35)

I would guess 50%.

Nat Bullard (33:54.094)

43% last year. There’s a big world out there. There are lots of people from the US who want to look outside. From the outside, look into the US. And there’s a lot of people that want to look essentially mathematically in chords on a circle compared to the way that you and I are having a conversation right now. They’re in Brazil, and they’re very interested in thinking about what’s happening in Australia or vice versa.

Doug Lewin (34:16.075)

Yeah. No, I think a lot of times, obviously Americans, I do this myself. Shit, as a Texan, I do this a lot. Just think like this is where things are happening. It’s one of the things I love about your presentation. There is a great big world out there. And I do try to write about that at the newsletter too, right? Especially China and what has happened there. All right. So let’s get into some of the stuff that was in this latest slide deck, Discontinuity, Disparity, Data. And I believe you did the report right with GridLab about the prices of natural gas. So one of the things you had in there is this great slide that kind of shows the prices combined cycle gas turbines, basically averaging over $2,000 per kilowatt. Then you’ve got combustion turbines, much less somewhere in the $1,200 to $1,400. Now, one of the things we’re seeing that, and I’m wondering how much you’re tracking this or even can track this. I’m hearing more and more about this just from talking to people, but even the podcast Odd Lots last week got into this a little bit. Their guest put a drone over the Stargate facility.

Nat Bullard (35:09.746)

Stargate, yeah.

Doug Lewin (35:13.55)

They had seen the types of gas turbines that were there, and they’re pretty much like used, I don’t know what vintage or era, but they were like smaller, I assume, aeroderivatives, like Caterpillar turbines or something like that. I’ll add one more bit of data before I ask the question. Mitsubishi announced they’re gonna double their capacity of gas turbines. Do you see the gas turbine constraint kind of lifting anytime soon or do you think we’re really looking at like all the way through like 2035 these very elevated prices for new gas or used gas as it were?

Nat Bullard (35:52.34)

So I’ll start at the back. Do we see this easing? No, the demand is way in excess of supply and even Mitsubishi’s commitment. You don’t snap your fingers and magic up like rotor casting. Okay. Like, you know, these are some of the most complicated things in the world to possibly make with lots of lead time and in an industry that is rightly, I think, judicious about its expansion plans, having done this in years past, in eras past.

Doug Lewin (36:24.43)

20 years ago, right? And having a big old bubble burst.

Nat Bullard (36:27.788)

Wildly oversupplying a market for quite a long time. So that’s to my old saw here about, you know, markets responding to incentives. The incentives are complex and companies will react accordingly. The type of turbines that are being moved are fascinating. Yeah, like things that are aeroderivatives that have traditionally in these companies been sold by the oil and gas group. They were used offshore. They were used for field production. They might’ve been put behind the fence for LNG or something like that. Now being used as primary power production. There’s a move to buy used plant and move it around. I mean, that’s, you know, sure. Why not? That’s going to be of finite catchment in the long run, I think. And as far as price point goes, it’s funny because I put this slide up and the first comment I got was somebody’s like, I’m building those things and my prices are like three times higher. I’m like, show me your prices. And he’s like, I’m not doing that. I’m like, all right then.

Doug Lewin (37:24.654)

I’m not putting you in my slideshow.

Nat Bullard (37:26.222)

Yeah. Well, but also part of the purpose of building it this way, the reason that we wanted to work with GridLab on that white paper and the reason that our clients at Halcyon want this information is the rigor with which it’s sourced, which is I know that y’all are paying higher prices, but what I have here are the things that are in the regulatory disclosure. They have what’s called a CPCN or certificate of public convenience and necessity or the equivalent. Therefore, they kick into a process where we have visibility on cost, volume, time, conditions, all that sort of stuff. And that’s what we’re recording here. And also the full data set serves a broader purpose. A lot of people use it for physical trading. So they’re trying to say like with this asset coming online here and with my assumptions on asset utilization, what does that mean for demand at this node? You know, what does that mean for demand on this strip, that kind of stuff? So yeah, the numbers that we have here are lower than what people are probably getting quoted. In fact, I know they’re lower than what people are getting quoted.

But they are the revealed cost. Again, back around to my earlier comment, this is why we run this thing pretty much continuously to continue to get more sunlight. And in the long run, having come from a background where we did this quite usefully, would be to do a survey capability of it. I’d love to be able to do bids and asks here and get a sense in the long run of where people are at. We’re not quite there. It takes, having built this sort of thing before, it takes a little bit of time before you can get there. But if you’re out there listening and you’d be willing to start sharing bids and asks with me in terms of like when you’re getting quoted for combustion turbines, I’d be happy to talk. I want things that are only official. I don’t want anecdotes and I don’t want anything that’s non-verified. So that’s the purpose of doing this. But yeah, the numbers are striking to say the least. And there’s just, there’s a lot of future uncertainty about it. I mean, the biggest one for me being at a $2,500 a kilowatt cost for a combined cycle gas plant. What other competing options are there for providing power?

Doug Lewin (39:27.096)

So that kind of leads me to where I wanted to go next…

While many of these measures aim to strengthen Canada’s long-term competitiveness, they also create new opportunities for investors and small businesses to improve cash flow and lower taxable income.

From accelerated write-offs for equipment purchases to expanded credits for clean-tech manufacturing and R&D (research and development), the updated framework rewards companies that reinvest in growth and modernization.

Here’s how investors and entrepreneurs can apply these tax tools to strengthen their financial position and position for future gains.

#1. Invest in growth now — and write it off immediately

The new Productivity Super-Deduction announced in the Budget 2025 gives businesses a powerful reason to invest before 2030.

Under this rule, companies can immediately expense the full cost of eligible assets — including machinery, manufacturing equipment, and clean-energy systems — instead of depreciating them over several years.

For small business owners, optimal tactics include:

Time major capital purchases before the program phases out.

Combine the deduction with provincial grants or green financing for maximum leverage.

Consider upgrading production lines or fleet vehicles to clean-energy models — both qualify.

Investor insight

Companies that reinvest early will report stronger after-tax profits and higher operating efficiency, especially in manufacturing, logistics, and construction sectors. So, watch for firms announcing capital reinvestment plans — it’s a bullish signal that they’re taking advantage of this incentive.

Why it matters: Immediate expensing lowers taxable income in the year of purchase, freeing up cash flow that can be reinvested in operations, staff, or technology upgrades.

#2. Ride the wave of clean economy investment credits

Budget 2025 cements Canada’s Clean Economy Investment Tax Credits, offering 15% to 60% credits on spending in clean tech, hydrogen, carbon capture, and manufacturing of renewable components.

Good tactics for businesses include:

Partner with clean-tech suppliers or retrofit your facilities using qualifying technologies (solar, geothermal, energy storage).

Stack credits by pairing clean-tech equipment investments with the Productivity Super-Deduction.

Investor insight

Green infrastructure firms, utilities, and clean manufacturing companies stand to benefit. Look for publicly traded companies scaling their decarbonization strategies — their future returns may be partially government-funded.

Why it matters: These credits drastically reduce the effective cost of clean-energy investments — making Canada more competitive with the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act incentives.

#3. Tap into critical mineral and manufacturing credits

The Critical Mineral Exploration Tax Credit (CMETC) now covers 12 new minerals, expanding opportunities for exploration and extraction. The Clean Technology Manufacturing Credit further boosts producers involved in electric vehicle (EV) batteries, solar panels, and semiconductor components.

For business owners cosider whether or not your company supports this sector (e.g., logistics, engineering, component supply) — and partner early. Government incentives often ripple through the entire value chain.

Insight for small-cap investors

Junior miners exploring nickel, lithium, graphite, or rare earths are poised to benefit.

Look for exploration companies with eligible projects under the expanded CMETC.

Green-tech manufacturers could see higher valuations as production credits lower costs and speed up scaling.

Why it matters: These credits aim to develop a full domestic clean-tech supply chain — from resource extraction to finished products — positioning Canada as a leader in EV and renewable manufacturing.

#4. Reclaim R&D spending through the SR&ED Program

The Scientific Research and Experimental Development (SR&ED) credit remains one of Canada’s most generous incentives for innovation.

Budget 2025 confirms enhanced refundable credits of 35% on up to $3 million in annual R&D expenditures for small firms.

Tactics for small businesses include:

Track R&D-related labour, materials, and subcontractor costs meticulously — many companies underclaim eligible work.

Use the SR&ED refund to reinvest in intellectual property, automation, or scaling production.

Investor insight

Tech firms that lean on SR&ED can sustain innovation without excessive dilution or borrowing. Pay attention to management commentary in quarterly reports — firms that regularly claim SR&ED credits often show stronger long-term margins.

#5. Accessibility Credits as a Market Opportunity

The Home Accessibility Tax Credit (HATC) and Medical Expense Tax Credit (METC) won’t directly apply to most businesses, but they create a strong consumer market signal: Canadians are spending to retrofit homes for accessibility and aging-in-place.

If you own or operate a firm that operates in the construction, renovation, or healthcare services business, then positioning your products to meet CRA’s eligible renovation list could increase demand and eligibility under these programs — and increase your firm's bottom line.

Investor insight

Companies producing modular ramps, adaptive construction materials, or smart-home medical tech are positioned for growth. Investors can look for suppliers or exchange-traded fund (ETFs) targeting senior housing, accessibility technology, or healthcare innovation.

#6. Shift from carbon rebates to business incentives

With the Canada Carbon Rebate winding down in 2025, the focus is shifting toward industrial decarbonization and business-led sustainability.

A good tactic for businesses is to audit your energy use — replacing high-emission equipment now can yield compounded savings under both clean-tech and productivity tax programs.

Investor insight

The policy pivot suggests a medium-term opportunity in industrial retrofits, energy auditing, and emissions tracking technology — all positioned for growth as carbon policy shifts toward enterprise responsibility.

Why it matters: Firms that invest early in emissions-reducing technology may now receive direct federal support, rather than consumers getting rebates at the pump.

Bottom line for investors and entrepreneurs

Budget 2025’s tax credits aren’t just fiscal fine print — they’re strategic tools for growth. Small businesses can immediately lower taxable income and fund expansion through targeted deductions and clean-tech incentives.

For investors, the winners will be those companies leveraging these programs to accelerate innovation, efficiency, and sustainability.

In short, Budget 2025 rewards proactive capital allocation — whether that’s a small firm investing in new equipment today, or a savvy investor backing the next generation of Canadian clean-tech leaders tomorrow.",https://media1.money.ca/a/137468/investors-and-small-businesses-budget-2025_social_media_thumbnail_1200x628_v20251104231210.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 06:58:51.502454

So this month, they’re hoping for fewer promises and more action.

Past pledges from nearly 200 nations have fallen far short and new plans submitted this year barely speed up pollution-fighting efforts, experts say. And if the numbers aren’t sobering enough for world leaders when they kick off the action Thursday, there’s the setting: Belem, a relatively poor city on the edge of a weakened Amazon.

Unlike past climate negotiations — and especially the one 10 years ago that forged the landmark Paris climate agreement — this annual U.N. conference isn’t primarily aimed at producing a grand deal or statement over its two weeks. Organizers and analysts frame this Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 — as the “implementation COP.”

“This is really going to be much more about what are we doing on the ground,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd the 2015 Paris agreement aimed at limiting warming.

Figueres and many of more than three dozen experts interviewed by The Associated Press said negotiators have already pinned down the goal. What’s needed now is more money and political will for countries to put decades of words and promises into action and policy to reduce heat-trapping gases and stop deforestation. Only that will put the brakes on global warming as it careens toward a level the world has agreed is too dangerous, they say.

Adapting to a warmer world and saving forests

In Belem, diplomats, activists, scientists and business leaders will discuss new national climate-fighting plans, the need to save trees that absorb carbon pollution, how communities can adapt to warming and how to financially help developing nations hit hardest by climate change.

Host Brazil will preside and set the agenda. For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil’s environment agency.

Those leaders arrive Thursday for a two-day pre-meeting summit to discuss ratcheting up the fight against climate change.

“Holding COP in the Amazon itself creates a new level of accountability. You can’t talk about climate solutions while standing on the land that’s absorbing the planet’s carbon and ignore the people who protect it,” said Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, Canada, and executive director of the nonprofit Indigenous Climate Action.

Top polluters won’t be at pre-summit

That high-level meeting is likely to be missing top leaders of the biggest carbon-polluting nations: China, the U.S. and India. They contribute about 52% of the world’s heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.

China is sending its deputy premier. The U.S. is mostly skipping this conference under President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic who’s begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement. Some U.S. cities and states are coming to show that they and businesses take climate change seriously, said former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy, who co-chairs a group called America Is All In.

Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. said it’s important world leaders understand the threat to countries like his: “Without the United States, without China, without India committing, we really have no hope.”

“We want to see action … particularly from the largest polluters,” Whipps said. “Our communities live on the front lines and we cannot afford more promises.”

Figueres said she hopes “because of the craziness in the United States that there is an expanded sense of, this is the moment to pull together.”

But Panama’s environment minister, Juan Carlos Navarro, told the AP he expects little from the talks. He said such meetings have become “a jet-setting orgy of bureaucrats who travel around the world with a tremendous carbon footprint and achieve nothing.”

Promising to cut more pollution or focusing on fulfilling pledges?

There’s already a divide on the nature of this meeting. Brazil is stressing implementation of past plans as well as what’s in new emissions-cutting plans submitted this year. But smaller island nations, such as Palau, and scientists are saying that’s not enough. It dooms Earth to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times, they said.

Palau and other island nations want negotiators to tell countries to be more ambitious in their new carbon pollution-cutting plans.

Implementing “mediocrity,” said Natural Resources Defense Council adaptation chief Adelle Thomas, “is not creating a future for vulnerable nations.”

But if nations do what they’ve already promised in past climate-fighting plans, it could trim an entire degree Celsius — 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit — from projected warming, said Ani Dasgupta, chief executive of World Resources Institute. Scientists agreed with the estimate. Dasgupta said negotiators have too long focused on big commitments instead of outcomes in the real economy, which he said is “the messier thing” that doesn’t get headlines.

“What we now need to do is deliver against what we have signed on to,” said scientist Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany.

Path to disaster or optimism?

“The challenge today is not whether we will phase out fossil fuels. The challenge today is will we be too late?” Rockstrom said. “We are heading towards catastrophic 3 degrees.”

Figueres, the former U.N. climate chief, agreed it looks bad. But she co-founded an a organization called Global Optimism and said she’s sure the world can do this.

“My optimism is not naive. I know what we’re up against,” she said. “But my optimism is about determination. It’s about we’re up against a really, really, really challenging threat here. And we don’t give up.”

In poor areas such as Arara, those who can afford air conditioning — Cassiano is one — can’t always count on it because of frequent power outages on an overloaded system. Cassiano gets some relief from the green roof he installed about a decade ago, which can keep his house up to 15 degrees Celsius (about 27 degrees Fahrenheit) cooler than his neighbor’s, but he still struggles to stay comfortable.

“The sun in the summer nowadays is scary,” Cassiano said.

As world leaders come to Brazil for climate talks, people like Cassiano are the ones with the most at stake. Poor communities are often more vulnerable to hazards like extreme heat and supersized storms and less likely to have the resources to cope than wealthier places.

Any help from the climate talks depends on countries not just laying out pledges and plans to lower emissions. They also need to find the political will to implement them, as well as come up with the billions of dollars needed to adapt everything from harvests to houses to better withstand human-caused climate change.

All of it is sorely needed for the 1.1 billion people around the world who live in acute poverty, according to the United Nations.

That’s why many have lauded the choice of Belem, a relatively poor city, to host these talks.

“I am pleased that we will be going to a place like this, because this is where climate meets poverty, meets demand, meets financing needs, and meets the reality of the majority of the population of this world that are impacted by climate change,” said Inger Andersen, executive director of the U.N. Environment Programme.

Even in wealthy countries, the poor face climate impacts

It’s not just poor people in poor countries who suffer when poverty and climate change collide. A U.N. Development Programme report found that even in highly developed countries, 82% of people living in poverty will be exposed to at least one of four climate hazards: high heat, drought, floods and air pollution.

People in poverty are more vulnerable to climate change for several reasons, said Carter Brandon, a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute who works on the economics of climate change and the finances of adapting to it.

They might not have the money to leave areas like inundated deltas or floodplains, landslide-prone hillsides or farmlands regularly scorched by drought. Nor to rebuild after a disaster hits. And those financial hits can be worsened by other problems like health issues, lack of education or lack of social mobility.

“It’s not just, climate destroys buildings or bridges or property. It destroys the livelihoods of families. And if you don’t have savings, that’s really devastating,” Brandon said.

Crop yields suffer in many places, but worst in poor countries

Even relatively developed countries with more ways to adapt will see some farm yields drop significantly, according to a UNDP analysis of global agriculture under different warming scenarios.

But poorer countries will be more severely affected, said Heriberto Tapia, head of research and strategic partnerships advisor at the UNDP Human Development Report Office.

Tapia said Africa, with more than 500 million people in poverty, is a big concern. Many depend on crop yields for their livelihoods.

Most of the world’s 550 million small agricultural producers are in low- or middle-income countries, working in marginal environments and more vulnerable to climate hazards, said Ismahane Elouafi, executive managing director of CGIAR, the Consultative Group for International Agriculture Research.

Elouafi thinks technology can help ease the climate pressure on many of those farmers, but also noted that many can’t afford it. She’s not confident that this year’s COP will provide enough money to help with that.

Will holding COP30 in the Global South make a difference?

Brazilian officials thought Belem, on the edge of the Amazon and not a rich city, would be a forceful reminder for negotiators of the difficulty that climate change and rising extreme weather are bringing to millions of people every day.

“I heard there were a lot of negotiators who have been complaining of being put on a bunk bed, or in terms of sharing a room, but this is the reality of most people around the world,” said Nafkote Dabi, climate policy lead at global development organization Oxfam. “So I think it makes things real.”

But some experts were skeptical, despite the recent UNDP report saying the need to take action is urgent.

“I wish that they had said more about what exactly is the rapid action that needs to be taken, because I don’t think rapid action is going to come out of COP,” said Kimberly Marion Suiseeya, an associate professor at Duke University who studies how international policies impact people in rural and forested areas.

With poverty ‘not budging,’ why focus on climate change?

Although the public narrative has long been that humankind has generally been making progress on alleviating poverty, numbers show that now there’s a “stagnation,” said Pedro Conceição, director of the Human Development Report Office at the UNDP. “The numbers are high and they are not budging.”

In a memo ahead of COP30, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates called for a shift from prioritizing reducing emissions to focus on reducing human suffering. On climate change, “there’s no apocalyptic story for rich countries,” he said. “The place where it gets really tough is in these poor countries.”

But Conceição said it’s wrong to think about poverty reduction and climate as a tradeoff.

The idea that climate is only a future problem, “or it’s about things out there like glaciers melting, needs to be completely thrown out and replaced with the notion that actually the two agendas are one and the same,” he said.

This prosperity is demonstrated by the exponential growth international automakers have experienced within the last 20 years.
Specifically, in the Carolinas, international automakers have four manufacturing facilities, two research & development facilities, and 476 dealerships, contributing over $18 billion to North and South Carolina’s economies in 2024.","Thanks to international automakers, the Carolinas are in the midst of a manufacturing transformation. From Toyota’s new electric vehicle battery plant in Liberty, North Carolina set to open later this year and employ over 5,000 Americans, to BMW Group Plant Spartanburg in South Carolina, which is the largest BMW plant in the world, international automakers have doubled down on investment with a direct, sizable economic impact and benefit to North and South Carolina.

The industry’s exponential growth is shaking up U.S. auto manufacturing on the national scale as well: Last year, for the second time, international automakers outproduced the Detroit automakers.

Put another way: international automakers are a catalyst for creating jobs in the Carolinas. The latest data from Autos Drive America reveals that international automakers directly employ more than 160,000 Americans, including 17,000 across North and South Carolina alone. In 2024, international automakers produced 4.9 million vehicles in the U.S., of which, over 460,000 were produced right here. These aren’t just cars for American consumers—10 U.S.-made models built in the Carolinas were exported to more than 130 countries, contributing to $31 billion in export revenue.

But it’s important to remember that these gains are not guaranteed. They are the direct result of a robust international trade system that allows companies to invest in the U.S. and export to the world. Manufacturing jobs in the U.S. are better for it.

Over the last few decades, politicians from both sides of the aisle continue to talk about how to bring better-paying manufacturing jobs to the U.S. The answer lies in continuing to embrace international trade, not shying away from it. Restricting trade won’t build cars or create the supply chains of the future—international partnerships will. The ability for U.S. manufacturers to sell abroad, just as international companies build and sell here, creates a prosperous cycle of economic growth for the U.S.

This prosperity is demonstrated by the exponential growth international automakers have experienced within the last 20 years. With $124 billion invested in their U.S. operations and 31 manufacturing facilities located across the country, international automakers are leading the industry while simultaneously creating thousands of American manufacturing jobs. Specifically, in the Carolinas, international automakers have four manufacturing facilities, two research & development facilities, and 476 dealerships, contributing over $18 billion to North and South Carolina’s economies in 2024.

To continue this leadership, policymakers must prioritize expanding and modernizing trade agreements. Strengthening our partnerships and fostering new trade deals will ensure that the U.S. economy remains competitive in the ever-changing global marketplace. And working to open valuable markets for American-made vehicles, parts, and other products—like in the European Union and the Indo-Pacific—would drive our export growth and support high-quality domestic manufacturing jobs.

As we reflect on Manufacturing Month this past October, we must recognize the contributions that international automakers have made to our national manufacturing ecosystem and our own local Carolina communities, and how they’re leading the way forward.

Electricity prices have been rising across much of the country, and Illinois is among the states seeing the sharpest increases. Over the past five years, prices have shot up by about a third on average across the state, and some regions have seen increases of nearly 50 percent. According to the Illinois Commerce Commission, more than 170,000 disconnection notices were mailed out in June alone — that’s up from approximately 46,000 for the same time last year.

In response to the skyrocketing utility bills, Illinois lawmakers passed a sweeping energy reform package last week. The Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act, or CRGA, is expected to flood the grid with more power and bets big on battery storage. In a landmark shift, lawmakers also lifted the state’s nearly four-decade-old moratorium on the construction of new large-scale nuclear reactors in Illinois. The state legislature passed a law two years ago making an exception for small modular reactors. Nuclear power already provides more than 50 percent of the state’s energy mix. The state currently relies on a mix of fossil fuels and renewables for the rest of its energy, with solar and wind making up roughly 13 percent of the

To finance the buildout, Illinois ratepayers will face a surcharge on their electricity bills beginning in 2030. An analysis from the Illinois Power Agency, which manages how the state procures its electricity supply, found the program will cost approximately $1 billion to execute but will save consumers more than $13 billion over 20 years.

The bill comes as the state’s electrical system is in a crunch driven by a surge in demand from power-hungry data centers, a state law promising to phase out fossil fuel use for generating electricity, and federal funding cuts for clean energy. State lawmakers passed the bill during the last two days of an October legislative session, and Governor JB Pritzker has pledged to sign the bill.

Illinois is the first state to take significant climate action since President Donald Trump retook office, said Andrew Linhares with the Solar Energy Industries Association, a national trade group that advocates for solar power and energy storage.

“It is a response to the attack on clean energy and attack on Illinois consumers that is represented by the One Big Beautiful Bill, which is going to have the impact of raising prices on all Americans,” he said.

President Joe Biden’s signature climate law, the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, provided tax credits and other incentives to help accelerate the transition to cleaner sources of energy like wind and solar and put the country on the path to net-zero carbon emissions. Illinois was expected to receive approximately $1 billion through the law. But the federal incentives didn’t last long. Earlier this summer, Congress passed the One Big Beautiful Bill, which ended the climate-friendly tax credits. Energy analysts have predicted that the loss of those tax credits and other incentives in the Inflation Reduction Act will result in as much as $250 more in energy costs per year per household.

Trump, who has called climate change “a giant hoax,” also cancelled nearly $600 million in grants for Illinois earlier this month aimed at modernizing the state’s grid and catching leaks of methane, a planet-warming gas. Linhares said that the administration’s pro-fossil fuel agenda has spooked investors from clean energy.

The new bill tasks the Illinois Power Agency with drawing up a plan to incentivize developers to bring 3 gigawatts of additional battery storage capacity onto the grid. Batteries are crucial for a grid shifting toward renewable energy as they absorb excess electricity during the day when prices are low and save it for later when prices spike.

“It’s an incredibly exciting investment in climate progress,” Jen Walling with the Illinois Environmental Coalition said, adding that the bill does far more than fund batteries. It also dedicates funding for home energy efficiency programs, geothermal energy, and thermal energy network pilots, and helps expand electric vehicle charging stations. The new legislation also includes new authorities for the state’s utility regulator, the Illinois Commerce Commission, to make long-term plans about the state’s electrical supply.

Earlier this summer, Meta, the tech giant that owns Facebook, inked a 20-year deal to buy the entire electrical output of Constellation Energy’s Clinton nuclear plant in central Illinois to power its AI boom beginning in 2027. Constellation signed a similar deal last year with Microsoft to restart the Three Mile Island nuclear facility to power its Pennsylvania data centers.

Communities across the country have pointed to the rise of the always-on, power-hungry data centers to explain runaway electricity bills in recent years. But a recent study from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory found that the toll of data centers can vary from state to state.

“This is a very nuanced situation,” said Ryan Hledik with the Brattle Group, an economic consulting firm that contributed to the study. States like Virginia and North Dakota have seen tremendous growth in data centers without seeing increasing rates. The picture is less clear statewide in Illinois, but ComEd, which distributes electricity to the northern half of the state, is estimating an increase in demand by 40 percent by 2040 due in part to the data center boom. Whether it will translate to an increase in residential electricity costs remains to be seen.

Nationally, a key factor pushing rates upward is the rising cost of modernizing the aging distribution system — the power lines, poles, substations, and transformers that deliver power — and protecting it against climate change-fueled natural disasters. Nevertheless, the fundamental imbalance between supply and demand remains.

“What we are seeing is that as utilities or markets are running out of spare capacity, new investments are going to need to be made to continue to support load growth,” Hledik said.",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Power-Lines_sized-min.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-05 06:58:57.164052

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 83(1), I would like to table, in both official languages, the budget documents for 2025, including the notices of ways and means motions.

The details of the measures are contained in these documents.

Pursuant to Standing Order 83(2), I am requesting that an order of the day be designated for consideration of these motions.

Mr. Speaker, Honourable Members of this House, Canadians,

The budget I present today comes at a time of profound change. A time to build.

The world is undergoing a series of fundamental shifts at a speed, scale, and scope not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The rules-based international order and the trading system that powered Canada's prosperity for decades are being reshaped - threatening our sovereignty, our prosperity, and our values.

Long-standing supply chains and trade relationships that once ensured stable growth, good jobs, and affordable products, are being disrupted.

The impact is profound-hurting Canadian companies, affecting workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that holds back investment.

The level of uncertainty is higher than what we have seen and felt for generations.

In fact, it is not a transition but a true generational shift.

The challenges are great, but the opportunities for Canada are even greater.

And in this spirit, today I present to you Budget 2025.

And as a former Finance Minister, also from Shawinigan, so eloquently put it:

""Let's accept this role with humility, but also, with confidence.""

This budget must be generational in its ambition and serve to shape our economy and our nation's future.

There is no place for withdrawal, ambiguity or even standing still.

Only for bold and swift action.

Bold and swift action is needed.

To weather the storm of uncertainty, we will not lower our sails, Mr. Speaker.

Quite the opposite. We will raise them - to catch the winds of economic change.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will explore new markets and sell more of the best of what Canada has to offer.

We will build here at home - stronger industries, nation-building infrastructures, and millions of more homes for Canadians.

We will protect what matters most: our people, our communities, and our sovereignty.

And, we will empower Canadians by making life more affordable, creating new career opportunities, and ensuring every generation can get ahead.

This is how we win, and keep winning.

When people look back on this budget, they will be able to judge the importance of the choices we have made.

Greater autonomy is and continues to be the best approach to achieve real resilience.

And it is in this spirit that, with Budget 2025, we are building Canada Strong.

Mr. Speaker, around the world, tariffs have increased, growth is slowing, and trade relationships are being tested.

All of these constraints are being felt across the country by Canadians in their daily lives.

Families are seeing it every week when they do their groceries, as well as renters when they pay their rent.

Young people are sending out their resumes, but they aren't receiving any offers as a result of their efforts.

In factories, in the fields, and in communities across the country; people feel the current economic challenges.

Workers are facing fewer shifts, shorter hours, and in some cases, layoffs.

Small business owners want to grow, but uncertainty is understandably making them wait.

And for many, it feels like opportunity is slipping just a little further out of reach.

Mr. Speaker, these are the realities Canadian workers and their families are facing; they are doing everything they can to keep moving forward in uncertain times.

And through it all, the Canadian economy has held steady. Forecasters expect modest GDP growth of just above 1% in 2025.

The resilience of our people is earning us the respect of our foreign partners, and it is this same resilience that gives me confidence in the future.

When your largest trading partners fundamentally reshapes all of its trade relationships, there are two responses:

You can slash the deficit, hunker down, hope for the best, wait and see if the 'trickle down' ever comes.

That approach, to balance the Budget this year, would have to eliminate vital social programs, and all the capital investments needed for Canada's future.

We choose a different path:

That believes in Canada.

That invests in our country's future.

That reinforces Canadian values.

That makes us less reliant on the U.S.

A plan that allows us, first and foremost, to be masters in our own house.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, when our steel, aluminum, forestry, auto and agriculture industries were hit by U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions, we did not stand by and wait for the storm to pass.

We stepped in with the most comprehensive set of trade resilience measures in Canadian history.

The government launched the Strategic Response Fund - allocating 5 billion dollars to help sectors impacted by tariffs adapt, diversify, and grow.

Businesses can use the fund to invest in the design of new products, retool plants to boost productivity, or offset the costs of accessing new markets.

We have introduced a $1 billion liquidity relief package to help small and medium-sized businesses adapt, along with a new skills-retraining program that will benefit 50,000 workers.

To our steel workers, we will be there to help you increase your competitiveness within the Canadian market.

To our aluminum workers, we will be there to help you modernise your smelters and open up new markets.

To our auto workers, we will fight alongside you to keep auto plants in Canada.

And to our lumber and canola producers, we know times are hard, and we are working not only to restore your market access, but to expand it!

These strategic sectors are at the forefront of this generational change. We will ensure they are strong, resilient, and ready to lead our economic transition - from dependence to resilience.

These are generational challenges, Mr. Speaker, and they demand a generational response.

Budget 2025 is that response.

It is a plan for resilience. Rooted in confidence, focused on results, and designed to ensure that Canada not only weathers this storm, but emerges stronger from it.

I am reminded of the words of a previous Finance Minister, when in 1995, he presented his budget:

""Our very way of life as Canadians is being tested and there are times in the progress of people when fundamental choices must be made, and a new course charted. For Canada, this is one of those times.''

And Mr. Speaker, I would say that today we are also facing a unique moment.

The Prime Minister has called on our country to look beyond the challenges of today and to embark on a path that will redefine Canada for generations to come.

He has asked us to focus on what we can control and to take bold action.

I have confidence in the strength of Canadians.

I have confidence in our ability as a nation to meet the moment.

I have confidence that together we can build Canada, protect our way of life, and empower Canadians like never before.

Because we believe in Canada.

Canada has what the world needs, and what the world increasingly wants:

We are an energy superpower, in both clean and conventional energy;

We are among the top producers of critical minerals and a world leader in artificial intelligence;

We have unmatched market access, as the only country in the G7 with free trade agreements with every other G7 nation;

We have the people, the resources and the stability necessary to prosper and compete in the new economy before us.

So Canada enters this period of transformation from a position of strength.

Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7, and the federal debt-to-GDP ratio will remain stable over the Budget horizon. We also have one of the lowest deficits in the G7, and one of the strongest fiscal positions in the world.

And we must use this fiscal firepower to make generational investments.

Because we believe in Canada.

As the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund recently said:

""Both Germany and Canada recognize that in this very testing time, they need to use their fiscal space.

In the case of Canada, the Canadian authorities have been very decisive to take action in the context of changing relations with their main trading partner.""

That recognition matters - because it affirms something fundamental about this country: when times are difficult, we do not retreat, we invest.

Budget 2025 is a plan to catalyze investments from provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and the private sector.

With this plan, in five years, we will see one trillion dollars in total investments in this country.

Canada is one of the best places in the world to invest; and we are going to make it even better.

This fiscal strength allows to make historic investments not only today but also for future generations.

And to Canadians who feel the strain of these times, our message is clear:

We will not back down;

We will be there for you, now, and for as long as it takes, and

We will do what Canadians do best in times of need, we look after each other, we help each other. That's the Canadian way, our way!

Meeting this challenge requires both ambition and discipline.

We need to be ambitious in our investments and rigorous in our spending.

That's why this budget charts a new course for Canada's public finances. Because Canadians expect their government to achieve results.

And to get there, we must spend less on operations so we can invest more in Canada's future.

First, a new Capital Budgeting Framework, separating our day-to-day spending from the investments that build our future.

This reform will allow Canadians to better understand where their money goes and will ensure that each dollar helps strengthen our productivity.

In short, we will make capital investments a national priority.

Better budgeting also means presenting the budget at the best time.

From now on the budget will be presented in the fall, aligning with the construction season, and better supporting provinces, municipalities as well as contractors in the delivery of their projects.

Second, discipline. The Prime Minister has been clear: Canada's new government will spend less, so we can invest more.

Mr. Speaker, our budget today puts forward 60 billion dollars in savings over five years.

Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we are protecting the vital services Canadians rely on, including child care, dental care, and pharmacare.

And we are making responsible and pragmatic choices to reduce inefficiencies and focus government initiatives on our core priorities.

Through the government's Comprehensive Expenditure Review, we are focusing investments on initiatives that meet their objectives and complement, rather than duplicate, services delivered by other levels of government.

For example, the Department of National Defence will divest from fleets reaching the end of service life, and focus on investing in new fleets that meet the modern needs of our service members, while maximizing benefits for Canadian companies.

We will cut red tape, digitize services, and make them faster, simpler, and easier to access.

We are encouraging the adoption of new technologies across government, including made-in-Canada sovereign AI tools, through a new Digital Transformation Office.

This will create a more effective government, one that can deliver smarter, faster, and more effectively for Canadians.

Building a government that works better for Canadians requires a modern, agile, and efficient public service.

Since 2019, the federal public service population has grown at a rate far greater than the Canadian population.

We must get the size of our public service back to a sustainable level that is in keeping with best-practices. And we will do so with fairness and compassion.

And, Mr. Speaker, as we modernize government, we will make the tax system fairer for Canadians.

Third, clear fiscal anchors. We will balance day-to-day operating spending with revenues by 2028-29, shifting the budget toward investments that grow the economy.

We will maintain a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio, ensuring discipline today, while investing in our collective future.

The measures proposed in Budget 2025 put us on the right path to achieving our investment goals.

Mr. Speaker, we will create a business environment that attracts an unprecedented flow of private capital into the energy, infrastructure, housing, and defence sectors.

You see, Mr. Speaker, productivity and investment are the keys to our economic success.

And the government is fully focused on boosting productivity -doing more with less - because that is the best way to raise our standard of living.

Budget 2025 will not only accelerate construction in housing and infrastructure.

It will also strengthen Canada's position as a fiscally competitive jurisdiction and one of the best places in the world to invest.

In addition, we will introduce measures to enhance competition across the economy - starting with the financial and telecommunications sectors.

Mr. Speaker, budgets are not about doing everything. They are about doing what's necessary - and doing it well.

We are putting forward a firm, fair, and results-driven plan -the kind of reform Canadians are asking for, and the kind that has always served our country well.

This generational plan invests 280 billion dollars over five years in capital to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience. On a cash basis, that is an historic investment of 450 billion dollars.

These investments will drive growth in every region and create good, middle-class jobs that benefit all Canadians.

The kind of careers that allow young people and families to plan for the future with confidence.

Our generational investments will focus on four key priorities:

Housing: to restore affordability and opportunity.

Infrastructure: to connect Canadians and accelerate growth.

Defence and security: to protect our sovereignty and our communities.

Productivity and competitiveness: to put Canada at the forefront and make our country a leader in innovation.

These are not abstract priorities - they are the foundations of a stronger, more independent, and more competitive Canada.

Because we believe in Canada.

Our task now is to turn fiscal strength into national purpose.

For generations, together Canadians have undertaken major projects that have connected our regions, energized our industries, and defined our identity.

The One Canadian Economy Act, adopted last June, continues that tradition.

It removes barriers to internal trade, accelerates approvals for major projects, and strengthens the economic union that binds our provinces and territories together.

We are completing the unfinished work of Confederation - ensuring that wherever a product is made in Canada, it can be sold in Canada. Where trade and opportunity flow freely across provincial lines.

Our new government is also launching the next generation of nation-building projects.

The highways, airstrips, ports, electrical grids, and digital corridors that will define the next century of Canadian growth.

Thanks to these investments, we will connect regions, strengthen supply chains, and create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in every region of the country.

Our Arctic Infrastructure Fund will expand possibilities and opportunities like never before in Canada's North.

And, we will build infrastructure in communities all across Canada through the new Build Communities Strong Fund.

As we build millions more homes, we'll need infrastructure like roads to build new neighbourhoods - this fund will help build that.

New neighbourhoods will lead to new communities, that will want recreation and athletic centres - this fund will help build that.

And new communities will need new hospitals - this fund will help build that.

This fund will Build Communities Strong.

And we will also do that by being our own best customer through a new Buy Canadian Policy.

When the Government buys, Canadian suppliers will be our first choice wherever possible. Full stop.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will use:

steel made by our workers in Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie;

aluminum cast in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Becancour and Kitimat;

and softwood lumber cut in Thunder Bay, Prince George and La Tuque.

Because every time we buy here at home and build here at home, we make Canada stronger.

Mr. Speaker, I will give you one example.

Yesterday, in Saint-Tite, a small rural city in my riding, I visited Boulet Boots, a family business that has made boots since 1933!

I even had the opportunity to build part of the shoes I am wearing today, with the help of many skilled workers - a reminder of the craftsmanship and pride that make the Canadian manufacturing industry strong.

The same shoes worn by RCMP officers!

Made in Canada, by Canadians, for Canadians. That's the way to go!

That's what Buy Canadian is all about: good jobs, resilient communities, and pride in what we build together.

We are building an economy by Canadians, for Canadians.

Canada has A Legacy of Builders, Mr. Speaker, that same spirit of building at home has defined Canada for generations. We have done this before.

Back in 1945, just after the war, Canada had to think big. As so-called ""Minister of Everything"" at the time, the great C.D. Howe banked on the boundless potential of Canada to make big, big changes. He was not afraid to bet big on Canadians - and neither are we.

This budget is guided by the conviction that Canada must remain a nation of builders - of infrastructure and innovation, of trust in public institutions, and of hope for generations to come.

This nation knows how to build:

We built the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, allowing our country to be connected from coast to coast and supporting trade across the Prairies;

We built the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, creating a deep-water route from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean;

We built the James Bay hydroelectric facility in 1985, providing abundant clean energy to power Canadian industries and enabling Canada to become one of the world's top producers of renewable hydroelectric energy.

Each generation has taken on its share of the work and left the next generation stronger for it.

We will do it again.

With planned investments of 115 billion dollars in infrastructure over 5 years, we will meet the moment and build the backbone of Canada's next economy.

Our task is simple but profound:

to turn plans into projects,

projects into careers,

and careers into prosperity.

And to do so in a way that protects our future, our nature, and our core values, building in true partnership with Indigenous Peoples, whose stewardship and knowledge of the land continue to guide us today.

Because we do not just build for ourselves. We build for those who will follow.

I am often reminded of the Seven Generation Principle, rooted in Indigenous teachings - a reminder that every decision we take today must consider its impacts on future generations.

Mr. Speaker, a strong country invests not only in its economy, but also in its identity.

Over the past year, Canadians have shown what Canada is really made of.

When global uncertainty tested us, we looked to each other.

People asked where their food was grown and chose to buy from local farmers and producers.

Families travelled across the country and rediscovered its beauty, from coast to coast to coast.

Communities rallied around Canadian businesses, creators, and workers.

That, Mr. Speaker, is what it means to be Canadian. To stand up for one another, to build together, and to take pride in what we make, grow, and create here at home.

We are a bilingual, diverse and compassionate country; shaped by reconciliation, equality, and respect.

Canada faces a steep housing supply gap that threatens affordability, opportunity, and the ability for Canadians to build their lives here at home.

Budget 2025 is the most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War!

With investments of 13 billion dollars over 5 years, our flagship home building initiative, Build Canada Homes, will build at a speed and scale not seen in generations.

We will double the pace of housing construction over the next decade while creating a new industry using Canadian technology, Canadian workers, and Canadian lumber.

We will improve affordability and create careers in the skilled trades, Mr. Speaker.

Every home built is a step toward a more affordable, more confident Canada.

Affordability is not only about housing.

It's about making life easier for Canadians and reducing everyday costs, while protecting the programs that families depend on.

Canadians elected us to take bold action to help them improve their quality of life quickly.

That's what we did, Mr. Speaker, and will continue to do:

We cut taxes for 22 million Canadians;

We brought down gas prices by 18 cents per litre when we cancelled the consumer carbon price;

We made permanent the National School Food Program, helping 400,000 children each year;

We've launched automatic federal benefits, reaching 5.5 million low-income Canadians, to ensure no one gets left behind;

We will strengthen competition in the telecommunications and banking sectors in order to drive down costs.

These are practical measures that make life more affordable today and build confidence for tomorrow.

Because when Canadians can afford a home, raise a family, and plan for the future, our entire country grows stronger.

Because prosperity is only meaningful when it is shared and when all Canadians can see themselves in the promise of this country.

As the Prime Minister has said: there can be no prosperity without security.

And I'm sure, Mr. Speaker, that every member of this House would agree that we need to protect our people, our communities, and our country.

A confident nation protects its sovereignty at home and its interests abroad, through strength, stability, and partnership with Allies who share our values.

With $30 billion over five years, Budget 2025 represents the largest defence investment in decades.

We will meet our NATO 2% commitment this year, modernize NORAD, reinforce our Arctic defences, and equip the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces with the infrastructure and technology they need to safeguard our nation.

With our new Defence Investment Agency and Defence Industrial Strategy, we will build up Canada's defence industry - strengthening Canadian businesses and supporting Canadian workers.

Our work on defence will strengthen Canadian research centres, and Canadian communities in the North, working with our Inuit and First Nations partners, by building dual-use infrastructure - like ports and airport runways.

We will further build our security and defence capabilities, right here at home - creating new jobs for our engineers, technicians and scientists in sectors such as aerospace, shipbuilding, cybersecurity, and AI.

We will hire 1,000 new border services officers and 1,000 new RCMP personnel to secure our borders and keep our communities safe.

Finally, by investing in law enforcement and justice reform, we will tackle organized crime, gun violence, and auto theft.

We will also invest and we will continue, with passion and determination, as my colleague Minister Valdez is doing, the important work with the provinces and territories to end gender-based violence.

We are taking all these actions because we believe in Canada.

As we strengthen our security partnerships, it is essential that we also deepen our economic partnerships.

In order to build a stronger future, we must increase trade, innovate faster, and play a leading role in clean and conventional energy.

Trade has always been one of Canada's strengths, connecting our population, our resources, and our industries to the rest of the world.

But too much of that trade depends on a single partner.

Through Budget 2025, we are launching a Trade Diversification Strategy supported by a Trade Diversification Corridors Fund to expand Canada's reach, double our overseas exports within a decade, unlocking 300 billion dollars in new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses.

We will strengthen ports, railways, and ports of entry, we will reduce bottlenecks, and we will open faster routes to global markets.

Because when Canadian businesses are competitive and successful abroad, Canadian workers and communities prosper right here at home.

Mr. Speaker, Canada is the best place to live, and top talent from around the world want to come here because they see opportunities and possibilities to contribute to cutting-edge research.

With our flagship International Talent Attraction Strategy of $1.7 billion, we will make sure that the best and brightest continue to chose Canada to innovate, invent and grow our industry.

By making a generational investment of 115 billion dollars over 5 years in measures that will drive productivity and competitiveness, we will supercharge growth in Canada, and become the strongest economy of the G7.

Productivity is not about working harder, it's about working smarter.

It's about how well we mobilize ideas, workers, investment, and innovation to generate growth.

It is what drives wages up, improves living standards, and strengthens public services.

For too long, Canada's productivity has been lagging - a challenge we can and must overcome.

AI will play a key role, along with quantum and other advanced technologies, to put Canada on a path of sustained growth.

Budget 2025 initiates this change by rethinking how Canada competes and creates value.

Through:

A Productivity Super-Deduction to create the right climate for businesses to invest in new machinery, equipment, and technologies.

A bold expansion of projects of national interest in AI, clean technology, and advanced manufacturing - turning Canadian innovation into industrial strength.

And enhancing tax incentives for Canadian builders to conduct research and development - and making it seamless for them to apply to these essential tax credits that drive innovation and productivity.

Mr. Speaker, numbers in the budget can seem abstract, so let me make them concrete.

As I said earlier, this budget will unleash one trillion dollars in total investment over the next five years. That would boost average wages by over $3,000 per year!

It would add 15 billion dollars to federal revenues that can support health care, lower your taxes and pay down Canada's debt.

We choose Canada. We will make Canada Strong.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, throughout our history, we have opened our doors to the world. We have always welcomed:

those fleeing the most difficult situations;

those seeking to study at our world-class universities;

and those willing to share their expertise and drive innovation in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, we are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels - allowing us to fulfill the promise of Canada to those who call it home.

Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system, while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our economy.

Our plan will allow us to ensure better control of our immigration system while maintaining our approach based on our Canadian values.

Climate action is not only a moral obligation, it is an economic necessity.

The key to competitiveness and growth is also to be a leader in a low-carbon economy.

Our Climate Competitiveness Strategy turns Canada's natural wealth - critical minerals, clean power - into lasting prosperity.

Reducing our emissions is essential to protecting the competitiveness of Canada's energy sectors.

We are introducing a comprehensive suite of clean economy investment tax credits - measures that are already generating billions of dollars in private capital for projects in hydrogen, carbon capture, and clean electricity.

These investments will modernize our power grids, speed up approvals for major clean energy projects, and expand the transmission lines that connect our provinces.

By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and help our industries thrive in the global economy.

We have the most skilled and talented workers as well as the most educated workforce in the world. We can all be very proud of that.

Budget 2025 expands learning, training, and growth opportunities for young people.

It creates new pathways for careers in construction, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

It is essential that we give the next generation the confidence and skills needed to succeed.

So, through a suite of new measures, we will extend union training, extend the tax credit to personal support workers, and enhance labour mobility.

Mr. Speaker, Canadian workers will drive Canada's economic transformation with new skills and training, and they will seize the exciting, high-paying careers it will create.

In the words of the Canadian Labour Congress, ""these measures signal a shift toward putting workers at the heart of Canada's economic strategy"".

This is how we give Canadians the tools they need to shape the future.

This is how we Build Canada Strong.

To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the budget I am tabling today is our framework for Canada's future and a roadmap to prosperity and resilience.

It all comes down to a choice between two visions.

One vision of resignation - a vision that would scale back the vital support Canadians rely on, make it harder for families to find a home, and leave our country more vulnerable, poorer, and dependent.

And another vision - one rooted in confidence. Confidence in Canadians, and in the belief that by making generational investments today, we can build lasting prosperity for tomorrow.

By putting more money in people's pockets.

By ensuring every Canadian can retire with dignity.

By making the dream of home ownership a reality once again

By building the infrastructure our cities need to grow.

By keeping our communities safe for our children and our parents.

Budget 2025 makes our choice clear: we choose confidence over resignation. We choose to empower Canadians - to build this country together and to protect what we hold dear.

Mr. Speaker, it's about confidence. In ourselves, in our capacity to adapt, and in the promise of this great country.

It is about a Canada that builds, protects, and empowers.

It's about moving from reliance to resilience, and from uncertainty to prosperity.

Let's rise to this generational challenge.

Let's build Canada strong.

Because we are - and always will be - the true North, strong and free.

LONG LIVE CANADA!

Check against delivery

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 83(1), I would like to table, in both official languages, the budget documents for 2025, including the notices of ways and means motions.

The details of the measures are contained in these documents.

Pursuant to Standing Order 83(2), I am requesting that an order of the day be designated for consideration of these motions.

Mr. Speaker, Honourable Members of this House, Canadians,

The budget I present today comes at a time of profound change. A time to build.

The world is undergoing a series of fundamental shifts at a speed, scale, and scope not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The rules-based international order and the trading system that powered Canada's prosperity for decades are being reshaped - threatening our sovereignty, our prosperity, and our values.

Long-standing supply chains and trade relationships that once ensured stable growth, good jobs, and affordable products, are being disrupted.

The impact is profound-hurting Canadian companies, affecting workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that holds back investment.

The level of uncertainty is higher than what we have seen and felt for generations.

In fact, it is not a transition but a true generational shift.

The challenges are great, but the opportunities for Canada are even greater.

And in this spirit, today I present to you Budget 2025.

And as a former Finance Minister, also from Shawinigan, so eloquently put it:

""Let's accept this role with humility, but also, with confidence.""

This budget must be generational in its ambition and serve to shape our economy and our nation's future.

There is no place for withdrawal, ambiguity or even standing still.

Only for bold and swift action.

Bold and swift action is needed.

To weather the storm of uncertainty, we will not lower our sails, Mr. Speaker.

Quite the opposite. We will raise them - to catch the winds of economic change.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will explore new markets and sell more of the best of what Canada has to offer.

We will build here at home - stronger industries, nation-building infrastructures, and millions of more homes for Canadians.

We will protect what matters most: our people, our communities, and our sovereignty.

And, we will empower Canadians by making life more affordable, creating new career opportunities, and ensuring every generation can get ahead.

This is how we win, and keep winning.

When people look back on this budget, they will be able to judge the importance of the choices we have made.

Greater autonomy is and continues to be the best approach to achieve real resilience.

And it is in this spirit that, with Budget 2025, we are building Canada Strong.

Mr. Speaker, around the world, tariffs have increased, growth is slowing, and trade relationships are being tested.

All of these constraints are being felt across the country by Canadians in their daily lives.

Families are seeing it every week when they do their groceries, as well as renters when they pay their rent.

Young people are sending out their resumes, but they aren't receiving any offers as a result of their efforts.

In factories, in the fields, and in communities across the country; people feel the current economic challenges.

Workers are facing fewer shifts, shorter hours, and in some cases, layoffs.

Small business owners want to grow, but uncertainty is understandably making them wait.

And for many, it feels like opportunity is slipping just a little further out of reach.

Mr. Speaker, these are the realities Canadian workers and their families are facing; they are doing everything they can to keep moving forward in uncertain times.

And through it all, the Canadian economy has held steady. Forecasters expect modest GDP growth of just above 1% in 2025.

The resilience of our people is earning us the respect of our foreign partners, and it is this same resilience that gives me confidence in the future.

When your largest trading partners fundamentally reshapes all of its trade relationships, there are two responses:

You can slash the deficit, hunker down, hope for the best, wait and see if the 'trickle down' ever comes.

That approach, to balance the Budget this year, would have to eliminate vital social programs, and all the capital investments needed for Canada's future.

We choose a different path:

That believes in Canada.

That invests in our country's future.

That reinforces Canadian values.

That makes us less reliant on the U.S.

A plan that allows us, first and foremost, to be masters in our own house.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, when our steel, aluminum, forestry, auto and agriculture industries were hit by U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions, we did not stand by and wait for the storm to pass.

We stepped in with the most comprehensive set of trade resilience measures in Canadian history.

The government launched the Strategic Response Fund - allocating 5 billion dollars to help sectors impacted by tariffs adapt, diversify, and grow.

Businesses can use the fund to invest in the design of new products, retool plants to boost productivity, or offset the costs of accessing new markets.

We have introduced a $1 billion liquidity relief package to help small and medium-sized businesses adapt, along with a new skills-retraining program that will benefit 50,000 workers.

To our steel workers, we will be there to help you increase your competitiveness within the Canadian market.

To our aluminum workers, we will be there to help you modernise your smelters and open up new markets.

To our auto workers, we will fight alongside you to keep auto plants in Canada.

And to our lumber and canola producers, we know times are hard, and we are working not only to restore your market access, but to expand it!

These strategic sectors are at the forefront of this generational change. We will ensure they are strong, resilient, and ready to lead our economic transition - from dependence to resilience.

These are generational challenges, Mr. Speaker, and they demand a generational response.

Budget 2025 is that response.

It is a plan for resilience. Rooted in confidence, focused on results, and designed to ensure that Canada not only weathers this storm, but emerges stronger from it.

I am reminded of the words of a previous Finance Minister, when in 1995, he presented his budget:

""Our very way of life as Canadians is being tested and there are times in the progress of people when fundamental choices must be made, and a new course charted. For Canada, this is one of those times.''

And Mr. Speaker, I would say that today we are also facing a unique moment.

The Prime Minister has called on our country to look beyond the challenges of today and to embark on a path that will redefine Canada for generations to come.

He has asked us to focus on what we can control and to take bold action.

I have confidence in the strength of Canadians.

I have confidence in our ability as a nation to meet the moment.

I have confidence that together we can build Canada, protect our way of life, and empower Canadians like never before.

Because we believe in Canada.

Canada has what the world needs, and what the world increasingly wants:

We are an energy superpower, in both clean and conventional energy;

We are among the top producers of critical minerals and a world leader in artificial intelligence;

We have unmatched market access, as the only country in the G7 with free trade agreements with every other G7 nation;

We have the people, the resources and the stability necessary to prosper and compete in the new economy before us.

So Canada enters this period of transformation from a position of strength.

Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7, and the federal debt-to-GDP ratio will remain stable over the Budget horizon. We also have one of the lowest deficits in the G7, and one of the strongest fiscal positions in the world.

And we must use this fiscal firepower to make generational investments.

Because we believe in Canada.

As the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund recently said:

""Both Germany and Canada recognize that in this very testing time, they need to use their fiscal space.

In the case of Canada, the Canadian authorities have been very decisive to take action in the context of changing relations with their main trading partner.""

That recognition matters - because it affirms something fundamental about this country: when times are difficult, we do not retreat, we invest.

Budget 2025 is a plan to catalyze investments from provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and the private sector.

With this plan, in five years, we will see one trillion dollars in total investments in this country.

Canada is one of the best places in the world to invest; and we are going to make it even better.

This fiscal strength allows to make historic investments not only today but also for future generations.

And to Canadians who feel the strain of these times, our message is clear:

We will not back down;

We will be there for you, now, and for as long as it takes, and

We will do what Canadians do best in times of need, we look after each other, we help each other. That's the Canadian way, our way!

Meeting this challenge requires both ambition and discipline.

We need to be ambitious in our investments and rigorous in our spending.

That's why this budget charts a new course for Canada's public finances. Because Canadians expect their government to achieve results.

And to get there, we must spend less on operations so we can invest more in Canada's future.

First, a new Capital Budgeting Framework, separating our day-to-day spending from the investments that build our future.

This reform will allow Canadians to better understand where their money goes and will ensure that each dollar helps strengthen our productivity.

In short, we will make capital investments a national priority.

Better budgeting also means presenting the budget at the best time.

From now on the budget will be presented in the fall, aligning with the construction season, and better supporting provinces, municipalities as well as contractors in the delivery of their projects.

Second, discipline. The Prime Minister has been clear: Canada's new government will spend less, so we can invest more.

Mr. Speaker, our budget today puts forward 60 billion dollars in savings over five years.

Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we are protecting the vital services Canadians rely on, including child care, dental care, and pharmacare.

And we are making responsible and pragmatic choices to reduce inefficiencies and focus government initiatives on our core priorities.

Through the government's Comprehensive Expenditure Review, we are focusing investments on initiatives that meet their objectives and complement, rather than duplicate, services delivered by other levels of government.

For example, the Department of National Defence will divest from fleets reaching the end of service life, and focus on investing in new fleets that meet the modern needs of our service members, while maximizing benefits for Canadian companies.

We will cut red tape, digitize services, and make them faster, simpler, and easier to access.

We are encouraging the adoption of new technologies across government, including made-in-Canada sovereign AI tools, through a new Digital Transformation Office.

This will create a more effective government, one that can deliver smarter, faster, and more effectively for Canadians.

Building a government that works better for Canadians requires a modern, agile, and efficient public service.

Since 2019, the federal public service population has grown at a rate far greater than the Canadian population.

We must get the size of our public service back to a sustainable level that is in keeping with best-practices. And we will do so with fairness and compassion.

And, Mr. Speaker, as we modernize government, we will make the tax system fairer for Canadians.

Third, clear fiscal anchors. We will balance day-to-day operating spending with revenues by 2028-29, shifting the budget toward investments that grow the economy.

We will maintain a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio, ensuring discipline today, while investing in our collective future.

The measures proposed in Budget 2025 put us on the right path to achieving our investment goals.

Mr. Speaker, we will create a business environment that attracts an unprecedented flow of private capital into the energy, infrastructure, housing, and defence sectors.

You see, Mr. Speaker, productivity and investment are the keys to our economic success.

And the government is fully focused on boosting productivity -doing more with less - because that is the best way to raise our standard of living.

Budget 2025 will not only accelerate construction in housing and infrastructure.

It will also strengthen Canada's position as a fiscally competitive jurisdiction and one of the best places in the world to invest.

In addition, we will introduce measures to enhance competition across the economy - starting with the financial and telecommunications sectors.

Mr. Speaker, budgets are not about doing everything. They are about doing what's necessary - and doing it well.

We are putting forward a firm, fair, and results-driven plan -the kind of reform Canadians are asking for, and the kind that has always served our country well.

This generational plan invests 280 billion dollars over five years in capital to strengthen Canada's productivity, competitiveness, and resilience. On a cash basis, that is an historic investment of 450 billion dollars.

These investments will drive growth in every region and create good, middle-class jobs that benefit all Canadians.

The kind of careers that allow young people and families to plan for the future with confidence.

Our generational investments will focus on four key priorities:

Housing: to restore affordability and opportunity.

Infrastructure: to connect Canadians and accelerate growth.

Defence and security: to protect our sovereignty and our communities.

Productivity and competitiveness: to put Canada at the forefront and make our country a leader in innovation.

These are not abstract priorities - they are the foundations of a stronger, more independent, and more competitive Canada.

Because we believe in Canada.

Our task now is to turn fiscal strength into national purpose.

For generations, together Canadians have undertaken major projects that have connected our regions, energized our industries, and defined our identity.

The One Canadian Economy Act, adopted last June, continues that tradition.

It removes barriers to internal trade, accelerates approvals for major projects, and strengthens the economic union that binds our provinces and territories together.

We are completing the unfinished work of Confederation - ensuring that wherever a product is made in Canada, it can be sold in Canada. Where trade and opportunity flow freely across provincial lines.

Our new government is also launching the next generation of nation-building projects.

The highways, airstrips, ports, electrical grids, and digital corridors that will define the next century of Canadian growth.

Thanks to these investments, we will connect regions, strengthen supply chains, and create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in every region of the country.

Our Arctic Infrastructure Fund will expand possibilities and opportunities like never before in Canada's North.

And, we will build infrastructure in communities all across Canada through the new Build Communities Strong Fund.

As we build millions more homes, we'll need infrastructure like roads to build new neighbourhoods - this fund will help build that.

New neighbourhoods will lead to new communities, that will want recreation and athletic centres - this fund will help build that.

And new communities will need new hospitals - this fund will help build that.

This fund will Build Communities Strong.

And we will also do that by being our own best customer through a new Buy Canadian Policy.

When the Government buys, Canadian suppliers will be our first choice wherever possible. Full stop.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will use:

steel made by our workers in Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie;

aluminum cast in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Becancour and Kitimat;

and softwood lumber cut in Thunder Bay, Prince George and La Tuque.

Because every time we buy here at home and build here at home, we make Canada stronger.

Mr. Speaker, I will give you one example.

Yesterday, in Saint-Tite, a small rural city in my riding, I visited Boulet Boots, a family business that has made boots since 1933!

I even had the opportunity to build part of the shoes I am wearing today, with the help of many skilled workers - a reminder of the craftsmanship and pride that make the Canadian manufacturing industry strong.

The same shoes worn by RCMP officers!

Made in Canada, by Canadians, for Canadians. That's the way to go!

That's what Buy Canadian is all about: good jobs, resilient communities, and pride in what we build together.

We are building an economy by Canadians, for Canadians.

Canada has A Legacy of Builders, Mr. Speaker, that same spirit of building at home has defined Canada for generations. We have done this before.

Back in 1945, just after the war, Canada had to think big. As so-called ""Minister of Everything"" at the time, the great C.D. Howe banked on the boundless potential of Canada to make big, big changes. He was not afraid to bet big on Canadians - and neither are we.

We built the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, creating a deep-water route from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean;

We built the James Bay hydroelectric facility in 1985, providing abundant clean energy to power Canadian industries and enabling Canada to become one of the world's top producers of renewable hydroelectric energy.

Each generation has taken on its share of the work and left the next generation stronger for it.

We will do it again.

With planned investments of 115 billion dollars in infrastructure over 5 years, we will meet the moment and build the backbone of Canada's next economy.

Our task is simple but profound:

to turn plans into projects,

projects into careers,

and careers into prosperity.

And to do so in a way that protects our future, our nature, and our core values, building in true partnership with Indigenous Peoples, whose stewardship and knowledge of the land continue to guide us today.

Because we do not just build for ourselves. We build for those who will follow.

I am often reminded of the Seven Generation Principle, rooted in Indigenous teachings - a reminder that every decision we take today must consider its impacts on future generations.

Mr. Speaker, a strong country invests not only in its economy, but also in its identity.

Over the past year, Canadians have shown what Canada is really made of.

When global uncertainty tested us, we looked to each other.

People asked where their food was grown and chose to buy from local farmers and producers.

Families travelled across the country and rediscovered its beauty, from coast to coast to coast.

Communities rallied around Canadian businesses, creators, and workers.

That, Mr. Speaker, is what it means to be Canadian. To stand up for one another, to build together, and to take pride in what we make, grow, and create here at home.

We are a bilingual, diverse and compassionate country; shaped by reconciliation, equality, and respect.

Canada faces a steep housing supply gap that threatens affordability, opportunity, and the ability for Canadians to build their lives here at home.

Budget 2025 is the most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War!

With investments of 13 billion dollars over 5 years, our flagship home building initiative, Build Canada Homes, will build at a speed and scale not seen in generations.

We will double the pace of housing construction over the next decade while creating a new industry using Canadian technology, Canadian workers, and Canadian lumber.

We will improve affordability and create careers in the skilled trades, Mr. Speaker.

Every home built is a step toward a more affordable, more confident Canada.

Affordability is not only about housing.

It's about making life easier for Canadians and reducing everyday costs, while protecting the programs that families depend on.

Canadians elected us to take bold action to help them improve their quality of life quickly.

That's what we did, Mr. Speaker, and will continue to do:

We cut taxes for 22 million Canadians;

We brought down gas prices by 18 cents per litre when we cancelled the consumer carbon price;

We made permanent the National School Food Program, helping 400,000 children each year;

We've launched automatic federal benefits, reaching 5.5 million low-income Canadians, to ensure no one gets left behind;

We will strengthen competition in the telecommunications and banking sectors in order to drive down costs.

These are practical measures that make life more affordable today and build confidence for tomorrow.

Because when Canadians can afford a home, raise a family, and plan for the future, our entire country grows stronger.

Because prosperity is only meaningful when it is shared and when all Canadians can see themselves in the promise of this country.

As the Prime Minister has said: there can be no prosperity without security.

And I'm sure, Mr. Speaker, that every member of this House would agree that we need to protect our people, our communities, and our country.

A confident nation protects its sovereignty at home and its interests abroad, through strength, stability, and partnership with Allies who share our values.

With $30 billion over five years, Budget 2025 represents the largest defence investment in decades.

We will meet our NATO 2% commitment this year, modernize NORAD, reinforce our Arctic defences, and equip the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces with the infrastructure and technology they need to safeguard our nation.

With our new Defence Investment Agency and Defence Industrial Strategy, we will build up Canada's defence industry - strengthening Canadian businesses and supporting Canadian workers.

Our work on defence will strengthen Canadian research centres, and Canadian communities in the North, working with our Inuit and First Nations partners, by building dual-use infrastructure - like ports and airport runways.

We will further build our security and defence capabilities, right here at home - creating new jobs for our engineers, technicians and scientists in sectors such as aerospace, shipbuilding, cybersecurity, and AI.

We will hire 1,000 new border services officers and 1,000 new RCMP personnel to secure our borders and keep our communities safe.

Finally, by investing in law enforcement and justice reform, we will tackle organized crime, gun violence, and auto theft.

We will also invest and we will continue, with passion and determination, as my colleague Minister Valdez is doing, the important work with the provinces and territories to end gender-based violence.

We are taking all these actions because we believe in Canada.

As we strengthen our security partnerships, it is essential that we also deepen our economic partnerships.

In order to build a stronger future, we must increase trade, innovate faster, and play a leading role in clean and conventional energy.

Trade has always been one of Canada's strengths, connecting our population, our resources, and our industries to the rest of the world.

But too much of that trade depends on a single partner.

Through Budget 2025, we are launching a Trade Diversification Strategy supported by a Trade Diversification Corridors Fund to expand Canada's reach, double our overseas exports within a decade, unlocking 300 billion dollars in new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses.

We will strengthen ports, railways, and ports of entry, we will reduce bottlenecks, and we will open faster routes to global markets.

Because when Canadian businesses are competitive and successful abroad, Canadian workers and communities prosper right here at home.

Mr. Speaker, Canada is the best place to live, and top talent from around the world want to come here because they see opportunities and possibilities to contribute to cutting-edge research.

With our flagship International Talent Attraction Strategy of $1.7 billion, we will make sure that the best and brightest continue to chose Canada to innovate, invent and grow our industry.

By making a generational investment of 115 billion dollars over 5 years in measures that will drive productivity and competitiveness, we will supercharge growth in Canada, and become the strongest economy of the G7.

Productivity is not about working harder, it's about working smarter.

It's about how well we mobilize ideas, workers, investment, and innovation to generate growth.

It is what drives wages up, improves living standards, and strengthens public services.

For too long, Canada's productivity has been lagging - a challenge we can and must overcome.

AI will play a key role, along with quantum and other advanced technologies, to put Canada on a path of sustained growth.

Budget 2025 initiates this change by rethinking how Canada competes and creates value.

Through:

A Productivity Super-Deduction to create the right climate for businesses to invest in new machinery, equipment, and technologies.

A bold expansion of projects of national interest in AI, clean technology, and advanced manufacturing - turning Canadian innovation into industrial strength.

And enhancing tax incentives for Canadian builders to conduct research and development - and making it seamless for them to apply to these essential tax credits that drive innovation and productivity.

Mr. Speaker, numbers in the budget can seem abstract, so let me make them concrete.

As I said earlier, this budget will unleash one trillion dollars in total investment over the next five years. That would boost average wages by over $3,000 per year!

It would add 15 billion dollars to federal revenues that can support health care, lower your taxes and pay down Canada's debt.

We choose Canada. We will make Canada Strong.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, throughout our history, we have opened our doors to the world. We have always welcomed:

those fleeing the most difficult situations;

those seeking to study at our world-class universities;

and those willing to share their expertise and drive innovation in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, we are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels - allowing us to fulfill the promise of Canada to those who call it home.

Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system, while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our economy.

Our plan will allow us to ensure better control of our immigration system while maintaining our approach based on our Canadian values.

Climate action is not only a moral obligation, it is an economic necessity.

The key to competitiveness and growth is also to be a leader in a low-carbon economy.

Our Climate Competitiveness Strategy turns Canada's natural wealth - critical minerals, clean power - into lasting prosperity.

Reducing our emissions is essential to protecting the competitiveness of Canada's energy sectors.

We are introducing a comprehensive suite of clean economy investment tax credits - measures that are already generating billions of dollars in private capital for projects in hydrogen, carbon capture, and clean electricity.

These investments will modernize our power grids, speed up approvals for major clean energy projects, and expand the transmission lines that connect our provinces.

By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and help our industries thrive in the global economy.

We have the most skilled and talented workers as well as the most educated workforce in the world. We can all be very proud of that.

Budget 2025 expands learning, training, and growth opportunities for young people.

It creates new pathways for careers in construction, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

It is essential that we give the next generation the confidence and skills needed to succeed.

So, through a suite of new measures, we will extend union training, extend the tax credit to personal support workers, and enhance labour mobility.

Mr. Speaker, Canadian workers will drive Canada's economic transformation with new skills and training, and they will seize the exciting, high-paying careers it will create.

In the words of the Canadian Labour Congress, ""these measures signal a shift toward putting workers at the heart of Canada's economic strategy"".

This is how we give Canadians the tools they need to shape the future.

This is how we Build Canada Strong.

To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the budget I am tabling today is our framework for Canada's future and a roadmap to prosperity and resilience.

It all comes down to a choice between two visions.

One vision of resignation - a vision that would scale back the vital support Canadians rely on, make it harder for families to find a home, and leave our country more vulnerable, poorer, and dependent.

And another vision - one rooted in confidence. Confidence in Canadians, and in the belief that by making generational investments today, we can build lasting prosperity for tomorrow.

By putting more money in people's pockets.

By ensuring every Canadian can retire with dignity.

By making the dream of home ownership a reality once again

By building the infrastructure our cities need to grow.

By keeping our communities safe for our children and our parents.

Budget 2025 makes our choice clear: we choose confidence over resignation. We choose to empower Canadians - to build this country together and to protect what we hold dear.

Mr. Speaker, it's about confidence. In ourselves, in our capacity to adapt, and in the promise of this great country.

It is about a Canada that builds, protects, and empowers.

It's about moving from reliance to resilience, and from uncertainty to prosperity.

Let's rise to this generational challenge.

Let's build Canada strong.

Because we are - and always will be - the true North, strong and free.

From: Lori Lodes, Climate Power

Date: November 4, 2025

Subject: Rising energy costs dominated the ballot in 2025—and created a playbook for Democratic candidates in 2026

Today, Democratic candidates prevailed and won critical elections in New Jersey, Virginia, Georgia and New York City. The winning candidates represented the full ideological spectrum of the Democratic Party but were united by a common theme – addressing the rising cost of living for the American people. In each of these races, Democrats stayed on offense on affordability with skyrocketing utility bills becoming a key campaign issue in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia.

Democratic candidates won by hammering Trump and Republicans on rising costs, including their reckless war on clean energy. To win in 2026, candidates should remain on offense on costs and position energy prices, along with issues like health care, at the center of their messaging, making clear that Trump and Republicans are responsible for raising electricity bills by taking affordable, reliable clean energy off the grid. The contrast is clear—Democrats want to bring cheaper energy online faster to drive down costs, while Republicans are taking energy options offline to benefit their billionaire donors and spike costs for everyone else.

How Democratic Candidates Won on Energy Costs in 2025

Voters in New Jersey, Virginia and Georgia have felt the acute pain of soaring energy prices:

New Jersey residents saw a 22.21% increase between July 2024 and 2025.

Virginians saw an average 11.25% increase in their utility bills since last year.

Georgians using the largest utility provider in the state saw their bills increase $518 in each of the last two years.

Democratic candidates, in each of these states, successfully positioned energy prices as a central pillar of their affordability-focused campaign—outlining a clear path to lower costs while holding Republicans accountable for their harmful agenda that raised them.

In New Jersey, Rep. Mikie Sherrill made lowering energy prices central to her campaign for governor, pairing an aggressive clean energy plan with relentless attacks on Trump and Republicans for cutting cheaper, faster clean energy. The contrast was clear: While Sherrill’s campaign focused on freezing electricity costs, Ciattarelli and Republicans attacked clean energy projects that would bring more energy to the grid quickly. In a recent Fox News poll on the race, in which Sherrill led with likely voters by 52-45, she had a 10-point lead on energy costs (54-44), up from just 3 points in mid-October. Exit polls in New Jersey found that 59% of voters viewed electricity costs as a major problem and only 12% said no problem at all.

In Virginia, Abigail Spanberger centered energy affordability in her campaign for governor, combining her own plan to tackle rising energy costs with direct attacks on Trump’s clean energy cuts, while Winsome Earle-Sears parroted Trump’s attacks on clean energy. Spanberger criticized Trump for gutting energy investments in Virginia, raising energy prices through the “One Big, Beautiful Bill,” and slashing jobs and critical projects in the state. Meanwhile, Earle-Sears attacked cheaper, reliable, clean energy and said that she supported the president as Trump slashed and threatened jobs in her own state. The Virginia debate also presaged another emerging theme: the exponential increase in energy demand from data centers that makes Republican cuts to our energy supply even more catastrophic for Americans’ utility bills.

In Georgia, for the first time in almost 20 years, two Democratic candidates will hold seats on the Public Service Commission. The Commission regulates utilities and dictates how to meet energy demand. The Democratic candidates, Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johnson, challenged two Republican incumbents by aggressively highlighting the soaring energy cost crisis under state Republicans—and pledging to increase clean energy. The race garnered national attention as voters expressed frustration toward the Republican-led Commission for hiking rates six separate times in the past two years.

A Winning Playbook for 2026

These outcomes did not happen in a vacuum: electricity rates have risen 11% nationally under Trump, and voters across the country are increasingly citing energy costs as a top concern. The race is on to win the fight over blame, with Republicans like Steve Bannon already pointing to energy costs as a key electoral flashpoint. These electoral results serve as a framework one year ahead of the midterms: As part of the focus on affordability, Democratic candidates can make a clear, coherent, and assertive case that Republicans are driving up energy costs by canceling clean energy projects.

Notably, both Sherrill and Spanberger found success directly tying rising utility costs to Republicans’ clean energy cuts, a valuable blueprint for candidates looking to connect with voters on this issue. Despite the Republican candidate being better known and having come within 4 points of winning the governorship before, Sherrill was able to beat back blatantly false attacks, part of the more than $12 million Republicans spent on ads mentioning energy prices. By centering costs and including energy in the story of an increasingly expensive American life, Democratic candidates can connect with voters and win in 2026.

Voters just drew a line in the sand: they want lower energy bills and real solutions—not more politics and excuses. Republicans will attempt to course-correct by blaming Democrats for soaring energy costs. However, Republicans’ attacks on clean energy over the last year are indefensible: Trump’s war on clean energy has made energy more expensive, cut more than 158,000 clean energy jobs (nearly half of which are in Republican districts), and jeopardized $24 billion in energy projects and over 338,000 jobs. While Republicans will try to hide from their disqualifying records, a successful 2026 strategy effectively and aggressively holds them accountable. Democrats’ 2026 strategy must make one thing crystal clear: Republicans broke our path to cheaper, faster and clean energy—and voters are paying the price.

Both women outperformed already sky-high expectations to categorically trounce their Trump-aligned Republican opponents.

In two races defined by the cost-of-living crisis, both governors-elect ran, won, and achieved decisive victories by championing energy affordability and successfully defining their opponents on energy costs. In the face of direct attacks from Donald Trump and his allies, they earned voters’ trust with common-sense plans to lower costs, take on broken systems that stack the cards against working people, and expand clean energy in their states.

Their historic victories offer a clear playbook for Democrats searching for a winning strategy ahead of next year’s midterms. Here’s how they did it:

Go Big on Clean Energy Affordability

Ratepayers in both New Jersey and Virginia have faced brutal price hikes—and there was no shying away from that reality in these elections. Gubernatorial candidates in both parties focused a significant portion of their messages to voters on energy costs, but the candidates backing clean energy had the clear advantage.

Mikie Sherrill, New Jersey

In New Jersey, Mikie Sherrill made fighting rising energy costs a centerpiece of her campaign:

Her platform promised to drive down utility costs with bold action to “massively build out cheaper and cleaner power generation” and “require more transparency"" from utilities and PJM, New Jersey’s grid operator.

In the final weeks of the race, Sherrill’s campaign ran multiple ads highlighting her commitment to a Day One Emergency Declaration on Utility Costs.

On the campaign trail, Sherrill spoke directly to voters about how PJM's failures have contributed to rising rates, how Trump and Jack Ciattarelli’s anti-clean-energy tax bill is making the problem worse, and how she would use clean energy to curb out-of-control costs.

Sherrill decided to go on offense on energy affordability—and it paid off. She defined the issue in the race and put forward common-sense solutions that helped her secure key endorsements and gain a commanding ten-point lead over her opponent in voter trust on energy costs.

It’s Time for Democrats to Go on Offense With Clean Energy

Deploying clean energy is the cheapest, fastest way to get more power on the grid and drive down costs. Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans have torched their credibility on energy affordability with their crusade against clean energy projects and investment across the country. One recent poll from Global Strategy Group found that when voters learned of Republican attacks on clean energy, it shifted the generic congressional ballot by 18 points toward Democrats. The Sherrill and Spanberger campaigns leveraged their opponents’ weakness and turned it into a signature strength by offering a better, more affordable path forward.

Meanwhile, two Democratic candidates for the Georgia Public Service Commission delivered the party’s first victories for a statewide constitutional office in Georgia since 2006 by framing the election as a referendum on rising energy bills.

Voters across the country spoke loud and clear: They want leaders who will go big on clean energy deployment and hold utilities and grid operators accountable. Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger showed us how to answer the call—now it’s up to them to deliver, and for leaders across the country to take up the mantle.

The urgency of this issue has intensified in recent weeks following a significant escalation in U.S.-China trade tensions. On October 10, 2025, President Trump announced plans to impose an additional 100% tariff on Chinese imports starting November 1, 2025, in response to China’s new restrictions on rare-earth mineral exports. This announcement triggered a global market sell-off and heightened concerns about supply chain disruptions in the renewable energy sector – the imposed tariffs will particularly have acute impacts on solar, battery storage, and wind component costs. China has countered with its own measures, including new port fees and sanctions on foreign companies, further complicating the trade landscape. Given these developments, this article outlines several approaches that sponsors and financing parties can use to manage tariff-related risks, spanning contractual structuring, financial modeling and structuring, and strategic planning.

For Sponsors:

Tariff Risk-Sharing Clauses in Project Documents

Sponsors can embed tariff-specific provisions into EPC, supply, and O&M agreements. Ideally, to shield themselves—and by extension, lenders—from cost volatility, sponsors would secure fixed-price contracts and allocate as much tariff risk as possible to suppliers or EPC contractors. However, in today’s tariff environment, a balanced approach is often more commercially feasible. For example, one party may assume tariff risk up to a certain threshold (either in absolute dollar terms or as a percentage), after which the other party shares in the tariff burden. Beyond a second threshold, either or both parties may have termination rights. Some sponsors have also successfully negotiated limited tariff risk-sharing with offtakers. Example structures include enabling the sponsor to seek a defined contract price increase if its costs exceed an agreed-upon threshold by automatic right, with anything above that threshold requiring joint approval with the offtaker. Further, should joint agreement not be possible, the sponsor sometimes has an early termination right (often coupled with a termination fee) if the project just isn’t economic.

Maximizing Other Incentives

Given the volatility and potential rise in tariffs, sponsors should maximize the use of government incentives, tax credits, and subsidies to offset tariff-related costs. Monitoring policy developments is crucial. Sourcing components domestically or investing in domestic manufacturing can help sponsors bypass tariffs and reduce the compliance burden related to “foreign entity of concern” rules under tax credit regimes. Exploring alternative technologies or renewable solutions not currently subject to tariffs may also yield better tariff treatment and unlock eligibility for tax credits unaffected by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. To learn more about the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and recent guidance, please see here and here.

Strategic Partnerships and Supply Chain Diversification

Sponsors may benefit from building relationships with suppliers across multiple countries to reduce dependency on tariff-affected nations. Forming strategic partnerships with global renewable energy firms can enhance negotiating power. Collaborating with industry groups and leveraging advocacy channels can also help push for regulatory clarity, stability, and potential tariff exemptions for renewable components.

Financing Structures and Insurance Protections

Sponsors may also consider mezzanine financing or hybrid debt instruments to provide flexibility amid tariff-induced cost fluctuations by providing sponsors with liquidity to make quick buying decisions when pricing is more advantageous. Project refinancing strategies can also help adapt to changing tariff environments. Additionally, specialized tariff or political risk insurance can protect projects from sudden tariff implementation or escalation. Such insurance products, typically offered by multilateral agencies, export credit institutions, or private insurers, can be structured to protect the insured project or portfolio from financial losses arising from unforeseen tariff imposition, increases in existing tariffs, or other trade‑restrictive measures implemented by host or foreign governments. This coverage can be critical for projects with cross‑border supply chains, imported equipment, or raw materials subject to international commodity flows.

For Financing Parties:

From the financing side, existing protections often include indemnity carve-outs that prioritize lender repayment over sponsor obligations, ensuring indemnities sit below debt service in the cash waterfall. Financing parties may also:

Incorporate additional deadline cushions.

Request sponsor certifications regarding AD/CVD and tariff risks.

Require tariff-specific contingency reserves or guarantees to cover tariff-related cost increases.

Assess sponsor creditworthiness (e.g., financial disclosures, minimum liquidity).

Consider requesting equity contribution agreements or secured guarantees.

Request tariff contingencies in financial models and/or special insurance coverage.

Ultimately, financing parties should be responsive to the kinds of mitigants that the applicable sponsor has been able to obtain in its project contracts for tariff risks.

As the global trade landscape continues to shift, tariff exposure will remain a critical consideration in project development and financing. By proactively embedding risk-sharing mechanisms, leveraging policy incentives, and aligning financial structures with evolving regulatory realities, both sponsors and financing parties can better navigate uncertainty and safeguard project viability. A thoughtful, collaborative approach to tariff risk management not only strengthens individual projects but also contributes to the resilience of the broader renewable energy ecosystem.

The bill, among other provisions, sets a 3 GW solar goal, creates Virtual Power Plant (VPP) and Time-of-Use programs, and requires Project Labor Agreements (PLAs) for community-solar projects 3 MWac and larger.

In parallel, after advocacy from stakeholders—including Michael R. Strong of Fox Swibel Levin & Carroll—the state’s Illinois Shines program is reopening for a new round of capacity to accelerate deployment amid the phase-down of the 30% federal solar tax credit.

The Illinois Shines Adjustable Block Program will expand the 2025–26 program year by 873 MW of new capacity. Unused prior-year allocations will be distributed to wait-listed projects that did not make the upcoming lottery.

Capacity is divided among private and school behind-the-meter systems as well as multiple types of community solar. Systems under and over 25 kWac—the cutoff between small and large distributed generation—each receive 142 MW of new capacity. Traditional community solar gains 213 MW, “community-driven” projects 36 MW, public schools 107 MW, and “Equity-Eligible Contractor” projects 233 MW.

Maria Bries, a deal lawyer at Fox Swibel Levin & Carroll, highlighted the new requirement for PLAs before incentives are awarded to projects larger than 3 MWac. She pointed to a recent study showing that PLA processes can actually lower bid prices on solar projects. Bries told pv magazine USA:

“Since Governor Pritzker’s Executive Order in 2019 requiring project labor agreements for public works projects, it has been a sticking point with county boards across the state that community solar developers under Illinois Shines were excluded. The support of labor unions was critical to get CRGA across the finish line in record time, and PLAs will ensure a less contentious permitting process, not to mention more competitive bids and diverse workforce as recent research in Illinois has proven.”

In a broader energy package, legislators also passed the omnibus bill SB 25—essentially the “cake” beneath the solar “icing.”

Key provisions include a 3 GW energy-storage target, a statewide VPP program, community-solar storage rebates, and inflation adjustments to Renewable Portfolio Standard (RPS) pricing to reflect real-world cost trends.

According to analysis provided to pv magazine USA by Kady McFadden, of McFadden Strategies, the legislation also includes a lengthy list of additional clean-energy policies:

– Public Integrated Resource Planning for the state’s cooperative utilities to improve grid consistency.

– Updated energy-efficiency goals for utilities.

– Consideration of a social cost of carbon in state planning.

– The first steps toward a Solar Bill of Rights.

– Time-of-Use pricing structures.

Speaking with pv magazine USA, McFadden said solar and storage developers should pay close attention to two key items: the community solar energy storage adder and the new inflation adjustment for RPS revenue.

The prior, offering $250 per kWh of nameplate storage—could raise community solar capacity factors and energy output (via increased module installations) by up to 30%, making it financially viable to store excess solar generation for later use. The latter, she said, could add roughly 1.8 GW of solar and 4 GW of wind capacity simply by aligning incentives with actual cost increases.

Several nuclear-energy provisions were included as well—some favoring nuclear, others supporting solar. Illinois, which currently generates about 53% of its electricity from nuclear, fully lifted its moratorium on new nuclear construction. Earlier legislation had only lifted the ban for plants under 300 MW; this new change removes it entirely.

Meanwhile, an existing subsidy for nuclear plants is being phased out as planned, but rather than ending altogether, its funding will be redirected to support additional clean-energy deployment.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/FlexGen.png,N,,2025-11-05 04:58:45.299259

The real game-changers might be two lesser-known technologies: Carbon Capture, Utilisation and Storage (CCUS) and hydrogen.

Together, CCUS and hydrogen are being hailed as the ""last-mile"" solutions to slash emissions that can't be avoided, especially in heavy industries like steel, cement, and petrochemicals. These sectors are the backbone of the economy, but also among the hardest to clean up.

These two technologies of the future are the missing pieces to help the world -- and Thailand -- reach its carbon neutrality and net-zero targets.

In short, to save the planet and humanity.

The catch? They're still very costly and stuck in a tangle of policies and legal gaps. But if Thailand wants a truly low-carbon future, these two technologies might just be the keys to getting there.

How CCUS works

CCUS works by capturing carbon dioxide (CO₂) before it escapes into the air -- usually from factory chimneys or other emission sources. The captured gas is then stored deep underground in layers of rock or put to use in other ways, such as being processed into new materials or reused in the energy and petrochemical industries.

Around the world, this technology captures about 400 million tonnes of carbon each year, still a drop in the ocean compared to total emissions.

Some countries are moving fast. In the United States, the Gulf Coast industrial cluster now traps more than 20 million tonnes of CO₂ a year, with plans to scale up sevenfold to 140 million tonnes.

This progress didn't happen by accident. It's driven by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which gives companies up to US$85 in tax credit for every tonne of carbon they capture. Capturing one tonne of carbon can cost anywhere between $15 and $120, depending on the emission source.

Without tax incentives from the government, CCUS would be too costly and economically unviable.

Thailand also has potential. A study by the Global CCS Institute suggests the Gulf of Thailand could store more than 8.4 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide. This is enough to keep emissions safely locked away for decades.

But CCUS won't take off in Thailand unless the government get four things right.

First, it needs to set clear national CCUS targets that fit with the country's net-zero goals. Second, there should be one government body in charge, with proper laws and rules covering every step of the value chain.

Third, investors need a reason to get on board. They need financial support and incentives that make the effort worthwhile. And most importantly, Thailand needs a fair carbon price, so the market itself starts pushing the change.

Green Hydrogen

While CCUS tackles emissions that can't be avoided, hydrogen offers a path to cleaner fuel. When burned or used in fuel cells, hydrogen releases no carbon at all. Hydrogen, particularly green hydrogen made with renewable energy, can even store power for weeks to solve one of the biggest problems of solar and wind energy: their instability.

Many developed countries are racing ahead with hydrogen technology. Germany is building a 1,200-kilometre hydrogen pipeline network to connect industries across the country by 2030.

Japan has had a hydrogen strategy since 2017 and recently passed new laws -- the GX Promotion Act (2023) and Hydrogen Society Promotion Act (2024) -- to speed up real-world use, including testing ships that carry liquid hydrogen. Meanwhile, Australia aims to become a major hydrogen exporter, starting with hydrogen made from coal and CCUS, and moving to full-scale green hydrogen by 2030.

Thailand has started to move too. There are plans to test green hydrogen mixed with natural gas to generate electricity, but that may not be efficient in the long run. Making hydrogen from clean electricity only to turn it back into power wastes energy at several stages. A better use would be in heavy transport as fuel for trucks, buses, and cargo ships that need steady, high power. There are several pilot projects in the heavy transport sector. For example, the state energy firm PTT aims to produce green hydrogen and build filling stations to serve 30-50 hydrogen-powered trucks. A Thai–Japanese partnership is also testing 20 trucks that can run more than 600 kilometres a day on hydrogen fuel cells.

But cost remains a major roadblock. Green hydrogen now costs 280 to 340 baht per kilogramme. To compete with diesel, it must drop to around 200. Domestic demand is still weak too, as Thailand lacks both infrastructure and a clear policy direction. Thailand is taking its first steps into the hydrogen era. The progress is small but promising. Still, without faster action, the country risks becoming just an importer of hydrogen rather than a developer that can add value and create jobs at home.

To make hydrogen part of the real economy, Thailand needs to move on several fronts.

Green hydrogen should first be used in heavy transport -- trucks, buses, and ships that need powerful, continuous energy. The government also needs to set clear safety standards and update the rules to officially allow hydrogen as a fuel.

Costs have to come down, too, so green hydrogen can compete with diesel. And to make it practical, Thailand must expand its refuelling network, attract private investment, and fund more research and development.

Both CCUS and hydrogen hold enormous promise. But that promise will remain out of reach without clear long-term goals, coherent policies, strong laws, and the right financial incentives.

The sooner Thailand invests in these technologies of the future, the greater its chance of shaping, not just surviving, the world's next energy revolution.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/11/05/5837209_700.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 04:59:06.076940

The investment in Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies is the latest stake taken by the U.S. in a handful of private companies — including another rare earths company and chipmaker Intel — since President Donald Trump began his second term in January. The White House has made it a priority to bolster the nation's supply chain in a market dominated by China.

Vulcan Elements manufactures rare earth magnets, while ReElement processes rare earth mineral ores and recycles old batteries and other products made with rare earths.

Rare earths are used in fighter jets, guided missiles, drones and nuclear submarines as well as smartphones and wind turbines.

The influx of cash will allow Vulcan and ReElement to ramp up their annual magnet production to 10,000 tonnes annually, the companies said.

“Our investment in Vulcan Elements will accelerate U.S. production of rare earth magnets for American manufacturers,” Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick said. “We are laser-focused on bringing critical mineral and rare earth manufacturing back home, ensuring America’s supply chain is strong, secure and perfectly reliable.”

The deal announced this week comes just days after Trump met with Chinese leader Xi Jinping and agreed to cut tariffs on China, which Beijing reciprocated by allowing the export of rare earth elements.

Before Xi and Trump met last week, China had imposed restrictions that would have required foreign companies to get special approval to export items that contain even small traces of rare earths elements sourced from China, even if those products were made elsewhere by foreign companies. However, it didn't eliminate restrictions that were imposed in the spring after Trump imposed his initial round of tariffs.

China accounts for nearly 70% of the world’s rare earths mining and controls roughly 90% of global rare earths processing.

The deal includes a $620 million loan from the Department of Defense, $50 million of federal incentives from the Department of Commerce and $550 million in private capital.

The Defense Department will receive warrants in both Vulcan and ReElement, with Commerce getting a $50 million equity stake in Vulcan.

In July, the Defense Department agreed to invest $400 million in shares of the Las Vegas-based MP Materials, which runs the only American rare earths mine. The unusual direct investment in the company made the government the largest shareholder in MP Materials.

A week later, MP Materials announced a new $500 million agreement with tech giant Apple to produce more of the powerful magnets used in iPhones as well as other high-tech products like electric vehicles.

U.S. Steel, Lithium Americas and Trilogy Metals are among the companies the U.S. government has taken equity stakes in under Trump.

India is transforming into a global manufacturing hub, attracting high-value production, research, and exports from advanced economies. Companies like Ford and HP are leveraging India's skilled workforce, policy incentives, and geopolitical realignments to establish it as a strategic production base, moving beyond just local consumption.

Over the past few years, India has been steadily transforming from a large consumer market into a global manufacturing hub. But recent announcements indicate a deeper shift. Companies from the world’s most advanced industrial economies are not merely assembling products in India for local consumption but are increasingly using India as a base for high-value production, research and exports. This movement underlines India’s growing strategic importance on the global manufacturing map, driven by a blend of policy incentives, geopolitical realignments and the sheer scale of its skilled labour force.

From domestic pressure to global pragmatism

Ford’s latest move exemplifies how multinational corporations are balancing local political pressures with global business realities. The company recently announced that its Chennai plant in Tamil Nadu will be retooled to produce high-end engines for export markets, with an annual capacity of over 235,000 units. Interestingly, these engines will not be shipped to the United States, a subtle but telling detail. Even as U.S. President Donald Trump had long championed reshoring and domestic production, companies like Ford recognise that competitive manufacturing costs and supply chain resilience increasingly lie beyond American borders.

India offers a compelling alternative. It provides a relatively stable political environment, a large engineering talent pool and improving logistics infrastructure. Ford’s investment also signals confidence in India’s manufacturing ecosystem, especially in the automotive and components sector, where India has already established itself as a global supplier to markets in Europe, Africa and Asia.

HP bets on local value chains

The American tech giant HP’s plans to make all its laptops in India mark a significant evolution in the electronics manufacturing landscape. HP’s CEO Enrique Lores, in a recent interview with The Economic Times, stated that within three to five years, all personal computers sold in India will be produced locally, and eventually, exports too will originate from Indian plants.

This decision aligns with India’s Production Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes, which have been specifically designed to attract large-scale electronics manufacturing. It also reflects the government’s broader Make in India and Digital India ambitions, which aim to deepen domestic value chains in high-tech sectors. For HP, the move offers dual advantages: it localises production in one of its largest markets and positions India as a competitive export hub in the global PC ecosystem, potentially replacing or supplementing China and Southeast Asian countries.

The Korean confidence

While American companies are expanding manufacturing for strategic cost reasons, South Korean firms seem to be betting on India for long-term industrial and technological integration. LG Electronics, one of South Korea’s biggest conglomerates, is reportedly exploring shifting production of capital goods, which are used to set up electronic product and display factories, from Korea, China and Vietnam to India.

This signals a shift beyond consumer electronics to higher-value manufacturing and industrial technology. Simultaneously, LG Corp, the group’s holding company, is investing Rs 1,000 crore to establish a global research and development center in Noida, expected to employ about 500 people. This dual focus, on both manufacturing and R&D, illustrates how South Korean conglomerates increasingly view India not just as a market or a cost-efficient factory floor, but as a full-fledged innovation and production ecosystem.

HP plans to manufacture all PCs sold in India locally in 3-5 years

Analysts in Seoul attribute this interest to multiple factors such as India’s large pool of technical professionals, growing government support and an emerging geopolitical logic that encourages diversification away from China. As Sunwoo Kim of Meritz Securities notes, “Various Korean tech companies have reviewed entry into India over the past few years, primarily due to abundant human resources, government subsidies and geopolitical issues.”

Policy, people and politics

Three forces underpin this global tilt toward India. First, the government’s consistent industrial policy anchored in schemes such as Make in India, PLI schemes and Atmanirbhar Bharat, has created a strong policy push for localisation. Second, India’s demographic dividend continues to be one of its biggest draws. Its young, technically skilled, English-speaking workforce can operate across design, production and digital integration. Third, the shifting geopolitical landscape, marked by trade tensions between the U.S. and China, and a broader global appetite for supply chain diversification, has made India a strategic hedge for multinational corporations.

The convergence of these factors allows India to occupy a unique position of not being a low-cost substitute for China, but a parallel centre of manufacturing competence capable of serving global markets.

""Tesla's pivot toward Korean suppliers follows its effort to diversify away from CATL, a Chinese battery maker that had supplied most of its cost-effective ESS battery cells.","Seoul [South Korea], November 5 (ANI): Samsung SDI is reportedly in final talks with Tesla to supply around 3 trillion won (USD 2.1 billion) worth of energy storage system battery cells, signaling the US electric vehicle giant's growing reliance on Korean battery makers amid Washington's push to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains, as per a report by the Korean Herald.According to the report on Tuesday, executives from Tesla's ESS division visited Korea last week and reached near-final terms with Samsung SDI on a multi-year supply contract. The deal would cover approximately 10 gigawatt-hours of lithium-iron-phosphate battery cells per year, starting as early as 2026, generating an estimated annual revenue of 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion won for Samsung SDI.Tesla CEO, Elon Musk, said on X, ""Slightly different versions of the Tesla AI5 chip will be made at TSMC and Samsung simply because they translate designs to physical form differently, but the goal is that our AI software works identically. We will have samples and maybe a small number of units in 2026, but high volume production is only possible in 2027. AI6 will use the same fabs, but achieve roughly 2X performance. Aiming for a fast follow to AI5, so hopefully mid 2028 for volume production of AI6. AI7 will need different fabs, as it is more adventurous.""The Korean battery maker is expected to produce the cells at its joint venture with Stellantis in Indiana, converting part of the facility's existing EV battery lines into ESS-dedicated production for North American clients, including Tesla.""The reported deal likely involves cell-level supply for Tesla's Megapack assembly lines in California,"" the report quoted an industry source. ""Tesla is expected to integrate the cells into its own Megapack ESS products.""

Samsung SDI's domestic rival, LG Energy Solution, which signed a contract in July to supply Tesla with 20 GWh of LFP ESS battery cells annually, according to the report, is negotiating to raise that volume by 50 per cent to 30 GWh. If both deals proceed, the combined Korean supply of cells to Tesla could reach 40 GWh per year.""The company later confirmed discussions were ongoing but said 'no details have been finalized.' Industry observers say the potential Tesla contract would give Samsung SDI a much-needed boost after recent financial headwinds.

Australia is a sunny place. It’s kind of known for it. It’s the sunniest continent, and the sunniest country outside of the Middle East/Africa, with extensive photovoltaic power potential across its entire territory.

In recognition of that, Australia has been installing lots of solar power. Formerly a coal-heavy nation (for which coal is still its 2nd-largest export), solar and wind have rapidly taken over Australia’s electricity grid, pushing coal and methane gas out of the equation.

This has taken a big chunk out of Australia’s electricity-related climate emissions, and of course resulted in clean air benefits as dirty coal is pushed out of the grid. And climate emissions matter a lot for Australia, a country that is becoming more unbearably hot and suffering more fires due to climate change. (Though Australia is also a great example of how global cooperation on environmental issues can fix a huge problem, as they are the primary beneficiary of global action on closing the hole in the Ozone layer)

So solar power has been a great thing for Australia, especially with rooftop solar on Australian homes.

But it can lead to swingy electricity supply, given that solar only generates electricity when the sun is out.

How swings in solar supply and electricity pricing work

Most areas have certain times of day where more electricity is used than others. These are referred to as “peak hours” and generally they happen in the early evening, when people get home from work, turn on the HVAC, cook dinner, do laundry and the like.

But there are also certain times of day when more electricity is generated, and that’s particularly the case in places with high solar penetration. Solar obviously generates energy only during the day, and creates a peak of generation in the middle of the day, when most people are at work.

There are ways to mitigate this – for example, with batteries, which Australia has also used a lot of (and is thinking about extending that to EV batteries too). Wind power also helps, since wind tends to pick up in the hours that solar is dropping off.

But another way to mitigate it is through simple economics. Offer people lower prices in the hours that electricity is more abundant, and higher prices in hours where it isn’t. Then, people will tend to use electricity when they can – especially if they have shiftable loads like electric cars, laundry, pool pumps and such, which don’t need to be on at the same time every day (unlike HVAC, cooking, and lighting, for example).

Most electricity providers will offer something like this, called a “time of use” plan. These plans differ in their rates and peak hours depending on your location and how the supply/demand curves work for electricity there (and have seen common use among electric car owners because of the outsized effect an EV has on home electricity use).

On the utility side, though, the swings in price can be much more drastic. Wholesale prices for electricity can go up to multiple dollars per kilowatt-hour during times of extreme demand when the grid is stressed, and electricity prices can even go negative when there is little demand and lots of supply, particularly on an islanded grid like Australia (this also happens in Texas, where the grid is largely disconnected from the rest of the US). These swings are ironed out for the consumer, so things aren’t as spiky for us, but it can be quite a rollercoaster on the grid side.

In Australia and other places with high solar penetration, these negative electricity prices often happen during the day. That’s when generation is the highest for solar panels, and household loads are typically low.

Australia proposes letting everyone benefit from negative wholesale rates

So, the Australian government has decided on a scheme to bring those electricity savings to the consumer, with what its calling its “Solar Sharer” program.

The program would require electricity retailers to provide free electricity to everyone for at least three hours a day, in recognition of the incredibly low wholesale cost of electricity during daytime due to extensive solar power penetration.

These would likely be in the middle of the day, when most people aren’t home. However, every home has some amount of shiftable electricity load, and the Solar Sharer scheme would encourage people to make use of that. With modern appliances that can be scheduled to start in the middle of the day, people can just plan to do laundry, run the dishwasher, run the pool pump, or charge their car at noon, instead of whenever else they were going to.

Additionally, people could fill up a home battery during the day, and then use that electricity during peak hours when rates are higher. And this plan will help to incentivize private installation of batteries, or other shiftable loads.

The overall effect of this is that it will help to iron out electricity use, making it track more closely with electricity supply, reducing the need for grid upgrades to manage swings in generation. Just turning on this simple behavioral switch, and then publicizing it so customers know to use electricity in the free hours, will both help the grid and help ratepayers save money.

Better yet, this scheme will apply not just to people who have solar or home batteries, but to people who live in places where they can’t put up solar – those who live in apartments and the like. The government says it will require companies to offer this scheme to all customers, not just those with solar.

The government did receive some pushback from electricity retailers, who feel they were not properly consulted on the plan. But Australia’s Climate Change Minister Chris Bowen said he would make “no apologies” if this scheme reduced their margins, and that “consumers are put first” as reported by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.

The government plans to implement the scheme starting in July next year, first in Queensland, New South Wales and South Australia. If it works well, other regions will get it starting in 2027.

Electrek’s Take

Australia is doing a lot of great things with electricity, and acting somewhat like a natural laboratory for a lot of ideas that people have been talking about for a long time. Since the whole country has similar solarization, it can work somewhat as a unit in pushing for solar power, and for reforms to help enable it.

It’s already working on V2G, with a huge trial started recently, and the wide adoption of solar and batteries is proving that even a solar-heavy grid can still work. And an idea like this, showing how simple economics can be used to change consumer behavior, could provide a model for the rest of the world on how to usher us into a cleaner energy future.

So we’ll be watching with interest how this turns out – I think it will likely turn out quite well, if the government goes through with it fully.

The 30% federal solar tax credit is ending this year. If you’ve ever considered going solar, now’s the time to act. To make sure you find a trusted, reliable solar installer near you that offers competitive pricing, check out EnergySage, a free service that makes it easy for you to go solar. It has hundreds of pre-vetted solar installers competing for your business, ensuring you get high-quality solutions and save 20-30% compared to going it alone. Plus, it’s free to use, and you won’t get sales calls until you select an installer and share your phone number with them.",https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/electrek.png?w=32,N,,2025-11-05 03:18:42.141350

AI Supercomputers to Power the Next Era of U.S. Innovation

On October 27, the DOE revealed plans for two new AMD-powered AI supercomputers — Lux and Discovery — at Oak Ridge National Laboratory. The systems will expand U.S. capabilities in scientific computing, defense research, and next-generation energy innovation.

The Lux AI cluster, arriving in early 2026, will use AMD Instinct MI355X GPUs and EPYC CPUs to accelerate breakthroughs in nuclear fusion, quantum computing, and grid modernization. Meanwhile, Discovery — a record-setting HPE Cray system powered by next-generation AMD chips — will debut in 2028, promising performance that surpasses even Frontier, the world’s current second-largest supercomputer.

“Winning the AI race requires new and creative partnerships that bring together the brightest minds in science and industry,” said Energy Secretary Chris Wright. “With Lux and Discovery, America is proving we can build faster, lead stronger, and innovate smarter than anyone in the world.”

The DOE’s new public-private partnership model aims to cut the time required to deploy supercomputers from years to months by sharing costs and infrastructure with private firms.

NVIDIA, Oracle Join DOE for Nation’s Largest AI System

Just a day later, the DOE announced another groundbreaking alliance with NVIDIA and Oracle to build Solstice — the largest AI supercomputer in the Energy Department’s network — alongside a smaller system called Equinox, both housed at Argonne National Laboratory.

The Solstice system will feature 100,000 NVIDIA Blackwell GPUs, while Equinox will include 10,000, each designed to power scientific research from energy security to advanced materials discovery. Oracle will also provide immediate AI resources to DOE researchers, marking what officials called a “new commonsense model” for high-speed collaboration.

“AI is the most powerful technology of our time, and science is its greatest frontier,” said NVIDIA founder Jensen Huang. “Together, we’re building an AI factory that will serve as America’s engine for discovery.”

Trump Administration Invests $100 Million to Modernize Coal Plants

Capping off the week, the DOE issued a $100 million Notice of Funding Opportunity to refurbish and modernize the nation’s aging coal power plants — part of President Trump’s broader effort to restore energy independence and end what officials call the “war on coal.”

“For years, the Biden and Obama administrations relentlessly targeted America’s coal workers,” said Wright. “President Trump is restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

The initiative will fund projects focused on improving power plant efficiency, enabling dual fuel capabilities between coal and natural gas, and developing advanced wastewater recovery systems. Managed by DOE’s National Energy Technology Laboratory, applications are due January 7, 2026.

4 hours ago

Stormont has been urged to back the creation of an independent Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for Northern Ireland.

Agriculture and Environment Minister Andrew Muir told members their cooperation was ""crucial"" and he was seeking ""an agreement in principle"" to get legislation in place by the end of this mandate.

But he warned that working in a power-sharing executive was ""hard"", and the Northern Ireland Assembly chamber was ""nothing more than a toxic thunderdome"" in terms of engagement.

The recommendation for an independent EPA came from a review of environmental governance.

Northern Ireland currently comes under the UK's environment watchdog, the Office for Environmental Protection.

It has already carried out a number of investigations in Northern Ireland and published several reports.

But the assembly was told the lack of independent environmental oversight had led to ""substantial"" costs.

""The cost of remediation of the Mobuoy site could be between £100m and £700m,"" the minister said.

""The cost that we're spending this year in relation to the crisis at Lough Neagh as my department is over £17m and I could continue.

""So the business case of this is very clear.""

SDLP assembly member Daniel McCrossan questioned the pace of progress and asked when an independent agency would ""finally"" be established.

The minister replied that the environmental landscape was ""very different"" since the UK left the EU.

He added that co-operation of the assembly was ""absolutely crucial"" and he was determined to make progress.

The Department for Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs committee is due to consider the review group's report.

UUP assembly member Robbie Butler, who chairs the committee, welcomed the opportunity and said the terms of reference should ensure that the new body would not be a barrier to ""environmentally compliant and sustainable"" planning applications.

Funding concerns

During the debate, the minister acknowledged the constrained budget environment the Northern Ireland Assembly operates in.

DUP's Michelle McIlveen asked how he expected ""a new, additional body"" would be funded.

In response, Muir said the review recommended that the enabling legislation should guard against the risk of reduced funding.

Colm Gildernew from Sinn Féin sought reassurance that the new agency ""will have the teeth"" to address air quality issues that were causing concern in his Fermanagh South Tyrone constituency.

Thanking staff who currently work in the Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Muir said penalties available to the new agency would be set by the assembly.

""This is not a silver bullet,"" he added.

""Ultimately it requires political leadership here to ensure that there are sufficient deterrents in place so that the environmental agency as an independent non-departmental public body can use the proper enforcement mechanisms.""

The company maintains a strong balance sheet with $232 million in cash and short-term investments, providing ample financial flexibility.

Clean Energy Fuels Corp (CLNE) continues to expand its downstream fueling business, securing contracts for hydrogen fueling stations and supporting transit agencies.

The company is well-positioned in the heavy-duty trucking sector, with RNG offering a cost-effective and low-emission alternative to diesel.

Clean Energy Fuels Corp (CLNE) is making progress in its upstream RNG production business, with two large dairy projects in Texas and Idaho beginning operations.

Negative Points

The company reported a GAAP net loss of $23.8 million for Q3 2025, compared to a $18.2 million loss in 2024.

RIN pricing has stabilized, but CFS credit prices continue to face headwinds, impacting segment profitability.

The heavy-duty trucking sector faces challenges such as uncertain policy regulations and low freight rates, affecting new truck sales.

The LCFS certification process is lengthy, potentially delaying full monetization of environmental credits.

The market environment for RNG adoption in heavy-duty trucking remains uncertain, with economic pressures affecting fleet decisions.

Q & A Highlights

Q: Can you provide an update on the RNG upstream business and expected production volumes?

A: Andrew Littlefair, President and CEO, stated that they currently have eight operating projects and expect to exit the year with 5 to 6 million gallons. They anticipate doubling this next year and reaching closer to 20 million gallons by 2027. The initial target of 100 million gallons was scaled back due to market conditions, but they are satisfied with their current position and focus on improving production rates.

Q: What is the status of the Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions and its impact on X15N adoption?

A: Andrew Littlefair mentioned that Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions has already engaged with 20 different fleets and has its first deal in the works. The partnership with Cummins and Hexagon Agility aims to lower barriers for fleets to adopt RNG-powered equipment, and they are optimistic about its potential to spur X15N adoption.

Q: How is the 15-litre engine ramping up in the market given current conditions?

A: Andrew Littlefair noted that the heavy-duty truck market faces challenges like freight rates and regulatory uncertainties, affecting new truck purchases. However, RNG offers a viable alternative with economic benefits, and major fleets like Walmart and Amazon have started adopting the X15N engine. They expect increased adoption as fleets experience its benefits.

Q: What are the capital expenditure requirements for the Maas Energy development projects?

A: Robert Vreeland, CFO, stated that the CapEx requirement for the three Maas Energy projects is about $35 million, with $12 million already contributed in the third quarter. The total plan involves about $85 million in investments.

Q: Can you discuss the recent flurry of supply agreements and their impact on volumes?

A: Andrew Littlefair explained that Clean Energy Fuels has hundreds of customers, and while not all agreements are announced, there is constant activity. The recent announcements reflect ongoing growth and renewals, with new transit and refuse customers contributing to the positive outlook.

Q: What is the timeline for certification of environmental attributes for new projects?

A: Andrew Littlefair indicated that certification for environmental attributes like RINs and LCFS credits takes time. The EPA is relatively quick, but full certification can take up to two years, as seen with their Del Rio project. They expect to fully monetize credits by 2026.

Q: How should we view the 2025 EBITDA guidance and potential upside?

A: Andrew Littlefair acknowledged that they are likely to be at the top end of their guidance range or slightly beyond, but they are not in a position to officially raise it at this time. They prefer not to micromanage quarterly guidance.

Q: What are the expectations for RNG volume growth in 2026?

A: Andrew Littlefair did not provide specific guidance for 2026 but indicated that they expect growth from their RNG production. The adoption rate for the X15N engine is uncertain, but they anticipate increased adoption as fleets become more familiar with the technology.",https://static.gurufocus.com/logos/0C00000PVT.png?5,N,,2025-11-05 03:18:46.908177

“In what was billed as a competitiveness budget, it is clear that the government recognizes the importance of low-carbon industries and the clean economy to drive Canada’s economic future and ensure continued access to international markets. At a high level, the climate competitiveness strategy rightly focuses on offering regulatory certainty, crowding in private capital, and incentivizing clean technologies, alongside a key promise to develop new metrics to track success.

“To that end, it’s helpful to have regulatory certainty around important policies that are driving down emissions while equipping Canada and Canadian industries for the future, like the commitment to not only keep but strengthen industrial carbon pricing alongside plans to maintain the Clean Electricity Regulations with the possibility of negotiated agreements with provinces. The budget also maintains and expands effective supports for the clean economy, like the existing clean technology investment and manufacturing tax credits, while confirming plans to finalize the new Clean Electricity tax credit.

“A big focus on critical minerals is one particularly exciting part of this budget, with the Critical Minerals Sovereign Fund helping to derisk investments and ensure supply is available for strategic industries. Critical minerals are the lifeblood of clean technologies and of realizing stronger energy security for Canada, not only through the adoption of those technologies but also by giving Canada leverage with its international trade partners.

“However, absent today is a focus on the benefits for individual Canadians and households in the energy transition. The ending of the Greener Homes Grant and Loan, combined with uncertainty around the EV Availability Standard and no recapitalization of the federal EV rebate program, will make life less affordable for many Canadians whose monthly energy bills remain tethered to fossil fuel prices set outside of Canada. Without these programs, it is critical for the sake of consumer affordability that Canada improves market conditions through competition, namely by keeping in place an effective EV Availability Standard, lowering the tariff on Chinese EVs, and easing the way for more European EVs.

“Also missing are concrete nationbuilding efforts to build out the clean electricity supply needed to meet the demands of the future. While tax credit finalization is important in what has been called the “Age of Electricity,” a more ambitious focus on clean electricity projects, including renewables, transmission, and energy efficiency needs to be at the centre of Canada’s industrial strategy. Similarly, any new conditions introduced to the Clean Electricity and Clean Technology investment tax credits must help accelerate the build-out of our electricity system, not hinder it.

“Much remains to be seen in the details. There will still be work to ensure changes to industrial pricing are strengthened, that agreements with provinces on clean electricity are robust, that the EV Availability Standard is maintained at a consumer-benefiting level, and that the new framework proposed to regulate oil and gas emissions will be effective.

“Major new investments in infrastructure, housing, and defence offer a real opportunity to create the markets and expectations for clean industrial products and processes in Canada, but work remains around implementation to turn this possibility into a reality. While there is mention of lowering emissions by 20% in construction, it’s disheartening to see a lack of clarity and specificity, especially given that effective policies like Buy Clean could be leveraged to achieve this goal and provide a clear market signal to Canadian producers. New investments in training and reskilling should also aim to set Canadian workers up with job security for the long term by focusing on the industries and skill sets of the future.

“So, is Budget 2025 a shift in the right direction? Or as Prime Minister Mark Carney put it today, does it help Canada take control of its future? To a degree, but there are important missing pieces.

“Thankfully, it is not the only critical decision point before this government, and we look forward to more announcements for projects of national significance, a hopefully productive update to the EV Availability Standard, and a meeting of provincial ministers later this month to discuss overcoming internal barriers in the way of realizing a more united Canadian economy.

“When the prime minister talks about Canada writing its own future, we should ensure such a future includes an economy that both meets this moment and tangibly benefits the everyday Canadians who not only work but live in that economy.”",https://cleanenergycanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/kat-FbiqTljojKY-unsplash-scaled-e1762295607126.jpg,N,,2025-11-05 05:18:06.464784

""The American auto industry frankly is in limbo, whether they're going to be able to continue to be competitive in the global market and even here at home,"" said Jesse Lee, a senior advisor at Climate Power.

The elimination of the $7,500 tax credit for buying or leasing EVs under the Trump administration's policies was cited as a setback for production.

Lee warned, ""If this doesn't get kind of turned around by Congress before Trump leaves office, you know in the next three years, you know you're gonna be looking at a place where it may never be possible to catch up.""

The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 reinstated the $7,500 tax credit, but it ended in September.

Marick Masters, a professor of business emeritus at Wayne State University, noted the challenges for companies to invest in EVs without policy incentives and mandates.

While the Antarctic ozone hole is healing due to global efforts to reduce ozone-depleting substances, there is still plenty of work to be done.

The Shorthorn Editorial Board believes that students and lawmakers should be more environmentally aware. People should acknowledge, advocate and vote for policies that work toward addressing climate change issues.

As the planet gets warmer, communities are having to deal with the repercussions.

The Central Texas floods on the Fourth of July was one of the deadliest flood events in American history, recording more than 100 people dead, according to Yale Climate Connections, a nonpartisan news service from Yale University.

The natural disaster started hundreds of miles to the southeast in the Gulf of Mexico. The body of water has gotten several degrees Fahrenheit hotter due to climate change, turning into a puddle of fuel for hurricanes barreling toward the Gulf Coast, according to the news service.

These increasingly severe weather events are not isolated incidents but symptoms of a warming planet.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) significantly reduced National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration staff, research capacity and data-sharing capabilities, including weather forecasts, according to the Center for American Progress.

The consequences of such policy decisions become clear when looking at how communities struggle to prepare for, respond to and are affected by disasters.

Intensifying weather conditions continue to affect Texas. The seasonal temperature outlook for December through February 2026 predicts that Texas weather will likely be above normal seasonal temperature, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration’s seasonal temperature outlook.

Although fewer counties have experienced level D4, or exceptional drought, across Texas compared to October 2024, much of the state is sitting at D0, or abnormally dry conditions, according to the U.S. Drought Monitor, created by the National Drought Mitigation Center and other agencies.

Some of the historically observed impacts under a D0 category nclude grass fires increasing, surface water levels declining, planting being postponed and producers starting supplemental feeding for livestock, according to the monitor.

At the same time, extreme weather beyond the United States is also growing in intensity.

On Oct. 28, Hurricane Melissa, a catastrophic Category 5 storm, made landfall in Jamaica and became one of the strongest Atlantic storms on record.

The hurricane killed 28 people in Jamaica, at least 31 in Haiti and at least two in the Dominican Republic, according to BBC News. Thousands of people were also evacuated, and more than 60,000 homes were damaged or destroyed in Cuba.

These global and regional climate patterns serve as a stark reminder that the consequences of insufficient climate action are far-reaching and immediate.

In the aftermath of a 2017 river flooding in Texas’ Hill Country, officials in Kerr County considered supplementing the local word-of-mouth system with sirens and river gauges, along with other modern communication tools, according to The New York Times.

In May, county commissioners discussed a flood warning system being developed by a regional agency as something they might be able to use, according to The New York Times.

The change did not happen. There were no sirens and no early flooding monitors. Instead, there were only text alerts from the National Weather Service that came too late for some residents and were dismissed by others.

Rob Kelly, Kerr County judge, said in an interview with The New York Times that the county did not have a warning system because it was expensive and residents were resistant to new spending. This resistance highlights how policy priorities shaped by both elected officials and voters can have life-or-death consequences in the face of climate-related disasters.

Without proper warning systems, residents rely on those same word-of-mouth systems that may only help those nearby. As storms and floods intensify, the cost of inaction grows heavier. The need for informed, proactive participation in shaping environmental policy has never been more critical.

These local challenges mirror a broader national issue. Decreased funding and staffing at various weather services further emphasizes the importance of public awareness and civic engagement. Understanding how dangerous climate change is and its effect on natural disasters is crucial in helping communities prepare and respond more effectively.

Preparedness requires more than individual awareness: It demands collective civic action through advocacy and voting for policies that strengthen climate resilience and protect vulnerable communities.

The next flood, fire or drought won’t wait for hesitation. Residents should push for leadership that recognizes the realities of climate change.

(AKRON, Ohio – November 4, 2025) – Babcock & Wilcox Enterprises, Inc. (""B&W"" or the ""Company"") (NYSE: BW) announced it plans to leverage its reliable, readily available and proven natural gas technologies to help meet the growing power demands of artificial intelligence data centers, as it works to capitalize on a more than $3 billion pipeline of opportunities in this expanding market. In alignment with this strategy the Company has announced it has signed a limited notice to proceed with Applied Digital (NASDAQ: APLD) to begin work for the delivery and installation of natural gas technology that will provide one gigawatt of efficient energy for an AI Data Center project. Full release for the estimated $1.5 billion contract is expected in the first quarter of 2026.

“This initial project with Applied Digital represents an exciting and transformational opportunity to broaden B&W’s customer base as the Company expands into the rapidly evolving AI Data Center space,” said Kenneth Young, B&W Chairman and Chief Executive Officer. “The impact from this deal on B&W is profound, adding over $3 billion to our pipeline which brings our total global pipeline to over $10 billion. It also marks a natural next step for our Company, which has been a global leader in designing and deploying reliable and efficient steam generation systems for nearly 160 years. Our customers know they can count on us to deliver robust energy solutions that provide them with dependable, available and long-term power for their operations. These aspects make our technology offerings highly compelling for customers and differentiates us from other energy source options in today’s market.”

""For the third quarter, we delivered strong operating results while displaying continued core business momentum and significant margin improvement,"" Young said. “Adjusted EBITDA and Operating Income significantly outperformed Company and consensus expectations this quarter. Our growing backlog, which was 56% higher compared to the same period last year, benefited from increasing demand across Thermal projects, upgrades and construction, as baseload generation needs in North America continue to accelerate. Our core parts, services and construction businesses continued to excel in the third quarter, and we anticipate further seasonal strength through the fourth quarter of 2025 with tailwinds from rising global energy needs fueling demand for our offerings. During the third quarter, our Global Parts & Services achieved the highest quarterly and year-to-date bookings, revenue, gross profit and EBITDA in recent company history. In addition, we paid down over $70 million of bonds due February 2026, and plan to continue to buy back remaining bonds in December as announced today.""

""We believe B&W is in a unique position to capitalize on the growing demand for baseload generation in North America and across the world. The increasing need for power and electricity fueled by demand from artificial intelligence, data centers and expanding economies are key drivers for growth across our broad range of technologies. Based on this momentum, we anticipate 2026 Adjusted EBITDA from our core business in the range of $70 million to $85 million, showing significant sequential growth over 2025. This range does not include any AI Data Center projects, which, when contracted, would serve as upside to this forecast. B&W’s recent data center project with Applied Digital demonstrates the core strengths of our Company, including our ability to provide reliable and efficient power generation solutions to our customers, and our extensive engineering, construction and project management experience. We remain optimistic about the significant upside across our business through the remainder of 2025 and into 2026 due to expected increases in parts and services revenue, as well as known data center projects in our pipeline. We believe this extended demand for our technology and services continues to position us for sustained success and provides B&W with a strong outlook moving forward.""

“This quarter, we completed the previously announced sale of Diamond Power International for gross proceeds of $177 million and we just completed the sale of Allen-Sherman-Hoff (ASH) for gross proceeds of $29 million. Both of these sales further improve our balance sheet and reinforce the value of our underlying assets as we re-capitalize our businesses going forward,"" Young added. ""The proceeds of the Diamond and ASH sales allow us to continue to pay down our existing debt obligations. We remain intently focused on our strategic vision and continue to explore the sale of other non-strategic assets, as well as potential refinancing options to reduce our current and long-term debt obligations. Additionally, during the quarter we entered a strategic partnership with Denham Capital to help convert existing coal plants to natural gas to power data centers in the U.S. and Europe. Through this partnership, B&W will work to convert coal plants to cleaner energy solutions, such as natural gas, while scaling electrical generation capacity for further AI and data center growth. This leaves B&W well-positioned to support the power demand from data centers and global AI growth now and in the future.”

""We are seeing strong global demand for our diverse portfolio of technologies and as a result of recent data center opportunities, our global pipeline has increased to over $10.0 billion. We continue to make progress on converting this pipeline of identified project opportunities into bookings, as displayed by our strong base business and backlog results this quarter. We expect industry tailwinds and generation demand to continue to increase in the coming years, and we believe these tailwinds, coupled with our higher margins and improved cash flows, provide a strong foundation for B&W to grow in the remainder of 2025 and beyond.""

Q3 2025 Continuing Operations Financial Summary

Revenues in the third quarter of 2025 were $149.0 million versus revenues of $152.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. This change is primarily driven by lower large project volume of $20.6 million, larger projects being completed last year as well as the timing of anticipated bookings slipping later into 2025. Global Parts & Service revenue in the third quarter of 2025 was $68.4 million compared to revenue of $61.7 million in the third quarter of 2024. This improvement is primarily due to the increasing need for electricity from fossil fuels driven by the demand from artificial intelligence, data centers and expanding economies. Operating income in the third quarter of 2025 was $6.5 million, compared to operating income of $1.6 million in the third quarter of 2024. The increase is primarily driven by reduced corporate overhead costs. Loss from continuing operations in the third quarter of 2025 was $2.3 million, compared to a loss of $7.9 million in the third quarter of 2024, driven by the improvement in the operating income results noted above. Loss per common share in the third quarter of 2025 was $0.06 compared to a loss per common share of $0.13 in the third quarter of 2024. Adjusted EBITDA was $12.6 million, an increase compared to $8.0 million in the third quarter of 2024. Reconciliations of net income, the most directly comparable GAAP measure, to Adjusted EBITDA for the Company's segments, are provided in the exhibits to this release.

Liquidity and Balance Sheet

At September 30, 2025, the Company had total debt of $416.4 million and a cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash balance of $201.1 million. B&W paid down $70 million of bonds due February 2026 on October 2, 2025, and expects remaining outstanding February 2026 bonds to be paid down fully in December 2025.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

The Company uses non-GAAP financial measures internally, also referred to in this release as “adjusted” financial measures, to evaluate its performance and in making financial and operational decisions. When viewed in conjunction with GAAP results and the accompanying reconciliation, the Company believes that its presentation of these measures provides investors with greater transparency and a greater understanding of factors affecting its financial condition and results of operations than GAAP measures alone. The presentation of non-GAAP financial measures should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the Company’s related financial results prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Adjusted EBITDA on a consolidated basis is a non-GAAP metric defined as the sum of the Adjusted EBITDA for each of the segments, further adjusted for corporate allocations and research and development costs. At a segment level, the Adjusted EBITDA presented is consistent with the way the Company's chief operating decision maker reviews the results of operations and makes strategic decisions about the business and is calculated as earnings before interest expense, tax, depreciation and amortization adjusted for items such as gains or losses arising from the sale of non-income producing assets, net pension benefits, restructuring costs, impairments, gains and losses on debt extinguishment, costs related to financial consulting, and other costs that may not be directly controllable by segment management and are not allocated to the segment. The Company presents consolidated Adjusted EBITDA because it believes it is useful to investors to help facilitate comparisons of the ongoing, operating performance before corporate overhead and other expenses not attributable to the operating performance of the Company's revenue generating segments. In addition, the Company presents the non-GAAP financial measure of Adjusted EBITDA excluding BrightLoop and ClimateBright. Management believes this measure is useful to investors because of the increasing importance of BrightLoop and ClimateBright to the future growth of the Company. Management uses Adjusted EBITDA excluding BrightLoop and ClimateBright to assess the Company's performance independent of these technologies.

This release also presents certain targets for the Company's Adjusted EBITDA in the future; these targets are not intended as guidance regarding how the Company believes the business will perform. The Company is unable to reconcile these targets to their GAAP counterparts without unreasonable effort and expense. Prior period results have been revised to conform with the revised definition and present separate reconciling items in our reconciliation, including business transition costs.

Bookings and Backlog

Bookings and backlog are our measure of remaining performance obligations under our sales contracts. It is possible that our methodology for determining bookings and backlog may not be comparable to methods used by other companies. Implied backlog and implied bookings include projects awarded or under contract but not fully released for performance.

We generally include expected revenue from contracts in our backlog when we receive written confirmation from our customers authorizing the performance of work and committing the customers to payment for work performed. Backlog may not be indicative of future operating results, and contracts in our backlog may be canceled, modified or otherwise altered by customers. Backlog can vary significantly from period to period, particularly when large new build projects or operations and maintenance contracts are booked because they may be fulfilled over multiple years. Because we operate globally, our backlog is also affected by changes in foreign currencies each period. We do not include orders of our unconsolidated joint ventures in backlog.

Bookings represent changes to the backlog. Bookings include additions from booking new business, subtractions from customer cancellations or modifications, changes in estimates of liquidated damages that affect selling price and revaluation of backlog denominated in foreign currency. We believe comparing bookings on a quarterly basis or for periods less than one year is less meaningful than for longer periods, and that shorter-term changes in bookings may not necessarily indicate a material trend.

Pipeline

Pipeline represents our uncontracted, potential revenue, which has a reasonable likelihood of contract execution. Pipeline is an internal metric monitored by management to understand the anticipated growth of our Company and our estimated future revenue.

We cannot guarantee that our pipeline will result in actual revenue in the originally anticipated period or at all. Pipeline may not generate margins equal to our historical operating results. Our customers may experience project delays or cancel orders as a result of external market factors and economic or other factors beyond our control. If our pipeline fails to result in revenue as anticipated or in a timely manner, we could experience a reduction in revenue, profitability, and liquidity.

Impacts of Market Conditions

Management continues to adapt to macroeconomic conditions, including the impacts from inflation, changing interest rates and foreign exchange rate volatility, current and potential tariff actions and geopolitical conflicts and global shipping and supply chain disruptions that continued to have an impact during the first nine months of 2025. In certain instances, these situations have resulted in cost increases and delays or disruptions that have had, and could continue to have, an adverse impact on our ability to meet customers’ demands. We continue to actively monitor the impact of these market conditions on current and future periods and actively manage costs and our liquidity position to provide additional flexibility while still supporting our customers and their specific needs. The duration and scope of these conditions cannot be predicted, and therefore, any anticipated negative financial impact on our operating results cannot be reasonably estimated.

But the electric vehicle maker’s stock surge couldn’t mask the harsh reality waiting just beyond the quarterly numbers: October EV sales plummeted 43% compared to the same month last year, according to automotive consultancy Urban Science, as the September 30 expiration of federal tax credits triggers the demand collapse EVXL predicted.

The Irvine-based company reported an adjusted loss of 65 cents per share for the quarter ending September 30, beating Wall Street’s expectation of a 71-cent loss, according to Bloomberg. Revenue hit $1.56 billion, topping the $1.5 billion estimate. But the actual reported loss told a different story: 96 cents per share, worse than the 88-cent loss analysts anticipated, Barron’s reported.

Positive Gross Profit Masks Temporary Tax Credit Surge

Rivian achieved $24 million in positive gross profit during Q3, significantly better than the $64 million loss Wall Street expected, according to CNBC. The company slashed automotive costs by nearly $19,000 per vehicle year-over-year, demonstrating progress on CEO RJ Scaringe’s aggressive cost-reduction program.

The improved numbers were driven largely by a 32% surge in deliveries to 13,201 vehicles compared to the same quarter last year. But that spike wasn’t organic growth—it was customers rushing to purchase before the $7,500 federal EV tax credit expired on September 30, 2025.

“Higher third-quarter EV deliveries helped boost revenue 78% from a year earlier to about $1.56 billion, topping Wall Street estimates,” Bloomberg reported. “The company sold more than 13,000 EVs in the period, helped by consumers rushing to secure the $7,500 US tax credit before it expired on Sept. 30.”

Rivian’s stock rose 3.4% in after-hours trading following the earnings release, with shares climbing to $13 despite declining less than 1% through Monday’s close for the year.

R2 Launch On Track As Tariff Impacts Ease

Scaringe emphasized progress on the company’s make-or-break R2 midsize SUV, scheduled for first-half 2026 deliveries at a targeted starting price of $45,000.

“R2 delivers on the adventurous spirit customers expect from Rivian,” Scaringe said in the shareholder letter. “It’s also a great daily driver that will fit so many different use cases for our customers.”

The company said it’s on track for R2 deliveries in the first half of 2026 and will launch with “features and a price to make the most people the most happy,” Scaringe told analysts on an earnings call, according to Bloomberg.

Rivian also disclosed reduced tariff impacts following policy changes. The company now expects tariff costs of “hundreds of dollars” per vehicle, down from the “couple thousand dollar hit it saw per car in the third quarter,” CNBC reported. Chief Financial Officer Claire McDonough attributed the improvement to expanded offset policies for certain imported parts on American-made vehicles.

October Sales Collapse Reveals Post-Credit Reality

The optimistic Q3 numbers stand in stark contrast to October’s performance. Consumer EV purchases dropped 43% compared to October 2024, according to data from automotive consultancy Urban Science cited in Bloomberg’s original reporting.

The timing directly follows the September 30 expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit for new EVs and $4,000 credit for used models. Congress eliminated the incentive through President Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill,” cutting short a program originally scheduled to run through 2032.

“While we face near-term uncertainty from trade, tariffs, and regulatory policy, we remain focused on long-term growth and value creation,” Scaringe wrote in the shareholder letter, according to Rivian’s official release.

Rivian previously lowered its 2025 delivery guidance to between 41,500 and 43,500 vehicles, down from an earlier target of 46,000 units. Fourth-quarter deliveries are expected to drop approximately 30% year-over-year, with the company projecting around 10,000 vehicles for the period.

Mind Robotics Spinoff Raises $110 Million

In an unexpected announcement buried in the earnings release, Rivian revealed it established a new company called Mind Robotics in November 2025, securing approximately $110 million in external seed capital led by venture capital firm Eclipse, TechCrunch reported.

The industrial AI and robotics venture will focus on “the advancement of industrial AI to reshape how physical world businesses operate and leverage Rivian operations data as the foundation for a robotics data flywheel,” according to the shareholder letter. Scaringe will serve as chairman of Mind Robotics’ board of directors.

The launch marks Rivian’s second major spinoff in 2025, following the March creation of ALSO Inc., a micromobility company that develops electric bikes and quadricycles.

EVXL’s Take

Let’s be clear about what just happened: Wall Street applauded Rivian’s Q3 “beat” while completely ignoring that those deliveries were artificially inflated by customers racing to claim tax credits before they vanished. Now that temporary surge has evaporated, and October’s 43% sales collapse reveals the brutal reality facing every EV maker in the post-subsidy era.

We’ve been tracking this exact scenario for months. Back in July, we covered the impending tax credit expiration and warned about the demand cliff that would follow. In October, we reported on Rivian’s third round of layoffs in four months—600 jobs cut, primarily in sales, marketing, and customer service. The same day, Rivian announced a $250 million settlement of an IPO fraud lawsuit alleging the company deliberately concealed pricing problems during its 2021 public offering.

Here’s the disconnect that should worry investors: Rivian is cutting the very teams it needs most to launch the R2 successfully. As we noted in our analysis of CEO RJ Scaringe’s layoff memo, the company is slashing sales and marketing staff right when it needs massive consumer education and aggressive outreach to move beyond early adopters. The R2 launch will determine whether Rivian survives or joins the graveyard of EV startups that couldn’t scale.

The positive gross profit deserves credit—it shows Rivian can theoretically build vehicles profitably. But “theoretically” doesn’t pay the bills when you’re burning over $1 billion per quarter and sitting on less than $6 billion in remaining cash. The $110 million Mind Robotics spinoff, while potentially valuable long-term, feels like rearranging deck chairs when the ship needs all hands focused on the R2 launch.

Context matters here. GM just laid off 3,300 EV workers following the tax credit expiration, idling massive battery plants barely two months after the subsidy ended. Ford’s October EV sales dropped 25% year-over-year. Toyota sold just 18 units of its BZ electric vehicle in October, down from 1,401 a year earlier. This isn’t a Rivian problem—it’s an industry-wide reckoning.

The R2 represents Rivian’s last chance to prove it can compete in the mass market. Starting at $45,000 without any federal incentives, it needs to be compelling enough to convince mainstream buyers to choose electric over comparable gas SUVs that cost $10,000 less. Analysts estimate automakers need around 400,000 annual sales to achieve positive operating income—a target that remains distant even if the R2 succeeds.

Wall Street may be celebrating cost cuts and improved margins, but the real test arrives in early 2026 when the R2 hits the market. Will Rivian’s adventure-focused brand resonate with budget-conscious families? Can a company that just gutted its sales force effectively market to mass-market buyers? And most critically: will there be enough “natural demand” for EVs without subsidies to support a pure-play electric vehicle company?

We’ll find out soon enough. Either Rivian establishes itself as a legitimate Tesla alternative, or 2026 becomes the year it joins Lordstown Motors, Fisker, and other cautionary tales about the brutal economics of EV manufacturing.

Mr. Speaker, around the world, tariffs have increased, growth is slowing, and trade relationships are being tested.
We will double the pace of housing construction over the next decade while creating a new industry using Canadian technology, Canadian workers, and Canadian lumber.
Because when Canadian businesses are competitive and successful abroad, Canadian workers and communities prosper right here at home.
To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the budget I am tabling today is our framework for Canada's future and a roadmap to prosperity and resilience.","Check against delivery

Mr. Speaker, pursuant to Standing Order 83(1), I would like to table, in both official languages, the budget documents for 2025, including the notices of ways and means motions.

The details of the measures are contained in these documents.

Pursuant to Standing Order 83(2), I am requesting that an order of the day be designated for consideration of these motions.

Mr. Speaker, Honourable Members of this House, Canadians,

The budget I present today comes at a time of profound change. A time to build.

The world is undergoing a series of fundamental shifts at a speed, scale, and scope not seen since the fall of the Berlin Wall.

The rules-based international order and the trading system that powered Canada’s prosperity for decades are being reshaped – threatening our sovereignty, our prosperity, and our values.

Long-standing supply chains and trade relationships that once ensured stable growth, good jobs, and affordable products, are being disrupted.

The impact is profound—hurting Canadian companies, affecting workers, disrupting supply chains, and causing uncertainty that holds back investment.

The level of uncertainty is higher than what we have seen and felt for generations.

In fact, it is not a transition but a true generational shift.

The challenges are great, but the opportunities for Canada are even greater.

And in this spirit, today I present to you Budget 2025.

And as a former Finance Minister, also from Shawinigan, so eloquently put it:

“Let’s accept this role with humility, but also, with confidence.”

This budget must be generational in its ambition and serve to shape our economy and our nation’s future.

There is no place for withdrawal, ambiguity or even standing still.

Only for bold and swift action.

Bold and swift action is needed.

To weather the storm of uncertainty, we will not lower our sails, Mr. Speaker.

Quite the opposite. We will raise them – to catch the winds of economic change.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will explore new markets and sell more of the best of what Canada has to offer.

We will build here at home – stronger industries, nation-building infrastructures, and millions of more homes for Canadians.

We will protect what matters most: our people, our communities, and our sovereignty.

And, we will empower Canadians by making life more affordable, creating new career opportunities, and ensuring every generation can get ahead.

This is how we win, and keep winning.

When people look back on this budget, they will be able to judge the importance of the choices we have made.

Greater autonomy is and continues to be the best approach to achieve real resilience.

And it is in this spirit that, with Budget 2025, we are building Canada Strong.

Mr. Speaker, around the world, tariffs have increased, growth is slowing, and trade relationships are being tested.

All of these constraints are being felt across the country by Canadians in their daily lives.

Families are seeing it every week when they do their groceries, as well as renters when they pay their rent.

Young people are sending out their resumes, but they aren’t receiving any offers as a result of their efforts.

In factories, in the fields, and in communities across the country; people feel the current economic challenges.

Workers are facing fewer shifts, shorter hours, and in some cases, layoffs.

Small business owners want to grow, but uncertainty is understandably making them wait.

And for many, it feels like opportunity is slipping just a little further out of reach.

Mr. Speaker, these are the realities Canadian workers and their families are facing; they are doing everything they can to keep moving forward in uncertain times.

And through it all, the Canadian economy has held steady. Forecasters expect modest GDP growth of just above 1% in 2025.

The resilience of our people is earning us the respect of our foreign partners, and it is this same resilience that gives me confidence in the future.

When your largest trading partners fundamentally reshapes all of its trade relationships, there are two responses:

You can slash the deficit, hunker down, hope for the best, wait and see if the ‘trickle down’ ever comes.

That approach, to balance the Budget this year, would have to eliminate vital social programs, and all the capital investments needed for Canada’s future.

We choose a different path:

That believes in Canada.

That invests in our country’s future.

That reinforces Canadian values.

That makes us less reliant on the U.S.

A plan that allows us, first and foremost, to be masters in our own house.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, when our steel, aluminum, forestry, auto and agriculture industries were hit by U.S. tariffs and trade disruptions, we did not stand by and wait for the storm to pass.

We stepped in with the most comprehensive set of trade resilience measures in Canadian history.

The government launched the Strategic Response Fund – allocating 5 billion dollars to help sectors impacted by tariffs adapt, diversify, and grow.

Businesses can use the fund to invest in the design of new products, retool plants to boost productivity, or offset the costs of accessing new markets.

We have introduced a $1 billion liquidity relief package to help small and medium-sized businesses adapt, along with a new skills-retraining program that will benefit 50,000 workers.

To our steel workers, we will be there to help you increase your competitiveness within the Canadian market.

To our aluminum workers, we will be there to help you modernise your smelters and open up new markets.

To our auto workers, we will fight alongside you to keep auto plants in Canada.

And to our lumber and canola producers, we know times are hard, and we are working not only to restore your market access, but to expand it!

These strategic sectors are at the forefront of this generational change. We will ensure they are strong, resilient, and ready to lead our economic transition — from dependence to resilience.

These are generational challenges, Mr. Speaker, and they demand a generational response.

Budget 2025 is that response.

It is a plan for resilience. Rooted in confidence, focused on results, and designed to ensure that Canada not only weathers this storm, but emerges stronger from it.

I am reminded of the words of a previous Finance Minister, when in 1995, he presented his budget:

“Our very way of life as Canadians is being tested and there are times in the progress of people when fundamental choices must be made, and a new course charted. For Canada, this is one of those times.’’

And Mr. Speaker, I would say that today we are also facing a unique moment.

The Prime Minister has called on our country to look beyond the challenges of today and to embark on a path that will redefine Canada for generations to come.

He has asked us to focus on what we can control and to take bold action.

I have confidence in the strength of Canadians.

I have confidence in our ability as a nation to meet the moment.

I have confidence that together we can build Canada, protect our way of life, and empower Canadians like never before.

Because we believe in Canada.

Canada has what the world needs, and what the world increasingly wants:

We are an energy superpower, in both clean and conventional energy;

We are among the top producers of critical minerals and a world leader in artificial intelligence;

We have unmatched market access, as the only country in the G7 with free trade agreements with every other G7 nation;

We have the people, the resources and the stability necessary to prosper and compete in the new economy before us.

So Canada enters this period of transformation from a position of strength.

Canada has the lowest net debt-to-GDP ratio in the G7, and the federal debt-to-GDP ratio will remain stable over the Budget horizon. We also have one of the lowest deficits in the G7, and one of the strongest fiscal positions in the world.

And we must use this fiscal firepower to make generational investments.

Because we believe in Canada.

As the Managing Director of the International Monetary Fund recently said:

“Both Germany and Canada recognize that in this very testing time, they need to use their fiscal space.

In the case of Canada, the Canadian authorities have been very decisive to take action in the context of changing relations with their main trading partner.”

That recognition matters – because it affirms something fundamental about this country: when times are difficult, we do not retreat, we invest.

Budget 2025 is a plan to catalyze investments from provinces, territories, municipalities, Indigenous communities, and the private sector.

With this plan, in five years, we will see one trillion dollars in total investments in this country.

Canada is one of the best places in the world to invest; and we are going to make it even better.

This fiscal strength allows to make historic investments not only today but also for future generations.

And to Canadians who feel the strain of these times, our message is clear:

We will not back down;

We will be there for you, now, and for as long as it takes, and

We will do what Canadians do best in times of need, we look after each other, we help each other. That’s the Canadian way, our way!

Meeting this challenge requires both ambition and discipline.

We need to be ambitious in our investments and rigorous in our spending.

That’s why this budget charts a new course for Canada’s public finances. Because Canadians expect their government to achieve results.

And to get there, we must spend less on operations so we can invest more in Canada’s future.

First, a new Capital Budgeting Framework, separating our day-to-day spending from the investments that build our future.

This reform will allow Canadians to better understand where their money goes and will ensure that each dollar helps strengthen our productivity.

In short, we will make capital investments a national priority.

Better budgeting also means presenting the budget at the best time.

From now on the budget will be presented in the fall, aligning with the construction season, and better supporting provinces, municipalities as well as contractors in the delivery of their projects.

Second, discipline. The Prime Minister has been clear: Canada’s new government will spend less, so we can invest more.

Mr. Speaker, our budget today puts forward 60 billion dollars in savings over five years.

Let me be clear, Mr. Speaker, we are protecting the vital services Canadians rely on, including child care, dental care, and pharmacare.

And we are making responsible and pragmatic choices to reduce inefficiencies and focus government initiatives on our core priorities.

Through the government’s Comprehensive Expenditure Review, we are focusing investments on initiatives that meet their objectives and complement, rather than duplicate, services delivered by other levels of government.

For example, the Department of National Defence will divest from fleets reaching the end of service life, and focus on investing in new fleets that meet the modern needs of our service members, while maximizing benefits for Canadian companies.

We will cut red tape, digitize services, and make them faster, simpler, and easier to access.

We are encouraging the adoption of new technologies across government, including made-in-Canada sovereign AI tools, through a new Digital Transformation Office.

This will create a more effective government, one that can deliver smarter, faster, and more effectively for Canadians.

Building a government that works better for Canadians requires a modern, agile, and efficient public service.

Since 2019, the federal public service population has grown at a rate far greater than the Canadian population.

We must get the size of our public service back to a sustainable level that is in keeping with best-practices. And we will do so with fairness and compassion.

And, Mr. Speaker, as we modernize government, we will make the tax system fairer for Canadians.

Third, clear fiscal anchors. We will balance day-to-day operating spending with revenues by 2028-29, shifting the budget toward investments that grow the economy.

We will maintain a declining deficit-to-GDP ratio, ensuring discipline today, while investing in our collective future.

The measures proposed in Budget 2025 put us on the right path to achieving our investment goals.

Mr. Speaker, we will create a business environment that attracts an unprecedented flow of private capital into the energy, infrastructure, housing, and defence sectors.

You see, Mr. Speaker, productivity and investment are the keys to our economic success.

And the government is fully focused on boosting productivity –doing more with less – because that is the best way to raise our standard of living.

Budget 2025 will not only accelerate construction in housing and infrastructure.

It will also strengthen Canada’s position as a fiscally competitive jurisdiction and one of the best places in the world to invest.

In addition, we will introduce measures to enhance competition across the economy – starting with the financial and telecommunications sectors.

Mr. Speaker, budgets are not about doing everything. They are about doing what’s necessary – and doing it well.

We are putting forward a firm, fair, and results-driven plan –the kind of reform Canadians are asking for, and the kind that has always served our country well.

This generational plan invests 280 billion dollars over five years in capital to strengthen Canada’s productivity, competitiveness, and resilience. On a cash basis, that is an historic investment of 450 billion dollars.

These investments will drive growth in every region and create good, middle-class jobs that benefit all Canadians.

The kind of careers that allow young people and families to plan for the future with confidence.

Our generational investments will focus on four key priorities:

Housing: to restore affordability and opportunity.

Infrastructure: to connect Canadians and accelerate growth.

Defence and security: to protect our sovereignty and our communities.

Productivity and competitiveness: to put Canada at the forefront and make our country a leader in innovation.

These are not abstract priorities – they are the foundations of a stronger, more independent, and more competitive Canada.

Because we believe in Canada.

Our task now is to turn fiscal strength into national purpose.

For generations, together Canadians have undertaken major projects that have connected our regions, energized our industries, and defined our identity.

The One Canadian Economy Act, adopted last June, continues that tradition.

It removes barriers to internal trade, accelerates approvals for major projects, and strengthens the economic union that binds our provinces and territories together.

We are completing the unfinished work of Confederation – ensuring that wherever a product is made in Canada, it can be sold in Canada. Where trade and opportunity flow freely across provincial lines.

Our new government is also launching the next generation of nation-building projects.

The highways, airstrips, ports, electrical grids, and digital corridors that will define the next century of Canadian growth.

Thanks to these investments, we will connect regions, strengthen supply chains, and create hundreds of thousands of high-paying jobs in every region of the country.

Our Arctic Infrastructure Fund will expand possibilities and opportunities like never before in Canada’s North.

And, we will build infrastructure in communities all across Canada through the new Build Communities Strong Fund.

As we build millions more homes, we’ll need infrastructure like roads to build new neighbourhoods – this fund will help build that.

New neighbourhoods will lead to new communities, that will want recreation and athletic centres – this fund will help build that.

And new communities will need new hospitals - this fund will help build that.

This fund will Build Communities Strong.

And we will also do that by being our own best customer through a new Buy Canadian Policy.

When the Government buys, Canadian suppliers will be our first choice wherever possible. Full stop.

Because we believe in Canada.

We will use:

steel made by our workers in Hamilton and Sault Ste. Marie;

aluminum cast in Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean, Bécancour and Kitimat;

and softwood lumber cut in Thunder Bay, Prince George and La Tuque.

Because every time we buy here at home and build here at home, we make Canada stronger.

Mr. Speaker, I will give you one example.

Yesterday, in Saint-Tite, a small rural city in my riding, I visited Boulet Boots, a family business that has made boots since 1933!

I even had the opportunity to build part of the shoes I am wearing today, with the help of many skilled workers — a reminder of the craftsmanship and pride that make the Canadian manufacturing industry strong.

The same shoes worn by RCMP officers!

Made in Canada, by Canadians, for Canadians. That’s the way to go!

That’s what Buy Canadian is all about: good jobs, resilient communities, and pride in what we build together.

We are building an economy by Canadians, for Canadians.

Canada has A Legacy of Builders, Mr. Speaker, that same spirit of building at home has defined Canada for generations. We have done this before.

Back in 1945, just after the war, Canada had to think big. As so-called “Minister of Everything” at the time, the great C.D. Howe banked on the boundless potential of Canada to make big, big changes. He was not afraid to bet big on Canadians – and neither are we.

This budget is guided by the conviction that Canada must remain a nation of builders – of infrastructure and innovation, of trust in public institutions, and of hope for generations to come.

This nation knows how to build:

We built the Canadian Pacific Railway in 1885, allowing our country to be connected from coast to coast and supporting trade across the Prairies;

We built the St. Lawrence Seaway in 1959, creating a deep-water route from the Great Lakes to the Atlantic Ocean;

We built the James Bay hydroelectric facility in 1985, providing abundant clean energy to power Canadian industries and enabling Canada to become one of the world’s top producers of renewable hydroelectric energy.

Each generation has taken on its share of the work and left the next generation stronger for it.

We will do it again.

With planned investments of 115 billion dollars in infrastructure over 5 years, we will meet the moment and build the backbone of Canada’s next economy.

Our task is simple but profound:

to turn plans into projects,

projects into careers,

and careers into prosperity.

And to do so in a way that protects our future, our nature, and our core values, building in true partnership with Indigenous Peoples, whose stewardship and knowledge of the land continue to guide us today.

Because we do not just build for ourselves. We build for those who will follow.

I am often reminded of the Seven Generation Principle, rooted in Indigenous teachings — a reminder that every decision we take today must consider its impacts on future generations.

Mr. Speaker, a strong country invests not only in its economy, but also in its identity.

Over the past year, Canadians have shown what Canada is really made of.

When global uncertainty tested us, we looked to each other.

People asked where their food was grown and chose to buy from local farmers and producers.

Families travelled across the country and rediscovered its beauty, from coast to coast to coast.

Communities rallied around Canadian businesses, creators, and workers.

That, Mr. Speaker, is what it means to be Canadian. To stand up for one another, to build together, and to take pride in what we make, grow, and create here at home.

We are a bilingual, diverse and compassionate country; shaped by reconciliation, equality, and respect.

Canada faces a steep housing supply gap that threatens affordability, opportunity, and the ability for Canadians to build their lives here at home.

Budget 2025 is the most ambitious housing plan since the Second World War!

With investments of 13 billion dollars over 5 years, our flagship home building initiative, Build Canada Homes, will build at a speed and scale not seen in generations.

We will double the pace of housing construction over the next decade while creating a new industry using Canadian technology, Canadian workers, and Canadian lumber.

We will improve affordability and create careers in the skilled trades, Mr. Speaker.

Every home built is a step toward a more affordable, more confident Canada.

Affordability is not only about housing.

It’s about making life easier for Canadians and reducing everyday costs, while protecting the programs that families depend on.

Canadians elected us to take bold action to help them improve their quality of life quickly.

That’s what we did, Mr. Speaker, and will continue to do:

We cut taxes for 22 million Canadians;

We brought down gas prices by 18 cents per litre when we cancelled the consumer carbon price;

We made permanent the National School Food Program, helping 400,000 children each year;

We’ve launched automatic federal benefits, reaching 5.5 million low-income Canadians, to ensure no one gets left behind;

We will strengthen competition in the telecommunications and banking sectors in order to drive down costs.

These are practical measures that make life more affordable today and build confidence for tomorrow.

Because when Canadians can afford a home, raise a family, and plan for the future, our entire country grows stronger.

Because prosperity is only meaningful when it is shared and when all Canadians can see themselves in the promise of this country.

As the Prime Minister has said: there can be no prosperity without security.

And I’m sure, Mr. Speaker, that every member of this House would agree that we need to protect our people, our communities, and our country.

A confident nation protects its sovereignty at home and its interests abroad, through strength, stability, and partnership with Allies who share our values.

With $30 billion over five years, Budget 2025 represents the largest defence investment in decades.

We will meet our NATO 2% commitment this year, modernize NORAD, reinforce our Arctic defences, and equip the brave women and men of the Canadian Armed Forces with the infrastructure and technology they need to safeguard our nation.

With our new Defence Investment Agency and Defence Industrial Strategy, we will build up Canada’s defence industry – strengthening Canadian businesses and supporting Canadian workers.

Our work on defence will strengthen Canadian research centres, and Canadian communities in the North, working with our Inuit and First Nations partners, by building dual-use infrastructure – like ports and airport runways.

We will further build our security and defence capabilities, right here at home – creating new jobs for our engineers, technicians and scientists in sectors such as aerospace, shipbuilding, cybersecurity, and AI.

We will hire 1,000 new border services officers and 1,000 new RCMP personnel to secure our borders and keep our communities safe.

Finally, by investing in law enforcement and justice reform, we will tackle organized crime, gun violence, and auto theft.

We will also invest and we will continue, with passion and determination, as my colleague Minister Valdez is doing, the important work with the provinces and territories to end gender-based violence.

We are taking all these actions because we believe in Canada.

As we strengthen our security partnerships, it is essential that we also deepen our economic partnerships.

In order to build a stronger future, we must increase trade, innovate faster, and play a leading role in clean and conventional energy.

Trade has always been one of Canada’s strengths, connecting our population, our resources, and our industries to the rest of the world.

But too much of that trade depends on a single partner.

Through Budget 2025, we are launching a Trade Diversification Strategy supported by a Trade Diversification Corridors Fund to expand Canada’s reach, double our overseas exports within a decade, unlocking 300 billion dollars in new opportunities for Canadian workers and businesses.

We will strengthen ports, railways, and ports of entry, we will reduce bottlenecks, and we will open faster routes to global markets.

Because when Canadian businesses are competitive and successful abroad, Canadian workers and communities prosper right here at home.

Mr. Speaker, Canada is the best place to live, and top talent from around the world want to come here because they see opportunities and possibilities to contribute to cutting-edge research.

With our flagship International Talent Attraction Strategy of $1.7 billion, we will make sure that the best and brightest continue to chose Canada to innovate, invent and grow our industry.

By making a generational investment of 115 billion dollars over 5 years in measures that will drive productivity and competitiveness, we will supercharge growth in Canada, and become the strongest economy of the G7.

Productivity is not about working harder, it’s about working smarter.

It’s about how well we mobilize ideas, workers, investment, and innovation to generate growth.

It is what drives wages up, improves living standards, and strengthens public services.

For too long, Canada’s productivity has been lagging – a challenge we can and must overcome.

AI will play a key role, along with quantum and other advanced technologies, to put Canada on a path of sustained growth.

Budget 2025 initiates this change by rethinking how Canada competes and creates value.

Through:

A Productivity Super-Deduction to create the right climate for businesses to invest in new machinery, equipment, and technologies.

A bold expansion of projects of national interest in AI, clean technology, and advanced manufacturing – turning Canadian innovation into industrial strength.

And enhancing tax incentives for Canadian builders to conduct research and development – and making it seamless for them to apply to these essential tax credits that drive innovation and productivity.

Mr. Speaker, numbers in the budget can seem abstract, so let me make them concrete.

As I said earlier, this budget will unleash one trillion dollars in total investment over the next five years. That would boost average wages by over $3,000 per year!

It would add 15 billion dollars to federal revenues that can support health care, lower your taxes and pay down Canada’s debt.

We choose Canada. We will make Canada Strong.

Because we believe in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, throughout our history, we have opened our doors to the world. We have always welcomed:

those fleeing the most difficult situations;

those seeking to study at our world-class universities;

and those willing to share their expertise and drive innovation in Canada.

Mr. Speaker, we are taking back control over the immigration system and putting Canada on a trajectory to bring immigration back to sustainable levels – allowing us to fulfill the promise of Canada to those who call it home.

Our plan will restore control, clarity, and consistency to the immigration system, while maintaining compassion in our choices and driving competitiveness in our economy.

Our plan will allow us to ensure better control of our immigration system while maintaining our approach based on our Canadian values.

Climate action is not only a moral obligation, it is an economic necessity.

The key to competitiveness and growth is also to be a leader in a low-carbon economy.

Our Climate Competitiveness Strategy turns Canada’s natural wealth – critical minerals, clean power – into lasting prosperity.

Reducing our emissions is essential to protecting the competitiveness of Canada’s energy sectors.

We are introducing a comprehensive suite of clean economy investment tax credits – measures that are already generating billions of dollars in private capital for projects in hydrogen, carbon capture, and clean electricity.

These investments will modernize our power grids, speed up approvals for major clean energy projects, and expand the transmission lines that connect our provinces.

By becoming a global leader in clean technology and clean energy, Canada can strengthen its competitive advantage and help our industries thrive in the global economy.

We have the most skilled and talented workers as well as the most educated workforce in the world. We can all be very proud of that.

Budget 2025 expands learning, training, and growth opportunities for young people.

It creates new pathways for careers in construction, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing.

It is essential that we give the next generation the confidence and skills needed to succeed.

So, through a suite of new measures, we will extend union training, extend the tax credit to personal support workers, and enhance labour mobility.

Mr. Speaker, Canadian workers will drive Canada’s economic transformation with new skills and training, and they will seize the exciting, high-paying careers it will create.

In the words of the Canadian Labour Congress, “these measures signal a shift toward putting workers at the heart of Canada’s economic strategy”.

This is how we give Canadians the tools they need to shape the future.

This is how we Build Canada Strong.

To conclude, Mr. Speaker, the budget I am tabling today is our framework for Canada's future and a roadmap to prosperity and resilience.

It all comes down to a choice between two visions.

One vision of resignation – a vision that would scale back the vital support Canadians rely on, make it harder for families to find a home, and leave our country more vulnerable, poorer, and dependent.

And another vision – one rooted in confidence. Confidence in Canadians, and in the belief that by making generational investments today, we can build lasting prosperity for tomorrow.

By putting more money in people’s pockets.

By ensuring every Canadian can retire with dignity.

By making the dream of home ownership a reality once again

By building the infrastructure our cities need to grow.

By keeping our communities safe for our children and our parents.

Budget 2025 makes our choice clear: we choose confidence over resignation. We choose to empower Canadians – to build this country together and to protect what we hold dear.

Mr. Speaker, it’s about confidence. In ourselves, in our capacity to adapt, and in the promise of this great country.

It is about a Canada that builds, protects, and empowers.

It’s about moving from reliance to resilience, and from uncertainty to prosperity.

Let’s rise to this generational challenge.

Let’s build Canada strong.

Because we are – and always will be – the true North, strong and free.

There are the obvious ones, the natural consequences of living adjacent to this abundant resource that so many notorious players seek to take advantage of — the environmental devastation posed by the Line 5 pipeline running underneath the Straits of Mackinac and the commodification of water by companies like Nestle circumventing the Great Lakes Compact, for example. But then there are the other problems — the obscured shortcuts and mistakes that are more indicative of the tenuous relationship between politicians and their constituents, between those with power and those without it. Infamously, we’ve seen this with the Flint Water Crisis over the past decade, where a switch in city water supply initially exposed more than 100,000 people to contaminated water and led to criminal charges being pressed against negligent state officials (but these were eventually dropped). Recently, though, tensions pertaining to water infrastructure and access are bubbling to the surface a little bit closer to home.

In Detroit, water justice is a pressing issue, but a neglected one. Residents across the city are experiencing perpetual flooding cycles that are directly connected to city water infrastructure, and tens of thousands are regularly unable to afford water services to their homes at all. It’s a complicated web, one in which the term “water crisis” doesn’t fully do justice to the variety of calamities unfolding. Despite this, a consistent through line remains: The city’s response and non-local media coverage have been lacking, keeping the crisis shrouded in an air of secrecy and away from sustainable avenues for change that truly address its root causes.

***

Over the past decade, access to safe and affordable water has increasingly become a luxury in Detroit. In 2014, one year after the City of Detroit filed for Chapter 9 bankruptcy, the Detroit Water and Sewage Department shut off water services for more than 20,000 Detroit residents with unpaid water bills in an effort to pay off their own debts. Between 2014 and 2020, more than 141,000 Detroit residences had their water shut off at some point — a little more than 20% of the city’s current population. Shut-offs were paused for more than three years during the pandemic — a combination of a moratorium issued by Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and the City of Detroit’s extension — but in August 2023, the shut-off campaign resumed. The impact has been enormous, predominantly for low-income residents, leaving tens of thousands of households suddenly on the hook for $700 to $10,000 in water debt they cannot pay off, and with no access to running water in the meantime — a human rights violation, according to the United Nations.

In an email with The Michigan Daily, Monica Lewis-Patrick, We the People of Detroit CEO and president, contextualized the rationale driving these mass shutoff campaigns.

“Shutoffs have been used by water systems as a tool to manage debt rather than to support residents’ needs,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “These decisions have been driven by financial pressures tied to bond obligations, state oversight and austerity politics, which prioritize revenue collection over basic human needs. It’s deeply unjust that Detroiters, largely Black and low-income residents, are targeted to absorb the system’s financial strain while external customers are not paying their fair share.”

In addition to the increased financial pressures and practical consequences associated with one’s water being turned off, Lewis-Patrick emphasized the negative physical and emotional health impacts created by water shutoffs.

“A study by researchers at the Henry Ford Global Health Initiative found that residents living on blocks where water shutoffs occurred were 1.55 times more likely to be diagnosed with a water-associated illness,” Lewis-Patrick wrote.

All of this is coming at a time when water is becoming increasingly unaffordable for the average household. Across the United States, water bills are rising about 7% every year, and Detroit is not exempt from this pattern. The Great Lakes Water Authority placed a 10-year 4% cap on water rate increases, but this expired in June 2025, prompting a 7.73% proposed hike in Metro Detroit water rates for 2026. In relation to its suburbs, the city of Detroit is disproportionately feeling the impacts of this due to the 1999 Rate Settlement Agreement dubbed the “83/17 split,” which burdens Detroit residents with paying 83% of regional stormwater treatment infrastructure costs while its suburbs (with a 2021 median household income more than twice that of Detroit’s) only pay a collective 17%. With 34% of Detroit residents living below the poverty line, these inflated water bills are proving increasingly difficult to pay. In 2022, DWSD implemented the water affordability Lifeline Plan in an attempt to address these issues, but the funding has since mostly dried up, raising questions about the program’s efficacy moving forward.

“The underlying problem isn’t just the loss of one program,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “It’s the absence of a long-term, water affordability plan that ensures every household can maintain access regardless of income.”

The water issues plaguing Detroit aren’t limited to increasing rates and water shutoffs, too; there are also significant problems with the city’s water infrastructure that are directly impacting Detroit residents and going unaddressed. On July 19, 2024, a water main broke in northwest Detroit, near the corner of Biltmore and Gilchrist streets, flooding the basements of nearby residents like Diana Hill, Sabrina Moore and Tina Wixon, and causing thousands of dollars in damages.

“I’m still struggling to pay off the debt for all of the damages, and I still need stuff fixed,” Wixon said in an interview with The Daily.

All three described severe damageafter water seeped into their homes for more than 12 hours. The flood and its aftermath ruined appliances, destroyed family keepsakes and left black mold covering the floor.

“I had to replace my heating system because it was inoperable,” Moore said. “That furnace cost $9,000.”

Beyond the damage to their physical possessions, these women and their families have been experiencing different health issues since the floods began, citing asthma and other respiratory issues that have been exacerbated by the black mold in their homes. Part of the reason for concern is the water itself, Moore adds, describing how she has to run the water coming from her bathroom sink before using it because of how it smells.

“I’m starting to question that the water system is even safe for us to be consuming,” Moore said. “I believe our water is contaminated. Our water needs to be checked by an independent source.”

In response, the city and the DWSD have been unhelpful.

“The (DWSD) still refuses to give us any compensation. They refused to even help us,” Hill said. “I had to call the Red Cross, I called (the Federal Emergency Management Agency), and each one of them told me it wasn’t a disaster so they couldn’t help me. So I had to lose my emergency money.”

These three women were introduced to me by Beulah Walker, vice chief director of Hydrate Detroit, a Detroit-based water relief organization. And as the five of us met over Zoom to talk about the flooding, Walker described how July 19, 2024 is only one instance in a bigger pattern of Band-Aid solutions and neglect.

“This flooding has been going on for 10 years, ever since the bankruptcy,” Walker said. Hill nodded, elaborating to say that it’s happening all across the city, but “not every area is getting the same treatment.”

According to Hill, the claims the women filed were denied on the basis of the Michigan Governmental Liability for Negligence Act of 1964. Section 17 of this act makes the government not liable for damages resulting from the overflow of a sewage disposal system. But that’s not what happened on Gilchrist Street, Hill argues — it’s fresh water that they’ve seen filling up their basements.

“The interpretation of the rules — what (Hill) is reading — we might see it one way, but they have already interpreted it a whole different way,” Moore said. “We need to understand what is the verbiage really saying. We’re tired of people just lying to us.”

Frustration with the lack of institutional powers listening to what’s going on is a common theme across each of these three women’s experiences.

“We live here in this beautiful city of Detroit, raise our families, we are homeowners, we pay taxes. We should never have to deal with flooding in our homes due to a lack of services that are supposed to keep our city water system safe,” Moore said. “To me, it shows there’s a lack of respect for people — for human rights.”

At the end of our conversation, Hill, who is now in her 70s, tells me that she used to work for the University of Michigan — first in housekeeping and then in a lab on North Campus.

“These people have occupations,” Walker said, jumping in to add that Moore works in health care and Wixon works in quality control. “You know, when people are reading these stories, they go, ‘Oh these people don’t do nothing but just sit at home.’ You know how people think about Detroit residents: that we’re just lazy and don’t do shit.”

Hill, Moore and Wixon’s resilience in the face of these challenges, alongside the tenacious work of local water rights advocacy groups like Hydrate Detroit and We the People of Detroit, couldn’t be clearer in refuting the stereotypes Walker references. There is an abundance of grassroots movements taking shape in Detroit right now, from the informal neighborhood collective of Gilchrist Street to formal institutions taking a statewide approach like the People’s Water Board Coalition. The fight is far from over.

“We’re not giving up,” Moore said.

***

Like any good Michigander, I could talk at length about what’s happening in Flint or the evils posed to the Great Lakes by Nestle, but can I let you in on a secret? Even though I grew up in Royal Oak, a suburb about three miles north of Detroit, I had no idea of the extent to which Detroiters were facing similar water issues. The state of various water crises in Detroit was introduced to me for the first time only a few weeks ago when We the People of Detroit came to present in my Sociology 225 class. Hearing about the 83/17 split, I felt ashamed for not having paid closer attention to the structural injustices embedded in the communities around me. Now, though, the shock factor has worn off, and I’m angry. Tens of thousands of Detroit residents are regularly experiencing the effects of water injustice, whether it’s with uncompensated flooding damages as the result of poorly maintained DWSD infrastructure or water services being shut off to their home. This should not be a secret. Why aren’t more people talking about this?

What’s happening with water in Detroit is the type of crisis that should be making national headlines, but it’s not. Whether water should be commodified or considered a human right is a major topic of conversation across the U.S. and the world, but Detroit, with its majority-Black population, largely seems to be excluded from these dialogues. The city’s complicated web of water issues is being diligently covered by Metro Detroit news outlets such as the Detroit Free Press and Bridge Detroit, but by and large, the crisis is not getting the attention it deserves.

“It’s striking how many people still don’t know about the water crisis in Detroit, despite its inextricable connection to Flint and the broader fight for water justice,” Lewis-Patrick wrote. “Too often, crises that predominantly impact Black and Brown people are underreported or framed as management failures instead of systemic injustices rooted in policy and disinvestment.”

In Flint — another city with a majority-Black population and a severe water crisis — national media coverage has slipped significantly despite lingering contaminated water and distrust towards the city’s institutions persisting even 10 years after the water supply was initially switched. Flint’s water crisis was quickly catapulted from a local story to an international one in early 2016 when a state of emergency was declared, but has since slipped back into being an exclusively local story, even though the crisis is far from over — public trust is damaged, physical and mental health issues are prevalent and residents still haven’t seen any money from the $626.25 million settlement fund (though checks are promised in November). This begs the question in Flint, Detroit and beyond: What does it take for people to keep their eyes on a crisis long enough to see its resolution through?

It’s easy to look at data chronicling Detroit’s recent population growth and the success of the city’s sports teams and agree with the flashy national headlines that argue for Detroit’s rebound: “Detroit is Cool Again,” a National Geographic article reads. I’m hesitant to fully follow this line of thinking, though, because, first of all, it implies a time when Detroit wasn’t a cultural hub. But, more importantly, proclamations that “Detroit’s so back,” seem to neglect the experiences of so many of the city’s residents who are still suffering the consequences of the bankruptcy and struggling to access clean and affordable water. We shouldn’t let these on-the-ground realities become secrets, obscured by powerful people incentivized to maintain a facade of an upward trend experienced equally across the city. If you’re reading this in Ann Arbor, thinking that living an hour west of Detroit makes you removed from the city’s problems, I can promise you that it does not. The way the University prides itself on being “Leaders and the Best” sometimes facilitates an elitist sense of disconnect from the communities around it, as if U-M students are meant to remain posed in this ivory tower, looking down at these experiences of inequality beneath us. In reality, the University alone does not represent all of the “best” the state of Michigan has to offer, but it is an integral player, just like Detroit is. It is our responsibility to be using the power of the University’s resources and, equally as important, the power of our attention, to engage with the state of Michigan community in meaningful ways — and most immediately, to give the Detroit Water Crisis the spotlight it deserves.

The Texas Water Foundation said that the proposition prohibits the use of the New Water Supply Fund for the transfer of groundwater.
Disclosure: Texas Water Foundation has been a financial supporter of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.","Subscribe to The Y’all — a weekly dispatch about the people, places and policies defining Texas, produced by Texas Tribune journalists living in communities across the state.

Texas is poised to make the largest investment in its water supply in the state’s 180-year history after voters on Tuesday approved Proposition 4, which authorizes $20 billion to be spent on water projects over the next two decades.

The vote comes at a time when communities are scrambling to find new water supplies to meet the needs of their growing population, all the while deteriorating infrastructure, and a warming climate threatens the state’s water supply.

Throughout Texas’ history, ensuring water supply has rarely been a partisan issue. Many see it as a precious resource essential to both survival and the prosperity of the state’s economy. However, this year proved that water is personal and deeply emotional too. Proposed reservoirs and groundwater exports in East Texas have outraged many in the water-rich region, desalination projects along the Coastal Bend region have sparked political debate amid a water crisis, and data centers expanding across arid West Texas have locals worried about their dwindling groundwater supply.

These challenges and others pushed lawmakers to make big investments in water at the Capitol this year.

“Prop 4 is the culmination of almost 30 years of bipartisan work to create reliable and predictable funding for Texas water,” said Sarah Rountree Schlessinger, CEO of Texas Water Foundation, a nonprofit that educates Texans on water issues.

“We are thrilled that Texans showed up, asked deep questions, and that they chose to prioritize water infrastructure needs across the state. That tells you a lot about the state of Texas water.”

A portion of existing state sales tax revenue — up to $1 billion annually — would be deposited into the Texas Water Fund each year, starting in 2027 to help fund water, wastewater and flood infrastructure projects.

The funding comes from existing revenue, meaning no new taxes would be created. However, the money would only be transferred to the fund when sales tax collections exceed $46.5 billion in a given year. The past two fiscal years have surpassed that amount. Assuming the state’s growth continues, there will be enough money available to dedicate the $1 billion to the fund.

The $20 billion is far short of what the state needs to maintain its water infrastructure. According to one estimate, Texas communities need nearly $154 billion over the next 50 years for projects. Both rural and urban communities will be able to tap the fund to address their existing infrastructure needs.

“Today’s vote shows that Texans across the political spectrum understand the stakes and are ready to invest in solutions that will protect our water for generations,” said Jennifer Walker, a special adviser to the National Wildlife Federation Action Fund.

“Investing in our water infrastructure now means fewer leaks, safer drinking water, conservation of natural resources, and a stronger economy that can support families and communities for decades.”

The money will be managed by the Texas Water Development Board, the state agency that oversees the state’s water supply. Funding would be divided into two categories: water supply projects, and other existing water programs.

Water supply projects would expand the overall volume of water available in Texas. Projects that could be paid for include desalination, which cleans salty water for drinking and agricultural use, fixing leaking pipes, water reuse, which includes treating wastewater and produced water from the oil and gas industry, conservation strategies and constructing permitted reservoirs. Existing water programs include improving flood control infrastructure and flood mitigation, ensuring clean drinking water, and agricultural water conservation.

While oil and gas, and big statewide water groups in Texas supported the proposition, some environmental groups were concerned that certain projects, like reservoirs, will be prioritized as a form of new water supply and take the land of farmers and residents who live in areas where they plan to be built.

Other organizations feared it will help fund mega projects like desalination, which they believe will help industry expansion in their communities, and that local communities will be cut out of water decisions. Some conservative groups argued that spending should not be written into the Texas Constitution.

The proposition does not greenlight projects, but rather provides a way to finance projects. Any particular project that receives funds from the Water Development Board will go through a regular application process. The Texas Water Foundation said that the proposition prohibits the use of the New Water Supply Fund for the transfer of groundwater.

The fund also comes with some oversight. Lawmakers have created a special committee to oversee the water board’s administration of the funding. The water board will be required to report on how the money is being distributed and the impact they are having in meeting state needs and the public will have a chance to give input.

“Dedicated funding is the most important tool available to address the looming water challenges and rising costs for ratepayers across the state,” said Stacey Allison Steinbach, Texas Water Association’s Executive Director.

The Details: The UN’s Emissions Gap Report 2025 highlights a widening gap between national climate pledges and actual policies, projecting that current measures would result in roughly 2.8°C of warming by the end of the century. Even if all current commitments are fully implemented, global temperatures would still rise by 2.3-2.5°C, well above the 1.5-2°C targets of the 2015 Paris Agreement. The United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP) said that “this will be difficult to reverse – requiring faster and bigger additional reductions in greenhouse gas emissions to minimize overshoot.” While the UNEP reported some progress–the world was previously on track for a 4°C rise–CO2 emissions continued to increase 2.3% in 2024 to 57.7 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent.

For Context: Among the highest CO2 emitters are China, the US, India and the European Union. China pledged to cut emissions by 7-10% from their peak by 2035. Under the Trump administration, the US has retracted several pollution controls and climate policies, which could add up to 0.1 degree Celsius to future global warming projections. The European Union is reportedly attempting to align at least 15 of its 27 nations’ targets ahead of the COP30 climate summit in Brazil. In 2022, the UN climate change panel issued a report, arguing that unchecked global warming presents ""a threat to human well-being and planetary health.""

How the Media Covered It: The Washington Times (Lean Right bias) and New York Times (Lean Left) both highlighted the slight progress reported, but that overall efforts fell short. Breitbart (Right) noted 300 mayors pledged coordinated climate action ahead of the Brazil summit. Reuters (Center) emphasized the world's failure to meet the main climate change target, and quoted a UNEP lead report author who said, “we can no longer totally avoid it.” CNN (Lean Left) and Bloomberg (Lean Left) both highlighted the role of individual countries, noting the UNEP’s argument that “countries’ slow action” have led to the increase, and that “none of the roughly 60 countries” heading to the summit “have submitted an updated climate pledge.”",https://www.allsides.com/images/meta-images/allsides-logo-open-graph.png,N,,2025-11-04 22:18:05.673660

That just changed. Wake Forest University School of Medicine’s Charlotte campus welcomed its first class in July 2025. The medical school is just one component of The Pearl, a $1.5 billion development that will transform health care and be a catalyst for the city’s continued economic growth and diversification.

Ventas, Inc. (NYSE: VTR), an S&P 500 REIT focused on the secular megatrend of a large and growing aging population, provided the capital for The Pearl and jointly owns the project with its partners Advocate Health, the third-largest nonprofit integrated health system in the U.S., and Wexford Science & Technology, LLC, a private real estate company that partners with universities, research centers, and academic medical centers to create mixed-use “Knowledge Communities.” Alongside its partners, the City of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County, Ventas broke ground on the project in December 2022. The grand opening of The Pearl occurred in June 2025 and marked the completion of the first 700,000 square feet of a multi-phased project potentially encompassing 3.5 million square feet.

“Our investment focus is on the longevity economy,” says Debra A. Cafaro, chairman and CEO of Ventas. “Ventas is a leader at the intersection of medicine, research, and universities, and we partner with first class companies. The Pearl fits squarely in that intersection.”

“We had tremendous local and institutional commitment to The Pearl,” Cafaro says. “Charlotte is a growing city known for its financial services economy and its leaders want to build on that with better health care and a diversified economy.”

The Pearl is the largest public-private partnership in the history of Charlotte, according to Collin Lane, senior vice president of facilities for Advocate Health, and it will bring significant benefits to the city and its residents. The Pearl is anticipated to generate 5,500 jobs on site and more than 11,500 jobs total in the region over the next 15 years, according to city officials.

About the grand opening of The Pearl, Charlotte Mayor Vi Lyles said, “As The Pearl opens its doors, it’s not only a symbol of Charlotte’s ambitions — it’s proof that those ambitions are becoming reality.” She added, “Whether you’re a student, a job seeker, an entrepreneur, a health care professional, or simply proud to call Charlotte home, now is an exciting time to watch our city rise as a life sciences powerhouse.”

The Pearl came together quickly for a project of its size, according to Cafaro, taking three to five years from start to finish.

“For our investors, this has been a jewel of a project since the beginning because all the necessary ingredients were in place, including pre-leasing,” Cafaro says. “The high-end tenants The Pearl has attracted are interested in synergistic interactions—they want to be together in an exceptional space. When you have institutional investment, financial support, experienced partners, and you’re fulfilling a need in the community with a project like this, it dramatically increases the likelihood of success.”

The Pearl’s signature Howard R. Levine Center for Education was 100% preleased, with the entire project, including a state-of-the-art research tower, 905 Pearl Park Way, now more than 80% leased.

Another partner that helped streamline development of The Pearl was Duke Energy, says Ted Russell, president, CEO, and CFO of Wexford. The Pearl is built in a historic neighborhood and Duke Energy worked to bring in the power lines, utilities, and high-speed transmission lines that were needed for the new buildings. They also agreed to bury a lot of the lines and helped in a variety of ways during the entire project, he adds.

Paying Homage to a Community

The Pearl, located in the historic Brooklyn neighborhood of midtown Charlotte, incorporates the community history throughout the development with murals and signs. The neighborhood was predominantly Black residents, but much of its population was displaced during the 1950s through the 1970s due to urban renewal projects and highway construction.

“The community has been very supportive of The Pearl, in part because the development team engaged local residents throughout the planning stages,” Russell says. “In partnership with Advocate Health, we created the ‘Purposeful Walk’ which explains the history of the neighborhood with interactive signs. The Pearl and its open-air plaza called Jacob’s Ladder will also be open to community events.”

Russell says that local residents wanted to feel included in the economic development generated by The Pearl as well as have building access. “Many of the training opportunities and jobs that are generated are available to people without a four-year degree, which makes this project valuable to everyone,” he notes. “The leadership in Charlotte had the strategic vision to diversify the economy so it’s not dependent on the financial services industry. They view growing the academic, health care, and life sciences research fields as essential to growing the Charlotte economy.""

Innovative Research and Training Facilities

Wexford has developed nearly two dozen “Knowledge Communities” or “Innovation Districts” that link research universities with entrepreneurs and technology companies to create economic development in their cities and regions.

“We worked with Atrium Health [now part of Advocate Health] on their Wake Forest University School of Medicine in Winston Salem, when Advocate Health’s CEO Gene Woods reached out to us because he wanted to close the gap on health care outcomes,” Russell says.

“At The Pearl and other Knowledge Communities, we bring together primary health care providers, life science researchers, and tech-based companies to leverage the strength of the universities themselves. Those institutions serve as magnetic anchors to attract collaborations with private companies and entrepreneurs,” he adds.

Among the most prestigious tenants at The Pearl is IRCAD North America. “IRCAD is the premium global surgical training center, and this is their first U.S. license,” Russell says. About 8,000 surgeons are expected to come annually for two to five-day programs centered on the latest techniques and devices in cardiovascular, neuro, and orthopedic surgery as well as other types of surgery.

In addition to IRCAD, Siemens is opening a 60,000-square-foot Siemens Healthineers Experience Center USA at The Pearl, which features the latest technologies in imaging, diagnostics, cancer care, and advanced therapies in order to demonstrate them to health care professionals from around the world.

There is also 35,000 square feet of Connect Labs by Wexford scheduled to open in November 2025, comprised of small suites and labs for medical, tech, and life science entrepreneurs, Russell says. “They can interact with physicians in the Advocate Health buildings and with other entrepreneurs. There will be intentional programming with private industry in the field and opportunities for informal interaction,” he notes.

The location of The Pearl was driven in part by Advocate Health’s flagship hospital, Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center in Charlotte.

“Atrium Health Carolinas Medical Center is one of the largest hospitals in the Southeastern U.S.,” says Lane. It’s the region’s only Level 1 trauma center and provides cancer treatment, transplants, a children’s hospital, and is one of the largest neuroscience centers. “This hospital brings together a high density of super-sub specialists in Charlotte, which is part of why organizations like Siemens and IRCAD are drawn here,” he adds.

Patients and medical professionals come from areas throughout the Southeast for care and training, since the Carolinas Medical Center is the only provider of some specialized treatments between Atlanta and Washington, D.C., Lane points out.

The architecture of The Pearl, meanwhile, contributes to collaboration, according to Lane. “The buildings are deliberately not siloed because we think it’s a value proposition to have undergraduates, faculty members, and researchers work adjacent to each other and alongside a training platform,” he says.

Investing in a Pipeline of Trained Professionals

The Wake Forest University School of Medicine location at The Pearl is just one part of a systematic plan to generate more highly qualified health care providers in Charlotte.

“When Wake Forest announced their intention to build a second medical school in Charlotte, there was an immediate reaction that other people in the health care industry wanted to locate nearby,” Lane says. “There are hundreds of companies in the area who could find synergies with medical researchers and other professionals.”

Advocate Health has academic relationships with numerous colleges and universities, not just Wake Forest, with the premise that multiple avenues can create a talent pipeline for health care providers. The Carolinas College of Health Sciences, co-located with the Wake Forest University School for Professional Services, is owned by Advocate Health.

“Advocate Health has also partnered with Charlotte-Mecklenburg Schools to create a STEM program for fifth to eighth graders to bring students on field trips and engage them in other ways so they can envision themselves in various health care roles,” Lane says. “There’s an early college program from ninth grade on for students to start taking classes to prepare for a health care career.”

Creating that pipeline of talent will also attract people in other related industries to Charlotte, Lane says. In turn, the programs can be tailored to meet their needs for future employees, he says.",https://www.reit.com/sites/default/files/styles/full_width/public/media-images/triggsphoto_wexford_pearl_5web.jpg?itok=WkLXL8bw,N,,2025-11-04 22:57:33.918683

“We’re making a significant investment in battery storage because we see it as a critical part of Minnesota’s energy future,” Bria Shea, president of Xcel Energy-Minnesota, North Dakota and South Dakota, said in a statement.

The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission has already approved 300 MW to be installed at Sherco. Xcel’s proposal would increase that capacity to 600 MW, making it the largest battery storage site in the upper Midwest, according to the utility. It would also add another 135.5 MW at the company’s Blue Lake facility and expand the company’s Sherco Solar facility with an additional 200-MW array.

Xcel plans to start construction on the battery storage projects in 2026, and bring them online in late 2027. The projects will use lithium iron phosphate battery cell technology that “discharge energy in four-hour increments and are quick to recharge, allowing for regular use,” the utility said in a statement.

Xcel said it plans to reuse existing grid connections for the batteries to store energy produced by wind, solar, nuclear and natural gas facilities across its system.

“Batteries help us store energy when it’s inexpensive to produce and dispatch it when needed, allowing us to continue delivering reliable electricity to customers while keeping bills low,” Shea said.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant, and another 710 are being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week that it will close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The Hill’s Rachel Frazin has more here.

The banking industry is urging the Treasury Department to limit stablecoin rewards payments under the GENIUS Act.

In a letter Tuesday, the American Bankers Association (ABA) and state bankers associations from all 50 states, Washington, D.C., and Puerto Rico called for the agency to “broadly interpret” the law’s prohibition on interest.

The Treasury Department put out an advance notice of proposed rulemaking in September, seeking input on implementation of various provisions of the stablecoin measure, including “prohibitions on certain issuances.”

The banking associations argue that a broad interpretation of the law reflects “Congress’ intent for payment stablecoins to be used for transactions and not as investment vehicles.”

“But while Congress’s intent is clear, digital asset platforms today offer incentives to attract users to hold payment stablecoins including, high-yield rewards, token bonuses, and promotional payouts, asserting the ban on interest does not apply beyond stablecoin issuers,” the letter reads.

They also warn that allowing such rewards could draw deposits away from banks, placing strain on community banks in particular.

However, the crypto industry has pushed back on these arguments, contending that the banks are trying to block new competition and are overstating the impacts of deposit outflows.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 21:18:31.109709

AUSTIN — Governor Greg Abbott celebrated Texas being named America’s Top Business Climate for the third year in a row by Site Selection magazine.

“Texas once again emerges as the national champion for the top business climate in America,” said Governor Abbott. “As the eighth-largest economy in the world, Texas offers the freedom and opportunity for companies of all sizes and all industries to thrive. Coupled with the pro-growth, pro-business laws I signed this year, Texas improved the process of doing business to help them succeed in our great state. We will continue to make strategic investments and partner with job-creating businesses to ensure that Texas remains the top state in the nation to do business.”

Driving Texas’ top ranking is a powerful combination of factors: the number of job-creating corporate relocation and expansion projects, a pro-growth mindset and environment where enterprise can flourish, investments in workforce development and infrastructure, access to technology and tech talent, and a predictable regulatory landscape.

Another key measure contributing to Site Selection magazine’s Top Business Climate ranking is a survey of corporate real estate executives and site selectors—for which Texas earned top marks, beating out all other states.

Earlier this year, Governor Abbott accepted Site Selection magazine’s Governor’s Cup for a record-shattering 13th consecutive win for Texas as the nation’s top-performing state for job-creating business relocations and expansions. Texas also won the 2025 Prosperity Cup from Site Selection magazine, which recognizes the top state in the U.S. for attracting new business investments.

Despite this, the company’s stock fell by 3.46% in aftermarket trading. The earnings per share (EPS) was below the forecast at -0.06 USD, with a net loss of $23.8 million, compared to a $18.2 million loss in the previous year.

Key Takeaways

Clean Energy’s Q3 revenue exceeded forecasts by $2.49 million.

The company reported a net loss of $23.8 million, larger than the previous year.

Stock price declined 3.46% in aftermarket trading despite revenue beat.

Clean Energy maintained its 2025 outlook with significant RNG production growth expected in 2026.

Company Performance

Clean Energy Fuels exhibited strong revenue growth in Q3 2025, driven by increased fuel sales and station construction. Despite this, the company faced a net loss of $23.8 million, partly due to $3 million in one-time costs and the absence of alternative fuel tax credits that were applicable in 2024. The company continues to focus on expanding its renewable natural gas (RNG) operations, which it sees as a sustainable and economically viable solution for the transportation sector.

Financial Highlights

Revenue: $106.1 million, up 8% year-over-year

Adjusted EBITDA: $17.3 million

Cash and short-term investments: $232 million

Net loss: $23.8 million, compared to $18.2 million in 2024

Earnings vs. Forecast

Clean Energy’s Q3 revenue of $106.1 million surpassed the forecast of $103.65 million, representing a 2.4% surprise. However, the EPS of -0.06 USD did not meet expectations, contributing to the net loss reported.

Market Reaction

Following the earnings release, Clean Energy’s stock fell by 3.46% in aftermarket trading. This decline was observed despite the revenue beat, potentially influenced by the larger-than-expected net loss and the absence of certain tax credits.

Outlook & Guidance

The company maintained its 2025 outlook, expecting RNG production to nearly double in 2026. Clean Energy anticipates gradual improvement in low carbon fuel standard (LCFS) credit prices between 2026 and 2027 and is awaiting the finalization of the 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit rules. The projected RNG production for the end of 2025 is 5-6 million gallons, with a target of close to 20 million gallons by 2027.

Executive Commentary

CEO Andrew Littlefair stated, ""We believe our formula of practical decarbonization at a lower cost per mile than diesel will continue to resonate with fleets and shippers."" He emphasized the importance of RNG as a viable low-emission solution, particularly in the heavy-duty transportation sector.

Risks and Challenges

The absence of alternative fuel tax credits could impact future profitability.

Fluctuations in fuel margins and oil-to-gas price spreads may affect financial performance.

The success of new RNG projects and technology adoption remains uncertain.

Regulatory changes and delays in credit rule finalizations could pose risks.

Q&A

During the earnings call, analysts inquired about the challenges of ramping up RNG production and the variability in RNG volume growth. The company also addressed potential adoption of new engine technologies and analyzed fuel margin dynamics.

Conference Call Operator: Today, everyone, and welcome to today’s Clean Energy Fuels third quarter 2025 earnings conference call. At this time, all participants are in a listen-only mode. Later, you will have the opportunity to ask questions during the question and answer session. You may register to ask a question at any time by pressing star one on your telephone keypad. Please note this call is being recorded. I will be standing by if you should need any assistance. It is now my pleasure to turn the conference over to Robert Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer. Please go ahead.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you, Operator. Earlier this afternoon, Clean Energy released financial results for the third quarter ending September 30, 2025. If you did not receive the release, it is available on the investor relations section of the company’s website, where the call is also being webcast. There will be a replay available on the website for 30 days. Before we begin, we’d like to remind you that some of the information contained in the news release and on this conference call contains forward-looking statements that involve risk, uncertainties, and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Such forward-looking statements are not a guarantee of performance, and the company’s actual results could differ materially from those contained in such statements. Several factors that could cause or contribute to such differences are described in detail in the risk factor section of Clean Energy’s Form 10-Q filed today.

These forward-looking statements speak only as of the date of this release. The company undertakes no obligation to publicly update any forward-looking statements or supply new information regarding the circumstances after the date of this release. The company’s non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA will be reviewed on this call and exclude certain expenses that the company’s management does not believe are indicative of the company’s core business operating results. Non-GAAP financial measures should be considered in addition to results prepared in accordance with GAAP and should not be considered as a substitute for or superior to GAAP results. The directly comparable GAAP information, reasons why management uses non-GAAP information, a definition of non-GAAP EPS and Adjusted EBITDA, and a reconciliation between these non-GAAP and GAAP figures is provided in the company’s press release, which has been furnished to the SEC on Form 8-K today.

With that, I will turn the call over to our President and Chief Executive Officer, Andrew Littlefair.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you, Bob. I’m pleased to report that our business delivered another strong quarter. For the third quarter, we posted $106 million in revenue, sold 61 million gallons of renewable natural gas, and generated $17 million of Adjusted EBITDA. We ended the quarter meeting our expectations in line with the raised guidance for 2025 that we announced in August. With $232 million in cash and short-term investments and maintaining a strong balance sheet with ample financial flexibility and capacity to fund growth. Today, I will provide updates on our downstream fueling business, RNG’s opportunity in the heavy-duty truck sector, and progress in our upstream RNG production business. I’ll let Bob provide more detail on our financials and our reaffirmed full-year outlook. Our downstream fueling business continues to perform well.

Transit and refuse remain steady contributors, reflecting longstanding customer relationships and our ability to deliver clean, affordable fuel day in and day out. For over two decades, natural gas trucks and buses have delivered cleaner air and lower emissions to these fleets and the cities they serve. On the refuse side, we currently have 140 different companies ranging from national leaders like WM and Republic Services to many regional companies around the country, 309 fueling sites. And we fuel the buses of transit agencies from New York City to LA and many in between. We are well positioned to support additional fleets in their adoption of ultra-clean RNG. Clean Energy also continues to support transit agencies that are following California state incentives to explore hydrogen alongside RNG. In late September, we announced we were awarded the contract to design, build, and maintain a second hydrogen fueling station for Foothill Transit.

This extends our 20-plus-year partnership with the agency and complements the RNG fuel fleet Foothill already operates. The new site will support an initial 19 hydrogen fuel cell buses. We’ve also won awards to build hydrogen stations for the cities of Riverside and Ventura transit agencies. The largest opportunity for our downstream fueling business continues to be heavy-duty trucking. Approximately 250,000 new Class 8 heavy-duty trucks are sold each year in the U.S. and Canada. The heavy-duty sector is tasked with providing critical goods movement services across our economy. Meanwhile, the sector has been facing challenging freight rates, uncertain policy regulations, and continued demand from shippers to lower emissions in this hard-to-decarbonize segment of the value chain. As you know, overall sales of heavy-duty trucks have been significantly lower over the last year or two compared to most years. Battery electric and hydrogen face significant challenges for heavy-duty trucking.

RNG, on the other hand, is low NOx and has low to negative greenhouse gas emissions, yet does this at a lower cost of ownership than even diesel. The engine technology, infrastructure, and reliable supply of clean fuel are here today. And at Clean Energy, we are pursuing this opportunity on multiple fronts. In September. Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions launched as the first leasing company focused on low-carbon heavy-duty vehicles with next-generation CNG trucks as the focus. Clean Energy, alongside Cummins and Hexagon Agility, partnered with Pioneer to support another pathway that lowers barriers for fleets to adopt RNG-powered equipment. Just last week, we expanded our Class 8 demo truck program with a 2026 Freightliner Cascadia Gen 5 day cab equipped with the Cummins X15N.

Our truck was unveiled at the American Trucking Associations’ conference to high praise from the senior editor of Transport Topics, a leading trucking publication, who did a test drive. The demo truck will rotate among carriers so they can experience the X15N’s performance across real routes in our fueling network. This builds on the success of our first Peterbilt X15N demo launch last year, and that continues to be in rotation around the country. Since Freightliner has the largest overall market share in the heavy-duty space, the demand to get in the queue for this new demo truck has been very high. Turning to our upstream RNG production business, while RIN pricing has stabilized, LCFS credit prices continue to face some headwinds impacting segment profitability. We expect CARB’s program changes, which are already in effect, to tighten the market and support gradual price improvement in 2026 and beyond.

The 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit is an important value driver for dairy RNG that recognizes the fuel’s negative emissions benefit. We continue to await Treasury’s finalization of the 45Z rules and credit values, which we expect in the next few months. We plan to begin to monetize our 2025 45Z credits once those rules are finalized. Meanwhile, we are controlling what we can control: project execution and production improvement. I’m pleased to report that our two largest dairy projects, one in Texas and one in Idaho, have recently begun initial operations. We will be announcing more specifics soon about these exciting developments. This brings our total projects in operation to eight. We continue to be focused on optimizing production across our portfolio to increase our own supply of negative carbon RNG for our network.

100% of the fuel that we sell in California is RNG, and the average carbon intensity score of that fuel is minus 194. So that’s impressive. In addition, we broke ground on three new dairy RNG projects under our development agreement with Moss Energy Works. These projects span six dairies across South Dakota, Georgia, Florida, and New Mexico, and are expected to produce three million gallons of RNG annually once fully operational. In summary, our business fundamentals remain solid. The downstream fueling business is steady and well-positioned for growth. And on the upstream side, we’re executing and scaling. Clean Energy is uniquely positioned with the largest RNG fueling network, a substantial supply of RNG from our own operations and from third parties, and a team that knows how to deliver for our customers.

We believe our formula of practical decarbonization at a lower cost per mile than diesel will continue to resonate with fleets and shippers that need solutions they can deploy today. And with that, I’ll hand the call back to Bob.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you, Andrew. And good afternoon to everyone. The third quarter of 2025 was another good quarter on $106.1 million in revenue. Versus $104.9 million a year ago. Last year’s revenue included $6.4 million in alternative fuel tax credit revenues, and the alternative fuel tax credit is not in place for 2025 as it was not extended past 2024. So putting the alternative fuel tax credit aside, the increase in revenues over last year’s third quarter was 8%, primarily driven by increases in fuel sales along with a rise in station construction sales. On a GAAP basis, our net loss for the third quarter of 2025 was $23.8 million versus $18.2 million in 2024, with the 2024 net loss benefiting from the $6.4 million in alternative fuel tax credits not applicable to 2025.

And as well, our 2025 GAAP net loss included $3 million in net incremental costs for a couple of one-time items, one of those being $5 million in incremental accelerated depreciation expense that was tied to our pilot stations, bringing that total depreciation charge in line with our initial estimates. And the second one-time item was a $2 million non-operating gain from the liquidation of a non-core investment. These two items did not impact adjusted EBITDA. Speaking of which, our adjusted EBITDA for the third quarter of 2025 was $17.3 million. And reflects similar and steady trends from our recent second quarter of 2025, with good fuel and service margins, plus an improvement in our upstream dairy negative adjusted EBITDA. Last year, adjusted EBITDA of $21.3 million, of course, includes the $6.4 million of alternative fuel tax credits.

When excluding the alternative fuel tax credits from 2024, the improvements in 2025 over 2024 continue to come from greater fuel volumes, including both conventional natural gas and RNG. Particularly a higher concentration of low-CI dairy RNG, along with lower operating expenses from a year ago third quarter. These improvements helped to offset the effects of lower RIN pricing from a year ago, where you can see the RIN revenue is down $2.8 million versus last year. We generated cash flow from operations again in the third quarter, and our cash and investment balance of $232 million that Andrew mentioned is our balance after making a $12 million contribution of capital into our dairy RNG joint venture with Moss Energy Works in the third quarter. And lastly, you’ll note that we maintained our 2025 outlook, which we had raised back in August, and we feel good.

We feel that we’re in good shape in maintaining that outlook. And with that, operator, we can open the call to questions.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: At this time, if you would like to ask a question, please press Star 1 on your telephone keypad. You may remove yourself from the queue at any time by pressing Star 2. Once again, that is Star 1 to ask a question. We’ll take our first question from Eric Stine with Craig-Hallum. Your line is open. Please go ahead.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Hi, Andrew. Hi, Bob.

Hi, Eric.

Hey. So maybe just starting with the RNG upstream business. So it sounds like you’ve got eight operating right now. Can you just give us kind of the thought or target, maybe run rate of volumes that you expect to exit 2025? And as you think about this longer term, I know that market has changed a bit. You’ve got a lot of supply from third-party sources. So just kind of curious how you think about that when you look out multiple years. At one time, you had a pretty high target for what you might ultimately produce upstream. Curious where that stands now.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Right. So, you’re bringing up the production rates of the five that came online. We call them the Renuco projects. But you’ll exit the year somewhere between five and six million gallons. And next year, you’ll double it. Close to doubling it. And eventually, you’ll be closer to 20 million gallons once those projects come on. And now I’m going out. That’s once those Moss projects are on. And so now I’m going out to 2027. Eric, you’re referring to what we came out with almost five years ago, four and a half years ago, the 100 million gallons, which, by the way, would have taken another $1.2 or $4 billion. And we pulled that back long ago when we looked at the credit pricing and some of the current situation. But what I will say is we like where we are.

We like having that amount of fuel that we control. But we’re very big in the business, as you well know. And we have 80-90 different suppliers. So we’re moving still about half of all the RNG into transportation in the industry. We continue to be at the focal point of that. Everyone that needs RNG into transportation often has to come to us. So we like our position. We feel like we’ve made prudent investments to this point. We have to get those up and running correctly. We’re starting to see an improved production rates, which will continue to get better and better. And we’re starting to feel much better about those early projects. We take great part in looking at the production that’s going on in our first project, Del Rio, that’s been up and running a while. And that thing’s hitting nameplate and it’s doing very well.

We’re very proud of that. And we’re beginning to start seeing some significant increases in production at the others. As I mentioned in my prepared remarks, Eric, our two biggest projects, one of which we own 100% of, they’re just now beginning to inject. So one of those produces somewhere around five million gallons and the other around 3.6 million. And they’re just now coming on. So we like where we are. And we’ll see how that kind of all plays out as they develop here in 2026 and in 2027.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Yep. Thanks for that. And you mentioned, I know, last quarter or earlier in the year, you kind of set it as an objective to improve the performance at the plants. And you have made progress. You did mention that you’ve got a few more steps to go. I mean, any clarity there, I would assume, or should we assume that those are pretty much you just kind of have to go through steps? It takes time rather than being something that’s a significant investment.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: That’s right. That’s right. It’s fine-tuning. It’s working with the farmer. It’s all those things. There aren’t big CapEx requirements to get them right. It’s really just kind of bringing it along, getting the team working exactly right. So. Going through the first winter and figuring out where certain other items need to be winterized is kind of mundane things, but they’re important. And what’s interesting, Eric, is you really do tune them up. From kind of when they first come on, they’re more like producing about half of what you thought. And next thing you know, they’re at 70, 75. But they will begin to pull on up to nameplate.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Got it. Last one for me. I know it’s early days still, but the Pioneer Clean Fleet Solutions, just any thoughts on initial interest, what you think that might do to spur X15N adoption, just kind of initial impressions.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Well, I’m told, look, I love having another interested party out working with our customers and with potential customers. I think that’s really powerful. We know this crowd. I like the fact that we’re engaged in standing that company up alongside Cummins and Hexagon Agility. I think that’s good alignment for us. I’m told they have their first deal in the works. I’m not going to say any more than that, but they have maybe their first paper out circulating and that they’ve already had meetings with 20 different fleets. I think they did some. Showed the flag pretty well down there in San Diego at the ATA. So I like the fact that you have a very focused group working just on RNG, just on natural gas trucks, understands the nuance there on leasing.

And so we’re working hard, hand in glove with them, our sales team, as is Hexagon and Cummins. So we’ll see how they do.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Okay. Thanks.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Rob Brown with Lake Street Capital Markets. Please go ahead.

Good afternoon. Speaking of the 15-liter kind of ramp rates and how that’s developing in the market. Good to see the Pioneer project. But what’s sort of the other sort of timeline and development of the 15-liter ramp? How do you see it at this point with sort of the market environment today?

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Well, I think there’s been, as I mentioned in my prepared remarks, the market has not been exactly favorable, right? The freight rate thing is real. That’s a real overhang in the trucking business. And it has affected purchases of new trucks. So that’s just something you wish can get worked off. I think you’re going to have softer rates that will begin to firm. But as I read the material, it looks like that could take a good part of 2026. So that’s just some headwinds there that I’d rather not have. It’s hard to get people to make a move toward not only buying new equipment, but buying new technology when they’re worried about tariffs and import duties and supply chain and their freight rates. Now, having said that, I think that most in the industry have seen that there’s kind of a shaking out.

I mean, as you take stock of what occurred down there at the ATA conference in San Diego, I mean, it’s clear that there’s been a sorting out of the technology. I mean, look, I’m not wishing ill on anything, but I think that the electric and the hydrogen technologies really have gotten knocked down a peg because of their reliance on certain of the regulations and such, certainly at the federal level. And so now it’s very clear that if you’re a trucker, you have diesel, renewable diesel, or you have RNG. And what’s coming through is, Rob, that the fleets and the shippers still want sustainability, still want to be green, still want to decarbonize, but it has to make economic sense. That’s what’s different now, is that this has to stand on its own bottom.

Now, the good news for us is we have a technology and we have an engine that’s here today and can be delivered today that can give returns. I mean, with our fuel pricing and with the economics associated with the incremental cost, we can get these fleets a two-year payback, two and a half-year payback on the equipment, and then they really have significant savings as they keep that truck up to the typical five years. So we like our positioning from that point of view. Now, we’ve had fleets such as Walmart, Amazon, UPS, FedEx, SAIA, Knight-Swift, Food Express. I mean, they’ve all purchased the new X15N. So I like the breadth. Now, we need more to acquire, and we need those fleets to really engage fully. But we’re seeing some breadth of people beginning to take that in, get comfortable with it.

And then we hope there’ll be those kinds of fleets buy a lot of trucks. We hope that as they like what they’ve got and they’re operating well, that we’ll see increased adoption in the coming years. But we’re working hard with making sure that we’re getting good exposure to the X15N with the largest fleets in America. And so far, most of them have taken some.

Okay. Great. Thanks for all the color there. And then on the Moss Energy development, how much is the CapEx requirement on your side for the three facilities? And then I guess what’s sort of the pipeline on the Moss side that you could see additional facilities on?

Hold on one second. It’s about 35. Yeah, 36 million.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: 35 million.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: We’ve sent 12 over. In the third quarter.

Okay. Good. And then just in terms of the additional potential projects with Moss, is there still a pipeline there, or do you feel like this is sort of it for what you see right now?

Well, Daryl’s a busy guy. So we’ve got those projects that I mentioned, the three projects. We constantly work with Daryl to see. There’s a couple others that we had looked at very closely. But just with the given credit situation, they didn’t sing quite like we’d like. And Daryl understood that. So we’ll continue to look at those. We like the fact that he’s a very good operator and brings these projects on quickly and efficiently. So we’ll see. Yeah. And we’ll have about, well, for this, what we have in front of us, so $35 million was in the cards for this year, but we’ll have about $85 million in total. Yeah. For the plan that’s in front of us with him.

Okay. Great. Thank you. I’ll turn it over.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Derrick Whitfield with Texas Capital. Please go ahead.

Good afternoon. Congrats on a solid update, guys.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you.

Maybe starting with the downstream, you guys announced a flurry of supply agreements last week. Could you speak to what led to that step change in activity and when those volumes will directionally start to flow through?

In many ways, we have hundreds and hundreds of customers, right? So at any given time, while we don’t always announce all of them, because sometimes they’re just not as glamorous, let’s say, every year, we have a couple hundred different customers that grow their fleet and renew contracts with us. And so you’re getting a little bit of that mix in there. Now, there were some wins, but I want to say that when you have the size of the network and the fact that we have about 800 or 900 customers under a contract, there’s a lot of activity kind of constantly. We had some extra transit properties in that release, but we have quite a few new refuse customers and additions coming up right now. So I don’t know if there’s some sea change that just happened.

It’s just kind of the way our cycle tends to ebb and flow, but I do like the fact that we have a lot of activity. And that makes us feel optimistic about these fleets as they continue with the program.

Great. Understood. And then regarding the two larger projects that you guys have just brought on. Could you offer maybe some directional thoughts on the timing of certification of environmental attributes, including RINs, LCFS, and 45Z credits? I know that the LCFS backlog was quite extensive at one point, but just where is that today? Where does that sit today?

These, let me handle it this way, and if I get too far out, someone will jump in here and save me. But these things take a while to really get up, and so there’s kind of a process for them to get into revenue production. I mean, and we’re just now kind of taking care of the commissionings. I mean, the Texas property is a few weeks ahead of the Idaho property. After about a month of operations or so, the EPA has been pretty fast after two or three weeks time often that we’re able to begin to certify to be able to get the RINs. Now, the LCFS, there’s a provisional and another kind of certification where at some point after time, we begin to participate and I guess collect at about a minus 150, right?

And then eventually, over time, we get the final processing from California, the LCFS. But that has taken on our Del Rio project the better part of almost two years. Now, we think that that backlog has gotten corrected some. But I would say by the time you’re really hitting your stride and all buttoned up with the certification process, I mean, it’s the better part of 2026 for these projects before you’re really done with that. Now, you’ll be receiving credits and being able to monetize credits, but not at their full potential.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Understood. Thanks for your time, guys.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Okay. Thank you.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Matthew Blair with TPH. Please go ahead.

Thank you. And good afternoon. And congrats on the strong results in the third quarter. You mentioned that you kept your 2025 EBITDA guide intact, which, if I’m doing the math right, implies, I think it’s $8 million-$13 million for the fourth quarter, even though the fourth quarter tends to be pretty strong for Clean. So I guess how should we think about this? I think in the past, you’ve been reluctant to change your guide so late in the year and effectively provide single-quarter guidance. But I guess, is it fair to think that there might be some upside to the 2025 targets? Or how should we think about that here?

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Probably. Right? I mean. As you look at it, it looks like. It looks like that we should, we’re doing well. I don’t think it’s—I don’t think we’re in a position to really now tick it up. That. At this point. But I think as you’re looking at it, you’re saying, ""Huh, these guys are going to be certainly on the top end of the guidance or maybe a little bit beyond that."" I mean, that’s reasonable if you thought that way. And we’ll see how it performs. There’s a lot of things that work here, but.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Yeah. I mean, I think.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: That’s how I feel too.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: And we kind of agree that at that point, maybe you’re micromanaging a quarter.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Yeah.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: And I think we feel good with that range that we’d put out there. And where we sit right now, too, to be comfortable with that. But we weren’t going to, we’re not going to micromanage it.

Sounds good. And then just looking at your RNG volume growth this year, it’s been a little variable. I think in the first quarter, it was down 13% year over year. Second quarter, up 8%. This quarter, up 3%. I guess, could you help us understand why has it been so variable? Is that due to the supply that’s coming to Clean, that there’s some variability in those volumes, or are there other factors?

Well, there was, Matthew. There certainly was in the first quarter, right, where there were cold spells throughout the country and all the RNG producers, the dairy producers were having execution difficulties because of that cold weather. So you saw a bit of a drop. And then there was a bit of a rebound in the second quarter. We also have the biogas reform where gas was held at year-end. So then that kind of floods in. It came in. Well, in the second quarter, we had an uptick primarily from the cold weather in the first quarter. And so that was a little bit distorted in terms of its growth. And then I think the third quarter, our third quarter here was maybe a little bit more normalized, if you will. So you’ve got, yeah. So there’s some variations in there.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Betty Zhang with Scotiabank. Please go ahead.

Betty Zhang, Analyst, Scotiabank: Thanks. Good afternoon. Thanks for taking my question. I first wanted to ask about. Maybe if you could give us a preliminary look at expectations for 2026. And in particular, if you could speak to. Volumes. Should we expect a pretty big step up given. Your production of RNG that’s ramping up? And as well. Should we be accounting for the. X15N gallons, or is it still too early for that?

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Betty, we’re not going to. It’s history is the guide. We’re not going to share today set our guidance for 2026. I mean. I think if you go back and listen to what I said earlier on this call, I gave about as much guidance as we’re going to give on the RNG. From our end, right? And so. In the scheme of things, it’s a nice growth from our, from where we’ve been to where we’re going next year. But it’s not a step change type thing. But go back and listen to that. I mean, basically, what I said, we’re exiting the year around four to five to six, and that it’ll get close to doubling, right? That’s from our RNG production. So that kind of gives you a thought for that. The adoption is hard to tell, Betty. And I don’t have a crystal ball here.

And I don’t. Over the years, we’ve worked hard to be in the high single digits. But it’s just. I think it’s too hard to tell exactly how the adoption rate for the X15N is going to be for, as I sit here today, for next year. Over the course of the last several years with the nine-liter at Cummins, I mean, we have seen dramatic adoption rates over time. But it takes time. And you’re kind of in the early phase of that with the X15N. And there’s a lot of uncertainty with regulations in California and the federal government. And so it’s a lot at work. And yet. We feel optimistic that you’re getting the right fleets experiencing with it to get to increased rates of adoption. But I guess I’m crawfishing around, Betty. No, I’m not going to give you the exact growth number, but. It’ll be.

We should see increased rates of adoption in 2026. Let’s put it that way. But of course, you’re coming off of low levels of adoption right now in the X15N.

Betty Zhang, Analyst, Scotiabank: Okay. Fair enough. For my follow-up, I wanted to ask about the fuel margin. Looking forward to the next several periods, our view is that the WTI to Henry Hub spread should narrow or may narrow. So I just wanted to get a sense of how Clean Energy is able to kind of manage the fuel margin, what leverage you guys could pull on that end.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Bob and I watched that as well very closely. As you know, there’s been a nice fuel margin throughout most of 2025. That’s narrow. Not only is it going to narrow, it has narrowed some from kind of historical differentials, the oil and gas spread to where you are today, right? Today, you have $4.25 gas and $60 a little more oil. You’ve come down to 15 to 1. Now, we tend to think, Betty, that that will be, that’s mid-teens to 15, 16, 17 to 1 is probably a good spread. With that, we’re in, that’s good for us. That’s very good for us. We can maintain the kinds of fuel margins that we’ve seen this year in that. Now, what’s difficult is if you have $40 oil and you have $4 natural gas or $4.50 natural gas and $35 crude.

I guess our view is, as we look out, that we see the relationship between oil and natural gas kind of staying in this 15 to 1 spread where you are right today. I think that’s pretty much where you’re going to be. I mean, frankly, Betty, I think you may see oil come down some. I mean, that seems to be, that could be. I don’t think you’re going to, right now, you’re seeing sort of winter pricing on the gas curve. That gas cost should come down. I think you’ll, as I said, I think the 15 to 1 is probably 15, 16 to 1 is probably a pretty good spread.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Yeah. Along with the other drivers that we have within our margin of RNG and LCFS pricing around that. So. We don’t have everything all concentrated in one.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: No. One of the beauties. No. We have a lot of the West Coast.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: The red spot around the country.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Refined products of diesel. I mean, diesel today in California is $5.25. So.

Betty Zhang, Analyst, Scotiabank: That’s helpful.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: That has to get factored in too.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Right.

Betty Zhang, Analyst, Scotiabank: Okay. Great. Thank you.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Our next question comes from Dushyant Ailani with Jefferies. Please go ahead.

Hey, guys. Thanks for taking my question. I just have one quick one. I know that as you guys kind of ramp your RNG upstream next year, 2026, I know there are a bunch of puts and takes, 45Z, LCFS, D3. Just trying to figure out what are some of the sensitivities to think about for that segment to get to a bit positive. Any kind of thoughts, Carlo, that you can share? Is that a 2026 story, 2027? Or do we need to see D3 or LCFS or 45Z to kind of get to those levels?

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Well.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: You got a lot of things.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Yeah. You got a lot of things. Let me start, and then Bob, where I mess up, you can chime in. We do think that the LCFS program as outlined by CARB is going to lead over time, over next year, to a strengthened LCFS price. It’s anybody’s guess exactly where it is. But. Our partners and us, we think that 2026 is going to be better in 2025, and 2027 is going to be better in 2026. And so that should be strengthening. I mean, CARB believes that the LCFS, by the time you get to 2028, 2029, could be back to where we were at $120-$135, $150. So. That’s good. Maybe we’ve seen the bottom, and that should be strengthening. So that’s good for our business. We, as I said on our call, we have to work on what we control.

Is we have to get the capacity and the production levels up at the plants. And we feel confident now that we’ve really taken firmer control of the operations. We’ll get there. But that’s important to us. For these things to perform correctly. Almost as important as what’s happening on the environmental pricing side. So we’ve got to get these things. Feel very good about these two large projects that we just brought on now because they’ve commissioned well. And I think we learned from some of our earlier projects. We’ve got to get all these projects performing better. And then. You really can see them perform like they should. And you’ll have strengthening LCFS prices over time. I think RINs, I would say maybe the cautious view there is. We’ve seen those stabilize.

And I’m not smart enough to figure how the small refinery exemptions factored into the maybe a potential change in the RVO. Some have said that it could lead to RIN strengthening some. I don’t know. But. We sort of like where the RIN is now because it’s stabilized at $2.30 or so. And that works fine for us. So. Productivity enhancements on our plants. And we do see a strengthening of the LCFS credit in the future.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: And then the production tax credit as well, 45Z. If that changes in our favor. With the guidance comes out from the Treasury if they.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: That’s better.

Eric Stine, Analyst, Craig-Hallum: Yeah. Depending on where that comes out, that could be some upside. But I think that. As you said, I mean, these projects at least are getting through that ramp-up phase. And it’s kind of about that kind of timing to get through the period, which going into 2026, a lot of them are. And the volume production then should show improvements there for sure.

Got it. Thank you.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: It appears we have no further questions at this time. I will now turn the program back over to Andrew Littlefair for any additional or closing remarks.

Bob Vreeland, Chief Financial Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: Thank you, operator. Thank you, everyone, for joining us today. And we look forward to filling you in on the next quarter next year. Thank you.

Andrew Littlefair, President and Chief Executive Officer, Clean Energy Fuels: This does conclude today’s program. Thank you for your participation. You may disconnect at any time.

Why Do Central Asia’s Minerals Struggle to Reach Western Markets?
Recommendations for Strengthening U.S.–Central Asia Minerals Cooperation Historically, the mining industry has long been a cornerstone of Central Asia’s economy.
Here are some recommendations to strengthen U.S.–Central Asia minerals cooperation.","Washington will host a C5+1 summit on November 6, marking the tenth anniversary of the regional diplomatic platform that brings together the United States and the five Central Asian states: Kazakhstan, the Kyrgyz Republic, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan, and Uzbekistan. Since its establishment in 2015, the C5+1 has served as the primary forum for advancing cooperation on economic, energy and minerals, and security issues. This year’s summit carries particular weight: It comes at a moment when China and Russia are rapidly deepening their foothold in Central Asia’s minerals and infrastructure, positioning themselves at the center of the region’s emerging supply chains.

In recent years, critical minerals have become a defining feature of the U.S.–Central Asia relationship. In February 2024, the United States launched the C5+1 Critical Minerals Dialogue to strengthen cooperation in geological exploration, attract mining and processing investments, and connect Central Asia’s mineral wealth to U.S. markets. That same year, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan joined the U.S.-led Minerals Security Partnership Forum, signaling their commitment to building more resilient supply chains less dependent on China. To date, efforts have focused on dialogue over action.

The region holds vast reserves of minerals critical to U.S. economic and national security, including uranium, chromite, copper, titanium, gold, and antimony, as well as emerging deposits of rare earth elements and other strategic metals. Mining remains a key pillar of the region’s two largest economies, contributing roughly 17 percent of GDP in Kazakhstan and 8 percent in Uzbekistan, reflecting Central Asia’s deep mining heritage and existing social licenses that enable industrial expansion. Recent commercial deals, such as Uzbekistan’s $8.5 billion aircraft procurement deal with Boeing and Kazakhstan’s $4.2 billion locomotive contract with Wabtec, further reveal a growing U.S.–Central Asia economic momentum.

Yet, despite these developments, tangible progress in minerals cooperation remains limited. Chinese and Russian capital dominate the region’s mining, processing, and logistics networks, while structural barriers, ranging from underdeveloped westward transport routes to recurring energy shortages, continue to deter Western investment. The upcoming C5+1 summit offers Washington a narrow but strategic window to translate diplomacy into concrete investment and position the United States, not its rivals, as a credible new partner in Central Asia’s evolving minerals landscape.

Central Asia’s Mineral Reserves and Production

Central Asia holds substantial reserves of minerals designated by the United States as critical. Kazakhstan, the region’s largest economy, is the world’s leading uranium supplier, producing 23,270 metric tons or 39 percent of global output in 2024. The country also leads the region in exploration spending, reaching a decade-high of $127 million in 2025, nearly half of which targets copper projects. Uzbekistan has likewise emerged as a promising mining center. In 2024, it announced the discovery of new deposits, containing tungsten, lithium, and germanium, along with 14 rare earth element sites, signaling strong potential for future development. Tajikistan, meanwhile, ranks second globally in antimony production, accounting for 15 percent of the world’s supply, further highlighting the region’s strategic importance in global minerals supply chains.

Despite this potential, Central Asia’s mineral exports remain heavily oriented toward China and Russia, limiting opportunities for diversification and Western engagement. Kazakhstan, which leads regional production, sends 27 percent of its mineral exports to China and 16 percent to Russia, while the United States accounts for only 5 percent. Uzbekistan shows a similar pattern, with China, Russia, and Turkey as its main export destinations. Central Asia’s China- and Russia-focused export patterns reveal a heavy reliance on eastward corridors and a lack of infrastructure linking the region to Western markets.

Central Asia’s Role in U.S. Nuclear Security

Kazakhstan is the world’s largest uranium powerhouse. In 2022, it produced more than 21,000 tons, or roughly 45 percent of the world’s supply. By comparison, Canada, the world’s second-largest producer, produced 7,000 tons. That same year, Uzbekistan ranked fifth, contributing around 7 percent of global supply. Together, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan account for just over half of the world’s uranium production, making the global market highly sensitive to developments in Central Asia. This vulnerability was underscored in January 2022, when political unrest in Kazakhstan triggered an 8 percent spike in uranium prices in a single day, revealing the strategic fragility of supply chains tied to the region.

Central Asia’s influence on the uranium market is expected to grow further. The question is whether the United States will partner effectively with these markets. China has moved aggressively to deepen its foothold in the region. It has been purchasing natural uranium from Kazakhstan since the early 2000s and maintains multiple long-term contracts across suppliers. Through its close partnership with Kazatomprom, Kazakhstan’s state nuclear company, China now offtakes nearly 30 percent of Kazakhstan’s uranium exports—cementing a significant degree of influence over one of the world’s most strategic uranium sources.

Uranium is a bedrock of U.S. energy security, accounting for 19 percent of U.S. electricity, and the United States remains the world’s largest nuclear power producer. However, that leadership is under pressure. Years of stagnation and plant retirements have slowed U.S. growth, while China is rapidly expanding its fleet—on pace to surpass U.S. nuclear capacity by 2030, with 150 new reactors expected between 2020 and 2035. Ensuring a stable uranium supply has therefore become one of the most critical factors in preserving U.S. nuclear leadership. The United States remains reliant on Russia, an adversary, for much of its uranium; in 2022, 30 percent of imports came from Russia. Over the next five years, global demand is expected to surge by nearly 30 percent. Achieving these goals, while de-risking nuclear power supply, will require not only a massive increase in uranium supply but also secure, diversified, and resilient supply chains.

Why Do Central Asia’s Minerals Struggle to Reach Western Markets?

Despite Central Asia’s abundance of mineral resources, the region’s ability to fully capitalize on new partnerships with the West, particularly with the United States, remains constrained by inadequate transport infrastructure. Most export routes still run north to south, a legacy of Soviet-era railway construction that prioritized moving raw materials toward Russia to support its industrial base. As a result, Central Asia remains heavily dependent on Russian rail and maritime infrastructure for shipping minerals to Europe and the U.S. In Kazakhstan, the region’s primary transit hub, an estimated 57 percent of railway tracks are in disrepair, further limiting export capacity.

Before Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Central Asian countries relied on the Northern Corridor, which passes through Russia to the Black and Baltic Seas, to transport energy resources and minerals to global markets. After the imposition of Western sanctions on Russia, regional governments shifted focus toward developing the Middle Corridor, a multimodal trade route connecting China to Europe via Central Asia and the South Caucasus. The corridor’s transit time of 16–20 days is comparable to the 14–18 days via the northern route.

At the same time, Central Asia’s power constraints, rooted in its Soviet legacy, pose a major barrier to expanding mineral production and processing. Under the Soviet system, power generation and distribution were centrally managed across the republics, with little regard for modern borders or national energy needs. After independence, all five states were left scrambling to balance generation, energy imports, and domestic demand.

Mining is highly energy-intensive, yet much of Central Asia still depends on aging power plants and outdated transmission lines, limiting its ability to scale up mineral output. The region faces high transmission and distribution losses, as well as frequent seasonal blackouts that can disrupt mining operations. In Kazakhstan, transmission losses reach about 15 percent, while in Uzbekistan, distribution losses are estimated at around 13 percent. Rolling blackouts are also common across all five states during both harsh winters and extreme summer heat, with temperatures in Turkmenistan often exceeding 50° C.

Power demand continues to grow rapidly, driven by industrial expansion, but capacity additions have lagged far behind. Central Asia’s population has also risen from roughly 50 million in 1991 to about 84 million today, further straining grids. Upgrading national and regional networks, and integrating renewable energy sources to provide reliable electricity for mining, would require at least $20 billion in investment in Central Asia by 2030.

Recommendations for Strengthening U.S.–Central Asia Minerals Cooperation

Historically, the mining industry has long been a cornerstone of Central Asia’s economy. During the Soviet era, the region supplied Moscow with a wide range of minerals, including copper, coal, lead, uranium, tantalum, zinc, and rare earth elements, that supported the Soviet Union’s industrial base. Most geological exploration was conducted before the 1990s under the centralized Soviet system for mineral prospecting, and after independence, Central Asian states relied heavily on those legacy surveys to sustain output and attract investors.

In recent years, however, the region’s mining industry has been reinvigorated as governments pursue national strategies to integrate into global critical minerals supply chains. Uzbekistan has launched a $2.6 billion initiative to advance 76 critical minerals projects over the next three years, while Kazakhstan introduced a five-year development plan focused on attracting foreign investment, expanding processing capacity, and strengthening mining governance.

Western interest has also grown sharply. In 2024, the U.S. Department of State signed memoranda of understanding with both Kazakhstan’s National Geological Survey and the government of Uzbekistan. In spring 2025, the European Union committed $2.9 billion under its Global Gateway initiative to support exploration and critical minerals development across all five Central Asian states. Around the same time, France, Germany, and South Korea concluded additional agreements with Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan to conduct geological exploration and invest in early-stage mining projects.

Although the United States has found it difficult to deepen ties with a region that is both geographically distant and strategically situated between its two primary rivals—China and Russia—Central Asia will play a key role in the future of minerals security. Here are some recommendations to strengthen U.S.–Central Asia minerals cooperation.

Strengthen U.S.–Central Asia vertical integration for uranium supply chains: Kazakhstan has affirmed that it has no plans to pursue uranium enrichment in the foreseeable future—making it a valuable strategic partner for the United States, which currently produces little uranium but is rapidly expanding enrichment capabilities in New Mexico, Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky. Establishing strategic uranium production in Kazakhstan, paired with offtake agreements for enrichment in the United States, could significantly reduce reliance on Russian supply chains while bolstering the uranium availability needed to achieve the United States’ ambitious nuclear energy goals.

Engage Gulf partners to coinvest in Central Asia’s mining and infrastructure: For more than three decades, the United States has struggled to engage in large-scale infrastructure and mining projects in Central Asia beyond the oil and gas sector, a challenge driven by geographic distance and the region’s proximity to China and Russia. However, the recent strengthening of ties between Central Asian states and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries presents a strategic opportunity for U.S. engagement. Gulf partners such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, and Qatar have become active investors in Central Asia’s transportation and energy infrastructure. Recent agreements between Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan with the United Arab Emirates (UAE)’s Masdar and Saudi Arabia’s ACWA Power to develop renewable energy projects underscore this trend. Central Asian governments are eager to see a greater U.S. role in the minerals space, and joint investments with Gulf partners, whether in mining projects or supporting transport and power infrastructure, could de-risk capital flows and expand Western participation. Investing in Middle Corridor infrastructure to enable mineral shipments from Central Asia to Saudi Arabia or the UAE for refining would also shorten supply chains compared to oceanic routes, strengthening both regional connectivity and U.S. strategic access.

Partner with Japan and South Korea to modernize geological mapping and support exploration: Outdated Soviet-era surveys and decades of underinvestment have left much of Central Asia’s mineral wealth unexplored. In Kazakhstan, exploration spending in 1990 equaled the total spent between 2003 and 2023, while only 40 percent of Uzbekistan and 6 percent of Tajikistan have been geologically surveyed. Japan and South Korea, two of the region’s most consistent partners, are well-positioned to help modernize this foundation. The Japan Organization for Metals and Energy Security and the Korea Institute of Geoscience and Mineral Resources have signed agreements with Kazakhstan to advance mineral exploration, with KIGAM recently identifying sizable lithium reserves at the Bakennoye deposit and Japan’s ITOCHU Corporation joining an Uzbek-French-Japanese uranium venture in Navoi. Deepening cooperation with these trusted U.S. allies to update geological mapping and support early-stage exploration would unlock new reserves, improve data transparency, and strengthen collective engagement in Central Asia’s critical minerals sector.

Develop a skilled mining workforce through Western academic collaboration: While mining has long anchored Central Asia’s economy, much of its geological expertise has eroded since the Soviet era. The region has historically relied on Russian training, but diversifying education and technical collaboration is essential to improving competitiveness. Eight of the top ten mining programs in the world are based in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Examples such as the Colorado School of Mines planning to open an international campus in Zhezkazgan, Kazakhstan, a major copper hub, in 2026, or the S. Embassy–funded exchange program with Uzbekistan’s Navoi State Mining Institute to strengthen academic and technical cooperation, offer strong starting points for deeper U.S. engagement. Expanding such initiatives with other Western universities and training institutions would help develop a new generation of skilled mining professionals, elevate environmental, social, and governance standards, and align the region’s mining governance with Western practices, reducing operational risk and enabling deeper U.S. engagement in the region’s critical minerals industry.

Central Asia sits at the crossroads of global competition for critical minerals. The region’s abundant resources, strategic geography, and growing openness to Western partnership present an important opportunity for supply diversification. Turning diplomatic momentum into tangible outcomes will require sustained investment, coordination with allies, and the mobilization of trusted partners across the Gulf, Japan, and South Korea.

S&P Global Mobility analysts expect slower EV sales to contribute to “muted growth” in the new-vehicle market through the rest of the year.","The numbers are in—and they show that the EV market has officially started a new chapter.

Battery-electric vehicles made up just over 5% of new-vehicle retail sales in October, according to JD Power and GlobalData. That’s down more than half from September’s all-time high of nearly 13%.

The drop-off comes after the Sept. 30 expiration of federal tax credits for EVs of up to $7,500, thanks to President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill. Industry analysts and executives predicted EV sales would fall as soon as the credits went away, and October’s sales numbers back them up.

Ford’s EV sales fell by nearly 25% YoY, while the automaker’s internal combustion engine vehicle sales grew 3.4% and its overall sales rose 1.6%.

Kia’s sales ticked up slightly in October. While the brand’s electrified vehicle sales (which include hybrids) grew by 16%, some all-electric models, including the EV6 and EV9, had lower sales.

Sister brand Hyundai reported a 2% YoY sales decline in October. Sales of the all-electric Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 6 models were down.

“Hybrid vehicles led the way in October with a 41% increase, and electrified sales were up 8%,” Randy Parker, Hyundai Motor North America’s president and CEO, said in a statement. “We saw strong EV demand leading up to the expiration of federal tax credits, and while that shift has temporarily disrupted the market, we’re confident it will reset.”

Honda’s sales inched up 0.7% YoY. The Honda brand’s electrified vehicle sales (including hybrids) set a new record for the month and made up nearly one-third of brand sales, though sales of its all-electric Prologue model dropped 80% from September.

Slowdown: EV sales surged in the months leading up to the credit’s expiration, boosting the new-vehicle market.

In an analysis released before industry sales reports, data provider Urban Science reported that industry sales were down as of October 25, “driven mainly by a 43% decline in battery and plug-in electric hybrid vehicles.”

Tom Kondrat, global lead for advanced analytics at Urban Science, said he expects BEV sales “to remain behind last year’s pace through Q4 and into the early part of next year” before picking up in the spring.

S&P Global Mobility analysts expect slower EV sales to contribute to “muted growth” in the new-vehicle market through the rest of the year.

New era: Hybrids’ market share climbed two percentage points in October to 14.2%, according to JD Power and GlobalData.

“While hybrid growth is encouraging, the recent EV market correction underscores a critical lesson: consumers prefer having access to a range of powertrain options that deliver comparable value,” Tyson Jominy, SVP of data and analytics at JD Power, said in a statement. “A singular focus on any one technology—be it EVs or hybrids—risks repeating past missteps. A diversified strategy that embraces multiple powertrain solutions will be essential to meeting evolving consumer preferences.”

Jessica Caldwell, AVP of insights for Edmunds, wrote in a blog post that “October mark[ed] the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.”

And interest remains: According to Edmunds’ data, EV buyer consideration saw only a “modest” dip, from 12.7% in September to 9% in October. Going forward, Caldwell said, the EV market will be driven less by incentives and more by considerations like model variety and ownership costs.

“The ‘reset era’ will reveal which brands and retailers can make EV ownership feel not just aspirational but practical and within reach for the next wave of buyers,” she said.","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-11-05 00:18:36.022958

“Repealing the GHGRP would undermine decades of progress to ensure the EPA is collecting and publicly disclosing data to effectively address climate change and ensure American global competitiveness,” the Members wrote. “We urge EPA to preserve and strengthen the GHGRP knowing the important role it plays to protect hardworking American families and the value it has for businesses and investors.”

Since 2010, the GHGRP has collected and tracked vital greenhouse gas (GHG)emissions, such as carbon dioxide, methane, and other gases from over 8,000 sites, including landfills, power plants, and oil refineries. This rollback by the Trump Administration will strip valuable data and science needed to combat climate change, inform families of the environmental threats in their community, and eliminate good-paying jobs.

The Members continued: “It is our responsibility to protect public health, preserve our environment, and strengthen the economy of our country and our communities. The Trump Administration’s proposed rollback of GHGRP would set our country back decades and expose American families to the harmful environmental, health, and economic impacts of climate change. We demand that the EPA withdraw its proposal and strengthen and maintain a transparent and comprehensive reporting program.”

Background:

On September 16, 2025, the Trump EPA announced the rollback of the GHGRP.

For decades, the GHGRP has provided up-to-date information that EPA needs to fulfill its mission of protecting human health and the environment. The GHGRP requires reporting of GHG data and other relevant information from large GHG emission sources, fuel and industrial gas suppliers, and CO2 injection sites across the United States. This data is an invaluable resource that is relied on by federal agencies, state and local governments, businesses, the financial industry, and community-based organizations.

But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.
And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States' withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.
Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.
Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.","All nations of the world had homework this year: submit new-and-improved plans to fight climate change. But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States' withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three-tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration's policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, the U.N. Environment Program's Emissions Gap report said Tuesday.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,″ said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. ”It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise. ″

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 C (2.7 F) since the mid-1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 C (4.1 to 4.5 F), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 C (5 F) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 C (3.1 F) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.

“We are making progress,'' UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. ""We have to go faster.""

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

UNEP said the U.S. did not provide comments on the report by their deadline and asked for emissions data about the U.S. to be removed. The UNEP declined but included a footnote at the U.S. request, saying that it doesn’t support the report.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year, the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/04/PDTN/87092983007-ap-25307773257233.jpg?crop=5390,3034,x3,y468&width=3200&height=1802&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-04 18:18:26.455190

Including Rivian.

As we meander into this electric automotive world, it’s apparent that they are more expensive to make. and therefore, more expensive to sell.

While a select few companies have been able to make affordable yet adept electric cars this year, bringing the entry barrier down, some luxury brands haven’t been able to match that trend.

However, it looks like Rivian has decided enough is enough, and to avoid being priced out, a new affordable 4×4 is on the way.

Rivian CFO says no EV tax credits have sparked a new mass-market car coming in 2026

The end of the EV tax credit in America has already left some companies scrambling.

While sales rocketed in June, now they’re in freefall, and it comes as no coincidence.

At least in the eyes of Rivian, as Chief Finance Officer, Claire McDonough revealed plans for a cheaper EV in retaliation.

“One of our core strategies and approaches to offset some of the impacts of the elimination of some of the credits for consumers is to bring a product to market that opens up the addressable market of consumers that can now say yes to a Rivian,” she said.

“It meant that we needed to reduce our costs in our vehicle roadmap.

“And the key strategy for us is to bring to market a more mass-market-priced product, which is coming out next year.”

As to what this car will be, well, it’s only speculation, but Rivian officials have stated that they intend to stay away from other genres like sports cars, so another EV truck is likely.

Why the EV tax credit ending is having such an impact

With experts predicting a sharp fall-off in new electric car purchases, some brands like Ford and GM have extended an olive branch to buyers by offering their own discounts for three months.

Others have built an olive tree and made their own five-year tax credit lines.

But others haven’t been able to afford that, and it’s having a knock-on effect amid the possible insurgency of Chinese EVs.

Tesla has already released a ‘Standard’ Model 3 and Model Y, and now Rivian is following suit.

What this means is that brands are looking to make more affordable cars, but at the expense of some of the gadgets you might be used to.

The administration’s FY26 budget delivered $2 million to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for the construction and building trades in Massachusetts and also expand registered apprenticeship to more industries.
In addition, the Healey-Driscoll Administration enacted legislation to expand eligibility for the Registered Apprenticeship Tax Credit, which offers employers a $4,800 credit for each apprentice hired.
“Interest in registered apprenticeship is growing fast and our GROW grants are helping employers meet this need,” said Undersecretary of Labor Josh Cutler.
The GROW Grant will provide critical resources to strengthen these programs, expand access to Registered Apprenticeship pathways, enhance hands-on-learning, and build stronger partnerships with employers.","LOWELL — The Healey-Driscoll Administration today announced $2.1 million in Grants for Registered Apprenticeship Opportunities in Workforce (GROW) to 34 organizations to train and place more than 300 apprentices and pre-apprentices across the state. The grants, which include contract renewals and new awards, leverage nearly $2 million in state funding complemented by support from federal funds to train apprentices in high growth industries like health care, manufacturing, clean energy, and life sciences.

Registered Apprenticeship provides individuals with paid work experience including classroom instruction and on-the-job training combined with securing nationally recognized credentials, progressive wage increases, and economic mobility and advancement.

Labor and Workforce Development Secretary Lauren Jones made the announcement at Middlesex Community College in Lowell, Massachusetts. Among grantees, Middlesex Community College received $125,000 to launch a Surgical Technology registered apprenticeship program.

“The GROW grants are an effective way to expand Registered Apprenticeship opportunities that connect people to good jobs and help build a skilled workforce,” said Governor Maura Healey. “Through these investments, our administration is helping more residents access pathways into growing industries while supporting employers who are ready to train and hire.”

“These GROW grants strengthen local and regional partnerships that help employers build a skilled workforce specific to their needs,” said Lt. Governor Kim Driscoll. “By supporting registered apprenticeship programs in industries like health care, advanced manufacturing, early education, and IT, we’re creating more opportunities for Massachusetts residents to earn, learn, and advance their careers.”

The Division of Apprentice Standards (DAS) within the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development (EOLWD) administers the Commonwealth’s Registered Apprenticeship Programs. DAS serves more than 500 active programs with more than 10,000 active apprentices. Construction and building trades apprenticeships comprise the majority of programs with nearly a quarter of registered apprentices represented by expansion industries such as health care, education and manufacturing.

“Expanding and growing Registered Apprenticeship in the Massachusetts is an important part of our workforce agenda,” said Secretary of Labor and Workforce Development Lauren Jones. “The GROW awards are part of the administration’s efforts to build workforce pipelines in our in-demand industries while increasing access and opportunity for our residents to pursue a career, gain industry-recognized credentials, and secure meaningful wages and benefits.”

The Healey-Driscoll Administration is committed to expanding apprenticeship. The administration’s FY26 budget delivered $2 million to enhance diversity, equity, and inclusion for the construction and building trades in Massachusetts and also expand registered apprenticeship to more industries. In addition, the Healey-Driscoll Administration enacted legislation to expand eligibility for the Registered Apprenticeship Tax Credit, which offers employers a $4,800 credit for each apprentice hired.

“Interest in registered apprenticeship is growing fast and our GROW grants are helping employers meet this need,” said Undersecretary of Labor Josh Cutler. “Whether it’s a career in the building trades, health care, IT, manufacturing, clean energy, or education, there’s a registered apprenticeship program for that. We look forward to working with all partners to support even more apprenticeship opportunities.”

“We are so excited to work with this group of thirty-four sponsors across the Commonwealth who see the immense potential of Registered Apprenticeship to support their workforce development needs,” said Director of the Division of Apprentice Standards Lara Thomas. “Apprenticeship changes lives, and we are honored to be able to provide this support and partner with these employers.”

The following is a list of the 34 grant recipients, totaling $2.1 million and resulting in 330 apprentices and pre-apprentices:

Statements of Support

Vanna Howard, State Representative, 17th Middlesex: ""These apprenticeship grants represent a critical investment in Lowell's future,"" said State Representative Vanna Howard (D-Lowell). ""The funding will provide valuable, hands-on experiences for students. I am particularly excited about the collaboration between Middlesex Community College and Lowell General Hospital/Tufts Medicine, and the new renewable futures lab at ProjectLEARN, which will offer our youth high-quality summer learning opportunities.""

Phil Sisson, President, Middlesex Community College: “Middlesex Community College is thrilled to receive a GROW Innovation Grant from the Massachusetts Executive Office of Labor and Workforce Development to launch our new Surgical Technology Apprenticeship Program.

We are excited to strengthen our partnership with Lowell General Hospital/Tufts Medicine on this endeavor, and we look forward to equipping the Commonwealth with a highly skilled workforce.”

Tom McKeever, President, SEIU Local 888: “The leadership of SEIU Local 888 has always believed that an investment in its members is an investment in the Local. We are consistently looking for work partners to help and assist, create pathways to enhance all membership benefits. We always had designs in building out apprenticeship and pre-apprenticeship programs but simply did not know how to launch it. Secretary Lauren Jones and the staff of Labor and Workforce Development was the answer that we were looking for. Their guidance and patience help us launch a successful program that provides options and support to our members were security and predictability for the future is hard to come by these days. The pre-apprenticeship program will initially serve 35 participants, offering them a structured path to gain valuable skills and secure meaningful employment. In short, as president of SEIU Local 888 I would like to thank the committed, professional, and knowledgeable staff associated with Labor and workforce development on behalf of the Commonwealth.”

A ""squirrel"" earned its acorns as the device was used by an Indiana Michigan Power linesman to show what happens when the pesky rodents short out a transformer that makes customers lose power. The result was a jarring boom that resounded throughout the coliseum's Expo Center.

At REMC's display, two students competed by using 15-foot insulated poles while wearing insulated gloves to touch an area on a simulated power pole, which stopped a timer.

It gives the students an inside look and appreciation of what it's like for linemen to work on weekends and evenings when a power outage occurs.

Jhon Estevez, a design tech in engineering at Indiana Michigan Power, said he wanted to show students that I&M has more jobs than just lineman.

""When you think about a power company, you think electricity, that's all you're gonna do,"" he said. ""But there's people in the background who actually have to design stuff, and never ever come into contact with electricity.""

Estevez said he came to the company as a mechanical engineer with no degrees dealing with electricity.

Whether is was games with robotic ""dogs,"" seeing a pig ultrasound, or getting their hair braided, each table had something to get students' interest sparked in a career.

The third-quarter adjusted loss was 65 cents a share, the company said in a letter to shareholders. That’s better than the 71-cent average deficit expected by analysts. Rivian slashed automotive cost of revenue by nearly $19,000 on a per-vehicle basis year over year, according to the letter.

Chief Executive Officer RJ Scaringe is pushing to control expenses and corral years of losses as it prepares to launch a new midsized R2 SUV next year. The model is critical for Rivian’s goal to boost sales volumes and achieve profitability in the future. Rivian said it’s on track for R2 deliveries in the first half of 2026.

The company also said it set up a new company this month called Mind Robotics, focused on the advancement of AI-enabled robotics in industrial applications. The new venture secured about $110 million in external seed capital.

Rivan had already trimmed its vehicle-sales outlook twice this year and warned of mounting losses. The company has also seen higher costs from President Donald Trump’s tariffs while the elimination of policies supporting EV adoption have hurt revenue.

“While we face near-term uncertainty from trade, tariffs and regulatory policy, we remain focused on long-term growth and value creation,” the company said in the letter.

The electric vehicle maker expects its third-quarter delivery performance to be its best of the year.

Rivian posted third-quarter earnings on Tuesday.

Rivian Automotive posted revenue that narrowly topped analysts' expectations, after expiring electric-vehicle tax credits helped boost sales.

The company's revenue hit $1.56 billion for the September quarter, narrowly beating the $1.51 billion expected by analysts. That also marked a 78% increase relative to a year before.

Rivian (RIVN) said its software and services division brought in $416 million revenue, a 324% increase compared to a year earlier, primarily reflecting contributions from services that the company didn't perform in the year-prior period.

Automotive revenue came in at $1.14 million, above estimates that called for $1.08 billion. That was driven by the sale of 13,201 electric trucks and SUVs for the September quarter, a number the company reported a month ago. At the time, that figure came in below analysts' expectations, but Rivian noted Tuesday that the third quarter's delivery performance will likely be the strongest of the year.

Rivian shares fell by more than 5% on Tuesday before the market closed, but rose by almost 4% in the extended session after earnings were reported.

Sales are expected to slow across the EV industry in the current quarter, after consumers pulled ahead their purchases to take advantage of tax credits that expired in September. Rivian, which makes vehicles that start at more than $70,000, is expected to sell about 10,000 EVs next quarter, down from the more than 14,000 it delivered a year earlier.

The company maintained its full-year sales guidance of between 41,500 and 43,500 EVs, which it announced in August. Initially, Rivian had expected deliveries of between 40,000 and 46,000 units. Last year, it sold close to 52,000 vehicles.

But Rivian expects its sales performance to improve next year with the launch of the R2, a more mass-market friendly mid-size crossover that's expected to start at $45,000. The company said Tuesday that deliveries are on track to begin in the first half of next year.

""In Q3, we continued to make significant progress across our strategic priorities which includes R2 and our technology roadmap,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. ""Over the long term, we believe the automotive industry will be fully electric, autonomous and software-defined.""

Rivian generated a positive gross profit in the September quarter after failing to do so in the June quarter.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.
GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.
Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.
“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant and another 710 being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announce layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 17:18:40.814328

“The global economic activity generated by decarbonization is one of the greatest opportunities of this century. Canada’s Climate Competitiveness Strategy, announced by the federal government today, is a good first step toward ensuring Canada can succeed in this context. If Canada aims to double non-U.S. exports over the next decade, it will be critical to increase trade with Europe, Asia, and the Americas—all of which continue to take strong action to accelerate the shift to renewables, electric vehicles, and other low-carbon electric technologies.

“The budget proposes actions and delivery timelines to bolster Canada’s climate competitiveness—especially on core policies such as industrial carbon pricing, stronger methane regulations, sustainable investment guidelines, and tax credits for expanding clean electricity. We look forward to working with the federal government to ensure these essential policies result in more abundant and affordable energy, attract new investment to Canadian industries, support more well-paying jobs and economic growth across the country, and help make communities more secure and resilient.

“Swift implementation of climate competitiveness priorities will define how Canada succeeds or fails. In the absence of some remaining details, policy uncertainty persists, undermining Canadian firms’ ability to attract investment.”

KEY POLICY DETAILS

For the last six months, the Climate Institute has emphasized the importance of several climate and competitiveness priorities. This budget addresses each of them, with varying levels of detail:

Industrial carbon pricing:

Modernizing industrial carbon pricing remains one of the most important things the federal government can do to reduce emissions while keeping costs low for businesses and having virtually no impact on the cost of living. Doing so requires fixing problems with provincial carbon credit markets, and creating certainty around carbon markets beyond 2030 so that businesses can make big investments in low-carbon projects.

Critically, Budget 2025 makes a clear commitment to bring more certainty to industrial carbon pricing. It commits to fixing the federal benchmark (which defines minimum standards for provincial systems), improving the federal backstop (which will be decisively applied in jurisdictions that do not meet the benchmark), and developing a long-term price trajectory. The details and specifics of these changes will make or break this policy’s effectiveness, both for the climate and competitiveness. We look forward to contributing to the government’s efforts to improve this critical policy tool.

Methane regulations for oil and gas:

We support the government’s commitment to finalize enhanced rules to reduce methane emissions for the oil and gas sector. Oil and gas emissions remain a barrier to Canada’s overall climate progress and make up nearly a third of the country’s greenhouse gases. Stronger rules to reduce methane pollution would build on an impressive record of success in provinces like B.C., Alberta and Saskatchewan, and create new opportunities for Canadian companies that have been leaders in commercializing technologies to manage methane. And methane represents some of the lowest-cost emissions reductions available.

Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit:

Budget 2025 explicitly recognizes the importance of dramatically increasing investment into Canada’s electricity system, and commits to introduce legislation soon implementing the Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit to support provinces in upgrading and expanding their electricity grids, as well as enhancements to existing tax credits. We also support the decision to maintain the federal Clean Electricity Regulations, which will help accelerate the transition to clean, reliable power. Low-carbon electricity is already a major Canadian competitive advantage, and making sure electricity remains abundant and affordable will be essential for future competitiveness as demand continues to grow.

Climate Investment Taxonomy:

Importantly, the Budget recommits Canada to finalizing anational climate investment taxonomy (referred to as “Made-in Canada Sustainable Investment Guildelines”) for the financial sector by the end of 2026. The voluntary guidelines will provide much-need criteria to help investors evaluate material risks and opportunities from transition. Budget 2025 also notes the government’s intention to explore a Sustainable Bond Framework in support of issuing both green and transition bonds to be aligned with a Canadian taxonomy, further mobilizing investment to support the transition.

Electric Vehicle Availability Standard:

While Budget 2025 notes that the national Electric Vehicle Availability Standard is currently under review, we urge the federal government to maintain the core elements of the policy, to help increase Canadians’ access to high-quality, lower-cost electric vehicles. The federal government should follow through on its commitment to bring clarity and transparency to any change to the policy within the following weeks.

Resilient communities and infrastructure:

Budget 2025 makes little mention of how the federal government will support provinces and communities in making infrastructure more resilient to climate-fueled extreme weather. Investing in adaptation is not a ‘nice to have’—upgrading infrastructure for current and future extreme weather will be crucial to saving billions of dollars in costs from disrupted trade and other economic impacts, and should be a key component of any climate competitiveness strategy.

In particular, the announcement of $51 billion for a new Build Communities Strong Fund should be carefully designed to ensure that projects funded through this program do not make Canada more vulnerable to climate change. Funded projects should both strengthen resilience by building infrastructure that can withstand a harsher and more volatile climate, and avoid encouraging new development in areas that are—or will become—unsafe from threats such as flooding and wildfire.

Critical minerals:

Budget 2025 explicitly tackles some of the concerns the Climate Institute raised in our report, Critical Path, which called for policy to de-risk investment in Canadian critical minerals projects. The Budget responds to this concern by committing $2 billion dollars in a new Critical Minerals Sovereign Wealth Fund to make strategic investments in critical mineral projects and companies. This approach, if well-implemented, will unlock private investment in Canadian projects to help seize a growing opportunity in the global energy transition, while also protecting the economic security of Canadian electrification supply chains.

Indigenous housing:

Budget 2025 commits to addressing the unique and persistent housing and infrastructure challenges facing Indigenous communities. It commits to work with Indigenous leadership in developing Build Canada Homes to ensure it meets First Nations, Inuit, and Métis identified needs and priorities. It also confirms $2.8 billion for urban, rural, and northern Indigenous housing as well as an increase in the Canada Infrastructure Bank’s target for investments in Indigenous infrastructure from at least $1 billion to at least $3 billion. As it implements these changes, the federal government should work to link these actions with both reconciliation and climate objectives.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil, here is a look at China's climate commitments:

Emissions

China emits over 30% of global greenhouse gases—an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60% of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70% of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10% by 2035.

But it did not set a baseline year from which to measure those reductions and experts say China needs to cut emissions by closer to 30% from 2023 levels to keep global temperatures from rising over 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

—Renewable goals—

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30% by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36% in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles,"" which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40% of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signaled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic meters, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.
GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.
Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.
“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile.","In recent weeks, automakers and other companies in the vehicle space are pulling back their investments in electric vehicles (EVs), including laying off workers in multiple states.

The moves come in the wake of Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which repealed incentives for consumers to buy electric cars.

GM in particular is set to lay off 1,200 workers from its Detroit plant and another 550 from its Ultium Cells plant in Ohio.

Meanwhile, another 850 are being temporarily laid off from the Ohio Ultium Cells plant and another 710 being temporarily let go from an Ultium factory in Tennessee.

While those layoffs were the largest that were recently announced, they’re not the only ones.

Last month, EV-maker Rivian told staff it would let go of about 4.5 percent of its workforce. Reuters reported that this represents more than 600 jobs.

“With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions,” Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said in a note to staff seen by The Hill.

Meanwhile, Freudenberg e-Power Systems said this week it would close two EV battery facilities in Michigan, laying off 324 workers.

“We have reached this difficult decision due to the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America,” the company said in a statement.

The moves come after this year’s tax and spending bill eliminated a tax credit for consumers that brought down EV prices by up to $7,500.

The credit expired at the end of September.

GM, whose spokespeople did not immediately respond to The Hill’s request for comment, cited in a recent note to investors government policies and specifically the end of incentives as part of a need to reassess its electric vehicle strategy.

“With the evolving regulatory framework and the end of federal consumer incentives, it is now clear that near-term EV adoption will be lower than planned,” said the letter from CEO Mary Barra last month ahead of the layoff announcement.

“That is why we are reassessing our EV capacity and manufacturing footprint. The work, which is ongoing, resulted in a special charge in the third quarter, and we expect future charges,” Barra said.

Meanwhile, Shawn Fain, president of the United Autoworkers union, criticized both the company and the government.

“Last week, GM raised its expected annual profits to $13 billion dollars. This week, they announce layoffs…. The company continues to post billions in profits every year,” he said.

“Going into negotiations, we knew — and the company knew — that the electric vehicle transition was going to be volatile. The cutting of federal subsidies for EVs has only made that volatility worse,” he added.

Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive, told The Hill that federal policies, especially the end of the tax credits, are a major factor in the layoffs.

“It’s been significant in slowing EV demand,” Valdez Streaty said.

However, she also noted other factors impacting automakers more generally that may be playing a role.

“You also have tariffs that are going on. You have chip shortages…there’s [an] aluminum fire that hurt production…there’s all these different things that are going on that are just amplifying or magnifying the navigation manufacturers have to do in terms of production,” she said.

Mike Madowitz, principal economist at the Roosevelt Institute, said that while some of these layoffs could be transferred to other jobs, including equivalent jobs related to gas-powered cars, they’re coming at a tough time for manufacturing more broadly.

“It’s pretty hard to not notice that manufacturing employment has been falling basically ever since we had tariffs announced,” Madowitz said.

“If you’re making the multi-decade commitments that you do when you’re investing in auto and battery plants, you have to think harder about your ability to export stuff from America,” he added.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/06/epa_electric-vehi8cles_evs_04122023_AP23102015614330.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 21:57:44.508347

Someone is considered energy burdened if they pay six percent or more of their household income on energy costs.
The reasons for rising electricity costs vary by state, but some trends in the report can help explain why those costs may be causing older women across the country to feel more anxiety over their utility bills.
And despite Trump’s promises to lower energy bills, his landmark legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to further impact energy prices.
“It is not just the energy cost, it is the cumulative effect of all those,” she said.","Molly Mandel is on a budget. Like many others her age, the 77-year-old retiree depends on her Social Security check and a small monthly pension to cover her expenses. She only buys food that’s on sale at the grocery store. She thrifts her clothes because the prices at department stores are too high these days. “You go into Penney’s, and you look at a blouse, and it’s 24.99!” she said.

But despite all her penny-pinching, her spending is still more than she sees in her monthly checks. “I’m economizing in as many places as I can, but the inflation of almost everything I use is outpacing my income,” she said.

Now her electricity provider, Arizona Public Service, is proposing to raise her electricity bills for the third time in three years. So when the opportunity came to speak at a town hall on the potential rate hike in Sun City, a retirement community north of Phoenix, she was one of the first to share the way rising costs were already impacting her tight budgeting.

Sitting at a roundtable near the front of the room, she spoke directly to the state attorney general, Kris Mayes, who convened the meeting. “I am a retiree who lives on Social Security and a small pension, and with increases in the Medicare costs that are deducted from Social Security, the food costs, and tariff costs for almost every product brought into the United States, an increase of 16 percent seems outrageous to me,” she said.

She was one of around 40 people who had shown up to the meeting, the first in a series of town halls organized by the attorney general, after the state’s largest electricity providers announced potential rate hikes.

‘The new eggs’

For people across the country, rates are going up at a fast clip, with some experts now calling electricity “the new eggs.”

Over the last year, electricity prices have risen twice as fast as inflation. And residents in 41 states are looking at even higher costs for electricity and natural gas due to proposed rate hikes this year and next, according to an analysis by the Center for American Progress, a nonpartisan think tank.

In some states, like Arizona, the increases have been particularly stark. As Mayes noted at the town hall, “The cost of electricity in Arizona has risen faster in the past two years than in the previous nine.” The latest request would raise residential bills by an estimated $240 a year.

For Arizonans, the price increase is on top of the already skyrocketing bills residents are paying in the summertime due to extreme heat, which continues to worsen from climate change.

Utilities have various reasons for raising their rates. In Arizona, for example, an explosion of data centers is leading to a skyrocketing demand for electricity. Extreme weather, like heat and wildfires, is also straining the grid, and the need to upgrade existing infrastructure like transmission lines is raising costs for utilities.

But many utilities are also for-profit entities. Arizona Public Service, one of two utilities asking for rate increases, made a net profit of $608 million in 2024, after raising rates 8 percent last year and the year before.

The CEO of APS, Ted Geiser, has said the rate hikes are necessary to pay for needed upgrades to infrastructure and that the new rate proposal also includes a new way to charge large electricity consumers like data centers to pay for the strain they are putting on the system.

But Mayes, who formerly served on the Arizona Corporation Commission, the body responsible for approving rate hikes, is intervening in this rate case in the hopes of stopping the hike. She thinks it’s obvious that the consecutive hikes are a sign that residents are shouldering some of the cost. “I’ve never seen anything like this in my life,” she told The 19th in an interview. “I’ve been watching utilities for 25 years. I was a utility regulator, and I’ve never seen a situation like this where such incredibly profitable companies are asking residential consumers to subsidize their electricity costs.”

“Enough is enough,” she continued. “Arizonans can’t afford these rate increases anymore and the utility shouldn’t be trying to foist them on people that are already struggling.”

Who is impacted

At 77, Mandel is emblematic of the people who stand to be hit disproportionately by the rising costs: older women.

This demographic is typically living on a fixed income with less in retirement savings and Social Security benefits than men. Women over 65 are also more likely to be living in poverty than men of the same age.

Those realities are translating to worries over how to make ends meet. According to an April poll by the AARP of adults 50 and older, women were more likely to say they were concerned about their electricity bills going up over men, with 50% of women saying they were very concerned compared to 35% of men.

“High energy costs can lead to older adults having to make difficult decisions between paying for heating, cooling, medication, or food,” said Jenn Jones, vice president of financial security and livable communities at AARP, in an email. “The bottom line is stable, affordable energy helps ensure people’s safety, comfort, and health — particularly during extreme weather.”

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

The elderly are also more vulnerable to the effects of climate change. They have a harder time regulating their body temperature, making them more susceptible to heat illness, which is becoming more common due to rising temperatures.

“We’ve had multiple heat-related deaths in Arizona, and one of the reasons I am being so aggressive in these rate cases is because I am very worried that more and more folks are going to feel like they have to turn their AC off so that they can afford their bills,” said Mayes, who is currently investigating the death of an 82-year old woman who died in Sun City in May after her electricity was shut off due to failure to pay her bills.

While there are no nationwide studies on electricity burden that focus on gender and age, in August, the Gender Equity Policy Institute published a California-specific analysis, finding that women are hit hardest by rising energy costs in the state. It also found that senior women — or those 65 and older, were most likely to be energy-burdened — more than senior men and younger adults of any gender. Someone is considered energy burdened if they pay six percent or more of their household income on energy costs. The report also found that in California, the energy burden is worse for Black women and Native women.

The reasons for rising electricity costs vary by state, but some trends in the report can help explain why those costs may be causing older women across the country to feel more anxiety over their utility bills. “A lot of this goes back to the gendered inequalities that women have experienced over their whole life. They on average or more likely to have earned lower wages and accumulated less wealth. And women live longer than men,” said Nancy Cohen, founder and CEO of the institute, and author on the report. “It is understandable and pretty much predictable that senior women would experience this difficulty.”

The report also found that 31% of women-led households were energy burdened compared to 24% of men-led households and that 37% of families headed by single mothers are energy burdened compared to 28% headed by single mothers.

Trump policies

At the same time that rates are going up, policies that could make bills go down are being upended by the Trump administration. Funding to bring more clean energy into the mix, which has consistently gotten cheaper, has been gutted. Energy efficiency standards, which ultimately help consumers save money by incentivizing appliances that use less electricity, have also been rolled back.

And despite Trump’s promises to lower energy bills, his landmark legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, is expected to further impact energy prices. According to an analysis by Princeton University, the legislation, which repeals clean energy tax credits and rescinds funding for renewables, is expected to increase electricity costs by $165 a year by 2030, and up to $280 a year by 2035.

And now due to the government shutdown, the Low Income Household Energy Assistance Program, one of the few that helps low-income Americans pay their energy bills, and that prioritizes the elderly, the disabled and those with young children, is in limbo, with funding delayed.

Usually states would have received their allocation by late October or early November – 80% of which is distributed for heating costs. Now, the best estimate by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, an organization that works with state directors of the program, says that funding won’t come until December at the earliest.

According to the organization, the cost of heating a home is expected to increase by 8 percent this year, largely due to the increase in electricity prices, making the dispersal of money even more urgent.

As a result, the organization is asking utilities to voluntarily pause shutoffs for customers who don’t pay their bills. “No family should be forced to choose between heat and food because of a federal funding delay,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of NEADA, in a news release. “Utilities must act in the public interest and pause shutoffs until federal aid is available again.”

Competing costs

For older people it’s not just electricity that’s rising; health care costs are going up as well.

Margaret Mohr, a 62-year-old who also was in attendance at the Sun City town hall, is facing $800 a month premiums on her health insurance; she is not old enough to qualify for Medicare. She works part time as a licensed counselor, a job she had wanted to transition to long before she retired from law enforcement, but now it’s become the way she can afford her rising costs. “Everything goes up except income,” she said.

Even for those on Medicare like Mandel, costs are also going up. Her premiums are rising by $21 a month, a cost that eats up the recently announced cost of living increase to Social Security. Mandel also worries about the price of medications. She just got a proposal from Cigna, her healthcare provider, which would require her to cover a higher percentage of the cost of certain prescription drugs.

Mandel considers herself lucky. She owns her home and has some resources she can draw from if forced to. But she worries about people she knows who have no financial buffer at all. “It is not just the energy cost, it is the cumulative effect of all those,” she said. “Even if you have additional assets they are depleting those the longer you live.”

She herself worries she might have to relocate. “I might have to downsize, or consider moving outside the country,” she said. “But because I have so much family here I don’t know if I want to make that drastic move.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/electricity-meter.png,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:42.716035

The company also maintained its full-year loss projection, as trade wars and the loss of EV tax credits continued to be complicating factors. Rivian reiterated an adjusted 2025 full-year EBITDA loss in a range of $2 billion to $2.25 billion, with capital expenditures of $1.8 billion to $1.9 billion.

""In Q3, we continued to make significant progress across our strategic priorities which includes R2 and our technology roadmap,"" CEO RJ Scaringe said in a statement. ""We continue to believe that Rivian’s vertically integrated technologies and direct-to-customer ownership experience position our company to build a category-defining brand with a strong product portfolio for the U.S. and European markets.""

Rivian’s original 2025 delivery target was between 46,000 and 51,000.

Key to boosting Rivian’s sales is the development of the company’s upcoming R2 midsize crossover, which the company says is on track for release in the first half of 2026.

""All shops have started equipment bring-up with all lines of the R2 body shop fully installed and powered on for robot commissioning.

Swtch Energy, a Toronto-based company that provides EV charging ports for multifamily and other commercial buildings, conducted a survey in September 2024 that revealed 82 percent of North America multifamily residents lack home access to EV charging, said Carter Li, SWTCH’s CEO and founder.

“We found that multifamily residents are two and a half times more likely to own an EV if they have charging access in their buildings,” Li said. “Furthermore, they would actually pay $50 to $100 more per month for their apartment if they had access to charging in these locations. But there’s a relative abundance of what we call, ‘garage orphans,’ who don’t have access to charging where they work and live.”

Swtch has seen an increase in how many buildings have EV charging, said Li.

“I think we did a survey two or three years ago and it was 6 percent of the multifamily buildings that had access to EV charging in North America,” but he now estimates that 13 to 14 percent of buildings are currently equipped with the necessary technology.

Founded in 2016, Swtch was created when Li realized his own challenges in owning an EV where he lived in Downtown Toronto.

“The technology, the business model, everything was designed around: How do you put in charging in multifamily buildings in Downtown Toronto?” he recalled. Since then, EV adoption in Canada and the U.S. has been similar: about 10 percent of new vehicle sales. Swtch’s business is primarily U.S.-based, with a significant presence in the Northeast and California, said Li.

The growth in EV ownership, despite periods of political opposition to subsidies in the U.S. and Canada, has been a net positive.

“The rate of increase might plateau a little bit, but there’s this consistent overall increase in EV adoption,” said Li. “There might be states and provinces across North America that have higher rates of adoption due to state or provincial policies, but irrespective of that, the general trend, with or without policies, is still increasing. It’s just how quickly it’s increasing.”

EV ownership and the subsequent demand for residential charging ports is particularly strong in California, Florida and Texas, said Olga Shevorenkova, CEO of Loop Global, a Los Angeles-based company that integrates EV charging hardware and software services into residential and other commercial buildings.

“We’re seeing that multifamily is one segment where demand continues strong, because a lot of tenants would not move into the building if there is no EV charger,” said Shevorenkova. “And that’s not just California. That goes across the country.” Founded in 2019, Loop Global has about 7,000 ports — approximately 6,000 in multifamily and under 1,000 in single-family homes — across 30 states, Shevorenkova said.

As far as demand for EVs, Shevorenkova doesn’t see Trump administration cuts to EV subsidies as being a huge negative — in particular, specific cuts to certain charging portals.

“Federal subsidies, which Trump canceled or nearly canceled, were designed to support corridor charging,” she said, meaning highway charging stations. “Those fast chargers are built alongside corridors to eliminate the range anxiety of a lot of people who buy these vehicles.

But we’re not playing in that market. So that particular federal subsidy affected a lot of companies, but not ours.

“The multifamily segments still have state, municipal and utility subsidies and rebates. Those didn’t go away. Despite federal subsidy cuts, state and municipal subsidies remain strong.”

Consistent demand from multifamily owners is a big plus to providers such as Loop Global, as real estate investment trusts that own many apartment buildings look to spread good practices throughout their portfolios, said Shevorenkova.

“If you’ve done a good job for them in a few buildings, they continue to do business with you,” she said. “And it’s a very agile way to grow your revenues and adoption, versus going and knocking on every building’s door. You’re not working with a corporate structure who pushes down your solution on individual buildings.”

Loop Global’s technology, too, can work with charging stations in underground concrete multifamily garages.

“The garages have very bad reception on a cellular site, and the chargers are smart devices for 21st-century infrastructure,” she said. “They don’t work without a connection to the internet. You need the internet for billing, reporting and connectivity for the car to send the signal to the charger, and so on and so forth.”

Tapping into a building’s WiFi is a bad solution, because security wouldn’t allow it, she continued. So, Loop Global developed what it calls network access packages and connectivity infrastructure to create a local Wi-Fi network that connects all the chargers and allows for local load management.

In addition, later this year, the company plans to bring to market what it calls Infinity Link, a Bluetooth-based technology that allows the charger to go offline if there is a grid outage and then connect back to the network.

Shevorenkova also noted growing investor interest in profitability over rapid growth for EV charging companies.

“The era of, ‘I’m going to grow at any cost,’ is over,” she said. “Investors only want to invest in companies which have either reached profitability, which not that many have done or maybe no one has done. An EV charging company must have a very clear path and strategy towards getting there. We have two fantastic investors, Fifth Wall and Agility, which is a large Middle Eastern group.”

Swtch’s Li said installing EV charging ports in a single-family home is far easier than in multifamily.

“Single-family is growing for sure, because they require less of what we call managed charging,” said Li. “It’s relatively easy to put a charger in a single-family home. You just hook it up to your electrical panel and it gets included as part of your monthly electrical bill. It’s when you’re dealing with complex common shared amenities and assets that it becomes really complicated in multifamily or commercial buildings.

“People who own and operate these EV charging assets — what they call charge point operators — raise money and go in there and own and operate. So it’s a zero capex model for the people the site hosts. They don’t have to necessarily put any skin in the game.”

A firm like Swtch is different, Li said.

“We are taking on the risks because we believe in the business model, and we’ve done all the math, and everything that we understand pencils,” he said. “So this has been a much easier way for people who still want to provide the amenity for their residents and tenants, but don’t quite understand the ecosystem, don’t really understand the risks involved. We do this day in and day out to be able to take on that risk and to deploy these assets in these locations.”

Aubrey Gunnels, CEO and co-founder at 3V Infrastructure, a Manhattan-based EV charging infrastructure investor, owner and operator, said in an email that her company is tackling the challenges of single-family and multifamily installations.

“Historically, it’s been easier to own an EV if you lived in a single-family home and could install charging yourself,” said Gunnels. “We’re trying to change that at 3V Infrastructure by removing the cost and burden for property owners to offer charging to their residents. 3V Infrastructure is one of the only companies addressing the market gap in infrastructure dollars to build chargers in multifamily buildings. This removes the financial and operational barriers for property owners to offer charging as an amenity to their residents.

“As EV adoption increases, more residents expect at-home charging, and they’re willing to pay more in rent for it.”

Gunnels cited a recent survey from multifamily ownership giant Greystar. It showed that residents were willing to pay $66 a month for EV charging — and won’t rent without it.

“Even if EV penetration peaks at 20 percent, that’s still 20 percent of building residents who will expect access to charging,” she said. “Multifamily property owners can’t ignore that.”",https://commercialobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/11/EV-charging-RF-GettyImages-2164056823-WEB.jpg?quality=80&w=1200&h=630&crop=1,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:24.692291

Mike Lawler (NY-17), Don Beyer (VA-08), and Chellie Pingree (ME-01) introduced the Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act, bipartisan legislation to improve soil health on farms and support sustainable alternatives to annual agriculture. The legislation would ensure United States Department of Agriculture’s (USDA) conservation programs are better able to support farmers who incorporate perennial systems and agroforestry into their operations.

“By supporting farmers in the utilization of perennial systems and agroforestry, the Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act encourages healthy soil management – improving overall farm productivity and stimulating microbial life,” said Congressman Lawler. “This is a win for farmers, a win for the environment, and a win for American families. I’m proud to join my colleagues Don Beyer and Chellie Pingree in introducing this commonsense bipartisan bill.”

“American agriculture faces many challenges today, including harmful soil erosion exacerbated by the climate crisis’ extreme weather patterns,” said Congressman Beyer. “Our bill is a significant step to support the health and sustainability of American farms by ensuring the USDA has the resources necessary to be a strong partner for farmers who prioritize perennial agriculture and agroforestry. These practices promote soil health, which not only makes the soil more resilient to extreme weather events and erosion but also improves long-term agricultural productivity and farming’s impacts on watersheds and wildlife.”

“In Maine and across the country, farmers are on the frontlines of the climate crisis – dealing with severe drought, flooding, wildfires, and other extreme weather conditions,” said Congresswoman Pingree. “In order to make our food system more resilient and to ensure our agricultural producers survive the worsening climate crisis, we must encourage and invest in climate-smart practices. My Representatives Beyer and Lawler’s Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act does just that – promoting soil health, investing in agroforestry research and development, and incentivizing greenhouse gas reduction. Our bipartisan, commonsense bill is a win-win.”

""The Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act provides common-sense, straight-forward support for high-impact perennial practices through NRCS conservation programs. It also ensures increased technical capacity at USDA for new and exciting perennial practices through a series of agroforestry centers,” said National Sustainable Agriculture Coalition Conservation Specialist Jesse Womack. “This bill is a win for farmers committed to building soil health across their operation through plant diversity and strong, living roots.”

“Perennial and agroforestry systems strengthen soils by minimizing disturbance, maximizing living roots, and bolstering land-based carbon sinks – all while delivering benefits across biodiversity, on-farm resilience, and producer bottom lines,” said Interim Director of Policy at Carbon180 Mary Olive. “The Innovative Practices for Soil Health Act of 2025 enhances NRCS conservation programs to increase support and flexibility for US farmers and ranchers looking to implement these innovative, soil-friendly production systems. We applaud Representatives Beyer, Lawler, and Pingree for their leadership in prioritizing soil health.”

At the Battery Show North America in early October in Detroit, the Fraunhofer IWU and the automotive supplier Amsted Automotive presented an integrally designed battery housing with aluminum foam sandwiches. This is a special material structure consisting of two solid aluminum sheets enclosing an inner core of aluminum foam. Such housings can, if needed, incorporate a cooling structure or a thermal storage medium known as Phase Change Material (PCM), which stores or releases heat as it changes between solid and liquid states.

Fraunhofer IWU has successfully integrated PCM into closed-cell aluminum foam. PCM can absorb or release large amounts of thermal energy while changing its state (solid to liquid or vice versa) without significantly altering its own temperature. This makes them particularly well-suited for efficient thermal management in lithium-ion batteries.

The demonstrator presented in Detroit shows a wide range of possible serial solutions. Depending on the prioritized properties, pure AAS (Aluminum-Aluminum Foam Sandwiches), AAS with infiltrated PCM, AAS with a cooling structure, or AAS with a cooling structure and PCM can be implemented.

To ensure that battery housings made from aluminum foam are also used in mass-produced vehicles, researchers led by Dr. Thomas Hipke and Dr. Rico Schmerler are now focusing more on cost-effectiveness. A key factor in determining future manufacturing prices is the cost of raw materials. Hipke states: ""We are increasingly using recycled material to produce the aluminum foam. Not only is this significantly more cost-effective, but it also greatly reduces the CO2 footprint.""

Since 2021, electricity demand within the Texas electricity grid operated by the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) has steadily increased.

Additionally, Oklahoma Energy investors track this Texas surge because regional transmission expansion pressures cross-state planning models.

In the first nine months of 2025, electricity demand in ERCOT, which manages about 90% of the state’s load, reached a record high compared with the same period in previous years.

Therefore, peak load trendlines now drive new investor assumptions on future infrastructure scale.

Fastest demand growth among U.S. grids

Over those same months, ERCOT had the fastest electricity demand growth among U.S. electricity grids between 2024 and 2025.

Also, analysts continue to treat ERCOT load as the leading indicator benchmark.

From January through September 2025, demand for electric power in ERCOT increased 5% compared with the same period in 2024 to 372 terawatthours (TWh), 23% more than the same months in 2021.

Finally, this type of sustained sequential comp growth rarely appears in modern grid cycles.

Since 2023, wind and solar generation, especially utility-scale solar, have been the fastest-growing sources of electricity in ERCOT and are increasingly meeting rising demand.

Therefore, this structural shift restricts natural gas mid-day market share.

Wind and solar scaling in ERCOT

Utility-scale solar generated 45 TWh of electricity in the first nine months of 2025, 50% more than the same period in 2024 and nearly four times more than the same period in 2021, when utility-scale solar only produced 11 TWh.

Additionally, utility-scale solar is showing the steepest absolute lift across the entire U.S. grid fleet.

Wind generation through the first nine months of this year totaled 87 TWh, up 4% compared with the same period in 2024 and 36% since the same period in 2021.

Also, wind additions continue to support diversification across the Texas balancing mix.

Together, wind and solar generation met 36% of ERCOT’s electricity demand in the first nine months of 2025.

Finally, this composite share shift highlights the new renewable-first pathway emerging within ERCOT economics.

Note: The other category includes nuclear, hydroelectric, biomass, batteries, and other nonrenewable sources. ERCOT=Electric Reliability Council of Texas

Natural gas levels flatten

Natural gas-fired generation also increased after 2021 but flattened more recently.

Therefore, market share compression continues at the margin during primary daylight generation windows.

Natural gas-fired generation between January and September increased to 161 TWh in 2023, 24% more than the same period in 2021.

Also, this period helped establish the dominance baseline for comparison modeling.

Since 2023, natural gas-fired generation remained relatively flat, totaling 158 TWh between January and September 2025.

Meanwhile, capital rotation toward solar remains strong through ERCOT interconnection queues.

Although it is still the largest source of electricity for ERCOT, natural gas-fired generation averaged 43% in the first nine months of 2025, compared with 47% in the first nine months of 2023 and 2024.

Therefore, solar and wind scaling continue to shrink the mid-day thermal footprint.

Midday generation shift

The types of energy sources used for electricity generation can vary on an hourly basis, especially during the summer.

Also, Texas demand spikes often trigger short-term market dislocations.

Solar output is highest during midday hours, and the increased availability of solar generation in ERCOT in recent years has reduced the need for natural gas-fired generation during that time of the day.

Additionally, intraday flexibility remains the critical technical advantage.

Solar generators in ERCOT produced an average of 24 gigawatts (GW) between noon and 1:00 p.m. during the summer months of June through September compared with an average of 12 GW of solar generation at noon in the summer months of 2023.

Therefore, solar output doubling materially alters summer dispatch dynamics.

Over the same period, the share of natural gas-fired generation at midday fell from 50% in 2023 to 37% in 2025.

Finally, intraday displacement becomes central to market redesign forecasting.

Batteries emerging as a grid stabilizer

Batteries store electricity during daytime when generation from wind and solar is the highest, and they supply electricity when generation from wind and solar is declining.

Additionally, storage adds timing flexibility that directly strengthens ERCOT balancing authority.

Beginning in October 2024, ERCOT began reporting battery output separately in its hourly grid data.

Also, storage tracking now improves operational transparency for developers and investors.

In the summer months of 2025, batteries helped supply electricity in the evening as solar output declined, supplying an average of 4 GW in the 8:00 p.m. hour.

Therefore, battery deployment is now considered a major competitive reliability lever.

Forward forecast

ERCOT’s electricity demand is forecast to grow faster than that of any other grid operator in the United States through at least 2026.

Additionally, analysts across Oklahoma Energy markets now price this load trend as a baseline assumption.

In our October Short-Term Energy Outlook, we forecast demand will rise another 14% in the first nine months of 2026 compared with the same period this year, reaching 425 TWh.

Governor Whitmer Signs Bipartisan Bills to Protect Michigan’s Environment, Supporting Clean Water, Air, and Land Across the State

Other bills include lowering costs for Michigan National Guard members and cutting red tape for local governments

LANSING, Mich. – Today, Governor Gretchen Whitmer signed a bill to lower costs for Michigan National Guard members. Last month, she signed six bipartisan bills to implement the budget. These bills secured resources to support local parks and recreation projects across the state, bolstered conservation programs and protected Michigan’s land, air, and water, and cut red tape for local governments. Including today’s legislation, Governor Whitmer has signed a record 1,531 bipartisan bills into law since taking office.

""Since I took office, I’ve been committed to protecting Michigan’s environment, ensuring generations of Michiganders can explore and enjoy all our state has to offer,” said Governor Whitmer. “That’s why I’m proud to sign these seven bills into law so our departments have enough funding and support to continue programs that protect Michigan’s water, air, and land. Whether it’s maintaining a supply of clean drinking water or creating new trails in our parks, I’ll keep working with anyone to protect and defend our environment. Together, let’s get it done.”

“We must all work hard to protect the natural resources we are blessed to steward,” said Lt. Governor Garlin Gilchrist II. “These bills will ensure Michigan can continue to conserve natural resources and protect water, air, and land across our state. We’re also making a difference for the National Guard members who step up for our state each and every day. Let’s keep working together to build a bright future for Michigan families.”

House Bill 4962, sponsored by state Representative Ron Robinson (R-Utica), supports Michigan’s National Guard members by establishing a Michigan National Guard Member Benefit Fund to put more money back in servicemembers’ pockets. Specifically, the fund will help Michigan National Guard members afford childcare, health care, and tuition. The fund ensures servicemembers and their families have the support they need to make it in Michigan. HB 4962 will not take effect immediately, as the tie-barred bills have not been passed out of the legislature.

House Bill 4392, sponsored by state Representative Ken Borton (R-Gaylord), protects Michigan’s environment by allocating $41.8 million from the Michigan Natural Resources Trust Fund for 85 projects across the state. Specifically, the projects conserve natural resources and develop land to support public recreation, conservation, and accessibility. This includes protecting wildlife habitats, building new trails, improvements to parks, and more.

Senate Bill 273, sponsored by state Senator Kevin Daley (R-Lum), supports environmental conservation efforts by continuing water quality protection fees. The fees were set to expire in 2025 but have been extended through fiscal year 2029. The money collected from the fees funds environmental and conservation efforts run by the Michigan Department of Agriculture and Rural Development.

Senate Bill 574, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), amends the tobacco settlement fund allocations and helps to increase the Michigan Merit Award Trust Fund, supporting scholarships, tuition assistance programs, nursing scholarships, and other related expenses.

Senate Bill 577, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), ensures Michiganders continue to have clean drinking water across the state. Specifically, the bill extends the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy authority to charge fees for training and certifying people who operate public water systems. The fees help fund important programs that train and certify water operators, support emergency responses to drinking water threats, and monitor and protect Michigan’s water quality. Overall, this bill generates around $600,000 per year in funding for these programs.

Senate Bill 579, sponsored by state Senator Sam Singh (D-East Lansing), protects Michigan’s environment by allowing the state of Michigan to continue collecting certain environmental fees. The fees are paid by individuals, businesses, or governments when they apply for permits to build near bodies of water, discharge water into storm drains or rivers, handle hazardous waste, or get certified to operate wastewater or stormwater systems. The fees help fund important programs that protect Michigan’s environment. Overall, this bill delivers $7.6 million a year for environmental protection programs.

The roots of controlled environment certification trace back to the mid-20th century, when clean air and contamination control became essential to aerospace, defense, and nascent semiconductor manufacturing. A watershed moment arrived in 1960, when engineer Willis Whitfield introduced the modern laminar-flow cleanroom—technology that revolutionized contamination control by sweeping particles away from sensitive processes. As cleanrooms expanded across industries, the need for standardized testing grew, giving rise to methods for measuring particulates, verifying filter performance, and documenting airflow behavior.

In the following decades, international consensus matured. The ISO 14644 series (first published in 1999) provided a common language for cleanroom classification and testing. In healthcare, sterile compounding and aseptic processing accelerated demand for qualified facilities. Regulators such as the U.S. Food and Drug Administration emphasized contamination-control strategy, aseptic behavior, and the importance of robust, defensible data—work that certifiers enable through routine testing and thorough reporting.

As the field professionalized, certifiers organized around shared practices, mentorship, and credentialing. CETA (Controlled Environment Testing Association) brought together field certifiers, manufacturers, and laboratories to exchange methods, refine procedures, and champion excellence.

Texans are heading to the polls on Tuesday to decide the fate of 17 proposed amendments to the state Constitution, fill vacancies in Congress and the state Senate, and vote on scores of local offices and bond measures.

The off-year election is set to draw only a fraction of the turnout seen in typical even-year elections for the presidency and Congress, even with major referendums on the ballot affecting taxes, water, criminal justice and other areas.

As the polls opened Tuesday, more than a million Texans had already cast their ballots during the 12-day early voting period, which ended last week.

Here are three of the biggest storylines to watch on Election Day.

18th Congressional District special election

Residents of Texas’ 18th Congressional District have waited months for a special election to fill out the remainder of Rep. Sylvester Turner’s term. Turner died in March, leaving the seat vacant.

But with 16 candidates in the race, Houstonians will likely need to wait longer, with nobody expected to reach the 50% threshold needed to win outright. In that case, the race would head to a runoff early next year between the top two finishers Tuesday.

Harris County Attorney Christian Menefee and former Houston City Councilmember Amanda Edwards, both Democrats, have led most public polling of the race. State Rep. Jolanda Jones, D-Houston, was delayed in announcing her campaign while the Legislature was in session earlier this year, but she is also expected to be competitive.

While the district is heavily Democratic — having voted for Vice President Kamala Harris by a margin of nearly 40 percentage points — vote splitting among Democrats could allow a Republican candidate to make the runoff. Carmen Montiel Maria, a former Republican nominee for the seat, has polled highest among Republicans.

The 18th District has served as a launchpad for several storied Black politicians, including former Reps. Barbara Jordan and Sheila Jackson Lee — and Tuesday’s election could be the starting point for a lengthy congressional career for the winner. But redistricting has scrambled the politics of the district, whose boundaries will shift significantly come the March primary, when voters will pick the nominees for a full two-year term starting in 2027. Neighboring Rep. Al Green, D-Houston, was drawn into the new version of the 18th District and has heavily hinted he plans to run there.

The district encompasses downtown Houston and — for now — several of the city’s historic neighborhoods, including Third Ward and parts of The Heights and Acres Homes. Under the new lines, much of the 18th will be shifted to the south and northeast parts of Harris County.

Senate District 9 special election

In North Texas, two Republicans and a Democrat are facing off in the special election to fill the state Senate seat vacated by Acting Comptroller Kelly Hancock.

The winner of the special election — or any runoff election, if no candidate wins a majority of votes Tuesday — will serve out the rest of Hancock’s Senate term through the end of 2026. The seat has been vacant since Hancock resigned from the upper chamber in June.

The two Republican candidates vying to represent the solidly red district are conservative activist Leigh Wambsganss and former Southlake Mayor John Huffman. Both have touted their experience in conservative politics and pledged to focus on reducing property taxes. Wambsganss won most of the biggest Republican endorsements, including from President Donald Trump, U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz and Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick, the Senate president who has stocked the chamber with political allies. Huffman, on the other hand, has raked in millions of dollars in contributions from casino magnate Miriam Adelson and her pro-gambling groups.

Meanwhile, Taylor Rehmet, a union leader, machinist and Air Force veteran, is running a long-shot bid as a Democrat and focusing his campaign on working class interests.

The district, which covers about half of Fort Worth and much of Tarrant County’s northern suburbs, voted for Trump by over 17 percentage points last year. If a Republican wins the seat, as expected, the 31-member state Senate will be made up of 19 Republicans and 11 Democrats, with another vacant seat in a dark-red district based in Conroe to be filled in May.

Constitutional amendments

Texas voters will decide whether to approve 17 proposed edits to the state’s Constitution, with major implications for property taxes, the state’s dwindling water supply and the rules governing its criminal justice system.

Most of the proposed amendments, which will be listed at the top of the ballot, seek to reduce taxes for various groups of Texas residents. Proposition 2 would prohibit the state from collecting taxes on money earned through capital assets like investments, real estate and valuable items. It would also end a franchise tax on business trusts.

Proposition 13 would increase the share of a home’s value that can’t be taxed to pay for public schools, from $100,000 to $140,000. A Tribune calculation shows that the owner of a typical Texas home, worth about $302,000 last year, would have saved about $490 on their school property taxes under the proposed change.

Proposition 4 asks voters to approve $20 billion over the next two decades for water projects mostly aimed at addressing aging pipes and infrastructure, developing new water sources and mitigating future floods.

Additionally, two measures could alter the state’s judicial system. Proposition 3 would require judges to deny bail to individuals accused of committing specific felonies, including murder, aggravated assault and indecency with a child, if the state demonstrates that doing so is necessary to ensure public safety or the defendant’s appearance in court.

And Proposition 12 would shake up the composition of the State Commission on Judicial Conduct, a 13-member oversight group that investigates judicial misconduct. The commission is currently made up of six judges appointed by the Texas Supreme Court, two attorneys appointed by the State Bar of Texas and five citizens appointed by the governor. If Proposition 12 is approved, the two lawyers would be replaced by additional Abbott-appointed citizens, putting the governor in charge of seven appointments — a majority of the body.

Proposition 14 would create a $3 billion Dementia Prevention and Research Institute of Texas to study dementia, Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s disease and other brain-related conditions.

The Inflation Reduction Act created the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit to reward fuels with low carbon intensity (CI) scores.
It just needs rules and regulations.” From Field to Flight Ethanol already makes up about one-third of Kansas corn’s market, but the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway could push demand to new heights.
Push SAF to 10% of global aviation fuel, and even if only 1% of that is ethanol-based SAF, the number jumps to 56 million bushels.
“That’s why we’re paying attention.” “Similarly, if 10% of global aviation fuel were SAF, and 1% of that came from ethanol-to-SAF, you’d get to 56 million bushels.","Ethanol’s next chapter could power the planes of tomorrow — but only if carbon-smart farming and flexible policy take off together.

Corn may soon fuel more than cars. With airlines under pressure to decarbonize, ethanol is emerging as a promising source for sustainable aviation fuel. The technology is ready, the chemistry is proven, and the market potential is massive — but policy and timing could determine whether American farmers lead or get left behind.

The Inflation Reduction Act created the 45Z clean fuel production tax credit to reward fuels with low carbon intensity (CI) scores. The lower the score, the greater the credit. That simple equation could spark a new carbon race across agriculture, with every decision — from seed selection to nitrogen efficiency — influencing a farmer’s bottom line.

Kansas Corn’s director of policy and economics Taylor Williamson recently spoke on the topic at the American Seed Trade Association (ASTA) Forage, Turf and Conservation Seed Conference in Kansas City. He explains that race is already underway, but the rules are still unclear. He says the government’s delay in finalizing the 45Z regulations is putting growers at a disadvantage.

“If Treasury doesn’t get these rules out soon, it’ll be too late for the 2026 crop,” Williamson says. “Once the seed is in the ground, it’s too late to change your CI score.”

He believes the program could be a powerful tool to inject dollars into the ag economy if it’s rolled out in time for farmers to respond.

“This is one way to put cash into the ag economy during a time of really bad prices,” he says. “The program already exists. It just needs rules and regulations.”

From Field to Flight

Ethanol already makes up about one-third of Kansas corn’s market, but the sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) pathway could push demand to new heights. Even a small percentage of global jet fuel made from ethanol would have ripple effects across the grain economy.

Williamson breaks it down simply. If SAF could become 1% of the world’s aviation fuel, and 1%of that came from ethanol-based SAF, that would use about 5.6 million bushels of corn — roughly 10% of Kansas’ annual production. Push SAF to 10% of global aviation fuel, and even if only 1% of that is ethanol-based SAF, the number jumps to 56 million bushels.

“If an airport like Dallas–Fort Worth International Airport converted half its jet fuel to SAF made from ethanol, that’s 389 million bushels,” he says. “That’s why we’re paying attention.” “Similarly, if 10% of global aviation fuel were SAF, and 1% of that came from ethanol-to-SAF, you’d get to 56 million bushels. But when we talk about a scenario like DFW, we’re assuming a full 50% SAF made purely from ethanol.”

He says the potential for ethanol-to-jet-fuel production not only strengthens corn markets but creates a symbiotic relationship with the livestock industry. Ethanol’s byproduct remains feed grain, keeping value cycling through rural economies.

“There’s not enough used cooking oil in the world to fuel every plane,” Williamson says. “If we want real sustainable aviation fuel, ethanol has to be part of the solution.”

Flexibility Over Mandates

To qualify for the highest 45Z credits, farmers may need to meet specific carbon-reduction standards based on production practices. That could include adopting no-till, planting cover crops, or switching to enhanced nitrogen fertilizers. Williamson says the intent is good, but the approach risks being too rigid.

“Don’t tell us exactly how to do it,” he says. “Just give us a number, give us the data, and we’ll go do it.”

He says although Kansas is known as The Wheat State, its plentiful corn farmers know better than anyone that what works in one field may fail in another. Eastern Kansas often benefits from cover crops that improve soil health and water retention. Western Kansas, with half the rainfall, can’t often afford to sacrifice moisture to a cover crop stand.

“Cover crops work in some places and not in others — and that’s okay,” he says. “Not all farmers, especially in Kansas, farm the same way.”

Williamson argues that flexibility, not prescription, will determine whether the program succeeds.

“You can’t accomplish your goal unless farmers can make it work for their bottom line,” he says.

Seeds of a Low-Carbon Future

The carbon-intensity push is already influencing conversations far beyond ethanol. Seed developers are exploring hybrids with better nitrogen efficiency and improved residue management. Agronomy teams are looking at how microbial products, stabilizers, and data analytics can cut emissions. Ethanol plants are developing traceability systems to verify the carbon profile of each bushel they buy.

Williamson sees this as a defining moment for the seed value chain — a chance to link genetics, agronomy, and markets in a measurable way. He believes farmers are ready to adapt, as long as risk and reward are balanced.

“Farmers aren’t afraid to innovate,” he says. “They just need to know a government program won’t put them out of business if they take a chance.”

For now, he says everyone is waiting on Washington. The potential for ethanol to power the planes of tomorrow — and for farmers to get paid for lowering carbon — hinges on clarity that hasn’t yet landed.",https://www.seedworld.com/wp-content/uploads/AdobeStock_1614423625-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-04 17:01:01.299935

The company, Vulcan Elements, announced the deal in a press release Monday in which it said, in total, the partnership involving the government will result in $1.4 billion dollars for it and American-based refiner ReElement Technologies to scale its domestic magnet supply chain.

Specifically, the firm, based in Research Triangle Park, North Carolina, said the fresh funds will allow it to build a new facility in the U.S. and increase magnet production to about 10,000 metric tons a year, with a “focus on recycling end-of-life magnets and electronic waste.” ReElement Technologies, it added, will be able to expand its recycling and processing capabilities with the new cash.

A press release from the Commerce Department’s National Institute of Standards and Technology said the federal government signed a “non-binding” letter of intent to provide $50 billion to the company. The funds, according to the department, are set to be used for Vulcan Elements to purchase equipment for the production of domestic Neodymium Iron Boron magnets specifically, which it notes “have significant commercial and defense applications,” including for semiconductor manufacturing, robotics, industrial motors, electric vehicles, drones, fighter jets, nuclear submarines, satellites and more.

The money comes from the bipartisan CHIPS and Science Act, championed by Democratic former President Joe Biden and passed by Congress when he was in office. As a result of the investment, the Commerce Department is set to take $50 million of equity in Vulcan Elements, according to the government press release.

Along with the $50 million from the CHIPS program, the Defense Department will offer a $700 million conditional loan. ReElement Technologies will also receive an $80 million loan from the Office of Strategic Capital, Vulcan Elements said in its press release.

Additionally, the firm noted that as part of the overall deal, the loan to ReElement Technologies is being matched by a private investment while Vulcan Elements is also receiving $550 million in private capital.

“Accelerating Vulcan Elements’ rare earth magnet production is strategic to the United States and will have profound ramifications for industries including semiconductors, AI data centers, defense, aerospace, and automobiles,” Michael Grimes, executive director of the U.S. Investment Accelerator, said in a statement with the announcement from the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

The move marks the Trump administration’s latest effort to bolster critical mineral supplies in the U.S. to rely less on China, which processes nearly 90% of the world’s rare earths, according to the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

Last month, President Donald Trump hosted Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese at the White House to sign a new critical minerals deal, and the president inked several new agreements on the matter with nations on his trip to Asia last week.

The topic has also loomed over recent trade tensions between the U.S. and China, with Trump threatening to place significantly higher tariffs on Beijing if it moved ahead with its announcement to place new export controls and restrictions on access to its rare earths. But China agreed to delay those new policies — and the U.S. said the same for its higher tariff rate — following a closely watched meeting between the countries’ two leaders in South Korea last week.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/Rare_earth_AP_23026825512861_NAT_0823,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:20.308268

“My top priorities are energy affordability for New York consumers and making sure the lights stay on,” Governor Hochul said. “The Zero Emission Tax Credit program is a prime example of how the state was able to take a federal tax credit and turn it into needed energy savings for ratepayers while at the same time supporting clean and reliable electricity generation in the state.”

The ZEC program was created by the New York State Public Service Commission in 2016 to compensate the four Upstate nuclear plants for their zero-emissions power. Under the program, any benefits received from the federal nuclear production tax credit (PTC) enacted in 2022 are required to be passed along to ratepayers.

Constellation Energy owns or controls the four operating nuclear power reactors, located across three facilities, including Ginna, Fitzpatrick, and Nine Mile. All three facilities are located along the southern shore of Lake Ontario. The federal nuclear PTC now being claimed by Constellation Energy will result in a $151 million benefit to electricity consumers in New York State.

New York State Public Service Commission Chair Rory M. Christian said, “When the Commission initiated the ZEC program, it recognized that the program could be adjusted in the future if the federal government later provided financial support for nuclear power facilities. Today, we are seeing this in action through the nuclear production tax credit. This important federal support helps ensure New York’s plants can continue to provide clean electricity while offering significant cost-savings to New Yorkers statewide.”

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “New York utilizes a diverse set of resources, including its existing nuclear fleet, to support the State's continued energy security and ensure a clean, reliable and abundant energy system that is also affordable. The federal tax credits and broader support for nuclear energy are critical as we continue to explore potential applications of advanced nuclear technologies through our Master Plan process.”

This announcement builds on a series of affordability actions Governor Hochul’s Administration has taken to help New Yorkers manage energy costs:

Adopting an Enhanced Energy Affordability Policy (EEAP) that expands energy bill discounts to an additional 1.6 million New York households below state median income that do not currently qualify for low-income assistance. The EEAP is a landmark step forward in supporting energy affordability and ensuring that more New Yorkers — including both electric and gas utility customers — can afford to keep the lights on, their homes heated and cooled, and their families safe.

Redirecting funding to protect consumers, with $360 million in surplus funding from New York’s distributed solar program, NY-Sun, used to offset costs in the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority’s energy efficiency and building electrification portfolios by 24 percent in 2026 through 2030. The Commission further reduced program costs borne by ratepayers by an additional $340 million in 2025 and 2026, while expanding access to low-income participants.

Expanding funding and access for low-income participants, through the Commission’s May 2025 Energy Efficiency and Building Electrification (EE/BE) Orders for low and moderate income (LMI) and non-LMI consumers. The Commission increased funding levels from 20 percent of the historical EE/BE budgets under the Clean Energy Fund to 30 percent for LMI consumers. This is an annual increase of $132 million to LMI EE/BE programs, including a nearly $50 million annual increase for the EmPower+, program compared to previous spending levels.

Reinforcing consumer protections through stronger performance standards and enforcement authority. Since 2021, Governor Hochul’s administration has secured roughly $214.4 million from utility shareholders for the benefit of ratepayers.

Conducting management and operations audits to identify areas where improvements are needed to maximize ratepayer value. Governor Hochul directed the Commission to initiate the Comprehensive Management Incentive audit, which is examining incentive management compensation practices across the State’s electric, gas and water utilities. For the first time, this review will evaluate multiple utilities’ management compensation programs concurrently, rather than in isolation, and expand oversight to companies that have not previously been subject to this level of review. The audit aims to ensure that compensation is directly tied to performance metrics that improve service, reliability and affordability for New Yorkers. This audit will provide critical insights into best practices and identify areas where improvements are needed to maximize ratepayer value.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2024-04/electric-grid-power-lines.jpg?h=05130931&itok=7OvQ6Jlc,N,,2025-11-05 12:13:24.856187

Geothermal energy production requires three key components: surface water and shallow groundwater seeping deep toward the Earth’s heated interior.","EDITOR’S NOTE: In the final installment in our series on geothermal energy, its availability in the West and the implications in Greater Yellowstone, Madison Dapcevich looks at the future of geothermal sites in Montana, sparking interest, and marrying the technology.

Montana State Hospital in Warm Springs has a long history of psychiatric treatment. Predating statehood in 1889 by 12 years, the state’s only public psychiatric hospital has served some of the Rocky Mountain West’s most vulnerable populations. But it was resource intensive and costly to heat water for the patients. Then, in the mid-20th century, the hospital began piping water from a natural hot spring was piped into the area for use in laundry and shower facilities. Since at least the 1980s, Montana has eyed the hospital for its hydrothermal and geothermal potential.

Water has historically been pumped to the state hospital from the nearby Fairmont Hot Springs, a 152-room resort 15 miles south that utilizes naturally heated water to warm its purported healing pools and buildings. Recently, private companies have been exploring the feasibility of installing geothermal power systems near the springs to generate electricity and pump hot water, reducing heating costs for local residents.

John Metesh, director of the Montana Bureau of Geology and Mines, says his agency is currently creating an inventory of geothermal sites around the state to do so.

“This begins by looking at data from oil and gas wells because these sites are very deep, and companies exploring for oil and gas can afford to conduct exploratory drilling,” Metesh said. “They’re drilling into geothermal formations to extract gas. So, the bureau looks at the data compared with seismic activity and geophysics data to build out maps of geothermal areas.” Between six and eight sites in Montana show potential to be transformed into geothermal power facilities, he added, one of which is the Montana State Hospital.

A previous estimation conducted in 2000 by Metesh and his colleague Jodey Kougioulis identified five areas that could be considered for geothermal development, including those near Bozeman, Ennis, Butte, Boulder and Camas Prairie.

Similar programs exist around the state. In 2020, Romney Hall at Montana State University launched a geothermal energy system, which efficiently cools and heats campus buildings and reduces their reliance on fossil fuels.

Aside from geothermal energy production through power plant facilities, hydrothermal features allow hot water to be pumped to nearby communities. Since the heated water is already close to the surface, it can be used as a hot water and energy source.

The Montana Bureau of Mines and Geology estimates roughly 150 springs and wells of low to moderate temperature could serve as potential geothermal resources, most of which are found in the southwestern part of the state. These abundant resources put the Treasure State in a unique position to become a major geothermal energy producer, particularly as its temperature extremes contribute to its place among the top five states with the highest per-capita energy consumption, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Currently, coal accounts for 45 percent of Montana’s in-state power generation and about 30 percent of total U.S. coal production.

But like other alternative power generation proposals, Metesh says the reality of switching to geothermal energy comes down to the simple economics of its production cost versus its benefits.

“As traditional power costs increase and co-location of sources and transmission/use improve, geothermal will become more attractive, but the cost of [geothermal] production still needs to decrease,” Metesh said. “Montana, in general, has moderate potential for commercial geothermal in two broad categories: eastern Montana geothermal systems related to oil and gas development, and western Montana fault-controlled valleys.”

The Bureau of Geology and Mines is now conducting a new survey to identify potential geothermal sites across the state and has published the raw data on its website. In addition to pinpointing well locations, the Bureau of Geology and Mines is also cataloguing the geochemistry of known geothermal areas and their aerial geophysics, such as magnetism or radiometrics, which allows for a subsurface view of the Earth without needing to drill.

“It’s giving us a good idea of where we can narrow down the areas to look and eliminate some of the other areas – some of these formations are warm, but not quite hot and are at a lower threshold than what we’re looking for,” said Metesh, who estimates that the report will be out next year.

Geothermal energy production requires three key components: surface water and shallow groundwater seeping deep toward the Earth’s heated interior. There, fluid warms to high enough temperatures to rise in fault lines as either hot water or steam, eventually reaching the surface. In shallow geothermal features like hot springs, accessing heat is relatively easy. But deep heat sources, those 10,000 feet and beyond, require large drills to access.

Current efforts by the Bureau of Mines and Geology pull available data from oil and gas exploration wells and seismic data indicative of fault-line fracture zones to “define and assess subsurface geology in areas that demonstrate higher-than-background temperatures.”

Angela Seligman, senior geoscientist at the nonprofit environmental organization Clean Air Task Force, notes that since extraction methods have recently improved, power plants can more easily access deep geothermal energy and produce energy from lower temperature resources more efficiently.

“We would like to think that all regions are thinking about geothermal energy as an important source of reliable electricity that is available 24/7,” Seligman said, “and that is also clean in terms of having little to no air pollutants like sulfur dioxide, particulate matter and greenhouse gas emissions.”

Metesh is optimistic about finding sites in Montana, sparking interest, and marrying the technology.

“As population grows and as demand for energy certainly grows, I think geothermal is going to become more and more important,” Metesh said.

NextStar Energy, Canada’s first large-scale lithium-ion battery manufacturing facility, is expanding its operations with the launch of energy storage system (ESS) battery production starting this November. This new production line, added to the existing electric vehicle battery manufacturing, will be based in the Windsor facility, a key site for the company’s industrial expansion.

A new direction towards the energy storage market

NextStar Energy is incorporating Lithium Iron Phosphate (LFP) chemistry into its production, a technology particularly suited to large-scale energy storage needs. This strategic move complements the existing Nickel Manganese Cobalt (NMC)-based battery production, used mainly for electric vehicles. By offering both chemistries, NextStar is well-positioned to meet the growing demand in the ESS market while continuing to supply its partners LG Energy Solution and Stellantis for electric vehicle batteries.

The global energy storage market is experiencing strong growth, driven by increased demand for grid stability and the rise of AI-powered data centers. This expansion is seen as a strategic opportunity for NextStar to strengthen its presence in the energy storage and electrification technologies sector, particularly in North America.

A local response to global industrial challenges

In addition to the vehicle battery production capabilities, the Windsor facility has added equipment dedicated to energy storage. To support this expansion, NextStar has invested in advanced technical training for its employees. Over 1,000 people have been hired to date, many of whom have participated in the “Battery Boost” program, developed in partnership with Invest WindsorEssex and Palette Skills. This program combines virtual reality simulations and hands-on training, tailored to the energy storage industry’s requirements.

Danies Lee, CEO of NextStar Energy, emphasizes that the company’s ability to rapidly respond to market demands reflects its flexibility and commitment to sustainable innovation. Thanks to a highly skilled team, the company is ready to begin mass production in the coming weeks.

The solar plants are expected to generate over $100 million each in combined state and local taxes and about 300 jobs during peak construction, Treaty Oak said.
State regulators and local parish governments must also approve each of the solar plants.
So far in 2025, Meta has signed agreements to purchase more than 3 gigawatts of solar power from U.S. companies.","Facebook parent company Meta will contract to purchase power generated at two new solar energy plants in Louisiana, a move that will help power the company’s new $10 billion data center and meet its long-term climate goals.

Meta has signed an agreement with Texas-based Treaty Oak Clean Energy, a builder and operator of utility-scale solar and battery storage projects, to supply power generated at the 200-megawatt Hollis Creek Solar Plant in Sabine Parish and the 185-megawatt Beekman Solar Plant in Morehouse Parish. The plants will deliver a combined 385 megawatts to the local grid in Entergy‘s territory in northeast and west central Louisiana, Treaty Oak said in a statement.

While Meta will purchase the renewable energy credits associated with the two plants, the electricity produced will help power the social media giant’s new AI data center under construction in Richland Parish. As part of its strategy to reach net-zero emissions by 2030, Meta typically either purchases carbon removal credits or invests in renewable power projects connected to the same grid as its data centers and offices.

Urvi Parekh, Meta’s head of global energy, said the solar plants will bring clean energy to the local grid. “When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid — and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that, while also helping match our operations with clean energy while contributing to local energy resilience and economic growth across Louisiana.”

The announcement follows the Louisiana Public Service Commission’s approval in August of a settlement with the Southern Renewable Energy Association, Walmart, the Sierra Club and others that allows Entergy to build three new natural gas generation plants and transmission facilities to power Meta’s data center, as reported by The Center Square.

As part of the settlement, Entergy committed to the expedited procurement and certification of up to 1,500 megawatts of solar or hybrid power, which Meta will use to help meet its clean energy targets. Entergy also agreed to update its request for proposals process for renewables to include wind energy.

Meta’s Richland Parish data center is expected to consume about 2,000 megawatts of power when it goes online, with its electricity demand potentially reaching as much as 5,000 gigawatts.

The solar plants are expected to generate over $100 million each in combined state and local taxes and about 300 jobs during peak construction, Treaty Oak said. The company expects to bring both solar facilities into service in the third quarter of 2027. State regulators and local parish governments must also approve each of the solar plants.

Treaty Oak, a portfolio company of Macquarie Asset Management, began construction on a 100-megawatt solar power plant in Arkansas in October 2024 and expects to begin producing clean energy in the first or second quarter of 2026.

Macquarie Asset Management is one of the world’s largest infrastructure managers with more than 105 gigawatts of green energy assets currently under development or in operation. On Oct. 23, Louisiana regulators approved a 200-megawatt solar plant near Bogalusa in Washington Parish being developed by Galehead Development, a subsidiary of Macquarie Asset Management.

Meta has contracted to purchase power generated at solar facilities in other states as well. The company agreed on Oct. 27 to purchase 600 megawatts from a large solar farm near Lubbock, Texas, which will feed the local grid beginning in 2027. So far in 2025, Meta has signed agreements to purchase more than 3 gigawatts of solar power from U.S. companies.

To meet a pledge to be “water positive” by 2030, Meta has vowed to restore more water than it uses in its operations, and earlier this year the company committed to a reforestation and wetland treatment project at Bayou Pierre in the Red River watershed, near the company’s data center site in northeast Louisiana.

Meta is partnering with Houston-based Resource Environmental Solutions to improve water quality in the watershed through the restoration of a 316-acre cattle pasture to native forested upland and wetland habitats, according to Meta’s website. The company estimates the project will restore 36.1 million gallons of water annually to the Red River watershed.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/11/5.-Depositphotos_solar-panel.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:44.407087

Last week, Carolyn Fortuna had an interesting article on Kamala Harris. Within that article, Harris had a quote that asked an important question: “Why. Didn’t. I. Separate. Myself. From. Joe. Biden?”

Overall, the most obvious answer to that question was that she didn’t have much time. Introducing ideas takes time, especially when you are busy trying to introduce yourself to people. Getting those people to understand those new ideas takes more time. Getting them to see the implications is not quick or easy. Candidates tend to listen to polls for what people want now and then repeat it back to them. Staying the course is easier.

But we have time now. Time before the next presidential election. Time to explore new ideas. People have time to wrap their minds around them. We have the time to change course. Time to explore how to separate ourselves from the past and take a new path into the future.

Trump’s simplicity clearly reveals flaws in approaches that might have been less noticeable with a more moderate execution. Opinions are shifting against Trump’s policies, especially regarding trade. We can further expose bad policies. We can create contrast with better policy. Leaders have an opportunity to lead on policy ideas, even if they are not yet in power to execute them.

We also are free to separate ourselves from Biden. Blind loyalty does not help. We are free to criticize. The election is over. We do not have to debate whether distancing ourselves helps Trump. People can still support their team while policy evolves. Holding onto bad policy out of loyalty hurts us going forward.

Which gets to another article by Steve Hanley on trade. Whether or not you think anyone can truly win a trade war, the US is clearly losing. Tariffs are being taken up by a the Supreme Court this week, which could have a long-term impact not only on trade, but also on presidential powers. A shift in direction on trade could differentiate from the disfunction and lead to better overall policy moving forward.

Protectionism Increases the Price of Cleantech

Tariffs increase prices. Not just when a Republican is in office. When those tariffs target cleantech, they raise prices compared to fossil fuels and legacy industry. Subsidies can only partially compensate. Despite the “Inflation Reduction Act,” the net effect was increased US prices with trailing renewable energy and EV adoption rates.

In the US, we pay over three times as much per watt on solar panels compared to China. That price does not count the 45X transferable manufacturing tax credits that also add up to more than the total cost of solar panels in China. Those tax credits continue under Trump, even though the 30% residential consumer tax credit is going away at the end of the year. With a change in trade policies, solar panel prices could be closer to Europe.

The average transaction price for EVs in the US in August was $57,245, according to Kelley Blue Book, which is more than three times BYD’s average selling price of $16,700 for 2024. Those are not apples to apples metrics, as BYD’s number was the price of vehicles sold to dealers, rather than the retail price. However, even when factoring in the $7,500 tax credit, our prices were still far more than double. Now, the rising protectionism on materials and components and the elimination of consumer subsidies are poised to make EVs even more expensive. Many manufacturer subsidies also continue for EVs, including the $45/kWh Battery Production Tax Credit, but we are not meaningfully closing the price gap. Trade has the potential to drop EV prices below legacy fossil-fueled vehicles.

Increasing the price of cleantech has economic consequences. For solar, the bulk of jobs are associated with installation and implementation. Multiplying the cost of the critical enabling component impacts net jobs. Most of the economic and environmental benefit from clean technology comes from the decades of usage, rather than the initial manufacturing. Increasing the price of clean technology slows adoption and the resulting usage. That perpetuates fossil fuel use and extractive economic models. That put us on the wrong path in the long term.

Politics of Protectionism

Biden and Trump are easily the two most protectionist US presidents since Herbert Hoover. There is a simplistic “us vs. them” mindset behind protectionism that doesn’t appreciate the increased value creation that accompanies increased value exchange between countries. Trade is not a zero-sum game. Hoover’s protectionist policies amplified the Great Depression, which taught an economic lesson the hard way. Many people, unfortunately, forgot that lesson. The continued inflation of prices under Trump will likely lead to a painful reminder.

Among Democrats, Biden was the most protectionist President in the two-century history of the Democratic Party. There are relatively few policies that extend from the pre-Civil War Democratic Party through to the post-Civil Rights Democratic Party other than an aversion to tariffs. There have been some outlier policies, like LBJ’s chicken tax, but other Democratic presidents removed more trade barriers than they added. Biden also issued more sanctions than any prior president of either party. There is potential to differentiate from both Biden and Trump.

Not that free trade is a purely Democratic idea. The intellectual conservative movement, with people like Ayn Rand and William F. Buckley, supported free trade. Republicans after WWII saw the economic errors of Hoover and tended to support free trade with an overall bipartisan consensus. Up until Trump. I know Republicans who would like a return to more intelligent trade policy. There is also an opportunity for a Republican who decides to distance himself from the obvious destruction Trump is creating.

Trump started a love affair with tariffs that Biden accelerated. Biden being more protectionist in action than Trump’s first term but less protectionist than what Trump proposed for his second term did not create much contrast. Having a nuanced presentation on the same policy direction does not create a lot of differentiation either. Trump has taken protectionism to new levels in his second term. With enough time, Harris could have differentiated herself with support of free trade, rather than just continuing a slower protectionist escalation. If Harris had the opportunity to communicate a policy focused on increasing trade to support cleantech adoption and accelerate progress, the contrast would be even more significant.

Own Being Smart

At this point, many are probably thinking that what I just suggested would be political suicide. The common assumption is that there is no way that our populist politics based on personal attacks and soundbites would support rational policies. Xenophobes will persist in their ignorance. Bigotry will perpetuate its fallacies. But maybe. Just maybe. We are not giving people enough credit.

Maybe, if we take the time to talk to people in terms they can understand, they will start to understand the concept. Jargon and acronyms can be avoided, but full sentences and logic are good things. Simply parroting back what pollsters say voters already believe might get agreement. But it is not evolving the beliefs that can evolve policy.

A leader should lead people to a better path forward. Elections should not just be a popularity contest or a contest of insults. Pandering to the most ignorant elements of society can be effective in drumming up votes in the short term, but it really does not set up a competition that educated Democrats are positioned to win long term. A more intellectual approach could turn some people off. However, were those people ever going to strongly support a highly educated, mixed-race female lawyer in the first place?

So, own it. Take the smart position and take the time to explain that position. Republicans can also take smart positions with a more conservative approach. We can have intelligent debates from different perspectives. We have time before the next presidential election to shift the narrative. And many people are already realizing that there is something wrong with Trump’s policies, such as protectionism. A little guidance can help people to understand what is wrong. Taking a slightly less stupid position does not create contrast. Try being smart.

We can take a smart position on trade. And that is just one of several ways that we can pursue smarter policy moving forward.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/green-shipping.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:59.103336

“Texas once again emerges as the national champion for the top business climate in America,” said Governor Abbott. “As the eighth-largest economy in the world, Texas offers the freedom and opportunity for companies of all sizes and all industries to thrive. Coupled with the pro-growth, pro-business laws I signed this year, Texas improved the process of doing business to help them succeed in our great state. We will continue to make strategic investments and partner with job-creating businesses to ensure that Texas remains the top state in the nation to do business.”

Driving Texas’ top ranking is a powerful combination of factors: the number of job-creating corporate relocation and expansion projects, a pro-growth mindset and environment where enterprise can flourish, investments in workforce development and infrastructure, access to technology and tech talent, and a predictable regulatory landscape.

Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue.
Gates noted his personal funding of both climate change and public health efforts are increasing.
If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates told reporters, according to The Associated Press.
Gates, in the Monday interview, pushed back on climate scientists who suggested he was setting up a false dichotomy between mitigating poverty and addressing climate change.","Billionaire philanthropist Bill Gates on Monday defended his call to refocus the climate debate on prioritizing human welfare.

In an interview with Axios n Monday evening, in front of about 1,000 students at the California Institute of Technology, Gates stood by the controversial memo he released last week, in which he argued that climate change is a serious problem but will not bring about the end of civilization. He also urged the world to focus more on preventing human suffering than on limiting rising temperatures.

“I’m glad people are listening,” Gates said at the event, noting it’s difficult to convey “nuanced positions nowadays.”

Gates has faced significant backlash from all sides of the climate debate since releasing his controversial memo on Oct. 28. Many conservatives have characterized the memo as a backpedaling of the pro-climate agenda.

“I (WE!) just won the War on the Climate Change Hoax. Bill Gates has finally admitted that he was completely WRONG on the issue. It took courage to do so, and for that we are all grateful,” Trump wrote on his Truth Social platform last week.

But Gates, at the Monday event, pushed back against that take.

“It’s a gigantic misreading of the memo,” Gates said of Trump’s view and similar sentiments. Gates noted his personal funding of both climate change and public health efforts are increasing.

“I didn’t think the memo was going to convert the non-believers into believers, and sure enough, it didn’t convert them,” Gates said at the event.

At a roundtable discussion with reporters ahead of the memo’s release, Gates recognized that the “tough truths about climate” contained in the memo were likely to be controversial.

“If you think climate is not important, you won’t agree with the memo. If you think climate is the only cause and apocalyptic, you won’t agree with the memo,” Gates told reporters, according to The Associated Press. “It’s kind of this pragmatic view of somebody who’s, you know, trying to maximize the money and the innovation that goes to help in these poor countries.”

In the memo, Gates criticized the climate community for focusing too much on near-term goals to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, diverting resources from effective ways of improving lives and mitigating suffering today.

Gates, in the Monday interview, pushed back on climate scientists who suggested he was setting up a false dichotomy between mitigating poverty and addressing climate change.

“What world do they live in?” Gates said, noting many foreign aid budgets must choose between climate and public health. “This is a numeric game in a world with very finite resources, more finite than they should be.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/08/AP24260763800896-e1754390789918.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:43.735659

[xxiv] Our Mission and What We Do, U.S. EPA, https://www.epa.gov/aboutepa/our-mission-and-what-we-do (last accessed Oct. 22, 2025) [https://perma.cc/5WZE-95C9].","Blog by: Emma Carlo

Following a change in presidential administration, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is asking the U.S. Court of Appeals in a civil suit to rescind, and therefore weaken, regulations regarding safe drinking water.[i] These regulations addressed the presence of six specific short-chain chemicals called PFAS which are known to increase an individual's risk of cancer and other health risks such as kidney and liver damage, harm to reproductive systems, and cardiovascular diseases.[ii] The danger of these chemicals is evident by the fact that even low levels of the chemicals can still cause adverse health risks.[iii] Importantly, more than 70 million people utilize water systems with PFAS levels that are above the safe limit.[iv] Additionally, these chemicals, also known as “forever chemicals,” are known to take upwards of thousands of years to breakdown in the environment.[v] Instead of maintaining the existing regulations for PFAS chemicals, the newly proposed regulations will only filter out two types of the PFAS rather than all six of the ones regulated by the prior administration, hence leaving the country at risk for drinking water with higher levels of contamination than what is considered safe.[vi]

This action is demonstrative of the trend towards deregulation currently happening within the EPA.[vii] Where the core of this action is hidden under the guise of improving efficiency, the true purpose is one of corporate favoritism and allotting more power to the chemical industry, rather than a true concern for regulatory burden or the country’s health.[viii] This action revealed that the current administration and utility companies have put a price on the cost of safe drinking water for the public.[ix] The estimated $800 million cost of implementation to filter out PFAS is considered too expensive in protecting public health and has instead been characterized as an economic burden.[x] Moreover, environmental advocates characterize this action as wealthy industries taking advantage of the relationships they have with the administration.[xi]

The current limits on PFAS were recently imposed by the prior administration through an action which environmental advocates counted as a win both for the health of the people and the planet.[xii] Specifically, these limits, known as maximum contaminant levels, set the legal standard as to how much of these chemicals can be allowed in drinking water and still be considered safe.[xiii] This action was the first ever limit to be imposed on such chemicals and were expected to reduce exposure to them for over 100 million people, of which would have prevented 9,600 deaths as well as 30,000 illnesses.[xiv] While the water utility companies were set to fulfill these regulations and fully complete them by 2029, by loosening the reins on regulation the EPA risks severe delay and even potential elimination of safer drinking water as a whole.[xv] Unfortunately, this dangerous choice suggests the conclusion that $800 million is worth more to utility companies and the EPA than the cost of 9,600 lives saved by more stringent safety requirements on drinking water.

Despite the current administration promising to provide clean water and better environmental protection, it also promised fewer and looser regulations.[xvi] As such, there will be less regulations regarding not only drinking water, but greenhouse gas emissions, car emissions, and clean-up standards for coal plant waste.[xvii] The contradictory nature of promising safe and clean drinking water while reversing important regulations that would guarantee it has led many activists to call the EPA a mockery as this deregulation will continue to place the health of Americans and the environment in jeopardy.[xviii] Deregulation of clean drinking water as proposed by the EPA will eliminate or delay desperately needed protection for over 100 million people with water that has contaminants well above the safety standard.[xix]

However, not all hope is lost in the fight against PFAS. Many environmental nonprofit organizations have already filed suit against the EPA, countering the deregulation as a violation of the Safe Drinking Water Act.[xx] Generally, this Act provides an anti-backsliding provision which prevents the EPA from repealing or weakening regulations once they are established.[xxi] Thus, to get around this provision, the EPA is asking the court to repeal this regulation on the grounds that it was improperly enacted.[xxii] The decision of the court rests on whether the regulations were properly enacted as per the Safe Drinking Water Act or whether they were improperly enacted on a procedural basis.[xxiii]

Ultimately, in attempting to deregulate safe drinking water, the EPA has proven to be an oxymoron. This current attempt at deregulation does not align with their mission of wanting to “protect human health and the environment,” but is indicative of avoiding expensive implementation costs.[xxiv] Unfortunately, the EPA does not seem to prioritize the very thing they were created to protect and made a costly decision which will adversely affect the health of America.

,Indiana and Evs,2025-11-04 20:02:08+00:00,Los Angeles Times,Musk's partisan actions cost Tesla more than 1 million car sales - Los Angeles Times,"Michael Hiltzik, www.latimes.com, michael-hiltzik",,,,,https://www.latimes.com/business/story/2025-11-04/musks-right-wing-politics-cost-tesla-more-than-1-million-car-sales,"A new study from Yale researchers has put meat on that bone.
Tesla sales rose in Republican areas after that break, but not enough to offset the Democratic decline.
The partisan divide in EV sales has been widely studied.
In both periods, overall EV sales in the U.S. rose, by 7.3% last year and 11.7% through the third quarter this year.
The Yale researchers took pains to distinguish those factors from the Musk effect by matching auto registrations to county-level Democratic and Republican votes.","If you’ve spent any time on a California freeway, you’ve probably seen an increasing number of Tesla cars on the road bearing anti-Musk bumper stickers.

“I bought this before we knew Elon was crazy,” reads one. “Eco-friendly, not Elon-friendly,” reads another. Some bear Elon Musk’s name or image with a bright red slash through them.

Those defensive messages would seem to validate the reasonable expectation that Tesla Chief Executive Musk’s foray into partisan politics — specifically, far-right politics — has sapped the appeal among Democrats and liberals for a product that once proclaimed its owners’ commitment to the fight against global warming and other progressive policies.

A new study from Yale researchers has put meat on that bone. They found that Musk’s partisan behavior has cost Tesla as many as 1.26 million car sales since October 2022. That’s when Musk acquired the social media platform Twitter and gave greater access on it to the far right and other extremist voices.

Musk intensified his partisan journey during the run-up to the 2024 presidential campaign, when he heavily funded Donald Trump’s reelection campaign, and after Trump’s inauguration, when he launched the DOGE service, which strewed chaos throughout the federal government by instituting mass layoffs purportedly in the name of budget-cutting.

What the sales numbers say is that “it’s probably not a good idea to alienate your core constituency with extracurricular political activities if you’re a CEO,” says Kenneth T. Gillingham, an economics professor at Yale’s School of the Environment and lead author of the paper.

The Yale researchers’ analysis of sales figures show that Tesla sales were stronger in Democratic-leaning counties than in Republican counties — until October 2022, when they began to plateau in Democratic areas and then began to fall. Tesla sales rose in Republican areas after that break, but not enough to offset the Democratic decline.

The partisan divide in EV sales has been widely studied. Republican and conservative car buyers have never been a target market for EVs generally, and Teslas particularly.

The Yale study also found that overall EV sales in the U.S. continued to rise after October 2022, benefiting non-Tesla makers of EVs and gas-electric hybrids at virtually a one-to-one rate—those products gained by about 1.26 million sales above what they would have been without the Musk effect.

I asked Tesla to comment on the Yale findings, but haven’t received a reply.

The Yale study points to the effects of CEO outspokenness for good or ill, especially when their topics have little or nothing to do with their companies’ direct interests. It’s one thing to go public with concerns about corporate taxes or tariffs, quite another to divagate into divisive political issues such as global warming or anti-LGBTQ discrimination.

The researchers also point to the Musk effect’s implications for public ecological initiatives, notably California’s EV policies. California’s official target is for 25% of new vehicle sales be for zero emission vehicles next, and 100% by 2035. But ZEV sales have stalled out, according to recent figures.

“The 2026 target was set when Tesla was rapidly increasing its sales,” Gillingham told me. “Without the Musk effect, it would have been easily met. Now it looks unlikely.”

In part that’s because buyers who formerly would have opted for a Tesla have shifted to other brands, but are choosing hybrids, which don’t meet the EV sales standard, rather than full electric models.

The study comes just as Tesla shareholders are scheduled to vote on a pay package for Musk with an estimated value of $1 trillion. The vote will come at the company’s annual meeting Thursday.

As I reported, that pay package treats Musk as the sole indispensable figure in Tesla’s future. But although the Tesla board members who approved the pay proposal described the milestones Musk must meet to collect the full value, the standards have been tweaked to make them more achievable than they appear on the surface.

Whether Tesla shareholders will ever come to see Musk as a drag on the company rather than its savior isn’t currently clear, but with Tesla stock trading at a meme-level price-earnings multiple of about 320 and a market value of more than $1.5 trillion, that epiphany plainly hasn’t occurred yet.

The effect that CEOs’ political excursions have on their companies’ fortunes has been debated for years. The common conclusion is that it depends on whether their statements and positions align with those of their core customer base, or flout them — whether they will “bolster brand loyalty or trigger a backlash against the CEO’s company, as Aaron K. Chatterji of Duke and Michael Toffel of Harvard wrote in 2016.

Chatterji and Toffel examined the impact of several CEOs’ criticisms of Indiana’s Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 2015, which expanded the ability of defendants in civil lawsuits, including those alleging discrimination, to cite their religious beliefs as justification for their actions.

Among the law’s public critics was Apple CEO Tim Cook. Chatterji and Toffel found that Cook’s statement that the law might foster anti-LGBTQ discrimination reduced public acceptance of the law significantly, and even increased the popularity of Apple products. Other corporate leaders have spoken out in favor of international initiatives to fight global warming.

Such forthright commentary about current events and issues are rare, however. The reason may be that it’s difficult for a high-profile executive to keep track of the shifting winds of public discourse; what may appear to be a popular position at one time can draw brickbats as public opinion evolves. Corporate interests may also outweigh the desire to be heard on issues of public concern.

In recent years, many corporate leaders pledged to stand firm against right-wing assaults on voting rights, access to women’s reproductive healthcare, diversity and democracy itself.

Many companies initially promised to end or review their campaign contributions to the 147 Republican lawmakers who voted against certifying Joe Biden’s 2020 election victory over Trump. Over time, as it happened, many resumed their contributions.

Toyota, for instance, continued to contribute to some of those politicians, explaining that it “supports candidates based on their position on issues that are important to the auto industry and the company ... We do not believe it is appropriate to judge members of Congress back on their votes on the electoral certification.”

How CEO comments are received by their presumed audience can depend on their context. Salesforce CEO Mark Benioff was long regarded as an echt San Francisco liberal billionaire. But last month he came out in favor of deploying the National Guard to patrol the city’s streets, evidently aligning himself with Trump’s militarization of local law enforcement.

Clearly, Benioff didn’t read the room. His statement caused a furor, prompting some entertainment figures to drop out of Salesforce’s annual tech conference, Dreamforce, causing the prominent venture investor Ron Conway to resign from a Salesforce philanthropic board, and culminating in Benioff’s apologetically withdrawing his suggestion.

Musk is a unique personage in the CEO ranks, as the Yale researchers observe — “the world’s wealthiest person and CEO of the most valuable automaker by market capitalization.”

Tesla’s sales pattern is also unusual in terms of the EV market. The company’s unit sales in the U.S. fell year-to-year in 2024 (by 5.5%) and through the third quarter of this year (by 4.3%). In both periods, overall EV sales in the U.S. rose, by 7.3% last year and 11.7% through the third quarter this year.

Tesla has faced a raft of challenges not directly related to Musk’s personal behavior: an aging product lineup, competitive models from Hyundai, Audi, GM and Ford, and the Edsel-esque sales flop of Musk’s pet project, the Cybertruck.

The Yale researchers took pains to distinguish those factors from the Musk effect by matching auto registrations to county-level Democratic and Republican votes. They found that “more Democratic counties show an increasing propensity to purchase Teslas over time prior to October 2022.” After that point, the trend reversed.

By the first quarter of this year, they found, without the Musk effect, Tesla monthly sales would have been about 150% higher than it was. From October 2022 through the first quarter, they calculated, the lost sales totaled 1 million to 1.26 million vehicles, or 67% to 83% of actual sales during the period.

Over the same time frame, sales of EVs and hybrids by Tesla’s rivals gained 17% to 22% due to consumers rejecting Musk, providing “a clear example of very significant adverse impacts on corporate performance due to the social and political decisions by one of the world’s best-known CEOs.”

The Yale paper suggests that Musk may be too well-known to be good for Tesla. His identification with the company has long been crucial for its success and for its high-flying stock price. The new study suggests that Musk has turned, at long last, into a negative.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/20f40ec/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5390x2830+0+382/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F82%2F2c%2Feba036fe40b0b290e86da0d56353%2F1497888-me-tesla-drivers-betrayed-by-musk-5-gmf.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:36.236039

2,000 Miles for 2 Years

The offer (see Tesla’s current offers here) says that trading in an old car for a new Tesla will result in 2,000 free Supercharging miles. That’s a nice thing to have for long-distance travel, especially considering the size of the Supercharging network.

The “Supercharging miles” must be utilized within two years of delivery, or they will expire:

“Terms & Conditions

Promotion requires completed trade-in of a gas or hybrid vehicle and is subject to change or end at any time. Supercharging miles expire two years after delivery date and cannot be postponed, assigned or redeemed for cash. Supercharging-related fees, like congestion fees, still apply. Used cars and B2B sales not eligible. Promotional miles may be revoked if the trade-in cannot be completed for any reason. Actual miles may vary and is dependent on factors like driving behavior and environment. Terms and conditions apply.”

What Models?

Tesla already offers Free Lifetime Supercharging for the Model S and Model X as part of the Luxe Package (standard on all versions). The same concerns the top-of-the-line Tesla Cybertruck Cyberbeast.

This means that the latest incentive will only apply for the Model 3, Model Y, and regular Cybertruck AWD. These are less expensive Tesla EVs, so the incentive is also much smaller compared to Free Lifetime Supercharging.

The Value of Free Supercharging

It’s always tricky to estimate the value of free Supercharging. The prices of energy vary significantly between states, and there are different use cases.

If we assume a Tesla Model Y with an energy efficiency of 3.5-4 miles/kWh, then 2,000 miles should result in 500-571 kWh. The numbers might be slightly lower for the Model 3, and noticeably higher for the Cybertruck AWD.

We are not sure how Tesla calculates the number of kWh a user should get (most likely based on the EPA test cycle), but assuming 570 kWh and roughly $0.40/kWh, the incentive’s value is $228. It might be closer to $200 for the Model 3 and closer to $350 for the Cybertruck AWD.

That’s a relatively small perk, good to have when switching to an EV, but definitely not a game-changer.",https://evchargingstations.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Group_51-3x-Model-Y-Perf.-Premium-and-Standard.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:28.719677

Meanwhile, intense opposition has hounded similar projects, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success. But Tallgrass’ Trailblazer pipeline is being praised because of community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing the gas before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles of pipe and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. The South Dakota Legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit stated.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations like a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was sent to a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska. His home is half a mile from the pipeline.

Tallgrass benefited from working with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost said.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold Nebraska, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://djcoregon.com/files/2025/11/1105_Pipeline_Infrastructure_WEB.jpg?_t=1762284559,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:15.403101

Katie Stuart, D-Edwardsville, that aims to reduce electric bills, create jobs and strengthen Illinois’ electric grid.

“Homes and businesses across my district are being forced to spend far too much on rising energy costs,” said Stuart. “This legislation will provide immediate short-term relief while making strategic investments in clean energy to secure lower consumer energy costs long term.”

Many Illinois residents have seen home energy costs skyrocket. Increased power demands from new high-tech businesses and Washington’s massive tax bill threaten to raise costs even further.

In an effort to combat these rising costs, highlights of the Clean and Reliable Grid Affordability Act (Senate Bill 25) include:

– Virtual Power Plants: By capturing clean energy already being generated as surplus power by home solar panels and other green sources, better coordination through virtual power plants can redistribute energy across the system and lower costs for all consumers. This change is expected to reduce bills by up to $4.34 per month for Ameren users.

– Increased Battery Storage: Adding battery storage will make the grid more reliable and affordable, further acting as insurance for the system. This improvement is expected to lower bills for Ameren customers by up to $8 each month.

– Energy Efficiency: By expanding and investing in energy efficiency programs, Ameren consumers are expected to save up to $1.41 per month.

The measure will additionally create up to 115,000 jobs, counteracting job insecurity and layoffs caused by the federal budget bill—including 50,000 manufacturing jobs projected to be lost in Illinois. As utility demands increase during the fall and winter months, Senate Bill 25 will play a significant role in meeting the state’s energy needs, strengthening reliability and helping manage untenable costs for customers for both short- and long-term relief.

The European Union's member states have been haggling for months over two separate targets for slashing greenhouse-gas emissions: one for 2035 they must bring to the UN climate talks, and the other for 2040.

""This is a crucial day,"" French Environment Minister Monique Barbut told reporters in Brussels -- warning that turning up empty-handed at the November 10-21 talks in Brazil's city of Belem would spell ""disaster"" for the EU.

Behind only China, the United States and India in terms of emissions, the EU has been the most committed of the major polluters to climate action and has already cut emissions by 37 percent compared to 1990 levels.

But after blazing a trail, the EU's political landscape has shifted right, and climate concerns have taken a backseat to defence and competitiveness -- amid concerns in some capitals that greening Europe's economy is harming growth.

""It's very, very difficult,"" said an EU diplomat, summing up the state of play in Brussels late Tuesday.

Denmark, which holds the bloc's rotating presidency, was understood to be working hard to win over Italy, one of the countries most sceptical of the proposed targets.

The most urgent challenge for ministers is to reach a unanimous deal on an EU emissions target for 2035, known as a Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), which Paris Agreement signatories are supposed to bring to the COP30.

""I want our heads of state and government to go to Brazil with a very strong mandate, a clear leadership role for Europe,"" German Environment Minister Carsten Schneider declared on arrival -- saying the decision must be ""today"".

Beyond the Belem target, the EU hopes to lock in the support of a weighted majority of countries for the next big climate target set out by the European Commission on the path to carbon neutrality by 2050.

The EU executive said in July it wanted to cut emissions by 90 percent by 2040, compared to 1990 levels -- a major step towards net zero.

But the bloc's capitals have yet to endorse that next step, which would require sweeping changes to industry and daily life at a time of growing concern over adverse impacts on Europe's economy.

Spain and the Nordic countries support the 2040 proposal, as does Germany, with some caveats. But Hungary, Poland, the Czech Republic and Italy remain opposed, citing risks to their industrial sectors.

Heavyweight France, meanwhile, has kept observers guessing on its position -- demanding guarantees its nuclear sector would not lose out under green transition plans and wiggle room on emissions should Europe's forests absorb less carbon than expected.

- 'Not pretty' -

To win over the staunchest sceptics, Tuesday's talks were covering a range of ""flexibilities"" for member states, including letting countries count carbon credits purchased to finance projects outside Europe.

A commission pledge for credits to account for up to three percent of a nation's 2040 emission cuts failed to win over hardliners, with countries pushing for a higher threshold of five percent.

Some also want the overall objective reassessed every two years.

Regarding the 2035 target for Belem, EU countries in September agreed to a non-binding ""statement of intent"" for the bloc to cut emissions by between 66.25 percent and 72.5 percent by 2035.

To avoid deadlock just days before COP30, ministers are expected Tuesday to formalise that range as the bloc's legally binding NDC under the Paris Agreement.

Environmental groups have accused states of undermining the bloc's climate ambitions with loopholes.

But a diplomat involved in the process defended the compromise shaping up in Brussels, while conceding it was ""not necessarily pretty"".

""In the muddy, messy, nasty real world out there, we are trying to achieve something good,"" said the diplomat, granted anonymity to discuss the sensitive deliberations.

The EU insists it remains committed to its role as global climate leader, having mobilised 31.7 billion euros ($36.6 billion) in public climate finance in 2024, making it the world's largest donor.

Bridging the electric vehicle divide in America Electric vehicle adoption in the United States certainly isn’t uniform.","As the U.S. accelerates towards a future of innovative transportation, not all states are keeping up. The rate of electric vehicle adoption across the country is more varied than many realize and is often shaped on a state-by-state basis by state policies, ability to deploy infrastructure, and economic or demographic factors. With some states surging ahead and others lagging behind, it’s crucial to map and analyze the differences to understand how to close the gaps.

Using data from the Department of Energy, state transportation agencies, and the third quarterly electric vehicle report by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, The General has put together a guide to help you navigate these trends.

The leaders: Top states driving EV adoption

As outlined within the Alliance for Automotive Innovation Q3-2024 electric vehicle report, some states are already recording remarkably high electric vehicle shares among their new auto sales. Other states are going even further, boasting significant electric vehicle fleets compared to their population.

Many West Coast and Northeastern states are leading the charge. However, the data also shows an interesting statistic: The highest state has only 5.8% adoption of electric vehicles in operation. This goes to show that despite the rapid evolution of technology, its adoption is still in its infancy.

California: The undisputed champion

California is the undisputed champion of electric vehicle adoption across the United States, holding the aforementioned 5.8% total electric vehicles among those in operation. This value amounts to over 1.8 million vehicles. Part of this is due to the fact that, as outlined in the report, the Clean Air Act allows California to set stricter emissions standards. This has incidentally led to accelerated growth of the market, in addition to the state’s long history of electric vehicle incentives and dense urban markets.

Washington: High per-capita performance

Washington also ranks as a top performer in the country, with 3.1%, or over 219,000, of their total vehicle fleet being made up of electric vehicles. While they are ranked fourth on a percentage basis, they are second only to California on a number basis. They are also one of the six states that adopted the ACC II ZEV mandate that goes into effect with the 2026 model year, which effectively prohibits the sale of new gas-powered vehicles.

Vermont: Small state, big impact

Vermont is special, not because it rivals California and Washington in terms of the number of electric vehicles in operation, but because of its market penetration. As outlined by Visual Capitalist data from the end of FY23, Vermont had one of the highest electric vehicle registration rates per 100,000 residents at roughly 1,100.

Falling behind: States struggling with EV adoption

While some states are surging ahead, others are still facing issues. There are more reasons than one for why a state may be lagging behind, but below are some of the key trends:

Mississippi: Lowest adoption in America

At 0.21% based on the Alliance for Automotive Innovation data, Mississippi has the lowest adoption rate in the country. It also has one of the lowest rates of electric vehicles per charger across the country at a meager 14, ranking it near the bottom for electric vehicle adoption in more ways than one.

Rural state challenges

One key challenge for electric vehicle adoption lies in the demographics of certain states. Small, dispersed, or lower-income states can sometimes face additional issues. Take the following three states, for instance:

North Dakota: North Dakota is the 48th most populated state and has a population density of only 11 people per square mile. Building out a charging infrastructure is expensive, and doing it for such a low population density can only exacerbate the issue.

Wyoming: Wyoming faces the same issue as North Dakota, with an even lower population and population density based on the same World Population Review Report. With few electric vehicles and limited grid connectivity given the space between people, adoption lags.

Arkansas: Unlike North Dakota and Wyoming, Arkansas has a larger population. However, the appetite for electric vehicles in the state has been cited as being low, particularly due to the rural nature and distance between potential charging sites.

Key factors driving the divide

There are some common barriers to entry for the electric vehicle market. It’s worth taking a deeper dive into three of the most prominent:

State policies and incentives

The states leading the charge are those that are pairing strong incentives with regulatory mandates. Six states adopted the mandate limiting gas-powered sales starting in 2026. Based on the same data source, an additional six signed up to start in the 2027 model year.

Beyond this, state policy extends further. California has 48% more electric vehicle chargers than gas nozzles now, demonstrating the investment in the technology. Other states more towards the bottom of the list simply aren’t matching this investment.

Charging infrastructure distribution

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation report also tells an interesting story regarding electric vehicles per public charger across the U.S. Buyers won’t commit to an electric vehicle without realistic access to a charging port, and the difference in charging density across the country is vast.

New Jersey, Illinois, Oklahoma and Hawai‘i rank at the bottom of electric vehicles per public charger. States that have a higher electric vehicle to port ratio face a greater potential strain and wait time at those sites, de-incentivizing purchasing such a vehicle.

Demographic and economic influences

Beyond state policy and infrastructure, there also could be socioeconomic conditions at play. The average transaction price for an electric vehicle sale in August 2025 was nearly $60,000, based on Kelley Blue Book data, which is no small sum. For states with smaller populations and less developed economies, the average salary range may put this price point far out of reach for the time being.

Looking Ahead: Future trends and implications

Continued investment into programs such as the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure plan outlined by the Department of Energy will be crucial to the future of the market. Another factor that will inevitably shape the market will be the cost of technology utilized in the construction of electric vehicles, as a reduction could bring the entry price point down far enough for more state populations to partake. Overall, though, it will take widespread state policy changes to ensure there is a reliable electricity supply and smart charging available to service electric vehicle fleets as they develop.

Bridging the electric vehicle divide in America

Electric vehicle adoption in the United States certainly isn’t uniform. While states like California, Washington, and Vermont are leading the charge, others are lagging behind due to socioeconomic and political factors. These reasons aren’t mysterious, and the right mix of policy changes and investments in infrastructure can make a significant dent. As the nation continues to adopt cleaner transportation, ensuring no state is left behind will be critical to the development of a nationwide electric vehicle infrastructure.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/rpaPjeQLGzykNhVguBWx2g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/stacker_642/587000606d8bc5446b789a9ab2ff3044,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:18.816270

Rivian’s expected gross loss is $39 million.","Rivian and Lucid entered this week’s third-quarter earnings with investors watching every dollar, every unit, and every forecast cut.

Rivian reports after the bell today, and Lucid follows on Wednesday, and both companies expect higher revenue and smaller adjusted losses, helped by what analysts say was likely the peak of U.S. EV sales before federal credits disappeared in September.

But the bigger story is the pressure ahead: shrinking margins, reduced production guidance, and a policy environment that just made life harder for “pure-EV” manufacturers.

RBC analyst Tom Narayan said, “Both of these are really challenged,” adding that in the near term, “it’s all about the underlying profitability.”

That profitability is exactly where the cracks show, because Rivian has already cut expectations for 2025 gross profit and adjusted earnings, while Lucid faces similar margin strain.

Both of these guys are trying to convince their current and potential investors that they have long-term plans worth sticking around for, but in an era of tight competition, they’re finding that harder than it used to be.

Credit cuts, tariffs, and changing policy reshape revenue outlooks

The Trump administration this fall removed the federal EV purchase incentive of up to $7,500 and also ended penalties for automakers who fall short on fuel-efficiency targets.

RJ Scaringe, Rivian’s CEO, said during the company’s last earnings call that the policy changes are “complex and rapidly evolving,” and will affect both performance and cash flow.

Rivian had expected $300 million in regulatory-credit revenue this year; that is now closer to $160 million. The company also lowered its gross profit forecast from a modest gain to roughly breakeven and carried out layoffs to cut expenses.

Tariffs are adding more pressure. Rivian said tariffs are costing the company “a couple thousand dollars per unit.” Lucid reported that tariffs hit its margins by $54 million in the second quarter.

Mark Delaney of Goldman Sachs said the loss of Inflation Reduction Act credits could create a “double-digit percent headwind” for industry sales. Tesla, also a seller of regulatory credits, reported credit revenue dropping 44% in the third quarter, from $739 million to $417 million.

The third quarter was the high-water mark for EV demand before credits expired. Barclays analyst Dan Levy warned that it’s unclear how long the slowdown that follows will last, saying Q3 likely marks “the highest” U.S. EV market penetration for some time.

Rivian delivered 13,201 vehicles in Q3, a 32% increase from last year. Lucid delivered 4,078 vehicles, a 47% rise. Yet both remain unprofitable.

Rivian is expected to report a quarterly loss of $0.72 per share on $1.5 billion in revenue, compared to a $0.99 loss on $874 million last year. Rivian also now projects a core loss between $2 billion and $2.25 billion for 2025. Analysts have questioned its goal to reach EBITDA profitability by 2027.

Lucid is expected to report a $2.27 adjusted per-share loss on $379 million in revenue, nearly 90% growth from last year, but still with a gross loss of $255 million. Rivian’s expected gross loss is $39 million. Rivian shares are down less than 5% this year. Lucid shares are down roughly 45%, after a 1-for-10 reverse split.

New models and tech partnerships aim to prove future demand

Rivian is leaning hard on its upcoming R2 midsize vehicle, targeted at roughly $45,000 and scheduled to begin production in the first half of next year.

But many of Rivian’s competitors plan similar-priced midsize EVs with longer ranges, so you get why Wall Street is questioning how many units Rivian can realistically sell.

Rivian has a $5.8 billion software and electrical architecture partnership with Volkswagen, and the company has been promising that its next-generation system will support advanced driver-assistance features since at least Q1 2025.

Meanwhile, Lucid’s interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said their upcoming Gravity SUV and a new midsize platform, saying the company is “pushing the boundaries of what EVs can be.”

Lucid signed a $300 million deal with Uber in July to deploy 20,000 Gravity SUVs equipped with autonomous technology from Nuro over six years.

But Winterhoff admitted on Tuesday that:- “We are not where we want to be with Lucid Gravity production relative to our target at this point in the year. We believe we will significantly increase production in the second half of the year.”",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Lucid.webp,N,,2025-11-04 15:04:49.112639

NEW BEDFORD — As the assembly line of turbine towers standing at the quayside of the staging terminal peters out, Vineyard Wind has more than doubled its power production, according to the latest federal data, even as the Trump administration keeps trying to shut down the offshore wind industry.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released the latest data on electricity sold by Vineyard Wind on Oct. 31. In the third (and latest) quarter, July through September, the project sold approximately 136,000 megawatt-hours of energy, up from 57,000 in the second quarter.

What does that mean for Massachusetts residents? The under-construction project sold enough electricity this summer to power an estimated 50,000 homes, up from about 33,000 in the spring, The Light calculated. (Depending on the residential consumption over a month or year, the homes-powered estimate can vary by thousands.)

Vineyard Wind and state officials say the project will power up to 400,000 homes when completed. The company declined to comment on the latest figures, which it reported to the federal agency.

The project is producing power from about 50% of its turbines as of October, according to an Oct. 28 report from Iberdrola, the project’s parent company. It’s an increase since July, when company officials said 17 turbines were generating nearly 30% of the project’s power.

What’s left?

More than two years since it sent the first set of turbine components out from the Port of New Bedford, Vineyard Wind has at most five of its 62 turbine towers left to install as of the end of October.

At the start of October, a Vineyard Wind spokesperson said the project was delivering at a capacity of 400 megawatts, or about half of the 806-megawatt project.

Satellite images from late October reviewed by The Light, which capture the project’s expansive white blades popping against the atmospheric view of the Atlantic, showed at least 56 towers were standing. Most of the towers have blades, but several don’t.

Vessel shipments suggest 57 towers may now be in, but more recent satellite images are not clear or capture clouds covering the lease site.

This week, vessel trackers show the installation vessel, the Sea Installer, near the location for a turbine that was shipped out on a barge in recent days, suggesting the installation of the 58th tower is underway.

In September, Vineyard Wind had only 10 “loadouts” to go, meaning 10 more barge shipments that usually — though not always — contain three blades, two tower pieces, and one nacelle.

It’s not clear whether workers will complete installation by the year’s end, as Iberdrola projected this summer. Construction usually slows in the colder seasons, which brings with it stronger winds and seas.

If Vineyard Wind doesn’t finish by December, the project has another six months on its lease to utilize the state’s commerce terminal.

New Bedford’s Marine Commerce Terminal, previously packed with blades, nacelles and towers for Vineyard Wind, has grown sparse. Blue metal cages that once hugged the components are now empty and stacked, waiting to be shipped out.

After all 62 towers are installed, work may continue with the help of a second specialized installation vessel, the Wind Pace, which has been at work removing blades and taking them to Canada as part of the government-mandated response to the July 2024 blade failure. The new replacement blades have been coming from a French factory.

In October, the terminal took in three vessel shipments from France, altogether carrying more than 20 blades, as well as a shipment of tower components. Meanwhile, one vessel carrying at least four blades set course for Canada, according to Port Authority vessel alerts and images shared by West Island Weather Station.

Vineyard Wind, 15 miles south of Martha’s Vineyard, is Massachusetts’ only offshore wind farm currently under construction and generating power.

New England Wind 1 and SouthCoast Wind, two other Massachusetts wind projects that intend to base some operations or construction out of New Bedford, face mounting delays due to the Trump administration’s opposition to the industry.

The Trump administration is looking to remand critical permits for those two Massachusetts projects. From January through September, the administration took more than 20 actions against multiple offshore wind projects (and the industry at large) through numerous agencies.

Revolution Wind, contracted by Rhode Island and Connecticut, is also under construction to the west of Vineyard Wind. Its developer, Orsted, is using New London, Connecticut, as its staging area. Sunrise Wind, another Orsted project, is in earlier stages of construction. Orsted completed a 12-turbine farm, South Fork Wind, last year.

Estimating homes powered

According to the FERC report, Vineyard Wind 1 produced about 136,200,000 kilowatt-hours of energy in the last quarter, which spanned July, August and September.

Using recent U.S. Energy Information Administration data, which captures monthly residential consumption only up to August of this year, The Light estimated about 50,000 homes powered for just the months of July and August. During this period, the average household usage was about 760 kilowatt-hours in Massachusetts.

Usage is often higher in the summer, as that’s when people are running their air conditioners. It’s greater than the monthly average calculated over a year, which was 580 kilowatt-hours in 2024.

Using the lower, year-round figure, The Light estimates Vineyard Wind sold enough energy to power up to 78,000 homes.

ISO New England, the grid operator, publishes data on what resources are powering the grid at any given time. However, the company does not disclose the electrical output of specific projects, citing “confidentiality rules.”

Capacity figures

The project’s 806-megawatts figure represents the nameplate capacity, which is the amount of energy a project could generate if its turbines ran 100% of the time at optimal wind speeds.

In reality, a wind turbine’s output ranges, affected by wind speeds and downtime for maintenance; it varies on a given day, week, and month; and it underpins an important concept: capacity factor. If a 100-megawatt project has a capacity factor of 50%, it produces 50 megawatts on average.

Offshore wind projects have a capacity factor ranging between about 40% and 50% (sometimes a bit higher). It’s comparable to the rates achieved by coal and natural gas plants, per federal data.

Vineyard Wind has not provided details on the project’s capacity factor thus far. A 2020 construction and operations plan for the project listed a capacity factor “in excess of 45%.”

Generally, capacity factor increases in the winter, when wind speeds are higher. Because of seasonal variability, this metric is best calculated over the course of one year.

It’s likely that once Vineyard Wind reaches full power, the FERC electricity reports will vary by season.",https://newbedfordlight.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/1387.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:42.953903

DETROIT — Challenges are mounting for all-electric vehicle manufacturers Rivian Automotive and Lucid Group as the companies try to sell investors on a brighter, more profitable future to come.

But things could get worse before they get better as both automakers are set to report third-quarter results this week, starting with Rivian after the bell Tuesday, followed by Lucid on Wednesday.

Both ""pure EV"" companies are expected to report notable growths in revenue and narrowed adjusted earnings losses amid record third-quarter U.S. EV sales. But investors are also expecting the manufacturers to give updates on future growth opportunities as well as impacts from more challenging market conditions.

""Both of these are really challenged,"" RBC Capital Markets analyst Tom Narayan told CNBC during an interview, saying he's cautious about much near-term upside for investors. ""To me, it's all about the underlying profitability.""

Both automakers have already cut vehicle production guidance due to more challenging market conditions, while Rivian also has negatively changed its adjusted earnings and gross profit expectations for 2025.

EV manufacturers face industrywide issues such as increasing costs due to tariffs and slower forecasted sales of EVs, as well as company-specific problems that include new product challenges, and regulatory changes that are negatively impacting sales and profits, including the end of consumer federal incentives.

The Trump administration this fall got rid of federal incentives of up to $7,500 for the purchase of an EV. In addition to that, it also ended the practice of fining automakers for failing to meet fuel efficiency rules. That hurts EV manufacturers, which had been counting on selling credits to legacy automakers that could offset some penalties.

Rivian this summer cut its expected earnings from credit sales from $300 million to $160 million. In connection to the change, Rivian also lowered its gross profit guidance for the year to roughly breakeven from a modest profit. It also has conducted layoffs this year to cut costs.

""While we believe deeply in the long-term value drivers of our business, the policy environment continues to be complex and rapidly evolving,"" Rivian CEO RJ Scaringe said during the company's last quarterly results call in August. ""Changes to EV tax credits, regulatory credits, trade regulation and tariffs are expected to have an impact on the results and the cash flow of our business.""

Rivian has maintained that it has enough cash to get it through the launch of its new ""R2"" product during the first half of next year, but the ongoing changes don't assist the company by any means.

Tariffs are hitting the automaker to the tune of ""a couple thousand dollars per unit"" this year, Rivian has said. Lucid also said tariff costs are hurting its profit margins this year, including $54 million during the second quarter.

""We expect the loss of the credit to be a headwind for the market in the coming quarters. Our prior elasticity of demand analysis implied that the loss of IRA [Inflation Reduction Act] credits could equate to a double-digit percent headwind to industry volumes, all else equal,"" Goldman Sachs analyst Mark Delaney said in an Oct. 3 investor note on Rivian and Tesla.

Tesla , which has also sold automotive regulatory credits, reported revenue from those credits in the third quarter fell 44% to $417 million from $739 million.

Pull ahead, Q3 results

The third quarter is expected to be the peak of EV sales for the foreseeable future, as customers rushed to purchase new models ahead of the federal credits ending in September.

As a result, the companies are expected to spend more time touting future products and technology opportunities to investors during their third-quarter calls this week rather than their near-term core businesses of producing and selling EVs.

""It remains to be seen how long the EV hangover will last in the US, though we suspect 3Q EV penetration will likely be the highest mark for quite some time,"" Barclays analyst Dan Levy said in an Oct. 13 investor note.

Rivian last month reported vehicle deliveries of 13,201 vehicles during the third quarter, a 32% increase from a year earlier. Lucid reported deliveries of 4,078 units, up 47% from 2,781 units from the third quarter of 2024.

Even with an uptick in sales, both companies are expected to report notable losses, albeit narrowed from a year ago and smaller than the second quarter.

Rivian is expected to report an adjusted earnings per share loss of 72 cents on revenue of $1.5 billion, based on average analysts' estimates compiled by LSEG. That would compare to an adjusted EPS loss of 99 cents on revenue of $874 million a year earlier.

When reporting its second-quarter results, Rivian said it expected its adjusted core loss to be between $2 billion and $2.25 billion this year, compared with $1.7 billion to $1.9 billion previously forecast. Analysts also have expressed concerns about Rivian's previous goal to be profitable on an earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization basis by 2027.

Lucid is expected to report a $2.27 adjusted EPS loss for the third quarter, down from $2.80 a year earlier (based on recalculated results following a reverse stock split), on a roughly 90% increase in revenue to $379.1 million, according to LSEG.

Narayan and other analysts have largely focused on improvements in the gross profits of the companies as proof of progress. Such results are a key indicator of a business's profitability before operating expenses, interest, and taxes deductions.

""[Investors] will want to see what that gross profit number is in Q3, but they also have a high bar to pass over with where consensus already is,"" Narayan said.

Rivian is expected to report a gross loss of $39 million during the third quarter, according to average estimates compiled by FactSet. Lucid, meanwhile, is expected to report a $255 million gross loss, according to the estimates.

Shares of Rivian are off less than 5% this year, while Lucid's stock is off roughly 45%, including a 1-for-10 reverse stock split in September.

Product and tech promises

Both Rivian and Lucid have tried to sell investors on the success of their future vehicles as well as technologies to save the companies from continued losses.

Rivian's future heavily relies on its new ""R2"" vehicles that are expected to begin production for customers the first half of next year. The roughly $45,000 midsize vehicle, per Rivian, is expected to cut build material costs in half, reduce production complexity and significantly grow demand and sales.

Mike Blake | Reuters

""I'm more bullish on this vehicle than any product we've developed. I believe that the product market fit is incredible. The packaging, the technology and overall value proposition set R2 up for meaningful share,"" Scaringe said in August.

However, the R2 will launch in a challenging market ripe with plenty of vehicle competition — many of which are expected to have longer EV ranges at a similar, if not lower, price.

Barclay's Levy earlier this year did an analysis of the potential total addressable market of the R2, questioning the company's bullishness on the product amid ""risks"" of weaker expected U.S. EV demand, additional costs and a more competitive market.

Narayan and other analysts also have questioned the company's sales targets for the vehicle: ""It's a very competitive market, and you have this EV slowdown in full effect. What are the volumes they're going to get on R2 going up against all this competition? … [General Motors ] can barely get to hundreds of thousands,"" Narayan said in the interview.

Rivian also has touted its potential for revenue with new technologies, such as the $5.8 billion deal it struck with Volkswagen for its software and electrical architecture.

Rivian has said the next generation of technology also is expected to help it become a leader in advanced driver-assistance systems, or ADAS, despite the automaker trailing many other systems.

Lucid

The story is similar at Lucid. The company has placed significant importance on the launch of its Gravity SUV, which Lucid has described as challenging, as well as a future midsize vehicle platform to broaden its market reach.

""We are not simply building electrical vehicles. We are pushing the boundaries of what EVs can be,"" Lucid interim CEO Marc Winterhoff said during the company's second-quarter call in August. ""From the record-breaking performance and efficiency of the Lucid Air to the game-changing Lucid Gravity, to our upcoming midsize platform, our technology continues to redefine what's possible.""

More recently, Lucid also has touted future ADAS technologies and the potential of personal autonomous vehicle capabilities as part of its future, despite a history of underwhelming capabilities in its current luxury models.

Lucid signed a $300 million deal with Uber in July that included the ride-hailing platform acquiring and deploying more than 20,000 Lucid Gravity SUVs that will be equipped with autonomous vehicle technology from startup Nuro over the next six years.

Other topics investors will be watching include any updates to Rivian's timeline for its R2 production or Lucid's production of the Gravity SUV as well as cash flows and profitability outlooks for both companies.

""We are not where we want to be with Lucid Gravity production relative to our target at this point in the year,"" Winterhoff said in August. ""We believe we will significantly increase production [in] the second half of the year.""",https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/107420148-1716586096525-gettyimages-2154514894-js1_9845_axy5pfiz.jpeg?v=1751487196&w=1920&h=1080,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:04.127244

Reed told Rhode Island Current on his way out of the teachers union headquarters that he believed the Trump administration would provide full funding to SNAP.
Three minutes later, after Reed had left the building, an emailed alert showed the Trump administration had submitted its plan for partial funding.
Whitehouse during the press conference called the initial halt of SNAP funding by the federal government “a truly deliberate act of cruelty.” “Every shutdown has had SNAP benefits continue until this one,” he told reporters.
“Essentially, it will destroy SNAP,” Reed said.","Rhode Island’s four Democratic congressional delegates demanded that the Trump administration release funding for Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, benefits during a 40-minute late morning press conference Monday in Cranston.

If they had stayed for just four more minutes, they would have received the news that the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) agreed to comply with a court order to partially fund SNAP for the month of November.

But U.S. Sens. Jack Reed and Sheldon Whitehouse were off to Washington D.C. where the Senate was set to resume at 3 p.m. after a weekend recess. U.S. Reps. Gabe Amo and Seth Magaziner remained in Rhode Island — though both noted they have returned to D.C. on a weekly basis despite the House not meeting since the shutdown began Oct. 1.

At 11:59 a.m., the USDA submitted a four-page report responding to an order from U.S. District Chief Judge John J. McConnell Jr. to force the Trump administration to pay at least a portion of benefits to the 42 million people who receive SNAP benefits by the end of Wednesday, despite the government shutdown.

Trump administration to pay about half of November SNAP benefits amid shutdown

“The U.S. Department of Agriculture is complying with the court’s order and will fulfill its obligation to expend the full amount of SNAP contingency funds today by generating the table required for states to calculate the benefits available for each eligible household in that state,” Agriculture Secretary Brooke Rollins wrote in the Trump administration’s court filing submitted one minute before the administration’s noon deadline.

Rhode Island receives about $29 million each month to administer the SNAP program across the state. Food pantries around Rhode Island are seeing increased demand as SNAP recipients prepared for the first lapse in benefit payments in the program’s history. Food drives have been organized by labor unions, local nonprofits, and advocacy organizations to support the RI Community Food Bank and food pantries across the Ocean State.

The Dr. Martin Luther King Jr Community Center in Newport saw a 34% increase in people using its food pantry in the month of October compared to September, according to its email newsletter.

“Trump can move very fast when he wants to,” Amo had told a half dozen reporters inside the office of the National Education Association of Rhode Island headquarters on Bald Hill Road in Cranston. “So why can’t he find the time to work on behalf of the hardworking Americans who make this country what it is?”

McConnell on Saturday gave the Trump administration two choices after ruling it must use available funds to keep food aid flowing: Cover partial benefits through a $5.5 billion contingency fund or find other reserves, or to pay for a full month tapping into additional revenue sources such as the Child Nutrition Program.

The USDA opted for the latter, stating in an attached declaration that officials determined child nutrition funds “must remain available to protect full operation” of programs through the federal fiscal year.

“Using billions of dollars from Child Nutrition for SNAP would leave an unprecedented gap in Child Nutrition funding that Congress has never had to fill with annual appropriations, and USDA cannot predict what Congress will do under these circumstances,” wrote USDA Undersecretary Patrick Penn.

Reed told Rhode Island Current on his way out of the teachers union headquarters that he believed the Trump administration would provide full funding to SNAP.

“Why would you concede half when you’re conceding?” Reed said.

Three minutes later, after Reed had left the building, an emailed alert showed the Trump administration had submitted its plan for partial funding.

In a statement issued after 4 p.m., Reed called the administration’s decision to partially fund SNAP “a half-baked approach.”

“Partial funding hurts the whole country and underscores Trump’s gross mismanagement,” Reed said.

Whitehouse during the press conference called the initial halt of SNAP funding by the federal government “a truly deliberate act of cruelty.”

“Every shutdown has had SNAP benefits continue until this one,” he told reporters.

Magaziner called Trump’s actions “shameful and unnecessary.”

“Hunger should never be used as a political weapon,” Magaziner said. “We cannot give into their bullying. If we give in now, then it will be four more years of assaults on working people and we cannot go along with that.”

Reed warned the brief chaos from the SNAP cuts will become the norm after the “Big Beautiful Bill” adopted by Republicans in July reduced $186 billion from SNAP funding through 2034.

“Essentially, it will destroy SNAP,” Reed said.

Rhode Island’s congressional delegation has voiced similar concerns about other federal aid programs, particularly health care subsidies. The delegation echoed Senate Democrats’ demands that Congressional Republicans extend the Obama-era subsidies set to expire at the end of the year.

Whitehouse said he is confident the GOP-controlled Senate will start to come to the table to meet Democratic demands and end the shutdown.

“They’re feeling the heat,” Whitehouse said.",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/ReedNextToFood.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 15:04:35.861751

The Department of Energy chose Argonne and Fermi national laboratories for quantum research projects five years ago. They were among five laboratories across the United States that received $25 million-a-year grants over five years, but the grants expired Sept. 30.

Chicago-led quantum research effort in the running for $160M from NSF

Dario Gil, undersecretary for science at DOE, announced the re-authorization of the grants this morning at the Chicago Quantum Summit, a two-day gathering of 700 researchers at Willis Tower.

The funding supports more than 500 research jobs at the two national labs, including more than 100 students at the University of Chicago. It also adds more fuel Chicago’s quest to become the nation’s top hub for quantum science, which is the next generation of computer and communication technology. In addition to Argonne, Fermi and the Chicago Quantum Exchange, the state is building a quantum research park on the former U.S. Steel South Works factory, which was championed by Gov. JB Pritzker, who committed $500 million in state economic-development funds to quantum.

“Our research will continue uninterrupted,” said David Awschalom, a quantum researcher at the University of Chicago and chief science officer of one of the DOE-funded QNext quantum information research center at Argonne. “It’s fantastic news.”

The funding also is a boost for Fermilab in Batavia and its work in quantum materials and sensing. “This renewal allows us to build on that foundation and take the next leap: moving from discovery to deployment,” Anna Grassellino, director of Fermi’s Superconducting Quantum Materials and Systems Center, said in a statement.

Paul Kearns, director of Argonne, called the announcement “excellent news” that will allow the research facility near Lemont to make additional investment in tools and equipment and bring on some additional staff. More than 200 researchers are involved in the quantum research center at Argonne.

Gil, a former top IBM research laid down a daunting challenge for quantum researchers, saying the Tump administration wants to have a fault-tolerant quantum computer running by 2028. Such a computer would be both stable enough to be usable and large enough to be commercially useful.

“By 2028, we need to demonstrate the first generation of fault-tolerant quantum computers capable of performing the next frontier of scientific calculations,” he said. “It is the time to build this first of a kind scientific instrument for the nation, and we will and we must accomplish this.”

The timeframe aligns with those of startups such as PsiQuantum and Infleqtion, both of which are building quantum computers at the Illinois Quantum and Microelectronics Park that is being built along Lake Michigan on the far south side. If the companies can deliver, it will put Chicago at the center of what Gil described as “a revolution in computing that’s going to transform how science and technology is practiced and how R&D is done.”

Sen. Dick Durbin welcomed the money announced today but says more will be required. “It’s undeniable that Illinois is at the forefront of groundbreaking quantum research, with Fermilab and Argonne leading the charge,"" Durbin said in a written statement. ""I’m encouraged to see continued investment in our national labs, but if we hope to maintain our position as a global leader in quantum technology, our federal government must supply the funding to match this ambition.”

Quantum computing, which involves using tiny particles to carry information at exponentially greater rates than traditional technology, is expected to enable breakthroughs in research such as drug discovery and materials science, as well as encryption of communications and data.

The basic research has been underway for decades. The technology is still unproven, but companies such as IBM and Google have made significant progress in the past few years. Gil believes quantum is at an inflection point.

It’s part of a larger goal he described of doubling scientific productivity and impact within a decade. The vision is to combine high-performance computing, AI and quantum, which will “allow us to solve some of the most challenging scientific problems of this century,” Gil said, while also framing quantum development as a critical national security goal.

“There is no doubt that our most formidable competitors and geopolitical adversaries aim to achieve similar goals,” he said. “And reap the benefits of economic and national security that would come with success. We cannot allow that to happen. It is unacceptable for the U.S. not to lead in quantum and AI.”

Argonne is at the center of that strategy. Gil pointed to the success in developing exascale supercomputers—or machines that can perform a quintillion — or 1 billion-billion — calculations per second. Such machines, including a half-billion-dollar computer at Argonne known as Aurora, were built in less than a decade.

The Energy Department doubled down on its investment in a new generation of supercomputers to push the boundaries of artificial intelligence, choosing Argonne last week to build a system with more than 100,000 Nvidia graphics-processing chips.

“It’s been an amazing week,” said Kearns, who was in the audience for Gil’s announcement.",https://s3-rd-prod.chicagobusiness.com/styles/1200x630/s3/fermi.png,N,,2025-11-04 18:06:20.883358

In the sea of enthusiasm for the global expansion of commercial nuclear power, there are modern-day Nostradamuses confidently predicting failure.

“Most [small modular reactors] SMRs are on paper [… and] the tech bros don’t seem to be grounded in reality,” prophesized a Former Nuclear Regulatory Commission chairperson in a recent BBC interview.

On social media, a noted nuclear power critic predicted, “you must know that none of this is actually going to happen” when referring to new nuclear microreactors “that are doomed to fail.”

It is very possible that these criticisms will be proven correct, and small reactors under 300 megawatts (MW) may lose steam as they slog through the thicket of design, licensing, and demonstration. Certainly, a new report on OKLO raises numerous concerns about technological readiness.

Also, as the critics note, there are no new commercial nuclear plants in the United States under construction or even under contract by energy utilities at this time. There are lots of memoranda of understanding (MOU) and paper reactors, but not much groundbreaking.

But the Trump administration has promulgated reams of requirements for advancing nuclear power, including adding 300 gigawatts (GW) of new nuclear energy capacity by 2050, and now has a plan to add financial fuel to this process.

The question is whether the critics are right and there are too many holes for projects to fall through, or whether the Trump mandates will shock the slow-to-change nuclear energy ecosystem into supercharging deployment.

AI Energy Expansion

The Trump administration’s nuclear energy objectives are fueled by several imperatives, but a core one is to win the artificial intelligence (AI) race with China.

That means it needs to concentrate capital and energy resources on the data center buildout. Today, the United States has 522 data centers, about half of the world’s total. Another 280 are expected to come online by 2028. This would jump energy demand in this sector from two percent of total US electricity to 12 percent.

The United States is currently adding only about 65 GW to the grid, but according to an ICF International analysis, it “should be adding about 80 gigawatts of new power generation capacity a year to keep pace with AI as well as cloud computing, crypto, industrial demand, and electrification trends.”

The last nuclear power capability the United States added was the completion of 2.2 GW at the Alvin W. Vogtle Electric Generating site in Georgia in 2024. By contrast, China has 33 reactors under construction and another 43 planned.

Since then, several shuttered nuclear plants have been slated for refurbishment in Pennsylvania, Michigan, and Iowa. They will contribute new energy in the next few years, along with power uprates for existing reactors that are expected to be approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

The partially completed VC Summer nuclear plant in South Carolina will be finished now that the Santee Cooper utility has chosen Brookfield, Westinghouse Electric Company’s majority owner, to complete the work on the AP-1000 reactors.

A number of tech companies, including Amazon, Google, and META, are investing in small reactors that will power the AI race, and Microsoft is supporting the restart of a shuttered reactor at Three Mile Island.

Reactor Role Reversal

The critics are betting that the challenges of achieving commercialization will sink the small reactor data center rally. Driving this view is a trifecta of concerns about emerging reactors’ cost-effectiveness, licensing ability, and delivery certainty. It may take a decade or more before these reactors are ready for deployment. By then, the AI boom may have slaked its energy thirst.

Evidence is already accumulating that proven large reactors in the one GW range, like Westinghouse’s AP-1000, are becoming more appealing for AI power after being cast aside in favor of the smaller newcomers.

Except for NuScale’s Voygr small modular reactor, no US-based SMRs have received NRC design approval, while the AP-1000 is licensed and has been built in the United States and abroad.

But AI is not the only application for small reactors. There are industrial applications for small reactors, including process heat, and small and disaggregated power grid uses that exist in developed and developing countries. The X-Energy deal with Dow to power the Seadrift plant is a good example of matching power plant output and consumption on one large industrial footprint.

Outside the United States, the Canadian Province of Ontario has approved the construction of four 300 MW General Electric Hitachi BWRX reactors at the Darlington nuclear plant. Ontario and the federal government committed $3 billion Canadian dollars for the project. If licensed, these would become the first commercial SMRs operating in North America. That will provide important concrete cost and construction information that may be applicable to other small reactor deployments.

Financing

Spinning up the American nuclear buildout will require billions in financing, and the history of significant cost overruns on previous plant construction casts a shadow on private sector financing enthusiasm.

The Trump administration, however, does not seem to be deterred by this history. It has embraced and revamped the Department of Energy’s Loan Program Office into the Energy Dominance Financing Program (EDF), which has an objective of “reinvigorating the nuclear industry.” It demands that projects move forward expeditiously.

EDF seems prepared to provide tens of billions of dollars in nuclear project loans beyond the commitments it has made to date. And, while the administration is willing to work with utility companies on this nuclear build-out, it is not waiting on them.

As part of its shockwave shake-up of the US nuclear industry, the Commerce Department has entered into a binding term sheet to facilitate financing of $80 billion for the domestic and overseas deployment of the AP-1000. The US government will be granted a participation interest of 20 percent of any cash distribution over $17.5 billion earned by Westinghouse if it secures the funding and assures the reactors will be completed.

Large reactors may be the next residents on federal land if Fermi America is any indication. That project aims to become the country’s largest nuclear complex, with multiple AP-1000s at the site.

But several factors need to fall together for the free flow of money to matter, including creating an assured fuel supply, developing significant efficiencies in the reactor Engineering, Procurement, and Construction (EPC) process to reduce overall cost and construction time, and rebuilding or importing a skilled labor cadre.

This is where US allies like South Korea could play an important role, particularly on AP-1000 construction. South Korea has experience with AP-1000s at home, has a world-class nuclear construction capability, produces components America can’t, and possesses a substantial and well-trained workforce. Korean companies are already partners in some US SMR projects.

Fuel Supply

Access to high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU) nuclear fuel is a major bottleneck for small reactors, and fuel supply could become a challenge for the US nuclear fleet if domestic uranium enrichment can’t quickly scale up.

Both the Biden and Trump administrations made revitalizing US nuclear fuel production a priority. The reasons were to reduce dependence on Russian fuel imports, increase domestic uranium enrichment, and ensure that a steady supply of fuel is available. Collectively, the two administrations have devoted billions to uranium enrichment.

The Trump administration is also enamored with plutonium as a fuel, and recently offered to provide nuclear companies access to almost 20 tons of weapon-grade plutonium for reactor fuel. Tens of millions of dollars in research on plutonium reprocessing technologies have been provided by both administrations.

Nuclear critics have cited nuclear proliferation problems associated with the use of HALEU and weapon-grade plutonium in the civil nuclear fuel cycle. For now, the administration is pushing forward on multiple nuclear fuel fronts, but it is not certain that its efforts will succeed in substantially breaking out of the reactor fuel bottleneck.

Military Reactors

While SMR skeptics are relying on the commercial requirements to smother the viability of next-gen reactors, they have not adequately accounted for the commitment of the US Department of Defense (DOD) to the development of small reactors. The key projects are Project Pele and the Janus Program. And DOD has vast experience turning nascent technology into commercial products.

The PELE reactor is a 1.5 MW TRISO-fueled, gas-cooled demonstration micro reactor that is manufactured by BWXT Advanced Technologies. The project broke ground at Idaho National Laboratory (INL) in 2024, and the reactor is expected to begin operation in 2028. The goal is to provide the US military with “a mobile, reliable, sustainable, and resilient power source which does not require a long logistics tail.”

The Janus project was launched in October 2025, and it is designed to be a micro reactor of one to 20 MWs that provides power for national defense facilities and critical missions. The program is a response to Trump’s executive order, which called for the operation of a US Army-regulated nuclear reactor at a domestic nuclear installation by September 2028.

The Janus reactors will be commercially owned and operated and could provide power to the local grid. The Army wants pairs of reactors demonstrated to underscore that the effort is not just research and development but aimed at wider-scale deployment.

There are questions about the ability of a reactor controlled by the defense department to provide commercial power, but the Atomic Energy Act does provide some authority.

Export Markets

The export of American nuclear reactors has slowed dramatically over the past 40 years but is now showing some signs of life. The AP-1000 is slated to be built in Poland, with the reactors possibly being deployed in Finland, Bulgaria, Slovenia, and Ukraine. Much of this interest is driven by the need to decouple from Russian energy.

US small reactors, however, are not faring as well in the export market in part because of the focus on the need to demonstrate them in the United States first.

However, these SMRs have applicability as an export technology, particularly to developing economy nations with growing populations and energy demand. But there is the need to first develop the nuclear power capacity and infrastcuture in many of these nations.

The United States has a slow, stepwise process for developing nuclear power capacity in countries that need assistance. It emphasizes training, technical assistance, and knowledge sharing. It has not resulted in the development of many markets for emerging US reactors, although it has provided SMR simulators to Romania and Ghana.

That process needs to evolve into one that identifies target countries and then applies the necessary technical and financial resources to develop them for the import of US small reactors. The think tank, Clearpath, has developed the concept of Energy Security Compacts (ESC) that would align US nuclear and financial tools to achieve this goal. It proposes 5 to 10-year agreements that align the various bureaucratic elements of the US government to work toward “clear, measurable outcomes” that support US foreign policy and energy security objectives.

This concept would strengthen the ability of the United States to win nuclear markets against the state-financed companies of Russia and China, which are already operating their own SMRs. And seizing markets outside of North America for US small reactors would push forward their commercialization in America, thereby responding to the concerns of the critics.

According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation.
This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state’s water fund during this year’s legislative session.","Subscribe to The Y’all — a weekly dispatch about the people, places and policies defining Texas, produced by Texas Tribune journalists living in communities across the state.

LUBBOCK — Two years ago, Texas voters overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Texas Water Fund with an initial $1 billion allotment to help the state get its water systems back on track. Since then, the state’s leading water agency has allocated nearly a quarter of that money to rural towns, according to state data reviewed by The Texas Tribune.

More than 40 projects totaling nearly $223 million have been approved for fixing water storage tanks and water service lines, building new water wells, and improving drinking water systems, state data shows. That money, paired with money allocated for projects that prioritize creating new water supply through water conservation and water loss mitigation, a statewide public awareness program and more, means more than $735 million has been committed by the Texas Water Development Board.

The data, which the Tribune requested, comes on the eve of another election in which Texas lawmakers are asking voters to spend $20 billion in sales tax revenue over the next two decades to secure the state’s water supply.

Texas’ water supply has long been under duress. Critical infrastructure has aged beyond repair, causing it to fail. More people are moving to the Lone Star State every day, which has spurred water demand, especially in areas that are already running dry. And climate instability is compounding matters.

Proposition 4, the ballot question that would authorize spending $20 billion, is one of 17 constitutional amendments on this fall’s ballot. Election Day is Tuesday. If it passes, at least 50% of the funds, and possibly more, would be used for creating new water supplies that expand the state’s water portfolio, including projects involving desalination, water conservation, reuse, and aquifer storage. The other portion of the money would be used for water infrastructure needs. And there would be stronger legislative oversight by creating a committee to review how the board administers the fund.

Supporters of the proposition — including Gov. Greg Abbott, state lawmakers, and water advocacy groups — have argued the state needs the money to continue the work started in 2023. At the time, nearly 80% of voters approved what seemed like a good start to address the growing water needs that plagued every region of the state.

While the Texas Water Development Board is in the final stages of spending the first billion, some of those same supporters are calling for better tracking and transparency of how funds are being spent to ensure lawmakers and taxpayers are willing to make more money available in the future.

“There’s going to be an option for a future Legislature to continue it or renew it,” said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at Texas 2036. “But in order for that to happen, there needs to be clear evidence that this funding stream has worked.”

Progress from the 2023 effort offers a look into the future if the $20 billion initiative is approved. In rural Texas specifically, the money has thrown a lifeline to communities struggling with inflation, supply chain issues and construction costs that make it impossible to make repairs on their own.

“This is not economically feasible otherwise,” said Mary Alice Boehm-McKaughan, general counsel with the Texas Rural Water Association. “These systems literally cannot afford to upgrade their system without access to these funds.”

The $1 billion tranche was more of a band-aid than a panacea, water experts said. At best, it helped clear a backlog of needs that had built up in recent years.

“That $1 billion injection was, in some ways, like if somebody has a wound and it’s bleeding and you have to put a temporary stop on it,” said Sarah Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation. “All the programs are so oversubscribed that it’s not like that was new money for new fun projects.”

Data obtained by the Tribune from the water board through a public records request shows the state has or will fund more than 40 projects. Most of those projects are in rural areas with fewer than 10,000 residents. Only six entities that serve a population between 10,001 and 150,000 residents were awarded grant dollars.

According to the data, these projects range from rehabbing water storage tanks and generators in the small town of Alba, in East Texas, and water service line and meter replacements in Benjamin, 130 miles east of Lubbock. The projects also include a new water well in Corrigan and Weimar, two towns with populations under 3,300 people, and drinking water system improvements in several towns, including Jefferson in far East Texas. Dozens of municipalities, including Matador and Paducah, two towns in the High Plains that both have less than 1,000 residents, were approved for water supply and distribution system improvements.

“Rural communities need this investment in critical infrastructure,” said Kelty Garbee, executive director of Texas Rural Funders, a nonprofit that has championed the 2023 and 2025 constitutional amendments. “Every dollar spent on water will deliver powerful results — repairing old systems, reducing waste, and keeping water affordable for Texas families and businesses.”

Clearer accounting wanted

There’s rarely simple accounting in government. The $1 billion that voters approved in 2023 is no exception.

The water board received the money on Jan. 1, 2024, then took several months to plot a path with public input on how the money should be spent. In the summer of 2024, they put together a list of what programs they would like to make commitments to.

Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.

The board later solicited project applications from waste and wastewater systems in Texas. According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation. Of those forms, 46 received funding, all of which went toward water infrastructure needs.

About $45 million was allocated for entities with populations of 1,000 or less to receive 100% grant funding from the rural assistance fund. According to Boehm-McKaughan, the East Medina County Special Utility District was able to fix leaks in more than a mile of water line thanks to that grant money.

“The good news here is that the board is prudently and rationally executing its due diligence,” Mazur said. “And doing what it needs to do to get money out the door in an appropriate manner.”

The board does not have a clear indication on how funds have been spent so far on their website, or for what projects. This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state’s water fund during this year’s legislative session.

Perry Fowler, executive director of the Texas Water Infrastructure Network, said the water board is under a lot of pressure to get the money out, but it also must vet projects to ensure tax dollars are used correctly.

“There probably are ways they could help demonstrate how money is being spent and when and where a little better,” Fowler said. “But I don’t think they’re being irresponsible.”

Senate Bill 7, which spells out in part how the $20 billion for water is to be spent, will add more oversight and require the water board to report on how the state is providing financial assistance and the progress being made toward addressing water infrastructure challenges.

Mazur said that moving forward, it would be helpful to have a clear description of the benefits to the communities when projects are completed.

“I think it’s going to be important for the board to start telling a story with these projects when they’re completed and what the actual tangible benefit will be to the communities they serve,” Mazur said.

Fowler agreed that more transparency is important. However, he said the public should be more concerned about the volume of projects the board is able to approve.

“As great as this billion is, and if we’re going to get it every year, it’s never going to be enough,” Fowler said. “We’re probably going to have to have additional appropriations because what we’re seeing is we’re not able to meet the demand we have.”

A Texas 2036 report estimates the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure — an estimate that does not include money for projects that create new water supply.

By the water board’s own estimates in the state’s 2022 water plan, towns and cities could be on a path toward a severe shortage of water by 2030. This would happen if there are recurring, record-breaking drought conditions across the state, and if water entities and state leaders fail to put in place key strategies to secure water supplies.

“I don’t think we’re going to end up with a scenario where there’s just money sitting around not being used,” Schlessinger said. “My gut says that $1 billion doesn’t get anywhere close to meeting the amount of project funding needs there are.”

That demands a massive scale-up in renewables and adaptation backed by a surge in finance for developing countries.
Renewables are leading that transformation and rewriting the rules of energy.
We need a quantum leap in climate finance to lower the cost of capital and expand concessional lending.","Following is the text of UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ video message for the 2025 Emissions Gap Report, issued by the United Nations Environment Programme (UNEP), in Nairobi today:

The new Emissions Gap Report, issued by the United Nations Environment Programme, is clear and uncompromising.

If nationally determined contributions are fully implemented by 2035, global warming would reach 2.3°C – down from 2.6°C in last year’s projections. That is progress, but nowhere near enough.

Current commitments still point to climate breakdown. Scientists tell us that a temporary overshoot above 1.5°C is now inevitable — starting, at the latest, in the early 2030s. And the path to a liveable future gets steeper by the day.

But this is no reason to surrender. It’s a reason to step up and speed up. 1.5°C by the end of the century remains our North Star. And the science is clear: this goal is still within reach, but only if we meaningfully increase our ambition.

Our mission is simple, but not easy: Make any overshoot as small and as short as possible; reach global net-zero emissions by 2050 and move swiftly onto a progressive, irreversible net-negative pathway; and bring the global temperature increase back below 1.5°C by the end of the century.

That means peaking global emissions immediately; achieving far deeper emission reductions during this decade; cutting methane sharply; accelerating the transition from fossil fuels to renewables; and protecting forests and oceans — our carbon sinks.

Make no mistake: Any period of overshooting will inevitably bring dramatic consequences – with lives lost, communities uprooted and development gains reversed. But we have the solutions to make this overshoot as small, as short and as safe as possible.

That demands a massive scale-up in renewables and adaptation backed by a surge in finance for developing countries. Renewables are leading that transformation and rewriting the rules of energy. Costs are falling, investments are rising, innovation is surging.

Clean power is now the cheapest source of electricity in most markets and the fastest to deploy. It strengthens energy security, cuts pollution and creates millions of decent jobs.

Leaders must seize this moment and waste no time in tripling renewables and doubling energy efficiency by 2030; building modern grids and large-scale storage; and ending all new coal, oil and gas expansion in a just and equitable manner.

The clean energy revolution must reach everyone, everywhere. But developing countries face crippling capital costs and a fraction of global investment. They also need far greater support to adapt to worsening climate impacts — protecting lives and building resilience.

We need a quantum leap in climate finance to lower the cost of capital and expand concessional lending. Developed countries must lead in delivering predictable, affordable finance through multilateral development bank reform, effective debt solutions and tools that crowd in private investment at scale.

Article content

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

Article content

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

Article content

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

First American is designing a 240-megawatt liquid metal reactor that uses lead bismuth as a coolant. It’s the only company using this technology in the US, though it’s been used in Russian submarines for years.

Article content

The reprocessing system will be able to convert spent uranium from the plant into new fuel, making the plants cheaper to operate and eliminating the challenge posed by the toxic waste created by conventional reactors.

As a news release from the Department of Energy detailed, the NNSA is ""seeking proposals from U.S. private sector partners"" to construct and power data centers on large tracts of land at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina and the Oak Ridge Reservation in Tennessee.

According to the American Nuclear Society, the sites were chosen because they can serve dual purposes: hosting data centers and nuclear power production, thereby boosting grid reliability, reducing energy costs, and bolstering national security.

Other selected sites include the Idaho National Laboratory and the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant, both of which are awaiting requests for proposals.

The NNSA has identified 10 tracts totaling more than 3,100 acres at the Savannah River Site for the development of AI data centers, along with approximately 44,000 acres at the Idaho National Laboratory, according to the ANS. The DOE stated that private-sector partners chosen for the project will enter into long-term leasing agreements at the site and will be tasked with constructing, powering, and decommissioning each data center.

""Proposals will be competitively evaluated for technological readiness, financial viability, and detailed plans to complete regulatory and permitting requirements,"" the DOE added.

While the DOE selected the sites for their easy access or potential for energy development, it also expects proposals to include innovative on-site energy generation, such as co-located nuclear reactors, geothermal energy, and energy storage solutions.

The DOE has acknowledged several risks associated with nuclear power, including public perception, safety concerns, high upfront costs for power plants, and the safe disposal of used fuel. It is working on many improvements, including ""accident-tolerant fuels"" that will boost performance and produce less waste.

Since data centers and artificial intelligence applications are notorious for needing enormous amounts of water and energy to operate, powering them with nuclear will help reduce heat-trapping pollution and conserve resources. Not to mention, it provides a major opportunity for the U.S. to take the lead in the digital and clean energy transition.

The study, conducted in Ecuador’s páramo, a high-altitude grassland ecosystem, found that even tiny ponds can release surprisingly large amounts of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide and methane into the atmosphere. Until now, these remote mountain wetlands have been largely overlooked in global carbon studies.

“Our study shows that the smallest ponds can make a big difference, emitting more carbon than larger waters just meters away,” said Kriddie Whitmore, a recent Ph.D. graduate from UNC who led the fieldwork and is now a postdoctoral researcher at Umeå University in Sweden. “These results highlight the need for increased research focused on small aquatic systems.”

By measuring emissions across ponds at different elevations and temperatures, the researchers found that elevation, water temperature, and how ponds connect with surrounding soils all strongly influence how much carbon they release. Contrary to past assumptions, smaller doesn’t necessarily mean less impactful.

“These areas have long been blind spots in global climate models,” said Diego Riveros-Iregui, the study’s principal investigator and professor of geography and environment at UNC. “By uncovering what drives carbon emissions in these remote, high-elevation ecosystems, we are filling a major gap in global climate science. This knowledge helps us refine climate models and better understand how tropical mountain landscapes influence Earth’s carbon balance.”

The findings suggest that high-altitude ecosystems like the páramo, which store vast amounts of carbon in their soils, could be important players in regulating the planet’s climate. Incorporating emissions from these small ponds into global models will help scientists make more accurate carbon budgets and predict how climate change might affect carbon cycling in tropical mountain regions.

The senators emphasized the importance of clean energy in providing Western families, farmers, and businesses with reliable and affordable energy, generating 44 percent of electricity in Western states. Blocking the cheapest and most abundant type of generation jeopardizes grid reliability and abandons existing private investments. The senators demanded clarity on how DOI’s new heightened reviews will affect current and future wind and solar energy projects, pointing out how this policy is irreconcilable with President Trump’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability.

“Western states have led the way in demonstrating that clean energy strengthens local economies and the electric grid, setting ambitious goals for its energy transition. Additional layers of federal bureaucracy could effectively stall new renewable projects, forcing Westerners to face higher costs, less reliable energy service, and fewer opportunities for economic growth,” concluded the senators.

The text of the letter is available HERE and below.

Dear Secretary Burgum:

We are writing to express concerns about the Department of the Interior’s (DOI) recent Secretarial order, which puts forward new requirements for Secretarial approval for routine permitting steps that risk delaying or blocking low-cost wind and solar energy projects. This order affects projects not only on federal lands, but also on state and private lands since DOI sign-off is needed at multiple steps during wind and solar project development – for example, ecological baseline studies, access road authorizations, federal wildlife permits, or utility corridor concurrences.

DOI’s recent Secretarial order, Departmental Review Procedures for Decisions, Actions, Consultations, and Other Undertakings Related to Wind and Solar Energy Facilities, outlines an expansive list of 69 DOI decisions and actions related to wind and solar projects that now newly require your personal review, including routine steps such as right-of-way applications or biological assessments. This ensnares virtually every ongoing wind and solar project in multiple layers of red tape and bureaucratic review, creating significant legal and regulatory uncertainty about timelines and raising questions about whether project approval is even possible. It also creates a significant deterrent to the development of new projects. This indefinite effective pause on wind and solar permits comes at a time of increasing energy demand and energy prices. It is difficult to understand how these actions align with the President’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability. With that in mind, we seek to better understand DOI’s rationale for these new policies and how they will be implemented in practice.

As you are aware, Western families, farmers, and businesses depend on reliable and affordable energy to power their homes, grow their crops, and keep our economy competitive. Clean energy is a cornerstone of that effort – generating 44 percent of electricity in our states while supporting good-paying jobs in both urban and rural communities and strengthening the region’s energy security. As the least expensive and fastest-to-deploy sources of new electricity generation, wind and solar are critical to meeting rising demand while keeping electricity affordable.

The Western Interconnection projects a 17% increase in peak demand between 2024 and 2034. Meeting this increase in the most affordable way will require 68 GW of additional solar and 40 GW of land-based wind over the next decade. Yet, DOI’s new policies effectively take these options off the table. If federal permitting for solar and wind does not resume soon, our states risk losing projects already in development. Cancellations or indefinite delays of this scale would eliminate expected capacity from the interconnection queue, jeopardizing energy reliability while increasing costs for Western families and businesses.

We request answers to the following questions:

How will DOI’s new heightened federal reviews be applied in practice? Specifically

Will this be applied to all projects or will certain projects be exempt?

If certain projects are exempt, can DOI lay out the criteria and process for an exemption?

How will DOI ensure transparency in this review process to provide certainty to developers and stakeholders?

How will DOI ensure timely approvals for wind and solar projects for all 69 listed items on the heightened review list given the likely bottleneck created by elevating 69 new decision and action items to your office?

Can DOI clarify how impeding the development and deployment of the lowest-cost and most widely available energy sources is consistent with the Administration’s stated goals of unleashing American energy and ensuring energy affordability? Has DOI conducted any internal legal, environmental, or economic analyses to evaluate the effects of this order on the nation’s ability to meet those goals?

The DOI Secretarial order defines actions broadly enough that it not only affects solar and wind projects on federal lands, but also state and private lands. Please explain why projects largely dependent on state and private development should be subjected to heightened federal reviews?

To what extent, if at all, has DOI consulted with any relevant authorities – such as the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, the Department of Energy, or state Public Utility Commissions – to assess the potential implications of DOI restricting wind and solar power permitting on grid reliability? Specifically, has DOI examined how these new actions might impact resource adequacy, reserve requirements, or reliability metrics such as loss of load expectation if there’s no new generation buildout?

Western states have led the way in demonstrating that clean energy strengthens local economies and the electric grid, setting ambitious goals for its energy transition. Additional layers of federal bureaucracy could effectively stall new renewable projects, forcing Westerners to face higher costs, less reliable energy service, and fewer opportunities for economic growth.

I urge you to address these questions swiftly and work in partnership with states to ensure that federal permitting supports, rather than undermines, efforts to build a secure and affordable energy future.

About the e-bike program CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground.
More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December.
Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.
Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.","California is halting its landmark electric bike voucher program with no announcement and millions of dollars still in the bank, and transit advocates are frustrated that the money appears to be going to a program geared toward electric cars instead.

The Electric Bicycle Incentive Program offered up to $2,000 to lower-income Californians to purchase e-bikes beginning last year. In a statement, the California Air Resources Board said only that it has redirected the funds toward another program “due to state budget constraints.”

“This is a recent outcome of legislative direction, and we have just started informing program partners,” CARB spokesperson Joe DeAnda said in an email, adding that it’s possible funding could be allocated for the program in future years.

Where is the money going instead?

But Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike), said she was told in mid-October that CARB would shift the program’s remaining funds to Clean Cars 4 All, a similar incentive program for electric vehicles.

While she said she felt the conversation was meant to be private, she expected it would be followed by a more formal announcement from the agency.

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.

According to Ramsey, about $17 million — more than half of the $30 million that’s been allocated to the e-bike program since its inception in 2022 — is set to go to the program for electric vehicles.

She said she was told that the funds were reallocated based on direction from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office to use any available CARB funding to continue supporting electric vehicle purchases as the federal government does away with its own incentives.

The Trump administration’s controversial One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 toward electric vehicle purchases.

“I think that’s really unfortunate that we’re responding to the current federal situation by limiting Californians’ ability to get really the cheapest and most economical, sustainable transportation option, instead of sort of doubling down and saying, ‘We have this really low-cost option that opens trips up for more people, and then we also have this other option for people who need cars,’” Ramsey said.

About the e-bike program

CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground. It wasn’t until 2024 that the agency began issuing $1,750 vouchers for a range of approved bikes to people whose annual household income fell under 300% of the federal poverty line. An additional $250 was available to applicants who met further income criteria.

The program was designed to expand access to an affordable transportation model, especially for non-drivers and people with limited mobility.

While it was heralded initially as an ambitious and significant step toward clean transportation, it also invited widespread criticism after a slow rollout, multiple pushed-back application timelines and two state investigations into Pedal Ahead, the nonprofit chosen to administer the vouchers.

Applicants also expressed frustration over technical issues with the application process once it got underway.

While the state’s electric vehicle incentive program has a rolling application process, the e-bike voucher program, by contrast, requires people to log onto the website at a prescribed time, click the application portal at just the right moment and enter their information under a time crunch.

“I found it a little bit surprising that the same entity would have two similar voucher programs run completely different ways ... when they had an existing program that was already working, that was distributing a large amount of money as well,” Ramsey said.

More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December. A second drop in May yielded a similar interest level.

“There were a lot of challenges. I don’t think anyone will tell you different,” Ramsey said.

Still, she said, at least some of the technology and availability frustrations the program spurred were also a sign of its value.

“The program was successful in showing that if you give people the opportunity to get an e-bike in an affordable manner, that they will take that opportunity and they will use e-bikes,” Ramsey told KQED.

Future drops were expected incrementally as long as funding was available. DeAnda said a third application round had been planned for next year before funds were redirected.

Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.

“Such a popular program shouldn’t be ended,” said Christopher White, the executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. “It should be operated well and fully funded because it promises to transform the mobility habits of tens of thousands of Californians to be more sustainable, far safer, [and it’s] far less expensive for the individuals to operate their new vehicles.

Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.

“It definitely gives the sense that CARB knows that this is the wrong direction to be moving in, to keep it so quiet,” he said.",https://scpr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/964abe9/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1020x536+0+72/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fscpr-brightspot.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2F80%2F46%2F54d8ee634d70a3d414de9b540b55%2F240823-valenciatelegraphbikelanes-33-bl-qed-1020x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 15:05:02.188012

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States’ withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.
Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.
Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.","All nations of the world had homework this year: submit new-and-improved plans to fight climate change. But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States’ withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three-tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six-tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration’s policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, the U.N. Environment Program’s Emissions Gap report said Tuesday.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,″ said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. ”It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise. ″

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 C (2.7 F) since the mid-1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 C (4.1 to 4.5 F), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 C (5 F) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 C (3.1 F) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 C (7.2 F) warmer.

“We are making progress,’' UNEP Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press. “We have to go faster.”

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

UNEP said the U.S. did not provide comments on the report by their deadline and asked for emissions data about the U.S. to be removed. The UNEP declined but included a footnote at the U.S. request, saying that it doesn’t support the report.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year, the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.

“Vehicle sales will face headwinds in the coming months,” said Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics.","WASHINGTON — Sales of U.S. light vehicles fell in October as the expiration of federal government subsidies undercut demand for battery-powered electric cars, and an easing labor market and looming higher prices from tariffs could limit any rebound this year.

Light vehicle sales decreased 6.5% to a seasonally adjusted annualized rate of 15.3 million units last month, data from market analysis firm Omdia showed. Unadjusted sales of electric vehicles dropped to 74,897 units from 98,289 units in September.

President Donald Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill approved by the U.S. Congress this year eliminated $7,500 tax credits for buying or leasing new electric vehicles and a $4,000 used-EV credit at the end of September. The subsidies, implemented by the previous Democratic Biden administration, boosted EV sales in recent years.

“Sharply lower electric vehicle sales, following the expiration of the federal tax credit on Oct. 1, reduced dealer volumes over the month,” said Ben Ayers, senior economist at Nationwide Financial. “With concerns about the labor market building, the near-term outlook for auto sales could be soft as more consumers stay away from auto showrooms this holiday season.”

Overall unadjusted light vehicle sales were down 4.5% in October from a year ago. Last month’s sharp decline would suggest moderate or weak retail sales in October. But a 35-day shutdown of the government, on track to be the longest on record, has led to an economic data blackout.

The Chicago Federal Reserve is estimating retail sales excluding motor vehicles increased 0.3% last month after a projected 0.4% gain in September.

Limited data have suggested the labor market has remained stagnant since August, with layoffs still relatively low and hiring tepid. Economists say demand for labor has ebbed because of economic uncertainty, tariffs and companies embracing artificial intelligence. A sharp reduction in workers because of raids on undocumented immigrants is also weighing on the labor market.

A survey from the Conference Board last month showed consumers’ perceptions of the labor market remained downbeat in October. The unemployment rate was near a four-year high of 4.3% in August.

“Vehicle sales will face headwinds in the coming months,” said Grace Zwemmer, associate economist at Oxford Economics. “New vehicles are one of the most exposed sectors to tariffs. So far, foreign and domestic automakers have largely absorbed the costs through their profit margins, but this isn’t sustainable.”",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/11/9016199_web1_2025-11-04T170102Z_2_LYNXMPELA3100_RTROPTP_4_CALIFORNIA-CARS.JPG,N,,2025-11-04 18:06:30.728639

For now, it remains a concept

It’s a true technology showcase for TRD.

It boasts no less than 547 horsepower

Developed by Toyota Racing Development (TRD) engineers in California and North Carolina, with support from Toyota Motor North America’s R&D department, this concept was created for the SEMA Show in Las Vegas. With 547 horsepower, a nearly silent powertrain, and a wealth of camping innovations, the Tacoma H2-Overlander embodies the fusion of performance, sustainability, and adventure.

“We wanted to preserve TRD’s off-road and desert racing heritage while incorporating cutting-edge powertrain technologies,” said Craig Cauthen, manager of TRD’s Emerging Technologies Group. “This vehicle showcases the TRD team’s capabilities beyond the racetrack.”

Design and Functionality

The exterior adopts a decidedly utilitarian look, featuring a custom overlanding camper made with recycled carbon-fibre aerodynamic panels. Reinforced bumpers, integrated tow points, a winch, recovery board mounts, and full DOT-compliant lighting complete the package.

“The Tacoma H2-Overlander Concept illustrates Toyota’s multi-pathway approach to carbon neutrality,” said Mike Tripp, vice president of Toyota Marketing. “Under the theme ‘Powered by Possibility,’ we’re demonstrating that hydrogen is not only viable but central to our vision of the future. This concept proves that clean energy and real-world capability can go hand in hand.”

A true team player, this next-generation Tacoma can also assist other electric vehicles thanks to a 15-kW power takeoff capable of powering an off-grid home or charging two EVs simultaneously via NEMA 14-50 outlets.

High-Performance Fuel Cell

When not building roaring NASCAR engines, the TRD-USA team acts as an innovation lab dedicated to Toyota’s sustainability goals. It has notably developed mobile hydrogen generators capable of powering an entire race weekend without noise or emissions.

The Tacoma H2-Overlander carries that same spirit forward. It incorporates Toyota Mirai’s second-generation hydrogen fuel cell and three tanks holding a total of 6 kg of hydrogen, all neatly packaged within the frame. The fuel cell combines hydrogen and oxygen in a chemical reaction that produces electricity and water vapor and nothing else.

The setup is supported by a 24.9-kWh lithium-ion battery. Together, they power a 225-kW (302 hp) front motor and a 188-kW (252 hp) rear eAxle. The result: the instant torque and responsiveness of an EV combined with the fast refuelling benefits of hydrogen.

Power is delivered through a front limited-slip differential and a rear electronic locking differential, making it a true four-wheel-drive adventurer. The engineers also strengthened the chassis with a TRD long-travel suspension kit, Fox 2.5 Performance Elite Series shocks derived from the Tundra, and upgraded front brakes. The 17 x 8.5-inch wheels are wrapped in 35-inch off-road tires, while a custom TRD cooling system, inspired by the Tacoma TRD Pro and Lexus RZ, maintains thermal stability for both the electric and hydrogen systems.

Another remarkable innovation is TRD’s patented water recovery system. It captures and filters the hydrogen fuel cell’s only byproduct, water, making it usable at the campsite. This distilled, mineral-free water can be used for washing or cleaning. While not recommended for drinking, it provides a valuable resource for explorers far from natural sources.

Toyota bZ Time Attack Concept: Electrified Power Takes on SEMA 2025

From Concept to Reality

Transforming a gasoline-powered Tacoma into a four-wheel-drive hydrogen vehicle in just a few months was a monumental challenge.

“Time was our greatest enemy,” admitted Cauthen. “The question was: what can we achieve within a tight timeline to bring to SEMA a fully functional vehicle that once ran on gasoline and now runs on hydrogen?”

To meet this challenge, TRD teams relied on 3D modeling, additive manufacturing, and a cross-country collaboration between North Carolina and California. The project resulted in several firsts, including the water recovery system and a “roboformed” tailgate developed with Toyota Motor North America Stamping.",https://motorillustrated.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025-Tacoma_H2_Overlander_Concept_Toyota_SEMA-5.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 18:06:10.908551

Figure 4 Conclusion These trends underscore why foreign direct investment is central to Edmonton Global’s mission.","As Edmonton Global approaches its ninth year – and welcomes a new CEO – it’s a natural time to reflect on the organization’s mission and impact.

Established in 2017, Edmonton Global is the economic development organization representing 14 municipalities within the Edmonton Metropolitan Region working together on economic development. Throughout the last eight years, our mandate has remained clear and consistent:

Help local companies expand into new markets through trade, and

Attract foreign direct investment (FDI) — bringing new companies, capital, and jobs to our region.

Both goals are critical to building a resilient, diverse, and globally competitive regional economy – and both outcomes exist under the umbrella term, economic development.

When people hear the term economic development, they often think of visible changes — new buildings, local business openings, or business improvement districts. While those are positive signs, they don’t necessarily tell the whole story of true economic growth.

Real economic development happens when a community brings new money into its economy — through exports, tourism, or investment from outside its borders. That external capital expands the community’s economic base, supports employment growth, and creates a ripple effect that benefits local businesses and residents alike.

This is where foreign direct investment plays a vital role. When a company from another country builds a facility, hires local talent, or partners with local suppliers, it’s not just creating jobs — it’s injecting new income into the local economy. Those wages are spent in local shops, restaurants, and services, creating what economists call the multiplier effect – every export-oriented job supports additional jobs in local sectors.

Focusing solely on “supporting local” businesses, while important, isn’t enough on its own. To grow, a community must attract new capital and produce goods and services that reach beyond local borders.

Foreign direct investment ensures that new wealth flows into the region, fueling innovation and expanding opportunities for everyone — from skilled tradespeople and engineers to small business owners and service providers. It connects our local economy to the global marketplace — and in doing so, strengthens the communities that make up our region.

This blog is the first post in a two-part series that explores why FDI matters and how it supports long-term regional prosperity. In Part 2, we’ll dive into the data to see how the Edmonton region stacks up globally and nationally.

What is Foreign Direct Investment?

Foreign direct investment happens when a company invests in another country – this can be through building a new facility, hiring local teams, or acquiring an existing business. These investments can take many forms. Just a couple of examples could include:

A manufacturer opening a new plant (for example UK’s Linde is currently constructing a $2 billion hydrogen production facility in Fort Saskatchewan),

A tech firming hiring a local team of software engineers (for example French multinational Sia partners opening an Edmonton office in 2022), or

A global company acquiring a local enterprise to grow its operations (for example US multinational Johnson Controls acquiring local tech giant Silent Aire in 2021 for $1.3 billion).

These types of investments do more than create new facilities or business expansions — they generate lasting economic benefits. When companies invest abroad, they bring with them new capital, technology, expertise, and market reach, helping to strengthen local supply chains, create high-quality jobs, and build global connections.

In short, FDI is one of the most effective ways for communities to grow their economies — which is why countries and regions around the world compete to attract it.

Why FDI matters

Countries and regions around the world rely on FDI to provide good quality jobs for their communities. In the United States, approximately 16 million (or around one in 10) jobs were directly or indirectly attributable to FDI. Here in Canada, that number is even higher, with more than one-third of positions being held by multinationals. In Alberta, roughly one in every four jobs is tied to a multinational organization. Many of the Edmonton region’s largest employers – including Shell, Gilead, and Cargill – are foreign investors who have built long-term operations here. Others, such as Stantec, Bee Clean, and Capital Power, are homegrown companies that are investing abroad and are building globally competitive businesses from right here in the Edmonton region.

According to Statistics Canada, multinational companies now employ more Albertans than ever — about 685,000 in 2023, up from 527,000 in 2010 (Figure 1).

Figure 1

This makes Alberta the third highest province in Canada for number of jobs from multinational organizations (Figure 2).

Figure 2

The same dataset highlights which sectors have seen job growth driven by multinational companies. Between 2010 and 2023, employment from multinationals increased across nearly all sectors (Figure 3).

Figure 3

Looking ahead

Global FDI has more than doubled over the past two decades – growing from 0.77 trillion USD in 2003 to more than 1.34 trillion in 2024, with the strongest growth in technology, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. Interestingly, investment flows for technology (especially electronics) surpassed energy and mining last year – bumping that sector into second; followed by general manufacturing in third (Figure 4).

This shows that Edmonton Global’s sector priorities are well aligned with global investment trends — all five of our focus sectors appear in the data, with energy and information technology among the top three.

Figure 4

Conclusion

These trends underscore why foreign direct investment is central to Edmonton Global’s mission. Each new investment represents more than capital — it’s a vote of confidence in our people, our industries, and our potential. By connecting the Edmonton region to global markets, we strengthen our local economy and ensure that prosperity is shared across our 14 municipalities.

In the next part of this series, we’ll examine how the Edmonton region compares nationally and globally, and where the biggest opportunities for growth lie ahead.",https://edmontonglobal.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Title-Page.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:06:38.753271

The Path Forward This session demonstrated California’s ability to pair ambitious climate policy with practical solutions for affordability and reliability.","Last month, Governor Gavin Newsom wrapped up bill actions for the 2025 legislative session, signing into law a suite of measures that together comprise one of California’s most comprehensive climate and energy packages in recent years. This year’s session was defined by efforts to pair climate ambition with affordability, with major bills aimed at cutting costs, stabilizing markets, and advancing clean energy deployment.

CATF’s advocacy, expertise sharing, and policy development helped shape several of these wins. While the legislature advanced a broad set of climate and energy-related measures, the following bills reflect areas of most direct CATF engagement and alignment with current priorities — ensuring strong climate ambition, supporting durable market frameworks, enabling policies that help meet the state’s Scoping Plan targets, and advancing energy affordability for Californians.

Electricity Affordability

Electricity affordability is one of California’s biggest clean energy challenges, with rates far outpacing inflation over the last several years. A key legislative priority this session was to advance policies to address near-term and long-term drivers of rising rates. SB 254establishes financing reforms for a portion of wildfire mitigation expenditures — a major near-term driver of rate increases. To address costs of grid infrastructure over the next several decades, the bill contains a lower-cost alternative to utility financing by enabling public financing for transmission infrastructure. Analysis from CATF and Net-Zero California found that Californians could save $3 billion per year, or approximately $123 billion over 40 years, by replacing high-cost equity with lower-cost public debt financing in the form of a public-private partnership. SB 254 turns this research into action by establishing the California Transmission Infrastructure Accelerator to coordinate transmission planning, facilitate public financing, reduce project costs, and develop a public-private partnership plan to maximize public financing and ratepayer benefits. The bill also establishes the Transmission Accelerator Revolving Fund, seeded with $325 million from Proposition 4 and a five-year allocation of 5% of Cap-and-Invest revenues from utility allowances as established under AB 1207 (Irwin).

Looking ahead: SB 254 lays a strong foundation for delivering real savings and accelerating grid expansion. Its success will depend on how effectively the Accelerator can structure and deploy public financing to lower capital costs and demonstrate measurable ratepayer benefits.

Extending Cap-and-Invest and Strengthening Market Integrity

California’s Cap-and-Invest program is the cornerstone of the state’s economy-wide approach to cutting greenhouse gas emissions, providing a market signal for clean investment and generating billions in annual revenue for climate priorities. The program’s authorization was set to expire at the end of the decade; AB 1207 (Irwin) reauthorizes California’s Cap-and-Invest program through 2045, while companion legislation SB 840 (Limón) outlines a plan for allocating revenues from the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund.

Both bills contain provisions around the use of offsets. SB 840 directs CARB to update all existing compliance offset protocols by 2029 to reflect the best available science, with reviews every five years starting in 2034. AB 1207 caps the use of offsets at 6% of an entity’s compliance obligation, requiring that half of those offsets deliver environmental benefits in-state, and permanently retires an equal number of allowances so that their use effectively translates into a tightening of the overall cap.

SB 840 also directs CARB to consider new carbon-removal protocols and for the first time, earmarks funding for climate-focused technological innovation — a yet-to-be-fully-defined category of technologies that could range from carbon dioxide removal and storage to industrial decarbonization solutions.

Looking ahead: The reauthorization of California’s Cap-and-Invest program marks a pivotal moment for aligning long-term climate goals with durable market design. As implementation begins, attention will turn to ensuring that the Cap-and-Invest program maintains a high bar for climate ambition and that the offset protocols reflect best-available science. Recent research from CATF and leading U.S. forest carbon scientists found that while high-quality forest carbon credits are possible under California’s current protocol, the protocol needs to be strengthened to ensure credits deliver their promised climate benefits. The assessment offers a roadmap for incorporating new data and scientific advances to improve accuracy, durability, and transparency for forest carbon offsets.

Modernizing Permitting and Regulatory Frameworks for Geothermal Energy

California is home to some of the nation’s richest geothermal resources, which offer a vital source of clean, firm power that can operate around the clock to complement the state’s growing portfolio of renewables and battery storage. Yet development remains constrained by fragmented permitting processes, outdated well regulations, and high development costs. AB 531 (Rogers),expands eligibility for geothermal projects of all sizes to use the California Energy Commission’s “one-stop-shop” permitting process, providing an additional option to streamline project approvals. A companion bill, AB 527 (Papan), was vetoed and would have exempted exploration wells from CEQA under certain conditions and required the state to modernize its well regulations for enhanced geothermal systems.

Looking ahead: The veto underscores the need for modernizing the state’s geothermal regulations through administrative action and evaluating whether additional permitting streamlining measures are needed to accelerate project development. As outlined in CATF’s recent report, “Unlocking California’s Geothermal Potential: A Strategic Opportunity for Clean, Firm Power,” these are important components to unlocking the state’s full potential for clean, reliable, around-the-clock power.

Lifting the Moratorium on CO₂ Pipelines

California’s currentstrategy to achieve carbon neutrality calls for capturing or removing 100 million metric tons (MMT) of CO₂ annually by 2045. To help operationalize this pathway, SB 905 (Caballero, 2022) directed CARB and other state agencies to develop a regulatory framework for carbon capture, utilization, and storage and carbon dioxide removal to support the safe and effective deployment of these technologies. SB 905 also established a moratorium on pipeline transport of CO₂ until updated federal safety regulations were finalized.

With the timing of federal rulemaking still uncertain, the state has now taken action to pass SB 614 (Stern), which gives California the authority to define safe CO₂ transport. The bill lifts the moratorium on intrastate CO₂ pipelines and directs the State Fire Marshal to adopt safety regulations by 2026 that meet or exceed federal standards proposed by PHMSA in January 2025. SB 614 builds on the framework established under SB 905, ensuring that transport infrastructure for carbon management can be developed safely and consistently.

Looking ahead: Coordination across agencies will be essential to align safety, permitting, and public engagement processes. Effective implementation of both laws will help California advance carbon management projects responsibly and transparently.

Indirect Source Review for Mobile Source Pollution

Under the Clean Air Act, states and localities have the authority to regulate emissions from stationary facilities that attract mobile sources of pollution. In California, mobile sources contribute the majority of the state’s NOx emissions (a precursor to ozone and particular matter), and the transportation sector accounts for 40 percent of California’s greenhouse gas emissions. Indirect Source Review (ISR) can be a powerful tool to regulate mobile sources of pollution at facilities like airports, warehouses, ports, and distribution centers, and several districts in California have promulgated rules for warehouses and new development. This session, lawmakers considered two ISR bills. AB 914 (Garcia) sought to affirm the CARB’s authority to promulgate statewide ISR rules and clarify a pathway for state-wide regulation of pollution from major transportation hubs. The bill ultimately stalled, but the debate underscored the importance of using every available state policy tool to cut harmful emissions in the face of federal attacks on California’s mobile source regulations.

SB 34 (Richardson) would have imposed restrictions on the South Coast Air Quality Management District’s ISR rule for the Ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach, establishing a harmful precedent of legislative constraint on air district ISR authority. Governor Newsom vetoed the bill, citing the need for the state to maintain every tool at its disposal to reduce air and climate pollution.

Looking ahead: As federal efforts to weaken mobile-source regulations continue, California’s leadership will depend on leveraging its full suite of policy tools — including ISR — to advance clean, reliable, and equitable transportation decarbonization. Clarifying statewide authority to adopt ISR rules could enable the state to drive deeper emission reductions across transportation and industrial corridors, accelerate the deployment of zero-emission technologies, and deliver cleaner air for communities most affected by mobile source pollution.

Other Key Measures

The legislature also advanced several major measures with broad implications for reliability, affordability, and the state’s long-term energy transition.

Regional Grid Integration – AB 825 authorizes California’s participation in a western regional electricity market, paving the way for greater coordination across state lines. Regional integration is expected to enhance grid reliability, lower costs for ratepayers by hundreds of millions annually, and enable more efficient use of renewable and clean firm generation resources across the West. This marks an important step toward building the transmission and market structures needed for a decarbonized, resilient power system.

Refinery Transition – With two of California’s refineries announcing closure, concerns had been mounting regarding potential gasoline supply shortages that could increase prices at the pump. SB 237 (Grayson) sought to mitigate potential fuel supply disruptions and price volatility during the state’s clean energy transition. The bill streamlines permitting for certain in-state oil projects, authorizes the Governor to suspend summer-blend fuel requirements if gasoline prices rise sharply, and directs the California Energy Commission to study alternative fuel blends and explore a regional approach to stabilizing prices across western states. The measure underscores the complexity of sustaining climate progress while maintaining affordability.

The Path Forward

This session demonstrated California’s ability to pair ambitious climate policy with practical solutions for affordability and reliability. With landmark measures now on the books, the challenge ahead lies in implementation — translating statute into durable progress, sound regulation, and tangible results for households and businesses while sustaining momentum toward the state’s 2045 climate and energy goals.",https://cdn.catf.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/10133250/california-clean-energy.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:00:54.594520

The program is designed to collect accurate and comprehensive data on greenhouse gas emissions from large industrial sources across the United States. Its primary purpose is to provide policymakers, businesses, researchers and the public with reliable information to track emissions trends and evaluate the effectiveness of climate policies.

“Ending the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program would jeopardize public health and the environment,” Raoul said. “This program is a longstanding source of reliable greenhouse gas emissions data that strengthens our nation’s competitiveness and allows policymakers to plan emissions reductions effectively. I join my fellow attorneys general in opposing this unlawful proposal.”

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program was established in 2009 by the EPA under the authority of the Clean Air Act, following a congressional mandate. The program requires facilities releasing 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, along with suppliers of fossil fuels and certain industrial gases, to report their annual emissions. The program has been recognized as the most comprehensive national inventory of greenhouse gas data in the world, covering about 85% to 90% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions. This data has informed regulatory actions, corporate sustainability strategies and research on emissions trends across key economic sectors.

Last month, the EPA issued a Proposed Rule seeking to eliminate the program arguing that it does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to require emissions reporting and that the data collected isn’t necessary for any current or future federal rule or regulation.

Raoul and the coalition argue in their comment letter that the lack of emissions reporting could lead to higher greenhouse gas concentrations, contributing to climate change, extreme weather events and ecosystem disruption. The coalition maintains that without emissions data, states would struggle to develop effective mitigation strategies, resulting in severe consequences for public health and the environment nationwide. Businesses would also face significant financial challenges in planning for emissions reductions, making it harder to compete with companies in countries that maintain robust emissions reporting and compliance systems. The coalition asserts that the proposed rule is arbitrary and capricious and based on unexplained and unsupported changes in the EPA’s interpretation of its statutory authority.

The program requires facilities releasing 25,000 metric tons or more of carbon dioxide equivalent, along with suppliers of fossil fuels and certain industrial gases, to report their annual emissions.

It has been recognized as “the most comprehensive national inventory of greenhouse gas data in the world” and the “gold standard of emissions reporting,” covering about 85-90% of total U.S. greenhouse gas emissions – providing benefits that dramatically outweigh the minor burden reporting poses to a covered facility. This data has informed regulatory actions, corporate sustainability strategies, and research on emissions trends across key economic sectors.

Last month, the EPA issued a Proposed Rule seeking to virtually eliminate the GHGRP, arguing that it does not have the authority under the Clean Air Act to require emissions reporting and that the data collected isn’t necessary for any current or future federal rule or regulation.

In the comment letter, the multistate coalition argues:

Lack of emissions reporting could lead to higher greenhouse gas concentrations, contributing to climate change, extreme weather events, and ecosystem disruption.

Without emissions data, states and businesses would struggle to develop effective mitigation strategies, resulting in severe consequences for public health and the environment nationwide. At the same time, companies would face significant financial challenges in planning for emissions reductions, making it harder to compete with companies in countries that maintain robust emissions reporting and compliance systems.

The Proposed Rule, if finalized, would be arbitrary and capricious and based on unexplained and unsupported changes in EPA’s interpretation of its statutory authority.

Attorney General Brown co-leads this letter with the attorney general of California, and they are joined by the attorneys general of Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, the District of Columbia, Hawaiʻi, Illinois, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, New Jersey, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, and the Chief Legal Office of the City of Chicago and New York City in filing this comment letter.

Emissions

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

For LIHTC developers, rooftop and carport solar facilities on affordable housing properties are often prime candidates under category 3.","The window to pair affordable housing incentives with clean energy credits is narrowing, and developers of low-income housing tax credit (LIHTC) properties face a pivotal period over the next 18 months. The Section 45L new energy efficient home credit, a valuable financing tool for housing developers which was substantially enhanced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), now sunsets for housing acquired after June 30, 2026, as called for under H.R. 1, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA).

At the same time, the clean electricity investment tax credit (ITC) for solar, under Internal Revenue Code (IRC) Section 48E, is also on a compressed runway and under new foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions. OBBBA requires projects to either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by Dec. 31, 2027, and the supply chain for facilities financed must be heavily divested from China and other nations of concern by 2026 to secure the full value of the credit. For sponsors navigating lease-up schedules, financing timelines and rising construction costs, the multiple near-term deadlines present both a challenge and an opportunity.

Affordable housing developers still have opportunities to leverage Sections 45L and 48E credits, as well as the Low-Income Communities Bonus (LICB) program, but they must act quickly and proactively adapt or even pivot to meet new near-term deadlines for eligibility.

The Lease-Up Clock for Section 45L

The Section 45L effective date is based on when a unit is acquired, meaning the timing is driven by when the financed improvements are placed in service, and the housing is first leased or sold. For LIHTC developers, this timing sensitivity makes lease-up as important as physical construction. To claim Section 45L credits in the 2025 tax year, apartments must be placed in service and leased or sold before Dec. 31, 2025. If lease-up occurs after June 30, 2026, the credit disappears entirely. This creates pressure for sponsors to coordinate not only construction schedules but also leasing strategies that align with financing needs and equity adjusters.

The Inflation Reduction Act made Section 45L particularly attractive to affordable housing developers because it no longer reduces LIHTC basis when combined with the LIHTC. The Section 45L credit itself can range from $500 to $5,000 per unit, depending on whether developments meet the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s ENERGY STAR or U.S. Department of Energy’s (DOE) Zero Energy Ready Home standards and whether prevailing wage requirements are satisfied.

The approaching sunset means that Section 45L qualification must be treated as a race against the calendar. Importantly, since Section 45L qualification is determined on a unit-by-unit basis, credits can be claimed for the proportion of Section 45L qualifying apartments that are leased up by June 30, 2026, even if all apartments on the property will not be leased at that time. For example, if 80% of the apartments are leased by the June 30, 2026, deadline, then the property owner can still claim 80% of the available Section 45L credits.

The ITC for Residential Solar as a Boost and a Backstop

While Section 45L is now only available through June 2026, small solar installations that qualify for the Section 48E ITC offer a critical backstop. Under the OBBBA, solar facilities must either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027. Developers that begin construction by the July 2026 deadline retain access to the four-year continuity safe harbor, allowing additional time to complete developments without losing eligibility.

For LIHTC properties, small on-site systems of 1.5 megawatts (MW) AC or less are particularly well positioned. According to new IRS guidance on beginning construction issued Aug. 15, Notice 2025-42, these systems can still rely on both the established 5% safe harbor test, achieved by incurring at least 5% of energy property costs before the deadline, or the physical work test. While the physical work test remains the same, requiring demonstrable progress on-site or through off-site fabrication under binding contracts, facilities will now need to more significantly demonstrate and document that construction has begun because of the administration and U.S. Department of the Treasury’s focus on stricter enforcement to prevent perceived circumventions. The result is that distributed solar remains one of the few asset classes where developers can choose their compliance path, an advantage in a market where interconnection and procurement delays are common.

The ITC also benefits from the fact that solar credits, like Section 45L, do not reduce LIHTC basis under current law. This allows developers to fully stack LIHTC equity, the ITC (with potential bonus credits such as the low-income communities bonus), and Section 45L where eligible. For developments where the Section 45L value is at risk because of timing, small photovoltaic systems can “backfill” the capital stack to an extent by providing alternative credits not tied to lease-up schedules and with a longer horizon.

The Low-Income Communities Bonus Credit Program

The LICB program (also known as the Environmental Justice Solar and Wind Capacity Limitation) established by the IRA has been a particularly important tool for LIHTC properties leveraging small solar. Administered by the DOE and the IRS, the LICB program selects qualified solar or wind facilities under 5 MW serving low-income households, affordable housing or designated low-income census tracts up to 1.8 GWs in annual aggregate capacity (unused amounts may be carried forward). Awardees are then eligible to increase their ITC by an additional 10% or 20%.

The program is divided into four categories that cover facilities located in low-income communities or on Indian land (categories 1 and 2 respectively), low-income residential buildings (category 3), and low-income economic benefits projects (category 4). The 1.8 GWs are shared across the categories, plus unallocated capacity carried over from the previous year. In 2025, category 1 received an approximately 33% allocation, or 643.6 MWs; categories 2 and 3 each received approximately 12%, or 243.6 MWs; and category 4 received 43%, or 843.6 MWs, for a total of 1.974 GWs.

For LIHTC developers, rooftop and carport solar facilities on affordable housing properties are often prime candidates under category 3.

The challenge is uncertainty: while the 2025 application round remained active after the change in administration and the IRS program page remains active and still includes the annual awards schedule out to 2032, questions persist. It is unclear whether it will continue to be implemented in 2026 on time or at all given legislative changes, administrative delays, and the administration’s energy agenda and actions taken so far to stymie solar generation, in addition to wind.

Despite this uncertainty, developers should prepare: if the next allocation round proceeds as planned, housing and solar developers should be ready to submit applications as early as possible. The applications require detailed project information, interconnection status and documentation tying the facility to eligible communities. Because allocations are competitive, readiness at the time of application can determine whether a development secures the bonus.

Under the existing Biden-era schedule still provided on the IRS program page, the 2026 round will open Feb. 2, 2026, at 9 a.m. with the standard 30-day initial application window, which is set to close March 3. The rolling application period then closes Aug. 7 for all other applications outside of the initial 30-day window.

Documentation and Compliance Risks

The ability to claim these credits depends heavily on documentation. A solar developer should prepare for heightened scrutiny of beginning-of-construction evidence, whether relying on the 5% safe harbor or physical work, by creating and retaining extensive documentation including but not limited to binding contracts, invoices, fabrication logs, site photographs and interconnection applications to substantiate eligibility.

Developers will also need to prove compliance with FEOC restrictions on prohibited foreign entities and material assistance starting in 2026. Restrictions on material assistance up to the thresholds initially set in the OBBBA can be avoided by establishing that construction has begun prior to 2026, but the prohibition on prohibited entities as taxpayers goes into effect with minimal exemptions and safe harbors. Treasury has not yet issued guidance or regulations on how the restrictions will be implemented but developers can begin reasonably preparing by examining business and project structures based on what the legislation has laid out. While FEOC compliance will be the responsibility of the taxpayer that owns the solar facility, any developer that works with the solar taxpayer will need to be prepared as well to assist with due diligence.

Prevailing wage and apprenticeship (PWA) compliance can also play a role. For multifamily developments, full Section 45L value is only available if wage requirements are met (the apprenticeship requirement does not apply to Section 45L), potentially adding costs but also significantly increasing the per-unit credit. While facilities less than 1 MW automatically qualify for the PWA credit step-up rate, if financing from the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) or other federal financial assistance assists the property, this would trigger wage requirements. Facilities more than 1 MW must of course adhere to the requirements as required by Section 48E.

Developers must weigh these compliance obligations against the potential tax benefits and ensure that payroll and certification documentation is in place well before credits are claimed.

What Developers Should Do Now

For LIHTC sponsors, the strategic imperative is clear: accelerate lease-ups where possible to capture Section 45L credits before July 2026, while simultaneously advancing rooftop solar facilities that can secure ITC value. This dual approach provides a hedge against timing risk. If apartments are leased by June 30, 2026, Section 45L credits can be claimed; if lease-up slips, solar can still anchor the financing structure. Early coordination with investors and syndicators is vital, since equity adjusters may hinge on the year credits are recognized or when developments are placed in service.

Rooftop and carport arrays at LIHTC properties are strong candidates for LICB program awards, particularly category 3. Category 1 and 2 applicable facilities that are in low-income communities or on Indian land qualify for a 10% increase. Category 3 and 4 applicable facilities that are part of a qualified low-income residential building project or a qualified low-income economic benefit project are eligible for a 20% increase.

The LICB program, if accessed, can transform the economics of LIHTC developments with on-site solar. A 20% bonus layered on top of the base 30% ITC materially strengthens the case for including distributed solar, even in developments where Section 45L may slip away.

LIHTC and Residential Solar Resilience

Two clocks are ticking for affordable housing developers. The first is the Section 45L clock, which measures not just when developments are completed, but when housing is leased. The second is the ITC clock, which requires projects to either begin construction by July 4, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027. While these deadlines create pressure and urgency, there are also opportunities.

The LICB program adds a third dimension. Its future may be uncertain, but the rewards for developers that prepare could be substantial. In a financing environment where every dollar counts, the difference between securing or missing a LICB allocation could reshape a development’s feasibility.

For developers willing to accelerate schedules, tighten documentation practices and integrate small solar into their developments, the near-term period represents a chance to capture substantial additional value without sacrificing LIHTC equity. Treat Section 45L as a race to lease-up, treat small solar as both a backstop and a catalyst, and treat the LICB program as a potential bonus too valuable to overlook. The next three to nine months will determine whether affordable housing properties leave millions of dollars on the table or seize the chance to strengthen financial resilience and energy security for decades to come.

“I hope Mr Lei can take a look at employee Wang Peizhi’s sudden death,” she wrote.
Within Xiaomi, Wang’s death was not widely reported, two of his former colleagues said.
No changes to the team’s working hours were made.","The wife of a Xiaomi employee is seeking recognition for her husband, who died of a heart attack when work pressure piled up after layoffs during the COVID-19 pandemic

By Yuan Gao / Bloomberg

Months before he dropped to the floor in agony while grocery shopping with his young son, Wang Peizhi (王培志) stayed up all night frantically preparing Xiaomi Corp’s flagship store for the launch of its first electric vehicle (EV).

Wang’s work had piled up after the company, led by billionaire cofounder Lei Jun (雷軍), unveiled a bold plan to become the first tech firm to successfully shift into automaking.

Lei, 55, staked his reputation on the transition, a feat even Apple Inc failed to achieve, vowing that it was his “last entrepreneurial project.”

A key part of executing that vision was Xiaomi’s retail network — Wang’s responsibility. To compete with the likes of BYD Co and Tesla Inc in China’s burgeoning EV market, the company had decided to overhaul its chain of retail outlets by converting stores designed for smartphones into showrooms to feature full-sized sedans and SUVs.

However, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Xiaomi fired about half of the staff responsible for the effort, leaving about 10 people, according to a former employee and a current staff member, both of whom worked with Wang and asked for anonymity to discuss sensitive issues.

The small team felt their workload sharply increase at the beginning of last year, when the company raced to roll out EV stores in time for the launch of its signature SU7 sedan, the people said.

Wang worked longer hours as he took on the team’s biggest projects in addition to his duties carrying out routine maintenance on the company’s web of stores, they said.

Plus, he was based in Xiaomi’s headquarters in Beijing, making him more visible to top company brass.

In the first eight months of the year, he worked on at least 267 retail stores, often retrofitting stores with an area for EVs, according to a trove of internal documents, photographs and WeChat messages reviewed by Bloomberg News.

On Aug. 25 last year, less than three days after he collapsed in front of his son, he died of a heart attack at the age of 34.

Local authorities ruled that Wang’s death was not related to his job at Xiaomi, but his widow is convinced that his punishing work schedule contributed to his death.

“He was treated just like a leaf: When it falls, people step on it without noticing its existence,” Luna Liu told Bloomberg News.

She agreed to speak publicly for the first time since his death because she thinks his case deserves more attention. She also shared thousands of her late husband’s work-related WeChat messages out of concern that Chinese companies push their employees too hard, with little regard for their health and welfare.

Xiaomi had given Wang more responsibility because he took his duties so seriously. He was in charge of some of the company’s most high-profile projects, including its flagship showroom just off Tiananmen Square. He still had dozens of other projects to manage at the same time.

Wang’s motivation for working long hours is complicated. People close to him said he felt a strong sense of obligation and would take on tasks himself because there was not anyone else who could share his duties. He also drove himself hard, keeping track of hundreds of projects and grinding for hours to make sure he delivered on what the company needed.

He was paid well by Chinese standards, bringing home about 600,000 yuan (US$84,000) a year, including stock options, according to his widow.

However, he lived under “immense mental strain” because he was caught between the demands of top company leaders and the realities on the ground, she said.

“He was sandwiched between his bosses and the stores whenever there was an issue with one of the projects,” she said.

In response to a detailed request for comment from Bloomberg News, a spokesperson for Xiaomi said: “We are deeply saddened by the unfortunate passing of our colleague and extend our deepest condolences to his family and friends. At the same time, we do our utmost to provide support and assistance to our colleague’s family under the applicable laws and regulations.”

Xiaomi is not the only company pushing its employees to work long hours. Staff across China’s tech sector complain that they spend all their time at the office. Several told Bloomberg News that overwork — defined by the WHO as more than 55 hours a week — is prevalent in many top firms.

Wang’s story offers a rare glimpse of the enormous pressure inside China’s tech companies. One reason is a renewed urgency to stay competitive in China’s increasingly crowded market, where battles for customers in sectors from EVs to e-commerce are red hot. Rivalry with the US in semiconductors and artificial intelligence (AI) has also brought the culture to some state-affiliated companies.

Excessive work culture, dubbed “996” for the expectation to be in the office from 9am to 9pm, six days a week, is deeply rooted in China’s tech sector.

A decade ago, it was driven by the belief that hard work would reap rewards as rapid economic growth created opportunities, according to Mary Gallagher, a professor of global affairs at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana.

Now, it is more about national priorities and a sense of patriotic duty as China competes in chips, AI and EVs.

“These industries that are doing so well — including on export markets — and are so important to the confidence that [Chinese President] Xi Jinping [習近平] wants to see in the economy,” said Gallagher, the author of Authoritarian Legality in China: Law, Workers, and the State.

“There’s enormous pressure in those places,” she said.

Lei’s pivot to EVs began with an initial investment of US$1.4 billion, followed by massive spending on nearly every corner of the supply chain, from batteries and chips to air suspension and sensors.

In all, it pumped more than US$1.6 billion into more than 100 suppliers from 2021 to last year, according to data compiled by Chinese analytics firm Zhangtongshe and Bloomberg.

As EV production was ramping up at the beginning of last year, company leadership also turned their attention to boosting sales. Two months before Xiaomi launched the SU7, Wang took on even more work. He was sending WeChat messages to colleagues from early in the morning to late at night, with some of them sent from his home. On one particularly long day at the end of January last year, he asked about the installation of mirrors at an outlet at about 2:30am. A few hours later, he pressed a furniture supplier to finish a project five times faster than originally quoted.

“At one point he was shouldering the workload of seven or eight people. He said he was busy like a spinning top,” Liu said. “Many times I told him: ‘Although you come back home every day, sometimes I feel I haven’t seen you for days.’”

After the Lunar New Year holiday in February last year, Wang worked at a relentless pace, exchanging hundreds of photos and messages with colleagues about the flagship showroom in Beijing, according to the collection of documents reviewed by Bloomberg.

As the location neared completion at the end of March, Wang spent all night there, toiling to fix the lighting system and charging poles in the basement. He also raced to get the floor reinforced after finding it had cracked under the weight of a car.

One evening, Xiaomi president Lu Weibing (盧偉冰) announced in a post on Chinese social media that he would make a long-awaited visit to the flagship store in Beijing the next morning. After sharing the news with a colleague, Wang worried about getting the showroom ready at short notice.

“Tomorrow decides everything,” he wrote on WeChat.

His hard work paid off: About two weeks later, Lei lauded the flagship location as “one of the most iconic among our 59 stores nationwide.”

The SU7 launch in March last year catapulted Xiaomi into China’s EV market.

Costing 215,900 yuan, it comes in below the 219,800 yuan asking price for a BYD Han L and the 235,500 yuan price tag of a Tesla Model 3. The Porsche Taycan — the vehicle to which the SU7 bears an uncanny resemblance — starts at about US$100,000.

Since the unveiling, Xiaomi’s stock has soared about 200 percent in Hong Kong, but the company still has a long way to go before it could break into the elite club of automakers. It has set a delivery target of 350,000 units this year, up from its previous goal of 300,000. By comparison, China’s top car brand, BYD Co, sold about 4.3 million EVs and hybrids last year, many overseas, while Tesla moved about 1.8 million vehicles globally.

Xiaomi has “democratized technology” and created an image that has resonated well with Chinese consumers, said Bill Russo, founder and chief executive officer of Shanghai-based advisory firm Automobility.

“Xiaomi is a known consumer brand that makes technology affordable and that’s been their value prop from the beginning for virtually every device that they manufacture,” Russo said. “Lei Jun is kind of a rock star in the perception of the Chinese consumer.”

In the past few years, China has been gripped by a national debate over the need to improve work-life balance. Social media platforms such as Weibo and Xiaohongshu have been flooded with posts — which are impossible to verify — about long working hours. The topic took on greater importance in the past few years following a series of high-profile deaths attributed to overwork, with the Chinese Communist Party voicing its support for protecting the rights of workers.

Work culture appeared to improve during the pandemic, when some tech staff were allowed to work flexible hours. The Chinese government also rolled out some efforts to improve working environments in an attempt to beat back the public outcry following a series of deaths attributed to overwork. Public officials held discussions and announced plans to improve working situations.

In 2021, Chinese authorities opened an investigation into working conditions at e-commerce company PDD Holdings Inc following the death of an employee in her early 20s. The employee collapsed while walking home with colleagues. Her death sparked a social media backlash against PDD and the relentless working schedules expected of its workers. The following year, a content moderator at Bilibili Inc, China’s largest anime streaming site, died from a brain hemorrhage.

Both companies have denied wrongdoing.

Neither PDD nor Bilibili responded to requests for comment.

China’s national labor laws cap standard working time at 44 hours per week, but employers can negotiate with trade unions and employees to extend that. Figures from the Chinese National Bureau of Statistics show that staff at Chinese companies have worked longer hours in the past few years. Last year, the average workweek totaled 49 hours with no break, up slightly from 47.9 in 2022.

Full-time employees in the US last year worked an average of 43 hours a week, according to a Gallup survey.

This year, the Chinese government released an action plan to “regulate the unwholesome work culture,” pushing provincial governments to take a greater role in preventing excessive hours.

“Local authorities are urged to better protect workers’ rights to rest and tighten supervision over employers’ behaviors of illegally lengthening employees’ working hours without permission,” the state-owned China Daily reported in March.

However, the problem has not gone away.

Alibaba Group Holding Ltd’s engineers canceled vacations and worked through this year’s Lunar New Year holiday to play catch up after DeepSeek shocked the global tech industry with its low-cost, powerful AI model in January.

PDD, locked in a price war with Alibaba and JD.com, also made some staff cancel their holiday plans during the same period.

It offered overtime bonuses to those who stayed behind to keep its Web site running, said one employee in Shanghai, who asked for anonymity to discuss their schedule.

The employee, in her mid-30s, said that she received a bonus of about 3,000 yuan after working four days during the holidays.

Alibaba and PDD did not respond to requests for comment.

Another engineer, at Shanghai-based chip equipment maker Ueascend, said that he was only able to take one day off per week since he joined the company last year.

Team calls were sometimes scheduled on the few days he had off, and when urgent projects came in, he would work from morning until 11pm for days, said the 25-year-old, who also asked for anonymity to talk about their working hours.

Staff at drone maker DJI and Apple supplier Desay Battery also claimed poor working conditions.

Bloomberg News was unable to reach Ueascend.

Desay Battery did not respond to requests for comment.

A DJI spokesperson said that its staff work an average of nine hours per day and regularly get a two-day weekend.

In April, Chinese media reported that Xiaomi was requiring employees to work at least 11.5 hours a day, with those who worked less than eight hours were told to submit a formal explanation.

Xiaomi did not respond to questions about the media reports.

A survey published last year by Chinese job hunting platform Maimai showed that Xiaomi workers averaged 11.5 hours a day, among the most in the country’s tech industry.

Staff at ByteDance Ltd. Meituan and Tencent Holdings Ltd all clocked double-digit hours, according to the survey, which did not explain its methodology.

In the US, the average workday spanned 8 hours and 44 minutes, with just 5 percent of employees working on weekends, according to data from workforce analytics company ActivTrak.

ByteDance declined to comment, while Meituan and Tencent did not respond to questions from Bloomberg News.

Wang’s long hours did not go unnoticed. He was praised by his bosses for expanding Xiaomi’s network of EV showrooms, according to his internal performance review, which covered the first half of last year.

The company credited him with rolling out new stores “at a unified standard, with high efficiency and quality,” the review said.

In the weeks leading up to his death in August last year, Wang worked on at least 80 stores, according to his WeChat messages.

Most of the sites he visited were in Beijing, but he kept a frantic schedule, criss-crossing northeastern China.

Only two team members were available to help him with a broad range of tasks that included renovation as well as supplier management and accounting, according to one of the former colleagues.

During a three-day trip at the beginning of the month that he died, he visited at least 14 Xiaomi outlets in Harbin, Changchun and Shenyang. He made his last business trip on Aug. 20 last year, visiting at least three stores in Tianjin, about 30 minutes from Beijing by train or a 1.5-hour drive.

On Aug. 22, Wang felt so weak he called in sick and went to a hospital for medical checks. While there, he received dozens of WeChat messages from staff at about five different outlets. He told a store manager in Shenyang that he was sick and someone else would visit his projects that day.

“Xiaomi’s employees are all warriors,” the manager replied, encouraging Wang to get better and including a crying facepalm emoji.

The work exchanges lasted until at least 4pm. Later that day, he took the trip with his son to a grocery store. There, his heart seized up, briefly stopping the flow of blood to his brain, and he slumped to the floor.

He was rushed to an intensive care unit by ambulance, his widow said.

Less than three days later he was dead.

Bloomberg News reviewed a copy of Wang’s death certificate that listed acute myocardial infarction — commonly known as a heart attack — as the cause of his death.

Wang was in good health at the time of his death, had no pre-existing conditions and maintained an active lifestyle, his widow said.

He underwent regular annual physical exams, but missed his appointment last year because of a scheduling conflict, she said.

He would spend his time off with his family, going on hikes in the mountains around Beijing and accompanying his son to extracurricular activities, she and a colleague said.

He regularly went on 5km runs to ease the stress of his job, another colleague said.

Wang’s widow told Xiaomi that she believed her husband had died from excessive work.

The company reported the incident to local authorities, which determined that Wang’s death was not work related.

According to Chinese guidelines, an employee is deemed to have had a work-related death only if they die within 48 hours of receiving treatment for an injury sustained on the job.

The Beijing Municipal Human Resources and Social Security Bureau did not respond to a request for comment.

Xiaomi denied any wrongdoing.

It offered the family 50,000 yuan as a hardship payment, but no funds were paid out, Liu said.

The company helped her access her husband’s investment portfolio, but later rescinded some of his stock options, she added.

Days after her husband passed away, Liu took to Sina Weibo to address Xiaomi’s boss directly.

“I hope Mr Lei can take a look at employee Wang Peizhi’s sudden death,” she wrote. “My husband contributed to the success of Xiaomi’s EVs. He was so tired because of too much pressure from work.”

Her posts gained little traction, with some people commenting that she was just seeking additional compensation from Xiaomi.

By the end of the year, she stopped using Sina Weibo.

“It’s okay if I was misunderstood or insulted, but the company still owes me an apology,” she wrote in one of her final posts.

Within Xiaomi, Wang’s death was not widely reported, two of his former colleagues said.

Zhang Jian (張建), a Xiaomi executive in charge of nationwide stores at the time, hosted an internal meeting about Wang’s death, according to the current employee.

He told colleagues that Wang had died from a heart attack and the company was talking to his family.

No changes to the team’s working hours were made.

Zhang has been promoted to head the company’s EV sales in China.

These days, the workload at the company varies by department.

On Wang’s former team, tasks usually pile up at the end of the month, the current employee said.

Another current Xiaomi employee who works on a different team in Beijing said they usually work between 50 and 60 hours per week and rarely go in on weekends.

A separate staffer on the company’s smartphone research team said they work more than 50 hours per week, including occasional hours on Saturday and Sunday.

Wang’s widow said he left his family with debts totaling about 4 million yuan, including the mortgage on their house.

His life insurance policy, provided by Xiaomi, disbursed a one-time payment of about 800,000 yuan.

At home in Beijing, she has tried to piece together the memories of her late husband by organizing his WeChat chat logs — most of which are related to his work.

However, she does not have access to a separate app he used for internal Xiaomi messages, leaving the full picture of his job responsibilities unknown.

What she is sure of is that she did not see her husband often during his final months.

“The work took all his time when he was needed as a father, as a husband,” she said, adding that Wang rarely returned home before 9pm and even then his phone kept buzzing with work messages.

“Almost every time he came back from work, our son was either already asleep or just about to go to bed,” she said.

One of the last messages Wang sent was a desperate plea for a contractor to work faster.

“What I signed up for was a life or death commitment,” Wang wrote. “Don’t leave me hanging.”",https://img.taipeitimes.com/images/2025/11/05/p07-251105-hkje.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 16:07:40.455996

Meanwhile, Congress and the Trump administration are redefining America’s role in critical minerals, fusion energy, and infrastructure resilience, signaling that even amid fiscal uncertainty, the race to secure the nation’s energy future has never been more dynamic.

Clean Energy Projects Termination

On October 2, the Department of Energy (DOE) announced the termination of 223 projects totaling more than $7.5 billion across multiple program offices, including Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains (MESC), ARPA-E, and Fossil Energy (FE).

While many of the cuts appear to target projects in blue states, they have also sparked frustration among Republican lawmakers. Over two dozen electricity grid improvement initiatives — some aimed at adding new power capacity — were canceled, fueling concerns about potential increases in electricity prices.

Reports also indicate internal disagreements within DOE leadership over many of the project cuts, with the result that Undersecretary of Energy Wells Griffith was replaced on an acting basis by Alex Fitzsimmons, who is also serving as the Director of the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response.

The fate of the remaining $22 billion in DOE-funded projects, many of which would benefit Republican-leaning regions, remains uncertain.

Critical Minerals

New International Initiatives

On October 23, the US International Development Finance Corporation (DFC) launched a Critical Mineral Consortium (CMC) with Orion Resource Partners and the Abu Dhabi–based ADQ, committing $1.8 billion toward a targeted $5 billion fund to finance mineral projects in emerging markets. The initiative aims to strengthen allied supply chains through investment, offtake management, domestic processing, and technology scaling.

Following China’s restrictions on rare earth exports, US officials signaled plans to expand investment in African mining and refining operations. Wayne Wall, Senior Director for Middle East and Africa Affairs at the National Security Council, said the administration aims to leverage financing from the DFC and Export-Import Bank (EXIM) to offer African nations an alternative to Chinese-backed infrastructure and mining deals.

In Congress, the Senate Foreign Relations Committee advanced an amended version of the bipartisan Critical Minerals Partnership Act (S. 2550), sponsored by Senators John Curtis (R-UT) and Jeanne Shaheen (D-NH). The bill authorizes $50 million for FY2026 to bolster global mineral supply chain security, empower the State Department’s Minerals Security Partnership to coordinate investments, and support the creation of a database of critical mineral projects to attract private-sector participation. It further underscores governance standards, recycling, joint financing, and risk insurance mechanisms for mining ventures.

US-Australia Critical Minerals Alliance and Investments

Complementing these efforts, the United States and Australia agreed on October 20 to a nonbinding framework to deepen cooperation in critical minerals mining, processing, and supply. Each country pledged at least $1 billion in new project financing to secure mineral supply chains vital to clean energy and defense. The agreement also establishes a joint response group to identify vulnerabilities and expedite mineral deliveries. Simultaneously, EXIM announced seven letters of interest totaling more than $2.2 billion to advance US critical minerals projects in Australia, including rare earth elements, graphite, magnesium, titanium, and scandium. Six of the seven projects are being pursued in partnership with Export Finance Australia (EFA) under the EXIM-EFA “Single Point of Entry” framework, demonstrating allied cooperation to counter China’s export dominance and ensure Western supply-chain resilience.

Critical Minerals Investment and Project Approval

Earlier in October, the White House announced that the Department of War would take a 10% equity stake in Trilogy Metals, a Vancouver-based mining company with claims in northwest Alaska. The Department of the Interior also reissued right-of-way permits for the Ambler Road project — a 211-mile corridor designed to unlock access to Alaska’s mineral deposits. Both actions were framed as advancing national security and revitalizing domestic mining capacity to reduce US dependence on China.

Also, at the beginning of November, Vulcan Elements announced a $1.4 billion partnership with the U.S. government and ReElement Technologies to establish a fully domestic, vertically-integrated rare-earth magnet supply‐chain capable of producing 10,000 metric tons annually and recycling end-of-life magnets and e-waste. Subject to due diligence and final agreement, the financing structure includes a $620 million direct loan from the Office of Strategic Capital and $50 million of federal incentives via the CHIPS and Science Act. This marks the first time CHIPS Act authority has been used to support critical-minerals or rare earth investment, underscoring a strategic shift toward domestic supply-chain security for magnets used in advanced defense and non-defense sectors.

LPO Is Now the Energy Dominance Financing Program

On October 16, Secretary Chris Wright announced that the DOE’s Loan Programs Office (LPO) has been rebranded as the Energy Dominance Financing (EDF) Program, keeping with the new authority granted in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) passed in July. Its first project under this new designation — a $1.6 billion loan guarantee to an American Electric Power (AEP) subsidiary — will fund the reconductoring and rebuilding of approximately 5,000 miles of transmission lines across Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma, and West Virginia.

Secretary Wright indicated that the administration will continue utilizing the EDF for projects originally proposed under the Biden administration, noting, “As we’re reviewing these things, of course, not all of them were nonsense.” While not the strong words of support all applicants were looking for, this shows that the EDF Program (formerly LPO) is open for business, a good sign for projects that align with the administration’s objectives.

Following Secretary Wright’s announcement, DOE issued an Interim Final Rule amending DOE’s loan guarantee regulations to implement the Energy Dominance Financing provisions of the OBBBA, which amended Section 1706 to authorize the Secretary of Energy to guarantee loans of up to a total principal amount of $250 billion through September 30, 2028. The rule replaces the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment (EIR) framework established under the Inflation Reduction Act with a significantly broader lending authority and mandate, revising Part 609 to define “energy infrastructure” to mean “a facility, and associated equipment, used for enabling the identification, leasing, development, production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining, and generation needed for energy and critical minerals.” DOE is also revising Part 609 to reflect OBBBA’s elimination of the application requirement to “include an analysis of how the proposed project will engage with and affect associated communities.” DOE is providing a comment period until December 29, 2025.

Federal Regulatory Commission (FERC)

On October 23, the Energy Secretary invoked a rarely used provision of the Department of Energy Organization Act, directing the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to initiate a preliminary Advance Notice of Proposed Rulemaking on reforms to improve the timeliness and efficiency of interconnecting large energy loads to the transmission grid. Read more about this update from our Mintz colleagues here.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration officially appointed Laura Swett as FERC Chair on October 20, following her swearing-in ceremony. Swett’s elevation, which follows the White House’s earlier push for former Democratic Chair Willie Phillips to resign, gives Republicans a majority on the Commission and renews scrutiny of FERC’s political independence.

Fusion Commercialization Roadmaps

A number of studies outlining the path and impact of fusion commercialization were rolled out during the month. On October 16, DOE’s Office of Science released its Fusion Science & Technology Roadmap, outlining a federal strategy to build the infrastructure and partnerships necessary for commercial fusion energy scale-up in the 2030s. The Roadmap identifies 10 key actions across three pillars — Build, Innovate, and Grow — focused on closing gaps in materials and technology, advancing scientific research, and expanding the US fusion ecosystem through public-private and international collaboration. The Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP)–led Commission on the Scaling of Fusion Energy also released their culminating report, “Fusion Forward: Powering America’s Future,” underscoring the imperative to declare fusion energy a national security priority, expand fusion leadership, and inject $10 billion to drive commercialization.

Mintz and ML Strategies continue to play an active role in this space, supporting the launch of Catalyzing California’s Fusion Advantage: Roadmap to Commercialization, a study led by General Atomics and released by the San Diego Regional Economic Development Corporation (EDC). The report examines the economic potential and growth trajectory of California’s emerging fusion energy sector.

In July of 2025, the government made the decision to eliminate the federal EV tax credits that had been around since 2008.
General Motors saw a response in its third-quarter sales report, stating the automotive manufacturer saw a loss of $1.6 billion.
Jacobson added that the focus would go more into cost reductions for electric vehicles, instead of making the lineup larger.
Mercedes-Benz went in a completely different direction than other brands, completely eliminating production of electric vehicles being build for the United States.","For a few years, it looked like the American automotive industry would slowly move away from internal combustion engines, and focus instead on electric vehicles. In August of 2024, American manufacturer General Motors told EV Magazine they were planning for a future comprised entirely of electric cars. That included an investment of $35 billion to phase out gas and diesel vehicles by 2035. More recently, Ford announced a $5 billion plan to create a lineup of affordable electric vehicles.

However, the tide may be turning back toward internal combustion engines and away from batteries. In July of 2025, the government made the decision to eliminate the federal EV tax credits that had been around since 2008. The announcement came just two months before the legislation was to take effect, and in that time, there was a massive jump in EV sales. Unfortunately, that jump in sales is starting to feel gravity as the tax credits are no longer available.

General Motors saw a response in its third-quarter sales report, stating the automotive manufacturer saw a loss of $1.6 billion. GM claimed that $1.2 billion of the losses came from ""adjustments to [GM's] EV capacity.""

As of right now, it means that the brand will slow down its electric vehicle production and research. Paul Jacobson, General Motors Chief Financial Officer, stated in September 2025 that although profitability needs scale, scaling up would go a little slower over the coming years.

Now, this doesn't mean that GM will eliminate its electric vehicle division entirely, as the brand has already invested a ton in EVs. Jacobson did mention seeing the bright side of this situation though, saying that GM will make a commitment to bringing down the price of its current EV lineup. Jacobson added that the focus would go more into cost reductions for electric vehicles, instead of making the lineup larger.

This slow down in EV production will also affect plants in Spring Hill, Tennessee and Hamtramck, Michigan, where the American brand had been building batteries in partnership with LG Energy Solution.

It's not just General Motors who has to figure out a workaround for the elimination of the EV tax credits, as it affects every other automaker as well. Hyundai recently cut the price of one of its most popular vehicles, the Ioniq 5, by nearly $10,000 in some of the upper trim levels. Ford is also in the same boat, as we mentioned earlier, and it plans on offering 0% financing lease deals on its EVs.

Stellantis, the parent company of Jeep, Ram, Chrysler, is currently offering its EVs at a $7,500 discount, the same amount that the federal tax credit offered. Tesla did something similar, although the discount placed on its vehicles is less than what the tax credit offered.

Honda and Acura don't offer many EVs in North America, just the Prologue and the related Acura ZDX, although Acura nixed production of the ZDX recently. Mercedes-Benz went in a completely different direction than other brands, completely eliminating production of electric vehicles being build for the United States.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/gm-takes-a-1-6b-hit-after-fed-reverses-on-evs/l-intro-1761900742.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 14:00:46.048007

Interim findings of a report indicate that, during construction, the project could support approximately 20,000 jobs annually; over its lifetime, it is projected to maintain an average of 12,000 full-time equivalent jobs across Canada (around 10,000 of these in Ontario). It is estimated to contribute nearly CAD $200 billion to Canada’s GDP (about CAD $172 billion in Ontario) and tens of billions of tax revenue for all levels of government.

Bruce Power already stands out as Canada’s largest public-private partnership; its current Life-Extension Program and Major Component Replacement Project are the country’s largest privately financed electricity infrastructure endeavours. These existing operations support around 27,000 direct and indirect jobs each year. The Bruce C Project would build on that foundation, bringing new chances for skilled employment, regional economic development and durable prosperity in Ontario communities.

Currently, 95 % of Bruce Power’s spending is domestic, via an Ontario-based supply chain. The Bruce C Project would further that “Canadian at our Core” strategy — committing to safe and reliable power, global medical isotope production, economic growth and stronger Indigenous partnerships.

As stated by Stephen Lecce, Ontario’s Minister of Energy and Mines: “Ontario’s nuclear advantage is powering our future and showcasing the best of Canadian technology, resources and workers… The Bruce C Project will support jobs, add CAD $200 billion to the Canadian economy, and expand Ontario’s leadership in life-saving medical isotope production…”

Together with the potential refurbishment of Bruce Power’s Units 1 and 2, the Bruce C Project would enhance the already significant economic contributions of the Bruce Power site (which currently delivers about CAD $4 billion annually to the province via ongoing operations and life-extension activities). This supports Ontario’s ambition to become an energy superpower.

As noted by MPP Lisa Thompson: “The Bruce C Project marks a pivotal moment in Canada’s clean-energy future. By expanding nuclear capacity in Bruce County, we’re not only advancing energy security but also driving innovation, job creation and long-term prosperity across Ontario and beyond.”

Bruce Power COO and Executive VP James Scongack noted: “We’re proud of the work we do each and every day … and we’re proving that large-scale projects can be completed safely and on plan…” Further, the involvement of local residents, Indigenous partners and municipalities is promised to ensure that benefits materialize where they matter most — in the region of Bruce, Grey and Huron counties.",https://www.foronuclear.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_965524740-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:11.614423

Ahead of the agreement’s 2026 joint review, coalitions across sectors submitted comments demanding urgent reforms to address the USMCA’s flaws, including corporate giveaways, insufficient labor and environmental protections and enforcement, and rules that fuel displacement and undermine human rights.

Cross-Sector Demands

105 members of Congress, led by Rep. Rosa DeLauro (D-Conn.), endorsed a comment calling for substantial changes to the USMCA, including stronger protections for U.S. workers, consumers, small businesses, and farmers, improved enforcement mechanisms for labor and environmental standards, and the removal of rules that undermine sovereignty, access to medicines, Big Tech regulation, and more.

The issues highlighted in their letter mirrored demands by more than 700 organizations and more than 23,000 individuals who signed onto a comment co-sponsored by the Citizens Trade Campaign and a dozen other organizations.

Public Citizen submitted a detailed comment demanding a complete overhaul of the agreement, with special focus on removing the deal’s terms that benefit Big Tech and Big Pharma at the expense of the rest of us.

Access to Affordable Medicines

Public health organizations, including Médecins Sans Frontières USA, Universities Allied for Essential Medicines, Public Citizen, and Health GAP, joined with unions – such as the Communications Workers of America and National Nurses United as well as faith groups like NETWORK Lobby for Catholic Social Justice – to call for the elimination of USMCA intellectual property rules that keep drug prices high, including patent term extensions, market exclusivity, and patent linkage.

Migrant Justice and Human Rights

Migrant rights organizations, including the National Partnership for New Americans, LULAC, and LCLAA, urged trade policy reforms to address displacement, exploitation, and inequality driven by decades of corporate-driven trade. They called for USMCA revisions that prioritize human rights, fair wages, climate resilience, and inclusive policymaking.

Centro de los Derechos del Migrante called for the agreement’s protections for migrant workers to be maintained, strengthened, and enforced, particularly for migrant women workers. They also advised that labor enforcement provisions be expanded to apply to facilities in the U.S. and Canada as well as Mexico.

Workers’ Rights

The Labor Advisory Committee (LAC) – a panel of USTR-cleared advisers including the AFL-CIO, the United Steelworkers, the United Auto Workers, the Teamsters, and more – warned that offshoring, job losses, and wage suppression persist under the USMCA. The committee called for renegotiation before any extension of the agreement’s 16-year term, with stronger labor enforcement, tighter rules of origin, and restored country-of-origin labeling for food.

Nearly 70 members of the Congressional Labor Caucus, led by Reps. Debbie Dingell (D-Mich.), Donald Norcross (D-N.J.), Mark Pocan (D-Wis.), and Steven Horsford (D-Nev.) recommended pressuring Mexico to raise wages and labor standards; strengthening and expanding the USMCA’s labor “rapid response mechanism,” ensuring both Canada and Mexico fully enforce a ban on goods made with forced labor, and addressing transshipment from China.

Environment and Corporate Tribunals

Leading environmental organizations, Sierra Club, League of Conservation Voters, National Resources Defense Council, and Industrious Labs, called for revisions to the USMCA that support green and union jobs and clean water and air. Revisions including binding and enforceable environmental standards, a full elimination of ISDS that undermines labor and environmental safeguards, and a new tri-national body to tackle air pollution, and more.

BlueGreen Alliance, a powerful coalition of labor and environmental organizations, shared key provisions needed to support industrial resilience, clean manufacturing, and high-road labor and environmental standards.

Right to Repair

A collection of small-business, consumer, and digital organizations explained how certain USMCA provisions undermine governmental tools to support consumers’ right to repair.

While year-on-year financial comparisons indicate a more challenging environment than the previous year, the recent operational successes highlight the company's resilience and strategic execution, providing a nuanced outlook for investors and the broader energy sector.

The strong operational momentum, particularly the significant increase in October production to 49,300 barrels of oil equivalent per day (boe/d), positions Parex for a strong close to 2025 and an optimistic start to 2026. This performance, driven by key assets and successful exploration, suggests that well-managed independent producers can still thrive by optimizing existing assets and pursuing targeted growth, even as the global energy landscape grapples with wavering demand and price volatility.

Detailed Coverage: Parex Navigates Market Headwinds with Operational Acumen

Parex Resources Inc. (TSX: PXT) showcased a mixed but ultimately promising third quarter for 2025. The company generated funds flow from operations (FFO) of $105 million, translating to $1.09 per share, and recorded a net income of $50 million. Despite these solid figures, a year-on-year analysis reveals a decrease, with FFO per share dropping from $1.50 and net income declining by 23%. Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA) also experienced a 32% year-on-year decline, totaling $113.6 million, reflecting the broader economic pressures and commodity price fluctuations faced by the industry compared to the previous year. Capital expenditure for the quarter was $80.0 million, a slight decrease of 2.9% year-on-year, indicating disciplined spending.

The operational front, however, tells a story of significant momentum. Parex reported an average production of 43,953 boe/d for Q3 2025, marking a 3% increase from Q2 2025. More notably, October 2025 production surged to an average of 49,300 boe/d, exceeding the company's full-year 2025 guidance range of 43,000 to 47,000 boe/d. This impressive ramp-up is largely attributed to the LLA-32 block, where production rates have more than tripled to over 12,000 boe/d following a strategic tuck-in acquisition. Additionally, successful exploration at LLA-74 saw five producing wells brought online in 2025 with a 75% success rate, further bolstering output.

The company's strategic initiatives extend to future growth, with drilling initiated on the high-impact Guapo-1 exploration well at the VIM-1 block, with preliminary results expected by year-end 2025. This forward-looking approach, combined with strong performance from existing base assets and plans to bring four to six additional production-adding wells online in Q4 across LLA-32, Capachos, and Putumayo, sets a robust foundation for continued growth into 2026. While overall crude oil production saw a 9.2% year-on-year decline, a significant 93% increase in natural gas production, reaching 8.41 million cubic feet per day, highlights a strategic diversification in Parex's energy portfolio. In a move to return value to shareholders, Parex also declared a Q4 2025 regular dividend of C$0.385 per share, annualizing to C$1.54 per share, alongside maintaining its share buyback program.

Initial market reactions have been cautiously optimistic, with analysts acknowledging the strong operational execution despite the challenging financial comparisons. The company's robust balance sheet and attractive valuation metrics are seen as strengths, though some analysts express a desire for sustained financial performance to drive a market rerating. This balance between operational success and financial prudence positions Parex as a key player to watch in the evolving energy commodity landscape as of early November 2025.

Market Ripples: Winners and Losers in the Wake of Parex's Success

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) robust Q3 2025 results and impressive October 2025 production figures are poised to send ripples across the energy sector, creating both direct benefits for partners and heightened competitive pressure for other players, particularly those operating in Colombia's prolific basins or with similar exploration and production (E&P) profiles.

A clear beneficiary of Parex's strong performance is Ecopetrol S.A. (BVC: ECOPETROL), Colombia's state-owned oil company and a key strategic partner. Parex and Ecopetrol have active collaboration agreements, notably in the Putumayo Basin and the Llanos Foothills. Increased production and operational efficiency from Parex in these joint ventures directly translate to higher shared revenues and de-risked projects for Ecopetrol. This success not only validates their investment strategies in these areas but also fosters confidence for future collaborative ventures, potentially accelerating development across their shared portfolio.

On the other hand, several competitors face increased scrutiny and pressure. GeoPark Holdings (NYSE: GPRK), a significant Latin American E&P player, finds itself in a particularly precarious position. Parex's continued strong performance intensifies the spotlight on GeoPark, especially after its board rejected an all-cash acquisition proposal from Parex in September 2025, deeming it an undervaluation. With Parex having acquired an 11.8% ownership stake in GeoPark, the pressure is mounting for GeoPark to demonstrate its ability to deliver superior shareholder value from its existing assets and recent expansion into Argentina's Vaca Muerta basin, to justify its rejection and ward off further advances.

Other independent producers with significant Colombian operations, such as Frontera Energy (TSX: FEC) and Gran Tierra Energy (NYSE: GTE), are also likely to feel the heat. While Frontera Energy has previously engaged in farm-in agreements with Parex, including for the VIM-1 block where Parex is currently drilling a high-impact exploration well, the outcome of such ventures will determine its direct benefit. More broadly, Parex's operational efficiencies and exploration successes in areas like LLA-32 and LLA-74 set a high benchmark, compelling Frontera and Gran Tierra to demonstrate comparable growth and efficiency in their own operations to maintain investor confidence and market share. Gran Tierra, in particular, has faced challenges including production declines and blockades, which Parex's sustained performance could starkly highlight in contrast. Even Canacol Energy (TSX: CNE), a prominent natural gas producer, could experience indirect pressure as Parex expands its natural gas opportunities, increasing competition for resources and investor capital within the Colombian energy sector.

Wider Significance: A Barometer for the Energy Sector's Future

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) impressive Q3 2025 results and October 2025 production figures emerge as a compelling narrative within a global energy commodities landscape marked by complexity and often, contradiction. This strong showing offers critical insights into broader industry trends, competitive dynamics, evolving regulatory frameworks, and echoes historical patterns in the energy sector.

Parex's success stands out against a backdrop of global oil market softness. Forecasts for Brent crude in 2025 and 2026 indicate a decline from previous highs, primarily driven by global oil production outpacing demand, with a significant surplus projected. Factors such as the rise of electric and hybrid vehicles and flattening demand in major economies like China contribute to this softening. Despite these overarching pressures, Parex's ability to boost output and maintain its full-year guidance underscores the potential for well-managed, agile independent producers to thrive through operational efficiency, strategic asset management, and targeted exploration, even when larger market forces exert downward pressure on prices. The nuanced global natural gas market, with slowing demand growth but increasing LNG supply and new discoveries, also frames Parex's increasing natural gas production as a timely strategic diversification.

The ripple effects of Parex's performance extend to the broader competitive landscape. As the largest independent E&P company in Colombia, its sustained growth intensifies competition for acreage, resources, and investor capital against peers such as Ecopetrol (BVC: ECOPETROL), Frontera Energy (TSX: FEC), GeoPark Holdings (NYSE: GPRK), and Canacol Energy (TSX: CNE). Parex's strong financial health and production growth also bolster its capacity for strategic acquisitions, exemplified by its recent proposal to acquire GeoPark, potentially leading to increased market consolidation and operational synergies within the region. Furthermore, its enhanced strategic partnership with Ecopetrol, including joint exploration in areas like the Farallones Block, signals a positive trajectory for future collaborations and shared development opportunities, benefiting the broader Colombian energy supply chain through increased demand for services and equipment.

Operating in Colombia, Parex navigates an evolving regulatory environment characterized by both challenges and opportunities. The Colombian government's pursuit of an energy transition agenda, including a halt on new exploration licensing rounds and increased taxes on producers since August 2022, reflects a broader ""resource nationalism agenda."" This policy shift has contributed to investor uncertainty and a decline in foreign direct investment. However, recognizing a looming natural gas supply shortfall by early 2026, Colombian lawmakers are debating measures to ease LNG import rules and offer tax breaks for critical infrastructure. These policy adjustments, alongside positive changes like allowing pipelines to carry both oil and gas, demonstrate a dynamic regulatory landscape where the government attempts to balance energy transition goals with the immediate need for energy security.

Historically, Parex's performance resonates with several recurring themes in the energy industry. The company's growth amidst broader market fluctuations mirrors the inherent boom-and-bust cycles of the oil and gas sector, highlighting the imperative for companies to prioritize efficiency and strategic investment to weather potential downturns. Sustained growth in specific regions, driven by significant production, can also evoke historical precedents of regional economic impacts, akin to ""boomtown"" phenomena, bringing both prosperity and challenges like strained infrastructure. Moreover, Colombia's current policy stance on resource nationalism finds parallels in historical instances where nations sought greater control and benefit from their natural resources, often leading to complex negotiations and, at times, investor-state disputes. Parex's ability to maintain growth within this framework serves as a case study for navigating such nationalistic shifts.

What Comes Next: Navigating the Future of Energy

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) strong Q3 2025 results and October 2025 production figures set a dynamic stage for its immediate future and offer a compelling case study for the broader energy commodity market. The company is poised for continued growth in the short term, but its long-term trajectory will be significantly influenced by global commodity price trends, geopolitical stability, and the accelerating energy transition.

In the short term (late 2025 - 2026), Parex anticipates robust production growth, with Q4 2025 average production expected to surpass its annual guidance. This momentum will be driven by successful exploration and development at key blocks like LLA-32 and LLA-74, and the potential transformational impact of the high-impact Guapo-1 exploration well at VIM-1, with results expected by year-end. The company's disciplined capital expenditure, focused on high-return development and exploitation, underscores its commitment to sustaining this growth while maintaining shareholder returns through consistent dividends.

Looking at the long term (beyond 2026), Parex aims to solidify its position as Colombia's largest independent E&P company, expanding its multi-field operator status and achieving sustainable production growth across its diversified portfolio, including the Llanos and Magdalena basins, and the newly acquired Putumayo blocks. Strategic initiatives like enhanced oil recovery (EOR) techniques, such as polymer injection at LLA-34 and Cabrestero, are crucial for maximizing long-term liquids recovery. Furthermore, Parex's demonstrated interest in strategic acquisitions, like its bid for GeoPark (NYSE: GPRK), signals a potential for further expansion and consolidation within the Colombian and Latin American energy landscape.

However, navigating the future will require strategic pivots and adaptations. Parex must continuously balance its growth investments with its commitment to shareholder returns, ensuring long-term value creation amidst market volatility. Operating primarily in Colombia, the company must adeptly manage the evolving geopolitical and regulatory landscape, particularly the government's energy transition agenda and potential shifts in resource nationalism policies. While currently focused on conventional oil and gas, Parex may need to consider long-term strategies related to the broader energy transition, potentially through investments in emissions reduction technologies or complementary energy ventures, to maintain relevance and attract investment in a decarbonizing world. Flexible capital allocation will also be paramount to respond to fluctuating commodity prices.

Market opportunities for Parex include Latin America's increasing importance in global energy security, driven by surging oil and gas production in the region and growing natural gas demand for power generation. The ongoing consolidation in the oil and gas industry also presents opportunities for Parex to expand its asset base or optimize its portfolio through strategic mergers and acquisitions. Conversely, significant challenges loom, primarily the persistent crude oil price volatility, with forecasts suggesting a potential decline in Brent crude prices to the mid-$50s per barrel by 2026 due to rising global inventories. Geopolitical instability in other regions and the long-term uncertainty of fossil fuel demand due to the global energy transition will also demand careful strategic planning.

Considering these factors, potential scenarios and outcomes vary. An optimistic scenario sees Parex successfully executing its programs, exceeding production guidance, and making accretive acquisitions, while oil prices stabilize at favorable levels. A base case involves moderate growth with some revenue pressure from declining oil prices, requiring continued capital discipline. A pessimistic scenario could involve a sharp and sustained decline in crude oil prices, coupled with operational challenges, forcing significant capital cuts and a focus on balance sheet preservation. Ultimately, Parex's ability to adapt its strategy, maintain capital discipline, and capitalize on value-accretive opportunities will be crucial for its long-term success in a dynamic energy market.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: Navigating a Dynamic Energy Future

Parex Resources' (TSX: PXT) strong Q3 2025 financial and operational performance, capped by an impressive surge in October 2025 production, presents a compelling narrative of resilience and strategic execution within a complex and often volatile energy commodity market. The company's ability to deliver robust results amidst broader market headwinds underscores its effective operational strategies and prudent financial management.

The key takeaways from Parex's recent performance are multi-faceted. The company reported a solid $105 million in funds flow from operations and $50 million in net income for Q3 2025. Operationally, average production increased by 3% quarter-on-quarter to 43,953 boe/d in Q3, with a significant jump to 49,300 boe/d in October. This growth was fueled by the substantial increase in output from the LLA-32 block following a tuck-in acquisition, and successful near-field exploration at LLA-74. The remarkable 93% year-on-year increase in natural gas production also highlights a strategic diversification. Financially, Parex maintains a strong balance sheet, continues to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks, and employs hedging strategies to mitigate price risk, demonstrating a balanced approach to growth and investor value.

Assessing the market moving forward, Parex is well-positioned for a strong start to 2026, with its Q4 2025 production expected to exceed the higher end of its annual guidance. Its ongoing exploration, particularly the high-impact Guapo-1 well at VIM-1, holds the potential for future reserve additions and production growth, which would further stabilize regional energy supply. While analyst sentiment remains cautiously optimistic, with some concerns regarding declining revenue and free cash flow growth, the company's strong technical indicators and positive earnings call sentiment suggest a favorable outlook, provided these operational gains prove sustainable. Parex's proactive risk management through crude oil hedges further instills confidence in its ability to navigate price volatility.

The significance and lasting impact of Parex's performance extend beyond its immediate financials. As a leading independent E&P company in Colombia, its sustained operational execution and disciplined capital allocation set a benchmark for peers in the region. In an era of increasing energy transition pressures and resource nationalism, Parex's ability to grow production and maintain profitability while returning capital to shareholders provides a model for how conventional energy producers can thrive by optimizing existing assets and pursuing targeted, efficient growth. This balanced approach is crucial for navigating unpredictable price swings and geopolitical uncertainties that define the modern energy landscape.

Investors should watch for several key indicators in the coming months. The preliminary results from the Guapo-1 exploration well at VIM-1, expected by year-end 2025, will be a critical determinant of future growth potential. Further, monitoring the company's progress in bringing additional production-adding wells online across LLA-32, Capachos, and Putumayo in Q4 2025 will be essential for gauging its momentum into 2026. Global crude oil price stability and the effectiveness of Parex's hedging strategies will directly influence profitability. Finally, continued analyst sentiment and any potential market rerating will depend on Parex's consistent delivery on operational promises and its ability to demonstrate sustainable revenue and free cash flow growth, addressing the concerns that currently temper its overall market perception.

From 2017 through 2021, the tariffs are estimated to have prevented 10.5 GW of solar capacity from being built.
The paper, Imported solar photovoltaics contributed to health and climate benefits in the United States, showed that 78% of solar panels deployed during this time were imports.
Modeling indicates that the Suniva tariffs worsened air quality and public health outcomes, resulting in roughly a hundred additional pollution-related deaths.
New and expanded U.S. solar trade barriers continue to raise costs and slow deployment, undercutting the very decarbonization targets those policies claim to defend.","Burning fossil fuels drives air pollution, intensifies heat, and accelerates climate change. These forces, in turn, fuel increasingly destructive hurricanes, some now so powerful that scientists have proposed adding a “Category 6” to the Saffir-Simpson scale to describe the extreme weather events that cause human suffering and death. Yet U.S. energy policy under the current administration has not merely favored fossil fuels; it has reverted to burning more fossil fuels to power the country, slowing the transition and worsening pollution’s toll.

Because the harm from pollution and climate change is slow, widespread, and diffuse, it’s easy for society to hide behind the mindset that “a single death is a tragedy, a million deaths are a statistic.”

While it’s difficult to assign individual harm to broad policy decisions, there’s no doubt that air pollution has tangible, immediate effects. Three years after a Pittsburgh coal-processing plant closed in 2016, researchers documented a 42% drop in local emergency cardiovascular admissions. Reducing fossil emissions directly improves public health in measurable ways.

Suniva tariff public harm extrapolations

An analysis by the Solar Energy Industries Association lets us consider how the 2017 Suniva tariffs, imposed after the company filed a Section 201 trade petition, had a human cost in their obstructing of solar deployment. From 2017 through 2021, the tariffs are estimated to have prevented 10.5 GW of solar capacity from being built. That capacity would have generated roughly 18 TWh of electricity in 2022.

With natural gas providing 39% of U.S. electricity and coal 20% that year, we can—very roughly—estimate that 7 TWh would have been replaced by gas and 3.6 TWh by coal.

Gas-fired power is estimated to kill about 2.82 people per TWh through air-pollution-related effects, while coal kills 24 per TWh. Applying these rates, the Suniva tariffs are estimated to have led to 19 deaths from gas generation and 86 from coal—a total of about 105 avoidable American deaths in 2022 alone. The number of Americans left with chronic respiratory conditions such as asthma likely reaches into the tens of thousands.

Solar module imports save lives

A more rigorous—and encouraging—analysis from researchers at the City University of New York found that solar panel imports into the United States displaced 305 TWh of fossil generation, avoided 178 million tons of CO2 emissions, and prevented 595 premature deaths between 2014 and 2022.

The paper, Imported solar photovoltaics contributed to health and climate benefits in the United States, showed that 78% of solar panels deployed during this time were imports. As utility-scale solar grew from “nearly zero” in 2010 to 3.4% of total U.S generation in 2022, those imported modules were critical.

Regional differences mattered. In Texas, one MWh of solar reduced gas generation by 0.70 MWh and coal by 0.31 MWh. In Florida, nearly all the displaced energy came from gas—0.97 MWh per MWh of solar.

Overall, imported solar panels generated $28 billion in combined health and climate benefits. Climate benefits made up 76% of that total, and air-pollution reductions the other 24%. On average, every kilowatt of imported solar produced $180 in health and climate benefits—about one-fifth of a system’s installation cost, separate from its energy value.

Strategy and consequences

While some would argue that it’s impossible to draw a straight line between a trade policy and an obituary, others—including this author—see a clear causal link. Modeling indicates that the Suniva tariffs worsened air quality and public health outcomes, resulting in roughly a hundred additional pollution-related deaths. Whether that figure is viewed as an estimate or an accusation, it reflects a policy failure with real human stakes.

Adding to the irony, the company that pushed hardest for those tariffs did not restart manufacturing until 2024, years after the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act reignited domestic production. Having already gone dark, Suniva leveraged the machinery of U.S. trade law to kneecap the industry.

The damage didn’t end there. New and expanded U.S. solar trade barriers continue to raise costs and slow deployment, undercutting the very decarbonization targets those policies claim to defend. Every delay in clean-energy buildout prolongs dependence on fuels that pollute and destabilize the climate. By contrast, imported solar modules over the past decade have accelerated emission reductions and delivered measurable—if diffuse—public-health and environmental gains.

If the United States intends to pursue energy dominance, it should do so through true abundance and evidence, not restriction and rhetoric. Tariffs slow the transition and prolong fossil dependence, while value-driven tax credits are already driving solar manufacturing and expanding domestic capacity across every link of the supply chain.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.
- Emissions trading, forest cover - China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.","China is the world's biggest emitter of planet-warning greenhouse gases but is also installing more renewable energy sources and putting more electric vehicles on its roads than any other country.

Ahead of the COP30 climate talks in Brazil, here is a look at China's climate commitments:

- Emissions -

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

- Reduction targets -

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

But it did not set a baseline year from which to measure those reductions and experts say China needs to cut emissions by closer to 30 percent from 2023 levels to keep global temperatures from rising over 1.5C above pre-industrial levels.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

- Fossil fuels, EVs -

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

- Emissions trading, forest cover -

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

Overall, AutoNation reported net income of $215.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of 16% vs. the same period last year.
On a same-store basis, revenue was up 6% to $6.9 billion, while total same-store gross profit reached $1.2 billion, up 4%.
AutoNation’s BEV sales were up 40% in Q3, accounting for 10% of its new-vehicle sales in the quarter, according to Manley.
However, with the need to clear dealer lots, profit margins on EVs “have been terrible for some time,” Manley said.","Megadealer group AutoNation has reduced its inventory of electric vehicles, which suffer profit margins that CEO Mike Manley called “absolutely terrible” during a Q3 earnings call on Oct 23.

The company’s focus is now on a potential seasonal year-end increase in luxury car sales and consumer incentives.

“For the fourth quarter, we expect the mix of new unit sales to improve, including less battery electric vehicles and a higher percentage of premium luxury, reflecting seasonal strength during the holiday season,” AutoNation CFO Tom Szlosek said during the earnings call.

Overall, AutoNation reported net income of $215.1 million in the third quarter, an increase of 16% vs. the same period last year. On a same-store basis, revenue was up 6% to $6.9 billion, while total same-store gross profit reached $1.2 billion, up 4%.

Too much BEV stock hit gross profit

EV sales jumped higher in Q3 for AutoNation and for the industry in general, as consumers rushed to beat the expiration of the $7,500 federal tax credit. AutoNation’s BEV sales were up 40% in Q3, accounting for 10% of its new-vehicle sales in the quarter, according to Manley.

However, with the need to clear dealer lots, profit margins on EVs “have been terrible for some time,” Manley said. That helped drag down AutoNation’s average gross profit per new vehicle of all drive types to $2,290 for the quarter, down 18.8% from a year ago. Year over year net income was also down 6% to $477 million.

Now, without the tax break and the pull-ahead effect of all those third-quarter EVs sales, demand is expected to fall in Q4. In anticipation, AutoNation ended the third quarter with just 1,550 BEVs in stock, less than a 20-day supply at its current sales rate. The company’s EV inventory is down 55% compared to the end of 2024, Manley said.

Aiming to self-source used cars

Based in Fort Lauderdale, Fla., AutoNation had 243 new-car dealerships in the U.S. market as of Dec. 31, 2024, plus 24 AutoNation USA used-only stores.

Like other publicly traded, new-vehicle chains, AutoNation said it is trying to avoid rising acquisition costs for used-car inventory by self-sourcing as many used vehicles as possible instead of buying them at auctions.

“Overall, industry supply of used vehicles remains tight. We continue to be competitive in securing our vehicle supply from our retail operations, including trade-ins, ‘We Buy Your Car’ services, loaner conversions, and lease returns. We source more than 90% of our vehicles from these channels,” Szlosek said in the conference call.

Year-end incentives are also likely for luxury brands, with the annual Lexus “December to Remember” promotion typically kicking off the holiday sales season, starting around Thanksgiving.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/txYZmuGHm5yIL5fDr0Zi4zzrBg17pqp74tJOJCl7FbY/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9VU0RlYWxlcnNHZXR0eS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:43.204088

The substantial distributed generation capacity has contributed to minimum demand records as rooftop solar output reached 15GW during peak generation periods.
Customers participating in the Solar Sharer offer will need smart meter installations to access the free electricity periods.
The government plans to consult with Victoria and Western Australia about extending the Solar Sharer offer to their jurisdictions by 2027, potentially expanding the program’s coverage to additional households across the NEM.
This approach aims to ensure consumer choice while providing access to the benefits of Australia’s abundant rooftop solar generation for households across different housing types and ownership arrangements.","Under the terms of the offering, energy retailers will be required to grant customers free solar-derived electricity for “at least three hours in the middle of the day”.

Bowen described the Solar Sharer offer as ensuring “every last ray of sunshine was powering our homes” while enabling more Australians to participate in the country’s solar energy transition.

The programme targets households with smart meters who can shift their electricity consumption to coincide with the designated free power periods during midday hours, when solar generation reaches its peak output.

The policy responds to Australia’s unique position as a global leader in distributed solar deployment, with the country hosting over four million rooftop installations, according to government figures. This extensive residential solar infrastructure has created significant midday generation surpluses that often exceed local demand, particularly during optimal weather conditions.

Australia’s National Electricity Market (NEM) has achieved record-breaking renewable energy performance in recent months, with rooftop solar capacity reaching 26.8GW in the first half of 2025. The substantial distributed generation capacity has contributed to minimum demand records as rooftop solar output reached 15GW during peak generation periods.

The Solar Sharer programme aims to address the economic challenges created by this generation abundance. Excess solar production during midday periods has reduced wholesale electricity prices and diminished feed-in tariff rates for rooftop solar owners, creating economic pressure on the distributed solar sector.

Indeed, the new programme seeks to increase daytime electricity consumption by incentivising households to operate appliances during peak solar generation windows.

Customers participating in the Solar Sharer offer will need smart meter installations to access the free electricity periods. The initiative covers all household electricity usage during the designated three-hour windows, including air conditioning, washing machines, dryers and other high-consumption appliances.

The Australian Energy Regulator (AER) will oversee the Solar Sharer programme to ensure customers receive fair pricing outside the free power periods. The regulatory framework aims to prevent retailers from inflating standard electricity rates to offset the cost of providing free daytime power, maintaining consumer protection across all usage periods.

The programme’s initial rollout covers Default Market Offer regions (New South Wales, South Australia and south-east Queensland) where the Australian Energy Regulator sets benchmark electricity pricing.

The government plans to consult with Victoria and Western Australia about extending the Solar Sharer offer to their jurisdictions by 2027, potentially expanding the program’s coverage to additional households across the NEM.

The Solar Sharer initiative reflects broader trends in Australia’s electricity system transformation, where record-breaking surges in renewables and energy storage assets have fundamentally altered generation patterns and wholesale market dynamics. The programme represents a policy response to manage the integration challenges created by high renewable energy penetration.

Energy retailers will be required to offer Solar Sharer plans, but customers must actively opt into the program rather than being automatically enrolled.

We will take the lead in training and certifying the industry on the system's benefits and proper application. With major international events approaching, ensuring safe and sustainable environments is more relevant than ever.""

The BioBond System: Three Layers of Protection

The patented system utilizes three specialized biobased coatings that can be applied to a wide variety of materials, including concrete, ceramic, wood, and metal. This makes them ideal for spaces where hygiene and durability are critical, such as industrial kitchens, veterinary clinics, public restrooms, and high-traffic public areas.

BioCoat SWaE250 (Base Layer): Prepares surfaces and enhances adhesion, ensuring a solid foundation. Dries to the touch in just 2-3 hours.

BioCoat SSoE250 (Intermediate Layer): Seals the surface and helps eliminate odors, promoting a highly hygienic environment.

BioCoat SUP250 (Top Layer): Provides exceptional durability and resistance to wear, chemicals, and frequent cleaning, without generating harmful microplastics.

The coatings are proven to reduce odors, resist mold and bacteria growth with excellent durability. Beyond health and safety, this technology offers significant economic protection; a microbial outbreak can cost an industrial facility up to $5M million in shutdowns, a risk mitigated by the BioBond solution.

""We have been working directly with construction teams across Mexico to introduce the BioBond Powered By Nature system in multiple industries—from hospitality to industrial and commercial projects,"" said Dinorah Cambuston, Country Manager of BioBond. ""This hands-on approach has allowed us to deliver impactful results that solve client issues while adding measurable value to their projects.""

Dominion Energy provides regulated electric service to about 3.6 million customers in Virginia and the Carolinas, and regulated natural gas service to about 500,000 customers in South Carolina. Its Contracted Energy segment operates the 2,098-MW Millstone nuclear power plant in Connecticut, various solar generation facilities and the Charybdis offshore wind installation vessel.

In the third quarter of 2025, Dominion’s regulated electric sales rose 3.3% year over year. Quarterly operating earnings grew to $921 million, up from $836 million in the third quarter of 2024.

Dominion’s 176-turbine, 2.6-GW Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is about 66% complete, the utility company said Friday. The project, which will be the largest offshore wind farm by capacity in the U.S. once complete, is a 50-50 venture between Dominion and Stonepeak, an infrastructure investment firm that purchased its stake in the project in early 2024.

Dominion expects to finish onshore work and deliver the project’s first electrons to customers by the first quarter of 2026, executives said during an earnings conference call with analysts. Full completion remains on track for the end of 2026, though CEO Robert Blue said that installation of the final turbine towers could slip into early 2027 due to delays in commissioning Charybdis, Dominion’s turbine installation vessel.

Including an unused contingency of $206 million, total project costs stand at $11.2 billion, down about $15 million from last quarter, Blue said. According to its updated forecast, Dominion expects U.S. tariffs to increase the offshore wind project costs $690 million through 2026, with $218 million borne by Dominion and the remainder by Stonepeak.

Dominion now expects the levelized cost of electricity generated by the plant to come in at $84/MWh, up from $63/MWh in August due to expected lower revenue from renewable energy credits. That estimate is within the $80/MWh to $90/MWh range Dominion envisioned in its 2021 initial filing and would support a net monthly customer bill savings of 63 cents, it said.

On the call, Blue expressed confidence that “bipartisan support at all levels of government” would endure for Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind after Virginia’s statewide elections this week.

“It’s the fastest way to get 2.6 GW on the grid that’s going to serve AI and technology companies, defense and security installations,” Blue said. “It’s critical to important infrastructure upgrades at the Oceana Naval Air Station. And if you stop it now, it causes energy inflation.”

Virginia data center boom continues

Dominion’s data center contracted capacity rose about 7 GW, or 17%, since December. Capacity with an electric service agreement rose from 8.8 GW to 9.8 GW while capacity with a construction letter of authorization jumped from 5.2 GW to 9 GW during the period.

Both project categories involve guaranteed payments to Dominion, even when a customer walks away from construction or fails to meet expected load levels.

Across its entire service territory, Blue said Dominion has received 17 GW of delivery point requests from data centers so far this year and more than 58 GW since 2020. It has “communicated firm rates” for more than 25 GW of capacity expected to energize through 2031, he added. The typical data center project takes four to seven years from delivery point request to meter hookup, he said.

“Our data center load just continues to grow, and the demand continues to grow, which is something considering that we have connected 450 data centers already and we’ve got more than 25% of our sales going to data centers in Virginia,” Blue said.

Dialing in an ‘all of the above’ resource strategy

Dominion executives on Friday detailed the utility’s “all of the above” resource strategy. The utility’s roughly $50 billion five-year capital investment plan includes a mix of transmission, thermal and renewable power projects, they said.

Notable regulatory and process milestones in the third quarter include submitting transmission project proposals to the PJM Interconnection in August; filing post-hearing briefs for the 1-GW Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center, a Virginia gas-fired peaker plant with four 250-MW turbines; submitting an application for 845 MW of solar and 145 MW of energy storage projects across its territory, part of what Blue said would be a planned “cadence roughly of a [gigawatt] of solar a year”; and filing its latest Virginia integrated resource plan.

Dominion said PJM’s transmission selections could come in early 2026. If approved by the Virginia State Corporation Commission, likely by the end of this year, the Chesterfield plant could begin construction next year and come online in 2029. Blue said Dominion’s size and long supplier relationships positioned it well to secure turbines and other long-lead equipment for gas and data center projects.

Measured caution on new nuclear

Dominion’s Virginia proposed IRP pushed back the date of a possible small modular reactor in the state by five years.

Blue cautioned against “[reading] too much into that” and reiterated his company’s memorandum of understanding with Amazon to explore an SMR at its North Anna nuclear power plant in southeastern Virginia. He described Virginia as “the most nuclear-friendly state in the country” thanks to strong policy support, existing civilian reactors and its naval nuclear supply chain.

But fiscal prudence dictates a measured approach to new nuclear investments, Blue added.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/9Gz9V2FMNHt3xFPzBbSjNgb6b03EiS-0ZYNwFPae3Iw/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9DVk9XXzAzNDMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-04 13:07:06.293872

Education

Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features.

Experience

Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written.

An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day.

In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest. Her non-automotive work, covering such topics as travel, food and drink, rural living, fountain pen collecting, and celebrity interviews, has appeared in publications including Harrowsmith, Where New Orleans, Pen World, The Book for Men, Rural Delivery, and Gambit.

COP30 must push for scaled-up financing for adaptation that integrates climate risk and resilience into economic planning, and the adoption of meaningful indicators.
Addressing both adaptation and loss and damage is not just about climate action—it is a matter of climate, economic, and social justice.
COP30 must accelerate both the scale and alignment of where global climate finance is currently at, ensuring that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most.
Showcasing community-level resilience—including action on extreme heat and sustainable cooling in countries like India—that blends adaptation, resilience, and mitigation in tangible ways.","However, we should first acknowledge that 10 years onward with the Paris Agreement in place, the world has made real progress—from the 36.2 million jobs generated by clean energy globally (more than oil, gas, coal, and fossil-engine manufacturing combined) to the exponential growth of solar energy (now four times what was predicted in 2015). Yet the latest reports show we are still drifting off course from limiting global temperature increase to 1.5–2 degrees Celsius, with profound consequences for people and the planet.

To change course, we need both emergency brakes and acceleration—brakes on the forces driving deforestation and forest degradation, ocean acidification, and sea level rise and acceleration in actions, such as deploying clean energy, efficient cooling, early warning systems, accessible finance, and affordable insurance, while protecting lives and livelihoods. Scaling up investment in these solutions is essential for a safer, more resilient future.

This is why COP30 matters. It must move beyond headlines and targets to focus on turning commitments into action—strengthening the cycle of planning, implementation, and accountability created in Paris to raise ambition over time. As an “implementation COP,” the international community must recalibrate this multilateral process and center those who are most affected by strengthening our ability to decarbonize supply chains, adapt to the changing climate, and address rising losses and damages, along with ensuring that vulnerable countries and communities are no longer left behind.

The Brazilian COP30 presidency has signaled that this will be a COP that’s centered on climate adaptation and resilience—and rightly so. Rethinking resilience means building systems that can anticipate, absorb, and recover from shocks, in addition to sustaining progress toward a livable future. This focus could not be timelier. Amid geopolitical headwinds and more extreme climate events, COP30 must serve as a cornerstone for strengthening resilience—across economies, communities, and ecosystems alike—by:

Enhancing the ability of the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change and the Paris Agreement to remain beacons of light in the midst of external shocks

Let us be clear here: While global cooperation may be strained, the Paris Agreement has nevertheless held firm—preventing the world from veering toward even greater 4–5°C warming trajectories. No country has followed the United States in leaving the accord. Global investment in renewables now doubles that of fossil fuels. Climate measures have increased sevenfold, with more than 80 percent of the global economy committed to net zero targets. Still, the pace and scale of action, along with the means of implementation—finance, capacity building, and technology transfer—remain far from sufficient. New tools and ideas are emerging to close this gap, from the International Court of Justice advisory opinion to innovative investment mechanisms, bolstered by the momentum from the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) World Congress in Abu Dhabi.

Rallying the world to close the emissions and resilience gaps

COP30 must signal a truly collective response to both the emissions gap and the resilience gap—helping nations adapt to intensifying climate impacts while limiting losses to lives and livelihoods. This will require formal decisions and strong action from governments that accelerate implementation on the ground. Central to this effort is doubling down on untapped opportunities, including reducing emissions other than carbon dioxide, like methane or HFCs from refrigerants, and ensuring “just transitions”—moving away from fossil fuels in a way that protects workers, communities, and economies, in addition to reducing poverty and leaving no one behind.

Adapting, addressing loss and damage, and putting justice at the center

Adaptation efforts have long been underfunded and insufficient, leaving communities exposed to mounting climate impacts. COP30 must push for scaled-up financing for adaptation that integrates climate risk and resilience into economic planning, and the adoption of meaningful indicators. Yet even the best adaptation has limits, and unavoidable losses and damages are increasing, as seen in the recent devastation from Hurricane Melissa and other record-breaking events worldwide. Addressing both adaptation and loss and damage is not just about climate action—it is a matter of climate, economic, and social justice.

Ensuring that nature is part of the solution

Protecting and restoring forests, mangroves, and wetlands and reforming agriculture and food systems not only reduce emissions but also strengthen our resilience to climate impacts. They need to be integral to climate decision-making. In order to be on track to halt and reverse deforestation and forest degradation by 2030, the degradation in the Global North, which holds some of the most carbon-rich forests in the world, should receive the same level of scrutiny, transparency, and accountability as the tropics. This issue was elevated at the 2025 IUCN World Conservation Congress in Abu Dhabi, through the adoption of an NRDC-led motion. The COP30 presidency’s anticipated launch of the Tropical Forests Forever Facility is a potentially positive step toward delivering further progress, but it requires more robust engagement of Indigenous Peoples and local communities and standards that capture all drivers of deforestation and forest degradation.

Mobilizing financial flows to those who need it

Finance remains the elephant in the room. COP30 must accelerate both the scale and alignment of where global climate finance is currently at, ensuring that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most. At COP29, in Baku, Azerbaijan, the international community committed to mobilizing at least $1.3 trillion per year in climate finance for developing countries by 2035, with developed nations taking the lead in mobilizing at least $300 billion annually. COP30 is about engineering a major leap in both funding and delivery. Adaptation and resilience must receive a fair share while private and public flows are mobilized with transparency, accountability, and impact.

This is why NRDC will be with our partners in Belém this year (as well as in Rio de Janeiro and São Paulo beforehand for other preconference dialogues and forums). Together, we aim to shape a COP30 package that drives forward a durable transition to a clean, low-carbon global economy and resilient future for the planet and its people. Our focus will be on four key thematic areas:

Catalyzing a finance step change, especially for adaptation and ensuring that the private and public sectors both work in concert to channel funds to the right kinds of efforts on the ground.

Holding governments accountable for the ambition and delivery of their 2035 climate plans, at a time when every fraction of a degree matters.

Showcasing community-level resilience—including action on extreme heat and sustainable cooling in countries like India—that blends adaptation, resilience, and mitigation in tangible ways.

Advancing equitable accountability for forest protection to preserve forests as critical carbon stores and sinks and tackle drivers of forest degradation and deforestation across both the Global North and Global South.

All of these efforts, in synergy with other multilateral processes—like the High Seas Treaty, the Montreal Protocol, the biodiversity and desertification conventions—are central to not only upholding multilateralism and global cooperation as a cornerstone of equitable global climate governance but also to meeting the human imperative of building a safer, healthier, and more prosperous society.

COP30 is a moment to mobilize all hands—Rio de Janeiro’s local leaders, São Paulo’s private sector, youth, women, faith-based communities, Indigenous and local communities, academics and engineers—to be, and continue to be, the changemakers turning the promise of the Paris Agreement into reality. It is also about ensuring the agreement remains a guiding beacon, providing the frameworks, space, and inspiration needed to catalyze transformative action for people and the planet.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-11/cop30-belem-brazil-RC294GA7KHOS.JPG?h=2e111cc1&itok=hvwr3_gN,N,,2025-11-04 14:19:38.993038

To ensure wind power projects are built and commissioned, the UK government holds annual auctions to incentivize renewable energy operators to invest in the nation’s wind power sector.
This year’s auction round budget will sit at around $1.2 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year.
It should be noted that this year’s auction round will allocate $236 million for earlier-stage floating wind technology, which was nonexistent in last year’s budget.
Europe has lofty ambitions for the expansion of wind power capacity on the continent","The UK has set itself an ambitious goal of decarbonization by the end of the decade. However, several industry analysts have noted that the latest auction round provides fewer subsidies for the wind power sector, which has raised concerns over the country’s ability to meet its self-imposed decarbonization goals. The world has seen the energy sector shift its attention away from the conventional oil and gas sector in favor of the untapped potential that the renewable sector has in abundance. While other nations opt for solar or nuclear power, the UK has a proclivity for wind power.

England is offering fewer public funds for the next round of wind power auctions

The aim would be to foster more international investment and not rely on government subsidies to boost the wind power sector in the United Kingdom. To ensure wind power projects are built and commissioned, the UK government holds annual auctions to incentivize renewable energy operators to invest in the nation’s wind power sector.

The UK guarantees a set purchasing price for wind power, which, without the government subsidies, operators may favor other markets. However, the latest round of auction documents details the UK’s plan to offer less cash to operators. The “contracts for difference” in the UK are essential to make wind power projects appear viable and financially stable for potential investors.

The UK’s next auction round will see significantly less “contracts for difference” funding

Documents released by the UK government note that this year’s auction round will see substantially less money being provided by the state. This year’s auction round budget will sit at around $1.2 billion, down from $1.4 billion last year. It should be noted that this year’s auction round will allocate $236 million for earlier-stage floating wind technology, which was nonexistent in last year’s budget.

“Our competitive new auction process will allow us to buy the right amount of clean power at the right price.” – British Minister for Energy Michael Shank

Industry experts have warned of the impact of the new round of auction’s budget

The UK has plans to decarbonize by the end of the decade and has selected wind power as the best and most practical driver to achieve this. However, market analysts have noted that if this year’s prices are anything like last year’s, the UK is in danger of not meeting its 2030 decarbonization target.

Pranav Menon, a senior researcher at Aurora Energy Research, has stated that the proposed funding of the UK’s wind power sector places the nation in danger of missing the mark for decarbonization. Mr Menon noted that the expected capacity is set to be around 4.9 GW if last year’s prices are repeated in 2025.

“This would set the government’s ambitious offshore wind capacity target to achieve CP2030 (clean power 2030) out of sight, as it requires at least seven to nine GW to be procured, which would require extremely competitive bids that are unlikely to materialise.” – Pranav Menon, a senior researcher at Aurora Energy Research

Europe’s offshore wind sector has been grappling with its growing dependence on the Chinese supply train, which raises concerns over national security among a litany of other worries.

Samsung SDI shares soared more than 8% on the news.

A deal would mark the latest push by Tesla to reduce reliance on China for key parts, fueled by tariffs and geopolitical tensions.

Tesla has signed deals with South Korean companies Samsung Electronics and LG Energy Solution to source chips and batteries in recent months.

Energy storage batteries have a similar chemistry to automotive batteries and are used to power facilities such as data centers.

South Korean battery makers are repurposing electric vehicle battery production lines to also produce energy storage systems as they are hit by the elimination of US subsidies.

Samsung SDI said in an earnings call in October that it has seen a big fall in automotive battery demand from joint venture partner Stellantis, and will tweak some of its production lines in the US state of Indiana to make energy storage batteries.

A source told Reuters that Tesla and Samsung SDI are discussing supplies of energy storage batteries, while another person said that the annual supply volume would be 10 GWh.

The South Korean newspaper Korea Economic Daily, which first reported the potential deal, said the three-year supply deal would be valued at more than 3 trillion won.

Tesla did not have an immediate comment. A Samsung SDI spokesperson said the deal and its details have not been finalised yet.

Tesla said in an earnings conference call in October that its energy storage business is seeing headwinds due to the increase in competition and tariffs. ""Currently, all sales procured are from China while we're still working on other alternatives,"" it had said.

The 2009 final rule — an obvious bureaucratic effort to gather information needed to implement various climate policies to reduce U.S. GHG emissions — cannot satisfy any plausible benefit/cost test. Even a U.S. net-zero policy achieved by 2050 would reduce global temperatures in 2100 by amounts either trivial or undetectable; the maximum under extreme assumptions would be 0.173°C, applying the Environmental Protection Agency climate model, while an estimate far more realistic would be 0.104°C.

Behind the Meter: How Developers Are Adapting To avoid delays on the grid, Texas developers are capitalizing on on-site generation systems to keep plans on track.
Vice President of Power Industry Research at IIR Energy, Britt Burt, stated the imbalance is worse.","Texas’s power grid, approximately 55 years old, is long past its prime. Reports show that the state saw an estimated 263 power outages from 2019 to 2023 alone. Now, when the power grid of America’s beloved Lone Star State is already stretched thin due to fast renewable integration and slow transmission upgrades, it is truly being pushed to the limit by a rush of AI and data center developments. While utilities forecast that new power won’t be available for years, developers are not deterred.

In San Antonio, grid operators informed data center operators they would not receive another megawatt of power until 2032. For most companies, that would be a signal to stand down. But data center developers are moving ahead with construction plans, resorting to behind-the-meter power sources like natural gas turbines and fuel cells to stay on course.

Experts at Texas-based IIR Energy, an energy market intelligence firm powered by Industrial Info Resources, indicate the trend as a milestone for Texas energy and technology industries. The firm’s research teams are observing how growth in data centers is transforming power usage, grid stability, and the economic landscape of the state.

The Texas Boom That Outpaced the Grid

Texas has become one of the hottest data center markets in the nation. IIR Energy estimates around $2.7 trillion in data center projects underway globally, with roughly $1 trillion in new capital spending invested in the United States in the last nine months. Much of this momentum is in Texas. Builders continue flocking to the state due to its mix of renewable energy, business-friendly tax incentives, and low-cost real estate.

Shane Mullins, IIR Energy’s Director of Global Power, explained how, in San Antonio, developers have already been informed that it will be 2032 before they can utilize another megawatt of power for growth. “It’s not holding up developers,” he said. “They’re just finding a way to do it another way.”

That resolve illustrates a larger truth: the digital economy is expanding faster than the infrastructure that supports it.

Behind the Meter: How Developers Are Adapting

To avoid delays on the grid, Texas developers are capitalizing on on-site generation systems to keep plans on track. The behind-the-meter strategy enables facilities to generate power independently, typically from natural gas-fired engines, small gas turbines, or fuel cells.

By building on-site power facilities, operators are becoming resilient and adaptable.

Mullins called this transition a revolution in how industry considers power. “Every data center is now a power project,” Mullins stated. “And every data center that’s not a power project is influencing the power industry.”

These developments bring technology and energy production closer together, with each new plant bringing stress as well as opportunity to the larger system.

A Reliability Crisis in the Making

Despite innovation, experts warn that Texas’s energy infrastructure is lagging behind. While renewable generation has grown rapidly, it cannot fully support AI’s constant power requirements.

Vice President of Power Industry Research at IIR Energy, Britt Burt, stated the imbalance is worse. “We’ve added a lot of wind, solar, and battery storage, but not much baseload generation—and that’s what we depend on every day to meet demand. The system hasn’t caught up,” he added.

While demand for electricity rises by up to two percent annually, reliability issues are accumulating nationwide. Texas, previously touted as energy independent, has become a benchmark for the consequences of digitalization outpacing infrastructure upgrades.

Coal-fired plants have postponed retirement to maintain pace with increasing load requirements, and wholesale prices have risen up to 800 percent in regional capacity auctions.

Reliable Data Matters

In this high-speed market that’s changing by the day, accurate information is critical. IIR Energy’s proprietary research approach enables its analysts to track projects from announcement to in-service, providing insight into developments that are actually happening and those that will fall short on grid constraints.

Executive Vice President of Marketing and Analytics at IIR Energy, Mike Bergen, noted that the value of the company lies in that level of verification. “We track projects through to completion,” he said. “So, at any given point in time, we can actually say how much of this $2 trillion market is actually approved and moving forward.”

This transparency gives confidence to energy traders, utilities, banks, and investors when making choices about where to invest and how to prepare for increasing demand.

In the end, the grid challenge in Texas is a national one: how to reconcile AI-driven innovation with sustainable, scalable energy supply. As Texas, the U.S., and beyond keep a close eye on the industry and data center progression, IIR Energy surfaces as more than a provider of numbers. They help determine where the next wave of opportunities and risks will land. Seeing those dynamics now will inform how Texas fuels the AI decade to come.",https://www.citybiz.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Matthew.png,N,,2025-11-04 12:12:15.524132

RESEARCHERS CREATE REVOLUTIONARY AI FABRIC THAT PREDICTS ROAD DAMAGE BEFORE IT HAPPENS

The road that powers your vehicle

The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University and Hutchinson. Together, they've installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.

So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car and bus — all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That's strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.

Charging ahead: Why it matters

If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.

For drivers, it could mean never having to worry about range anxiety again. Instead of hunting for the nearest charger, the highway itself could be your power source.

WOULD YOU BUY THE WORLD'S FIRST PERSONAL ROBOCAR?

The roadblocks ahead

The big questions now are about cost and control. Who pays to install these power roads? How much will it cost to use them? Public-private partnerships may hold the key, but until those details are ironed out, large-scale rollout remains a challenge.

Still, with global momentum building, it's only a matter of time before dynamic wireless charging becomes part of everyday driving.

What this means for you

This innovation is not limited to Europe. In Detroit, Michigan, a public road on 14th Street already uses embedded charging coils that can send power to EVs as they move. In Indiana, Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation are building a quarter-mile highway section designed to charge electric vehicles, including heavy trucks, while they travel.

For drivers, this technology could make owning an EV easier and more practical. Your vehicle could recharge during normal trips without the need to stop, plug in or wait. That level of convenience could help expand EV adoption across the United States, lowering emissions and fuel costs for millions.

Kurt's key takeaways

Wireless charging roads are moving from concept to construction and showing real promise for a new era of electric travel. The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.

,American Energy,2025-11-04 15:34:14+00:00,Utility Dive,What the last gas boom (and bust) says about today's rush to build | Utility Dive,"Diana DiGangi, Meris Lutz",,,,,https://www.utilitydive.com/news/gas-power-plant-boom-bust-data-center-ai-trump/801991/,"At the same time, major gas pipeline expansions are planned or proposed.
According to Enverus, capital costs for new natural gas power plants now average $2,200/kW to $3,000/kW.
Their competitiveness depends on the type of gas generation technology, which varies by efficiency, availability, ramp rate, cold startup cost and other factors.
Since then, the utility said its data center pipeline has shrunk by half — a positive development, said Wilmot from Enverus.
“This is a baby industry, and we are building and paying for infrastructure today for data centers that don’t yet exist,” he said.","This audio is auto-generated. Please let us know if you have feedback.

Twenty-five years ago, a data center boom helped fuel a race to build gas-fired power plants, with the energy secretary, utilities, politicians and experts warning of blackouts and economic stagnation if the country didn’t meet surging demand for electricity.

By 2001, however, the dot com bubble had burst, the economy was in recession and the huge demand increase never materialized. Efficiency and productivity improved rapidly, and demand remained more or less level for the next two decades, leaving many utilities with excess capacity and ratepayers footing the bill.

Some analysts and industry sources see parallels between then and now. Once again, headlines are warning of imminent energy shortfalls due largely to the power needs of artificial intelligence. Leading figures in government and industry are promoting more firm generation, and particularly gas, as a matter of economic and national security.

“Can the same thing happen? Definitely,” said Eugene Kim, Wood Mackenzie’s Americas Gas Research team director. “The utilities and anyone planning for power demand is forecasting unprecedented and, in some cases, even exponential growth. Whether that materializes or not – huge degree of uncertainty.”

Gas investment reaches new heights

Investment firms, utilities, tech giants, energy companies and others are pouring billions into acquiring existing gas plants or developing new ones to serve data centers. Gas power merger and acquisition valuations have doubled since 2024, reaching up to $1.93 million/MW in some markets, according to energy analytics firm Enverus.

While there are echoes of the millennium today, there are a few important differences.

The first is that the U.S. is producing and consuming more gas than ever before — driven largely by the rise of fracking — with production concentrated in Texas and Louisiana to the south, and Pennsylvania and West Virginia farther north.

Secondly, as the U.S. became a gas-producing powerhouse, the gas and electric power sectors have become much more interdependent. In 2000, the electric power sector accounted for about 22% percent of U.S. gas consumption, while gas accounted foraround 16% of electricity produced, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

By 2023, the electric power sector accounted for about 40% of total U.S. natural gas consumption, and gas accounted for about 42% to 43% of utility-scale electricity generation, making it the single largest fuel source, the EIA says. Over the years, the role of gas has grown, largely displacing coal as the latter became uneconomical.

The third key difference is the rise of renewables and storage on a large scale. While gas is the dominant source of fuel for U.S. power generation, it makes up a small fraction of new generation coming online this year, and energy storage is taking a small but growing share of daily peak demand when the sun goes down. Utility-scale wind and solar account for 83% of FERC’s “high probability” additions through July 2028, while gas makes up about 16%.

There is some evidence that could change.

The outlook for renewables has dimmed since President Donald Trump came to office this year and largely made good on his promises to repeal tax credits, permits and other government support for wind and solar while throwing his weight behind fossil fuels.

Scott Wilmot, an energy analyst at Enverus, said before the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act in July, he would have said the quality and size of the renewable project pipeline was more than enough to meet projected energy demands. Now, he’s not so sure.

“The reality is the [levelized cost of electricity] for these renewable projects has gone up without those tax credits,” he said. “A lot of folks who are developing these projects are probably reconsidering a lot of their pipeline.”

The PJM interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, is fast tracking 11.8 GW of generation, mostly from gas. Gas also dominated MISO’s fast track interconnection review, accounting for 19 GW out of 26 GW. In ERCOT, gas went from 6.8% of the interconnection queue in August 2024 to 9.1% as of August 2025.

At the same time, major gas pipeline expansions are planned or proposed.

Amy Andryszak, president and CEO of the Interstate National Gas Association of America, said existing pipelines are currently running at capacity, and her organization’s members are reporting a “record number” of inquiries for new pipelines from potential customers.

“They indicate they have not seen this level of interest in building since around 2010 when the fracking boom drove interest in pipeline development,” Andryszak said in an emailed statement. “Many members are already announcing new or revived pipeline projects, and we expect many more will file for certificates at [the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] over the next 18 months.”

FERC is expected to issue guidance soon on colocation rules, which could potentially make it easier to route gas directly to data centers and other large loads.

What would be the largest gas-fired power plant in the country is a 4.5 GW project being developed by Knighthead Capital Management at the former Homer City coal plant in Pennsylvania as part of a 3,200-acre data center campus.

Some developers say even without data centers, electricity demand is rising and gas, which is firm, dispatchable and proven, will be an important part of the energy mix for decades to come, especially as more coal generation retires.

Bilal Khan is an executive at Blackstone who oversaw the firm’s recent acquisition of the 620-MW natural gas power plant Hill Top Energy Center in Pennsylvania for about $1,600/kW. The state is part of PJM, which is already setting record capacity auction prices, making it an attractive market for producers. The grid operator has said that is due to supply and demand conditions, but its independent market monitor says data centers are the “primary reason” for the price surge.

Khan said that even putting aside data centers, he’s bullish on natural gas thanks to the other factors driving increased power demand, including manufacturing and electrification.

“We still need new power supply that’s reliable, consistent and affordable,” Khan said. “This moment is unique and in contrast to the last approximately 20 years when power demand was flat.”

A risky investment

Khan acknowledged, however, that new natural gas plants face significant obstacles. The backlog for new turbines, for example, can stretch up to seven years amid global competition for those and other components like transformers.

“There’s an equipment shortage, there’s a labor shortage and it’s more challenging to obtain all necessary permits,” Khan said.

And the cost of deploying new gas generation is rising fast.

According to Enverus, capital costs for new natural gas power plants now average $2,200/kW to $3,000/kW. An analysis by GridLab adds another $1,500/kW levelized for the 20-year cost of fuel and $500/kW for pipeline infrastructure, putting the cost of new gas generation at $4,000/kW to $4,500/kW.

Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon Energy, spent years working on natural gas projects alongside nuclear and renewables before transitioning to focus on renewables exclusively. He suggested there was a ceiling to how much gas could be built to meet near-term demand given the prices, pipeline constraints and interconnection queues.

“Tens of gigawatts of new generation from natural gas is likely at least five years away, if not more,” Smith said.

Changing market dynamics also mean new gas-powered generators face tighter conditions under which they would be economical to run, according to a recent report on thermal generation from Ascend Analytics.

Their competitiveness depends on the type of gas generation technology, which varies by efficiency, availability, ramp rate, cold startup cost and other factors. But overall, Ascend said, the value of gas assets will become increasingly concentrated in “narrow, infrequent windows of time,” increasing the importance of availability, secure fuel supply and strategically-scheduled preventative maintenance.

“In the face of rising electricity demand and declining capacity accreditation for renewables and storage, the need for dispatchable, long-duration capacity resources will persist. To meet this need, new gas capacity will be built,” it concluded. “However, investments in new gas should be made cautiously, prudently, and strategically. Thermal generation will remain a risky investment, with stranded asset risks not going away.”

Have utilities learned their lesson?

Against a backdrop of rising residential power bills, utilities and regulators say they are taking precautions to protect ratepayers from the possibility of a bubble.

NRG Energy’s vice president of regulatory affairs, Travis Kavulla, said past experience has formed the industry’s current approach in which competitive generators carry the risk of load forecasts – at least in deregulated markets.

“All of that has ramifications for the extent to which people are comfortable rapidly building out generation,” he said during a recent panel discussion hosted by the Heritage Foundation. “That’s why it’s so important for long-term offtake agreements to be formalized in this industry.”

Some regulators and utilities are moving to place more of the risk on hyperscalers by creating new rate classes for large loads. At least 30 states have proposed or approved large-load tariffs over the past several years to manage growth and protect existing ratepayers, according to a database from the North Carolina Clean Energy Technology Center and the Smart Electric Power Alliance.

“Whether those power plants or the gas pipeline go underutilized because that boom didn’t realize is yet to be determined.”

Eugene Kim

Wood Mackenzie’s Americas Gas Research team director

The Ohio Public Utilities Commission recently approved AEP Ohio’s plan to make data centers pay for at least 85% of the energy they request, even if they use less, to cover the cost of infrastructure. It also requires data centers to show they are financially viable and to pay an exit fee if their project is canceled or they can’t meet obligations.

Since then, the utility said its data center pipeline has shrunk by half — a positive development, said Wilmot from Enverus.

“We just can’t have absolutely unmitigated data center demand growth,” he said. “Otherwise, things are going to be very challenging for the ratepayer.”

Dominion Energy, which serves the area around Ashburn, Virginia – home to the highest concentration of data centers in the world — has proposed a similar tariff. Under its proposal, large load customers would be required to make a 14-year commitment to pay for the power they request regardless of how much they actually use.

Aaron Ruby, spokesperson for Dominion, said the utility is focused on making sure residential customers aren’t subsidizing the cost of infrastructure needed by data center customers and has yet to encounter delays as it pursues 5.9 GW of new gas generation.

He suggested, however, that there was little danger of overbuilding. In the last 20 years, he could only recall one example of Dominion developing infrastructure for a data center that fell through.

“Within a year or two, another data center customer emerged and fully utilized the infrastructure,” he said.

Others expressed skepticism.

Abe Silverman, an assistant research scholar with Johns Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute, said it was still very early to know what effects AI will have on power consumption.

“This is a baby industry, and we are building and paying for infrastructure today for data centers that don’t yet exist,” he said. “We are making an investment to build out that grid infrastructure based on these very frothy assumptions.”

Kim, the Wood Mackenzie gas researcher, suggested that the power industry has matured since the last bubble burst.

Back then, the three dominant gas turbine manfacturers — GE Vernova, Mitsubishi and Seimens — were “burned significantly,” he said. “The utilities were burned significantly by overbuilding, and now they’re more cautious.”

Kim predicted gas generation will likely continue to increase due to coal retirements and growing demand for electricity, with or without data centers. Advanced manufacturing facilities require more energy. Summers are getting hotter as the climate changes, increasing demand for cooling, and larger renewable portfolios will require dispatchable generation that cannot currently be replaced by storage, he added.

But an economic slump, technological innovation, improved efficiency and any number of unforeseen factors could impact what is still a highly speculative growth scenario, he said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/B4vwrgP2vkfth1H5ATt36B1w0vSN4Fyof8jpHl4RtiI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9ib282STVBMjU1Ny5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-04 11:02:37.617255

So this month, they’re hoping for fewer promises and more action.

Past pledges from nearly 200 nations have fallen far short and new plans submitted this year barely speed up pollution-fighting efforts, experts say. And if the numbers aren’t sobering enough for world leaders when they kick off the action Thursday, there’s the setting: Belem, a relatively poor city on the edge of a weakened Amazon.

Unlike past climate negotiations — and especially the one 10 years ago that forged the landmark Paris climate agreement — this annual U.N. conference isn’t primarily aimed at producing a grand deal or statement over its two weeks. Organizers and analysts frame this Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 — as the “implementation COP.”

“This is really going to be much more about what are we doing on the ground,” said former U.N. climate chief Christiana Figueres, who helped shepherd the 2015 Paris agreement aimed at limiting warming.

Figueres and many of more than three dozen experts interviewed by The Associated Press said negotiators have already pinned down the goal. What’s needed now is more money and political will for countries to put decades of words and promises into action and policy to reduce heat-trapping gases and stop deforestation. Only that will put the brakes on global warming as it careens toward a level the world has agreed is too dangerous, they say.

Adapting to a warmer world and saving forests

In Belem, diplomats, activists, scientists and business leaders will discuss new national climate-fighting plans, the need to save trees that absorb carbon pollution, how communities can adapt to warming and how to financially help developing nations hit hardest by climate change.

Host Brazil will preside and set the agenda. For the talks to be a success, world leaders need to beef up efforts and money for adapting to climate change and fund billion-dollar efforts to prevent deforestation and land degradation, said Suely Vaz, who used to run Brazil’s environment agency.

Those leaders arrive Thursday for a two-day pre-meeting summit to discuss ratcheting up the fight against climate change.

“Holding COP in the Amazon itself creates a new level of accountability. You can’t talk about climate solutions while standing on the land that’s absorbing the planet’s carbon and ignore the people who protect it,” said Eriel Tchekwie Deranger, a member of the Athabasca Chipewyan First Nation in Alberta, Canada, and executive director of the nonprofit Indigenous Climate Action.

Top polluters won’t be at pre-summit

That high-level meeting is likely to be missing top leaders of the biggest carbon-polluting nations: China, the U.S. and India. They contribute about 52% of the world’s heat-trapping carbon dioxide from the burning of coal, oil and natural gas.

China is sending its deputy premier. The U.S. is mostly skipping this conference under President Donald Trump, a climate change skeptic who’s begun the process of withdrawing from the Paris agreement. Some U.S. cities and states are coming to show that they and businesses take climate change seriously, said former U.S. Environmental Protection Agency chief Gina McCarthy, who co-chairs a group called America Is All In.

Palau President Surangel Whipps Jr. said it’s important world leaders understand the threat to countries like his: “Without the United States, without China, without India committing, we really have no hope.”

“We want to see action … particularly from the largest polluters,” Whipps said. “Our communities live on the front lines and we cannot afford more promises.”

Figueres said she hopes “because of the craziness in the United States that there is an expanded sense of, this is the moment to pull together.”

But Panama’s environment minister, Juan Carlos Navarro, told the AP he expects little from the talks. He said such meetings have become “a jet-setting orgy of bureaucrats who travel around the world with a tremendous carbon footprint and achieve nothing.”

Promising to cut more pollution or focusing on fulfilling pledges?

There’s already a divide on the nature of this meeting. Brazil is stressing implementation of past plans as well as what’s in new emissions-cutting plans submitted this year. But smaller island nations, such as Palau, and scientists are saying that’s not enough. It dooms Earth to 3 degrees Celsius (5.4 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming since pre-industrial times, they said.

Palau and other island nations want negotiators to tell countries to be more ambitious in their new carbon pollution-cutting plans.

Implementing “mediocrity,” said Natural Resources Defense Council adaptation chief Adelle Thomas, “is not creating a future for vulnerable nations.”

But if nations do what they’ve already promised in past climate-fighting plans, it could trim an entire degree Celsius — 1.8 degrees Fahrenheit — from projected warming, said Ani Dasgupta, chief executive of World Resources Institute. Scientists agreed with the estimate. Dasgupta said negotiators have too long focused on big commitments instead of outcomes in the real economy, which he said is “the messier thing” that doesn’t get headlines.

“What we now need to do is deliver against what we have signed on to,” said scientist Johan Rockstrom, director of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Research in Germany.

Path to disaster or optimism?

“The challenge today is not whether we will phase out fossil fuels. The challenge today is will we be too late?” Rockstrom said. “We are heading towards catastrophic 3 degrees.”

Figueres, the former U.N. climate chief, agreed it looks bad. But she co-founded an a organization called Global Optimism and said she’s sure the world can do this.

“My optimism is not naive. I know what we’re up against,” she said. “But my optimism is about determination. It’s about we’re up against a really, really, really challenging threat here. And we don’t give up.”

Before you can put a new horse to work, you've got to train it.

Jackson Watford was learning to do just that on a mild, sunny morning last September at Elk River Livestock, a regenerative ranch about 30 minutes north of Steamboat Springs.

The 21-year-old led a pony named Seven out of the stables, towards the training corral, or round pen.

“He is the youngest one on the ranch,” Watford said of the young horse. “He hasn't been messed with much this summer. So, this will be his first time in the round pen.”

With time and training, Seven would be able to join the team of working horses used to manage the ranch's cattle and pastures.

Watford was in training, too. As a first-year apprentice on the ranch, this experience earned him credit towards an associate's degree in agriculture business management from North Carolina State University.

At the same time, Watford learned the ins and outs of regenerative ranching—a method of raising livestock that involves grazing cattle at high densities for very short periods of time on small sections of pasture. The technique is much more labor intensive than conventional ranching, which keeps cattle spread out on much larger pastures for extended periods. Proponents say the regenerative style is more aligned with the natural ecosystem of the grasslands and promotes soil health.

The work kept Watford busy all summer, moving electric fencing and cattle from pasture to pasture.

“We would move them every day or two, to get them onto new grass and allow this grass to rest,” Watford explained. “It's definitely more work, but I really enjoy it and I think it's worth it in the end of the day.”

Watford’s mentor, rancher Davey Baron, owns and operates Elk River Livestock. He’s been ranching in Northwest Colorado for about a decade and sees this regenerative approach as critical for keeping the ranch afloat in a hotter, drier climate.

“Hearing old timers talk, we used to get monsoons every day. Used to be so wet,” Baron said. “Now we're dry.”

In fact, after seeing the region change over the years, Baron believes that adapting to the warming climate is now an essential skill for ranchers.

“If you're not managing differently for dry times, then you're not doing it correctly,” he said.

As climate change intensifies, adaptation skills are increasingly part of career training for the next generation of farmers and ranchers.

Hands-on climate adaptation

Training new agricultural producers in the art of climate adaptation is the big idea behind that apprenticeship program, which is run by the Quivia Coalition, an agriculture and environment nonprofit operating throughout the Mountain West.

“It offers an opportunity, particularly for people who don't come from ranching and farming backgrounds to get a foot in the door in these careers,” said Leah Ricci, the Quivira Coalition’s agrarian program director.

Since the apprenticeship program was launched in 2009, more than 150 apprentices have graduated. About 80% of them go on to have careers in agriculture. The regenerative techniques they learn as apprentices shape their approach to the work.

“As we're entering increasingly long periods of drought and climate instability, young people going into these careers know that it's not really a choice anymore,” Ricci said. “They have to be using climate smart practices in order to have a financially sustainable business.”

Mentors are veteran farmers and ranchers with deep experience in regenerative techniques who feel called to pass their specialized knowledge forward to the next generation of agricultural producers. Many see the mentoring as a necessity – a way for them to cultivate the kind of workforce they want to tap.

“Some of them have talked with us about the challenge of finding labor who care about the same things and are excited about moving fence as often as they have to do to get the grazing outcomes that they want,” Ricci said.

Climate adaptation enters the classroom

These days, hands-on experiences like the Quivira Coalition’s apprenticeship complement what goes on in the classroom as climate adaptation becomes a bigger, more sophisticated part of the national agriculture curriculum.

“Agriculture producers have to address climate change,” said Travis Park, director for agricultural education with the National Council for Agricultural Education. “It's causing additional stresses on livestock. There are new diseases and pest pressures. So, they have to change their management practices (based) on the science end of agriculture.”

Education in climate adaptation doesn’t stop at regenerative practices. Agriculture students today learn things like how to use advanced technology—drones and artificial intelligence—to be smarter about their work. It’s a practice called enhanced precision agriculture. Farmers make use of granular data about soil type, historical yield rates and crop growth to apply only the right amount of pesticides and fertilizers with hyper precision, at the exact time and placement best suited for each crop. The approach helps farmers cut down on costly inputs and respond in real time to changing climate conditions.

“We want our students to understand the science of agriculture,” Park said. “And to understand the science of agriculture, we need to understand the science of climate change and make production decisions based on the science in both those areas.”

That science is now being taught to more than a million students enrolled in agriculture education programs at high schools and colleges across the country.

But for ranching apprentice Jackson Watford, it’s the hands-on experience learning regenerative techniques at Elk River Livestock that captured his imagination.

“I really learned a lot more being out here than I did two years in college,” Watford said. “Experiencing everything day to day, making mistakes, messing stuff up—I learn a lot better doing that than just sitting in a classroom.”

Miles from any classroom, in the training corral with the unschooled pony at Elk River, Watford was trying to get the animal used to following directions. His mentor, Davey Baron, stood by and coached, offering tips on the subtler details of horsemanship.

“You're not trying to force him into submission,” Baron counseled his apprentice. “You're trying to make him a tough, resilient thinker.”

It's what Baron is trying to do for the next generation of ranchers, too. After all, he said they'll need to be smart and nimble to stay ahead of a volatile climate.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/83ee55f/2147483647/strip/true/crop/4192x2201+0+472/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F01%2F20%2F5b2c7e7c4e0aaa033fe54440f48b%2Fimg-2713-edit.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 11:03:42.892199

With Proposition 50, Newsom placed himself at the center of another potentially career-defining gamble before knowing how it would land.
Six out of 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times.
“We are talking about Proposition 50 on a nationwide scale,” Levinson said.
“And it’s really hard to talk about Proposition 50 without saying the words ‘Gov.","Gov. Gavin Newsom stepped to the microphone at the state Democratic headquarters in mid-August with the conviction of a man certain he was on the right side of history, bluntly saying California has a moral obligation to thwart President Trump’s attempt to tilt the balance of Congress.

Over the next 2½ months, Newsom became the public face of Proposition 50, a measure designed to help Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives by temporarily redrawing California’s congressional districts.

Newsom took that leap despite tepid support for a gerrymandering measure in early polls.

With Tuesday’s election, the fate of Proposition 50 arrives at a pivotal moment for Newsom, who last week acknowledged publicly that he’s weighing a 2028 presidential run. The outcome will test not only his political instincts but also his ability to deliver on a measure that has national attention fixed squarely on him.

From the outset, Newsom paired his conviction with caution.

“I’m mindful of the hard work ahead,” Newsom said in August, shortly after lawmakers placed Proposition 50 on the ballot.

It was familiar territory for a governor who has built a career on high-stakes political bets. As San Francisco mayor, his decision to issue same-sex marriage licenses in 2004 made him a progressive icon. It also drew accusations he’d energized conservative turnout that year in the presidential election that ended with George W. Bush winning a second term.

As the state’s newly elected governor, he suspended the death penalty in 2019 despite voters having twice rejected measures to do so, calling it a costly and biased system that “fails to deliver justice” — a move that drew fury from law enforcement groups and victims’ families. His decision to take on Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in a 2023 prime-time debate hosted by Sean Hannity on Fox News was intended to showcase his command of policy and political agility, but instead fell flat amid an onslaught of insults.

With Proposition 50, Newsom placed himself at the center of another potentially career-defining gamble before knowing how it would land. Ahead of Tuesday’s special election, polling suggests he may have played his cards right. Six out of 10 likely voters support Proposition 50, according to a survey by UC Berkeley’s Institute of Governmental Studies that was co-sponsored by The Times.

“You know, not everybody would have done it,” veteran Democratic strategist Gale Kaufman said. “He saw the risk and he took it.”

If approved by voters, the ballot measure would redraw California’s congressional maps to favor Democrats beginning with the 2026 midterm elections in hopes of discounting Republican efforts to gerrymander more seats for themselves. California introduced the measure in response to Trump and his political team leaning on Republican-led states to redraw their district lines to help Republicans retain control of the House.

The balance of power in the closely divided House will determine whether Trump can advance his agenda during his final two years in office — or face an emboldened Democratic majority that could move to challenge, or even investigate, his administration.

And while critics of the governor see a power-craving politician chasing headlines and influence, supporters say this is classic Newsom: confident, risk-tolerant and willing to stand alone when he believes he’s right. He faced intense backlash from his political allies when he had conservative personality Charlie Kirk as his inaugural guest on his podcast this year, on which Newsom said he believed it was “deeply unfair” for transgender athletes to compete in women’s sports. After Kirk was killed, Newsom regularly brought up that interview as a point of pride, noting the backlash he received from his own party over hosting a Trump ally.

In recent months Newsom struck a deal to stabilize struggling oil refineries, pushed cities to ban homeless encampments and proposed walking back healthcare coverage for undocumented immigrants — a series of moves that have tested his standing with progressives. Supporters say the moves show his pragmatic streak, while critics argue they reflect a shift to the center ahead of a possible presidential run.

“In so many ways, he is not a cautious politician,” said Jessica Levinson, a law professor at Loyola Law School. “His brand is big, bold decisions.”

With Proposition 50, Newsom has cast the redistricting counterpunch as a moral imperative, arguing that Democrat-led states must “fight fire with fire,” even if it means pausing a state independent redistricting process largely considered the gold standard. The measure upends a system Californians overwhelmingly endorsed to keep politics out of the map-drawing process.

Levinson said Newsom’s profile has been rising along with the polling numbers for Proposition 50 as he has booked national television shows like ‘The Late Show with Stephen Colbert” and appeared in an ad in favor of the ballot measure with former President Obama, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and other prominent Democrats that ran during the World Series.

“We are talking about Proposition 50 on a nationwide scale,” Levinson said. “And it’s really hard to talk about Proposition 50 without saying the words ‘Gov. Newsom of California spearheading the effort to pass.’”

California Republicans have called the effort misguided, arguing that the retaliatory response creates a slippery slope that would erode the independent redistricting process California voters have chosen twice at the ballot box.

“When you fight fire with fire, the whole world burns,” said California Rep. Kevin Kiley (R-Rocklin), whose district is among those that would be overhauled under Proposition 50. “Newsom is trying to claim that Texas did a bad gerrymandering, but what California is doing is a good gerrymander because somehow it’s canceling it out … I just think gerrymandering is wrong. It’s wrong in Texas and it’s wrong in California.”

Kiley said Newsom never has been one to shy away from national attention “and for pursing explicitly partisan goals.”

“He’s certainly used this as an opportunity to do both of those things,” Kiley said.

Out of the gate, the redistricting plan had lackluster support. Then came the flood of ads by proponents peppered with talking points about Trump rigging the election.

Supporters of Proposition 50 took in more than four times the amount that opponents raised in recent weeks, according to campaign finance reports filed with the state by the three main committees campaigning about the measure. Supporters of Proposition 50 raised so much money that Newsom told them “you can stop donating.”

Political analysts said the redistricting fight has given Newsom what every ambitious politician craves: a narrative. It’s allowed him to cast himself as a defender of democracy while reenergizing donors. That message sharpened when Trump administration officials said they’d monitor polling sites in several California counties at the state GOP’s request, prompting Newsom to accuse the Trump administration of “voter intimidation.”

Republican strategist Rob Stutzman said the campaign gave Newsom something he’d struggled to find: “an authentic confrontation” with Trump that resonates beyond California.

“And I think it’s worked well for him nationally,” Stutzman said. “I think it’s been great for him in some ways, regardless of what happens, but if it does lose, it’ll hurt the brand that he can win and there will be a lot of disgruntled donors.”

While Newsom has framed the measure as good for the country, Stutzman said it’s clear that Proposition 50 has been particularly good for the governor.

“He’s used it for his own purposes very, very effectively,” Stutzman said. “If he becomes the [presidential] nominee, you could look back and say this was an important part of him getting there.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/9c23c70/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5869x3081+0+459/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F58%2F51%2F437d04d84f3c88727e19fcc4fe30%2F2231388676.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 12:11:32.118738

Portuguese utility EDP SA says the outlook for investing in US renewable energy has become significantly clearer, easing concerns that followed the first months of Donald Trump’s presidency.

“The situation has become much more stable,” Chief Executive Officer Miguel Stilwell de Andrade said on Tuesday in a Bloomberg Television interview in New York. “There was a lot of uncertainty, certainly at the beginning of the year, in terms of the policies. Now at least we have visibility, with the Big Beautiful Bill.”

The comments come after Trump’s attempts to stall offshore wind projects forced EDP and its Ocean Winds joint-venture partner Engie SA of France to announce impairments in February. Denmark’s Orsted A/S only recently won a court ruling to resume work on its nearly completed Rhode Island wind farm.

Since starting his second term in January, Trump has issued a series of orders against the offshore wind industry, including halting new seabed leases and blocking federal permits for existing ones. Executives had expected projects that were already fully permitted would be spared from the administration’s hostility toward offshore wind.

Shares of EDP Renovaveis SA — the listed renewables arm of EDP — lost almost a third of their value earlier this year, hitting the lowest since 2018 in April, before rebounding more than 50%. Parent company EDP SA has also rallied, climbing about 35% from a more than six-year low in early April.

EDP has already poured more than $20 billion into US wind and solar projects and continues to see North America, along with Europe, as a core growth region. The company pledged earlier this year to keep adding renewable capacity, though at a slower pace than previously planned.

“We need a stable legislative framework to be able to invest, and I think that’s what we’re looking for,” the CEO said.

On Trump’s tariffs, d’Andrade said most of EDP’s supply chain is now based in the US as the company turns to domestically-made products, citing a framework agreement with panel manufacturer First Solar Inc. The underlying cost to produce solar panels in the US is maybe two times what it would cost elsewhere, according to the CEO.

“It’s more expensive than if you import it, although nowadays with the uncertainty around tariffs we prefer to pay that premium but ensure a stable supply chain,” d’Andrade said.

“China’s updated NDC is a significant moment in our collective climate effort.

China’s NDC will deliver clean, reliable, and affordable energy at an unprecedented scale and help accelerate the transition by lowering the cost of clean technologies and driving innovation.

Today’s news is another signal that the future global economy will run on clean energy.

NDCs will be among the most important policy documents this century because they can accelerate economic transformation, driving more economic growth, jobs, affordable and secure energy, cleaner air, and better health.

China, like so many other countries, sees a clear national interest in building a cleaner, more prosperous future, with President Xi noting at the Secretary-General's recent climate summit that ""green and low-carbon transition is the trend of the time''.

Every day now, new NDCs are being submitted by economies around the world, and more are expected in the coming days.

In the past few weeks alone, we have also received new NDCs from: Indonesia, South Africa, Malaysia, Côte d’Ivoire, Mauritania, Zambia, and Cabo Verde, adding to those previously submitted.

Recent data shows how far we’ve come and how much further we still have to go. But I’m encouraged by President Xi’s remarks at the recent climate summit, and reflected fully in today NDC submission, committing both to emissions reduction targets and saying that China will be striving to do better.

President Xi, like so many leaders, recognizes that change is happening fast, sometimes even faster than governments can account for.

In that light, I hope that the NDCs we receive will be a floor, not a ceiling for ambition. And that every country sees it in its interest to go further and faster, to protect all their people from worsening climate disasters, and reap the vast human and economic benefits of stronger climate action.”",https://unfccc.int/themes/custom/unfccc/favicons/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-04 10:18:32.501376

The Indiana-based company expects to start delivering electricity in 2028 using gas, and then deploy its liquid-metal fast reactor by 2032, according to Chief Executive Officer Mike Reinboth. The facility will include a system to reprocess and reuse spent fuel, minimizing the deadly waste produced by reactors, First American said in a statement Tuesday.

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

“Data centers are driving the demand for power,” he said.

First American is designing a 240-megawatt liquid metal reactor that uses lead bismuth as a coolant. It’s the only company using this technology in the US, though it’s been used in Russian submarines for years.

The reprocessing system will be able to convert spent uranium from the plant into new fuel, making the plants cheaper to operate and eliminating the challenge posed by the toxic waste created by conventional reactors.

“The waste actually gives you energy,” said Bill Stokes, the company’s founder and president.

CMS Energy pumped $15,000 into Protect MI Free Speech, the committee formed to oppose the Michiganders for Money Out of Politics ballot initiative. The other $15,000 backing the opposition campaign came from health insurance giant Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, which would also be prohibited from making campaign contributions under the proposal.

The Michiganders for Money Out of Politics framework would ban regulated utilities like Consumers Energy from giving money to state officeholders and political party committees. The prohibition would also extend to corporations with state or local government contracts worth more than $250,000 annually, like Blue Cross Blue Shield. Under the framework, dark money 501(c)(4) nonprofits – including a prominent one affiliated with Consumers Energy – would be required to disclose pre-election ad spending.

The coalition pushing the proposal includes Clean Water Action, Climate Cabinet, Community Change Action, Detroit Action, Michigan League of Conservation Voters, Michigan United Action, MOSES Action, Progress Michigan, and Voters Not Politicians.

Utility influence is a key driver of ballot initiative

Consumers Energy and DTE Energy, Michigan’s two largest corporate monopoly utilities, are among the most influential political forces in the state. Through their Political Action Committees (PACs), the two utilities have reported more than $1.7 million in contributions to current elected officials across their political careers, according to an Energy and Policy Institute analysis of campaign finance reports.

The review found that 122 of 148 current state legislators – or 82 percent – have received utility PAC money. Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer tops the list with $151,315 in utility PAC giving through October 2025. She appoints the regulators who oversee Michigan utilities, and who determine how much they can raise rates and how much they can profit. These proceedings have grown increasingly contentious in recent years as Consumers Energy and DTE Energy seek frequent rate increases while customers experience frequent outages, relative to other utilities in the region.

Earlier this year, Whitmer faced blowback for effectively ousting a well-respected regulator, Alessandra Carreon, and replacing her with Shaquila Myers, a political ally who pushed for utility priorities in her previous role as a top legislative aide.

After Whitmer, Republican Senate Minority Leader Aric Nesbitt – a Republican gubernatorial candidate – is next in line with $142,825 in utility PAC contributions through October 2025. Like their peers in other states, the Michigan utility PACs have historically given to elected officials in both parties, often funneling the most to those in leadership positions who have the most sway in shaping the legislative agenda.

To date, legislative efforts to rein in Consumers Energy and DTE Energy have largely stalled out, including a bill that would’ve restricted their political spending without the ballot drive now underway. Utility PAC giving has coincided with pivotal votes on key energy bills, prompting environmental justice and clean energy advocates to blame inaction on utilities’ outsize influence in Lansing.

“While Michigan families continue to pay the highest rates in the Midwest for the worst service, DTE and Consumers are writing check after check to lawmakers helping their CEOs protect this broken status quo,” Bob Allison, deputy director of the Michigan League of Conservation Voters, said earlier this year. “Michiganders of all political stripes chafe at our elected leaders being so blatantly influenced by the very utilities they, by law, are responsible for overseeing on behalf of us.”

Utilities channel millions of dollars more through dark money groups

Beyond the contributions made through their PACs, both Consumers Energy and DTE Energy have funded dark money 501(c)(4) nonprofit organizations that amplify their political giving, or their senior employees have led those groups. By using dark money groups, corporate interests can make donations, in secret, that exceed campaign finance limits. The groups also place ads designed to influence election outcomes.

These 501(c)(4) nonprofits – notoriously secretive, and designed to obscure how the money flows – would face greater scrutiny, and exposure, if the proposed ballot initiative passes. It would mandate disclosures of ad spending in the leadup to elections, commonly placed in service of utility-friendly candidates and their preferred policy outcomes.

While the utilities have insisted such nonprofits operate separately from them, their ties are clear.

One such dark money group, Citizens for Energizing Michigan’s Economy (CEME), has received over $43 million in contributions from Consumers Energy, whose executives and lobbyists sit on its board. CEME has contributed tens of millions of dollars to politically connected organizations over the past decade, while its spending on election season ads prompted a complaint filed with the Internal Revenue Service that questioned the legality of CEME’s activities.

Likewise, DTE Energy lobbyists and executives comprise the board of Michigan Energy First (MEF), a 501(c)(4) nonprofit that has pumped millions of dollars into funds affiliated with state officials and into advertising campaigns designed to influence state elections and policy decisions. Records daylighted in a criminal court case earlier this year showed a DTE Energy staffer was coordinating dark money donations on behalf of MEF using her DTE email account.

For those watching Michigan politics in recent years, the links are not surprising. After former Michigan House Energy Chair Gary Glenn, a Republican, took a hard line against Consumers Energy and DTE Energy priorities and profits in 2018, utility-affiliated dark money groups spent an estimated $1 million on a campaign to unseat him – a massive amount for a single legislative race.

Glenn lost, and with CEME in particular sitting on a multimillion-dollar war chest, Consumers Energy continues to loom large in state politics. Its most recent tax filing shows CEME was holding onto $12.7 million in assets as of December 2023 – a sizable war chest given typical spending in legislative races. MEF reported $7.6 million in assets at the end of 2023.

“By hanging my hide on the wall, utilities will intimidate even more legislators. Many legislators walk around scared of their own shadow when it comes to utility lobbyists,” Glenn told Midwest Energy News after his loss. “I am more disappointed in that than I have been about having lost the race — the fact that they’ll be able to intimidate other lawmakers by pointing to what they did in my race.”

Since then, both utilities’ dark money affiliates have continued to run ads during campaign season. They have also quietly given hefty sums to groups affiliated with sitting elected officials and political parties, including Whitmer and former House Speaker Joe Tate, who presided over the House as utility accountability bills languished in 2023.

“It essentially amounts to legal bribery,” State Rep. Dylan Wegela, a Democrat who has supported restricting utility campaign spending, previously told the Detroit News. “How else can you explain our lack of action on holding DTE accountable, especially, considering it’s one of the most popular and important issues?”

Protect MI Free Speech cash flowing to dark money lawyer

In addition to reporting five-figure contributions from CMS Energy and Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan, the disclosure filed last week by Protect MI Free Speech also detailed its spending so far.

Nearly 90 percent of the $30,000 raised so far – $26,525 – went to Eric Doster, an attorney who helps run CEME and MEF, the dark money nonprofits linked to Consumers Energy and DTE Energy. This spending covers legal fees, according to the filing.

Doster is also legal counsel for the Michigan Economic Development Foundation, a separate nonprofit facing scrutiny recently. The organization uses donations from large corporations – including Consumers Energy and DTE Energy – to fund Whitmer’s overseas trade trips, an arrangement critics say promotes inappropriate coziness between Whitmer and big business interests. Those with board seats got access to Whitmer and high-profile staff, plus billions of dollars in state economic development incentives in recent years, the Detroit News reported.

Doster’s wife, Mary, is listed in the filing as the “designated record keeper” for Protect MI Free Speech, and she lists her address as the Ingham County home she and Eric Doster share. Mary Doster is a GOP insider who has helped run campaigns for Republican candidates and causes in Michigan.

In addition to the fees paid to Doster, Protect MI Free Speech reported another $2,385 on legal fees paid to Dykema Gossett, a law firm that represents utilities and other corporate interests in Michigan.

The next required disclosure from Protect MI Free Speech is due Feb. 2.

“We have the groundwork in place to make solar power and renewable energy much more accessible than they are now,” celebrated climate activist Bill McKibben told people from all over the country on a Sept. 25 Zoom call.

The virtual gathering was organized by Third Act, a national organization of people over 60 confronting the climate crisis. It took place just days after a Third Act-coordinated nationwide day of action called Sun Day, which saw over 500 events in 49 states draw attention to renewable energy’s vast potential.

At a time when U.S. climate organizations are largely on the defensive, fighting the Trump administration’s rollbacks to climate action at the federal level, McKibben’s words underscored how Third Act has identified a rare opportunity to make real, short-term progress toward a clean energy future. The organization wants to remove local and state-level barriers that prevent people from harnessing the power of the sun.

“This is one area where we don’t have to wait,” said Third Act campaign strategist Jeremy Friedman. “You don’t have to wait for your state legislature to make things better, or for voters to throw out the politicians in Congress who repealed national climate legislation. We don’t have to wait for any policy change coming down from the top before we start taking action.”

Third Act calls its new campaign Simplify Solar. “It’s really more of a project than a single campaign,” Friedman said. “This is a decentralized effort, where volunteers will work at the local level to advance individual campaigns in their own communities.”

If successful, Simplify Solar could show how climate activists can still move the ball forward for clean energy, even at a time of unprecedented attacks on federal progress.

Removing barriers

“Solar is no longer ‘alternative’ energy,” said Deborah Moore, another Third Act strategist. “It’s really the best way to go.”

Solar energy is not only one of the cleanest forms of electricity, it’s also cheaper than energy from fossil fuels in much of the world, including large parts of the United States. Yet, a patchwork of state and local regulations adds time and expense to the process of installing home solar systems in the U.S. Many of these rules constitute unnecessary red tape that prevents people from powering their homes with clean, affordable energy.

By challenging governments to remove these barriers, Third Act activists believe they can help clear a real roadblock to the widespread adoption of clean energy — and there isn’t much the Trump administration can do about it. The organization’s first step is gathering on-the-ground information about current regulations.

Currently, there is no single, publicly accessible database about how different towns, cities and counties handle solar permitting. This presents problems for people who want to install renewable energy, but whose only guide for how to navigate the process comes from solar companies themselves.

“One of the barriers to the uptake of solar is poor information,” said Karen Gladding, a member of the coordinating committee for Third Act D.C. “And where do you go, except to a local installer? And then immediately you’re under pressure to sign a contract.”

This fall, Third Act is organizing a series of virtual trainings to help volunteers learn how to track down information about current policies pertaining to solar in their communities, then crowd source the information into a central database. This will provide a foundation for the next part of the project: persuading governments to remove unnecessary regulations.

“At the outset, we’re not treating city and county officials as targets who necessarily need to be pushed hard,” Friedman said. “Some may be allies waiting in the wings, who are ready to be invited into a partnership by our volunteers. A first step is to see what officials are already willing to work with us.”

Once activists identify where the rules for home solar need to be changed, and which lawmakers are receptive to helping, it will be time to put pressure on those decision makers who are more recalcitrant. This will likely involve some creative activism.

“I call it bureaucracy theater,” Friedman said. “We set up some desks along a sidewalk, complete with stacks of paper and a musty, white-wigged administrator behind the counter. Then, a volunteer playing the part of a beleaguered city resident goes from table to table, trying to get their solar permit approved and getting nowhere.”

Friedman said this kind of street theater is “a way to poke a little fun at the experience of navigating bureaucracy in the modern world.” The message is serious, though: Today, regulations governing rooftop solar aren’t just an inconvenience, but a genuine roadblock to progress on climate change.

“An exciting thing about this work is it’s something people can join from anywhere,” Friedman said. “Unlike so many other campaigns, you can find meaningful ways to participate whether you live in a red, blue or purple state.”

Spanning political divides

“Too often in politics, there’s an overwhelming focus on so-called purple states,” Friedman said. “This leaves people who don’t live in those states without many ways to contribute. Progressives in blue areas assume their state governments are already doing the right thing, while those in red states feel their representatives will never listen to them.”

The issues Simplify Solar seeks to tackle are less straightforward. For example, blue states may have some of the most burdensome regulations holding solar back.

“Up until now, one of the worst states in the country for putting solar on your roof has been New Jersey,” Friedman said. “They actually have more state incentives to make solar cheaper than many other states — but the difficulty of the permitting process makes it so solar is still more expensive in New Jersey than neighboring Pennsylvania. That’s wasted money people are being forced to pay for very little reward.”

A bill passed by the New Jersey legislature this year will help streamline the process for approving home solar installations, assuming it’s signed into law by Gov. Phil Murphy. However, the difficulties solar advocates have encountered there until recently illustrates how barriers to renewables can arise in unlikely places.

Simplify Solar isn’t about complete deregulation.

“We need to ensure solar installations are safe,” Friedman said. “But once that’s taken care of, there doesn’t have to be a lot of additional government intervention.”

Renewable advocates in politically red states can also take action, sometimes at the local level. Red states often contain urban centers where progressive lawmakers may be receptive to climate activists’ message.

Beyond this, the fact that simplifying solar is about reducing government regulation suggests at least the potential for genuinely bipartisan solutions. This year, Utah — one of the most conservative states in the country — passed a “balcony solar bill,” allowing people to plug small solar systems directly into home electrical outlets without additional fees.

Simplify Solar’s state-level work is entering a quiet period, since most state legislatures meet mainly in the first half of the year. The project will use this time to collect more information about what state regulatory frameworks could most likely be improved.

“Going into January and February, we’ll know a lot more about where legislators are willing and interested in introducing better laws,” Friedman said.

Once state legislative sessions start, Third Act members expect to contact and meet with lawmakers, testify at legislative hearings and engage in more creative kinds of activism. These same types of action will be going on at the local level.

There’s reason to think the organization’s specific volunteer power base might be uniquely suited to push this momentum forward.

Acting now

“Third Actors are especially well positioned for this work, in some ways,” Friedman said. “Our volunteers are more likely to be homeowners than younger people. They’re more likely to have lived in one place for a long time, giving them a relationship with their town and local politics. Those who are retired also likely have flexible daytime hours for interacting with officials.”

Third Act was founded with the goal of marshalling the resources and creativity of people over 60 to tackle climate change. This makes it stand out from other climate groups that have tended to be led by young people, and which in some cases explicitly focus on engaging students.

Young activists will likely always play an important role in the climate movement. But few high school or college students have experience navigating local bureaucracies to make home improvements. Third Act’s volunteers are more likely to be familiar with these processes.

Of course, older people also bring other valuable life experiences to the table. “We have members who are retired city employees, who are former elected officials, and folks who’ve been lawyers,” Friedman says. “Now, they can draw on all those years of experience to inform their activism.”

There are many different ways for volunteers to plug into Third Act’s campaigns. “A lot of how people engage will depend on temperament and ability,” Friedman said. “We’ve got folks with mobility issues, for example, who maybe can’t go testify at City Hall, but who can do research from home on existing local solar policies and share what they find with others.”

If successful, this work will lead to improved accessibility of home renewable energy systems for people all over the United States. This would help counteract some Trump administration efforts to remove renewable energy incentives, while laying the groundwork for rapid growth of renewables when the national political environment shifts again.

“With climate change, of course, we’re up against a real timeline to prevent the crisis from worsening,” Friedman said. “What’s so appealing about this project is it’s an opportunity to cut costs for solar no one wanted to pay — and to do it right now.”

Background The PTC is a refundable tax credit designed to help eligible individuals and families afford health insurance purchased through the ACA marketplace.
Projections on the number of people who would become uninsured vary slightly, though they all point to a significant increase.
The authors note this figure is larger than prior-year estimates partly because marketplace enrollment in 2025 was substantially higher than expected.
Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said at an October 29 “Save the ACA” rally organized by the Economic Security Project that the “enhanced ACA tax credits made health insurance more affordable for families and more than 89,000 Minnesotans.","Enhanced Affordable Care Act premium tax credits (PTCs) are set to expire at the end of 2025, and without congressional action, millions of Americans face sharply higher health insurance premiums and potential coverage loss, with significant consequences for household and federal budgets, according to stakeholders.

Millions of Americans who purchase health insurance through the Affordable Care Act (ACA) marketplace face steep premium increases in 2026 as the enhanced PTCs are set to expire. The enhancements, which were enacted as part of the American Rescue Plan Act (ARPA) and later extended through 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), will end unless Congress intervenes.

Background

The PTC is a refundable tax credit designed to help eligible individuals and families afford health insurance purchased through the ACA marketplace. As explained in a Congressional Research Service (CRS) report, which was initially published earlier this year and last updated in September, the credit works by capping the amount a household is expected to contribute toward a “benchmark” silver-level health plan, with the government subsidy covering the rest.

Prior to 2021, eligibility was limited to households with incomes between 100% and 400% of the federal poverty level (FPL), creating a “subsidy cliff” where a small income increase could make a family entirely ineligible for assistance. The ARPA and IRA enhancements temporarily eliminated this cliff by extending eligibility to those with incomes above 400% of the FPL and made the subsidies more generous overall.

These changes fueled record marketplace enrollment, which, according to a February 2025 explainer from the Commonwealth Fund, grew from 12 million people in 2021 to a record 24.2 million in 2025.

Rising Costs, Coverage Losses

If the enhancements expire, premiums for marketplace enrollees will rise sharply. A report published October 29 by Gideon Lukens and Elizabeth Zhang at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities (CBPP) projects that the amount the average enrollee pays will more than double. For example, a family of four making $130,000 (about 404% of the FPL) would see their monthly premium jump from $921 to $1,998 — an annual increase of about $12,900.

This “rate shock” is expected to push millions out of the insurance market. Projections on the number of people who would become uninsured vary slightly, though they all point to a significant increase. The Congressional Budget Office (CBO), in a June 2024 letter from Director Phillip Swagel to House Republican leaders, estimated that the number of uninsured people would rise by 3.8 million, on average, in each year over the 2026-2034 period.

Subsequent analyses showed a growing consensus around that number. The Commonwealth Fund’s Senior Scholar Sara Collins and Program Assistant Carson Richards projected that 4 million people would likely become uninsured. The Economic Security Project forecasted that 4.2 million people will lose coverage.

An analysis from the Urban Institute, authored in September by Senior Fellow Fredric Blavin and Principal Research Associate Michael Simpson, projects an even larger impact, with 4.8 million more adults becoming uninsured in 2026. The authors note this figure is larger than prior-year estimates partly because marketplace enrollment in 2025 was substantially higher than expected.

Representative Ilhan Omar (D-MN) said at an October 29 “Save the ACA” rally organized by the Economic Security Project that the “enhanced ACA tax credits made health insurance more affordable for families and more than 89,000 Minnesotans. Their loss would mean skyrocketing premiums,” she said. “This will hit middle-class Americans, small business owners, farmers and people [aged] 55 and older, the hardest.”

Budget Forecast

Swagel had found that making the enhanced PTC permanent would increase the federal budget deficit by an estimated $335 billion over the 2025-2034 period. This net cost reflects a complex shift in coverage, including a projected 3.5 million decrease in employment-based coverage as some workers switch to more affordable marketplace options, he wrote last June.

The Urban Institute’s more current analysis highlights that allowing the credits to expire would create other economic pressures, even while avoiding direct federal spending. The report projects that the resulting increase in the uninsured population would lead to a $7.7 billion increase in the demand for uncompensated care in 2026.

This cost, the report claims, is not a federal budget line item but is instead absorbed by hospitals, physicians, and state and local governments, placing a financial strain on the broader health care system.

At last Wednesday’s rally, Jennifer Flynn Walker, co-director of campaigns for Popular Democracy in Action, told attendees outside the Capitol building, “Families are struggling to pay rent and keep their health care while [President Trump] demolishes the East Wing to build a $300 million ballroom for his billionaire friends, instead of reopening the government and fixing the health care crisis affecting millions of us.”

Congress should pass the Fix Our Forests Act before the end of the year to give communities and agencies the tools they need to address this challenge.","In an overwhelming bipartisan vote, the Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry advanced a bill to address the growing threat of wildfires. There is now broad consensus that the poor health of our forests are threatening communities, public health and emissions goals.

But, as the bipartisan, bicameral Fix Our Forests Act proves, we don’t simply have to accept this as our new normal.

Recent fire seasons have been devastating — burning millions of acres, destroying thousands of homes and putting lives at risk. The growing wildfire challenge is also threatening climate goals, as forest fires increasingly become a source of emissions.

In 2020, for example, one wildfire season in California produced twice the emissions that the state had reduced between 2003 and 2019 combined, effectively wiping out 16 years of progress. Similarly, Canada’s 2023 wildfires released more carbon in just a few months than Russia or Japan emits from all fossil fuel use in an entire year.

While climate change plays a role in wildfires increasing in size, severity and frequency, the main driver is decades of poor forest management, which has left forests dense, overgrown and unhealthy. Under these conditions, our forests become tinderboxes, ready to ignite at any moment. Restoring them to a healthy state is crucial for protecting both our communities and our environment.

Unfortunately, many critical projects needed to restore our forests get stalled in lengthy review processes and legal challenges, unable to break ground before the next catastrophic wildfire hits.

For example, it’s not uncommon for the Forest Service to propose a project and start the National Environmental Policy Act process, only for an uncontrolled wildfire to burn the area before the environmental review is complete. It’s not surprising considering the fact that it takes an average of nearly five years to simply start a prescribed fire project, and forest management projects face more litigation under the act than any other project type.

Still, not all news is bad — in at least one case, we may have learned a valuable lesson. Through the Water Infrastructure Improvements for the Nation Act, enacted in 2016, Congress established a categorical exclusion for forest thinning projects of up to 10,000 acres within the Lake Tahoe Basin.

This policy allowed the Forest Service to implement critical forest treatments quickly. When the Caldor Fire ignited in 2021 and ultimately burned over 220,000 acres, these treatments played a crucial role in protecting South Lake Tahoe, bringing the fire to the ground and enabling fire officials to bring it under control.

Now, through the Fix Our Forests Act, Congress is looking to extend this model to the nation’s highest-risk forests, expanding the size of forest health projects eligible for a categorical exclusion from 3,000 acres up to 10,000 acres. The proposal draws on successes such as the Lake Tahoe Basin, and even former Forest Service Chief Randy Moore has expressed support for efforts to expedite critical forest management projects.

On top of streamlining the review process for forest management projects in high-risk areas, the bill establishes a Fireshed Center to improve coordination across federal, state, tribal and local partners. It also supports community wildfire initiatives, including home hardening and local resilience planning, while investing in reseeding and reforestation capabilities to restore healthy forests post-wildfire.

In January, after the Los Angeles wildfires became the most costly in history, the House passed the Fix Our Forests Act with significant bipartisan support. Now, as the year comes to a close, the Senate has the chance to advance this bill and deliver real solutions for communities across the country.

Wildfires have long been a part of life in the U.S., especially in the West, but we don’t have to simply accept the growing threat they pose. Congress should pass the Fix Our Forests Act before the end of the year to give communities and agencies the tools they need to address this challenge. We cannot wait for another disaster to spur us to act.

The agreement is President Donald Trump’s latest move to influence the energy sector — namely, by giving the U.S. government equity in private ventures. The government would arrange financing and permits in return for a 20 percent stake in Westinghouse’s profits.

“They’re converting loan and grant programs into equity stakes,” said Brent Cebul, an associate professor of history at the University of Pennsylvania who researches political economy and business-state interaction. “That’s one way that we can think about this as both continuity with the Biden administration, but also an important precedent-setting disjuncture in terms of the equity stakes.”

As of October, the administration had taken stakes in five public companies, including semiconductor manufacturer Intel and rare earths miner MP Materials. Upon the Westinghouse announcement, ClearView Energy Partners said the “scale of the Trump Administration’s energy sector-directed industrial policy seems to be accelerating.”

“We would suggest the Administration may have identified Westinghouse as a possible ‘national champion’ within the U.S. power sector, which could influence the competitive landscape for domestic nuclear generation and energy operations writ large,” ClearView analysts wrote.

Jacopo Buongiorno, director of the Center for Advanced Nuclear Energy Systems at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, said the deal indicates the government’s preference for Westinghouse as a purveyor of large, conventional nuclear reactors.

“It gives the perception that the government picked a winner, but it is the de facto winner in that category,” Buongiorno said.

Buongiorno noted that no other American nuclear firms are actively selling and building large reactors. While dozens of firms are looking to build midsize, small and micro reactors, he said, there are “other markets” for them.

“You have chemical plants; you have steel mills, concrete factories. They need heat and electricity, and maybe they need 100 megawatt equivalent of heat and 50 megawatt of electricity, or whatever it is,” Buongiorno said. “In that case, it doesn’t make any sense to put an AP1000. You put a small modular reactor.”

AP1000s produce roughly 1,000 megawatts of electricity, while small modular reactors generate anywhere from 12 MW to 300 MW. A typical Amazon data center consumes 300 to 500 MW.

Consulting firm Wood Mackenzie expects U.S. nuclear generation to grow 27 percent from 2035 to 2060 due largely to the proliferation of power-hungry artificial intelligence data centers. Many technology firms are turning specifically to nuclear to power their growing fleets in hopes that its low emissions will satisfy their sustainability goals without sacrificing reliability.

Westinghouse Electric’s owners, Cameco and Brookfield Asset Management, said in their announcement that the agreement with the U.S. government aims to boost the American nuclear industry, ensure energy sovereignty, support AI-driven data centers and potentially create thousands of jobs.

Under the new partnership, if the U.S. enters into agreements to build $80 billion of nuclear reactors, the government will receive 20 percent of profits “in excess of US$17.5 billion made by Westinghouse,” according to Cameco’s press release.

If the government makes a final investment decision by January 2029 and an initial public offering valuation for Westinghouse is expected at $30 billion or more, the government would be “entitled to require” an IPO. In that case, the U.S. would then have at least five years to purchase equity equal to 20 percent of Westinghouse’s value, after deducting the $17.5 billion.

Hazy details

The Trump administration’s pursuit of equity distinguishes its approach from previous instances of government ownership in private companies, such as during the New Deal and in the wake of World War II, Cebul said.

He also noted that in the 1980s and 1990s, states from Ohio to Arkansas set up public venture capital funds, pitching them as a way to create well-paying jobs.

In some instances, states reserved the right to participate in managerial decisions, Cebul said, but “I don’t know of any cases where the state actually stepped in to put their thumb on the scale.”

In the past, the U.S. government has also effectively created monopolies by awarding contracts to only one company. Cebul pointed to Boeing’s position in the aircraft industry and Lockheed Martin’s dominance in the defense sector as examples.

“Contracting is not the same thing as taking an equity stake, but it’s a distinction that is far more of a degree than a categorical difference,” Cebul said.

But much is still unknown about the deal with Westinghouse. Crucial details — such as sites, customers and builders — have not been publicly released.

“The announcement was very short on detail, and those details will have to be revealed soon for people to remain excited,” Buongiorno said.

ClearView analysts walked through the math of the IPO: At a $30 billion valuation, the agreement could let the government acquire a stake worth $6 billion by expending roughly $2.5 billion.

Funding sources aren’t specified. ClearView points to the Department of Energy’s loan-guarantee authority as a plausible tool to help arrange financing. The firm also highlights a new U.S.–Japan deal that sets aside up to $332 billion for critical energy infrastructure in the U.S., with a Japanese document sizing a Westinghouse provision at up to $100 billion.

ClearView estimated that $80 billion could support anywhere from 5 to 11 new reactors at 1 gigawatt each.

On its website, Westinghouse indicates that the new reactors could power more than AI: “Supporting America’s leadership in AI is a core use case, but the power produced will also meet broader increases in energy demand and bolster energy security.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/7d/92/57e0d7734844a2caf7d24af0f240/nuclear-plant-georgia-35574.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 10:04:58.126820

Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs Minister Andrew Muir said the current environmental governance system is “not fit for purpose and failing everyone”.

He described an “endless list” of examples of failed environmental governance, including Lough Neagh, the illegal dump site at Mobuoy, as well as nature decline, and air quality.

He urged MLAs for support as he asks the Stormont Executive to agree in principle to the establishment of an independent, environmental protection agency in Northern Ireland.

“Northern Ireland is a laggard in relation to the environment and, when I stand up and say that, and look to take action on that, I get vilified. Vilified because people are not prepared to take difficult decision,” he said.

“This is a point of decision for this place and people need to back me.”

Last month, a review of environmental governance in the region recommended independent regulation to include oversight of air and water quality, waste management, nature and biodiversity and the marine environment.

The panel noted the region’s environment is under “mounting stress”, with signals which “cannot be ignored”.

Mr Muir said this “critical issue cannot continue to be dodged”.

“I firmly believe that now is a pivotal moment for all of us, and that we should establish an independent environmental protection agency as recommended by the independent panel,” he said.

“We are witnessing more and more visible signs that our environment is struggling, and we need to take decisions now to change course.

“The costs of inaction are simply too great. We should look no further than Lough Neagh or the illegal dump at Mobuoy, which could cost hundreds of millions of pounds to resolve.

“Failed environmental governance and non compliance with environmental law results in huge costs to the public purse and, so, we must invest now in the longer term to make those savings.

“Inaction also leads to increasingly degraded eco systems, public health risks, impacts on people’s livelihoods and lost opportunities for sustainable growth.

“Without decisive reform, Northern Ireland will continue to fall behind in meeting its environmental obligations and the public will continue to pay the price in terms of quality of life and economic resilience.”

Daniel McCrossan, from the SDLP Opposition, pressed Mr Muir for a time scale on when the environmental protection agency will be active, pointing out the minister is two years into his post.

Mr Muir said once he has secured support in principle, then the process will move to the public consultation.

“If people believe in this, they need to work with me in relation to the implementation of that so we can have this legislation by the end of the mandate,” he said.

But the plans they handed in “have barely moved the needle” on reducing Earth’s future warming, a new United Nations report finds.

READ MORE: Trump called climate change a ‘con job’ at the United Nations. Here are the facts and context

And a good chunk of that progress is counteracted by the United States’ withdrawal from the effort, the report adds.

The newest climate-fighting plans — mandated every five years by the 2015 Paris Agreement — shaves about three tenths of a degree Celsius (nearly six tenths of a degree Fahrenheit) off a warming future compared with the projections a year ago.

Meanwhile, the Trump administration policies, which range from rolling back environmental regulations to hindering green energy projects, will add back a tenth of a degree of warming, Tuesday’s U.N. Environment Program’s Emissions Gap report says.

“Every tenth of a degree has ramifications on communities, on ecosystems around the world. It is particularly important for those vulnerable communities and ecosystems that are already being impacted,” said Adelle Thomas, vice chair of a separate U.N. scientific panel that calculates climate impacts. “It matters in heat waves. It matters in ocean heat waves and the destruction of coral reefs. It matters long-term when we think about sea level rise.”

Global average temperature increase is mainly caused by the release of greenhouse gases like carbon dioxide, which happens when fuels like oil, gas and coal are burned. So the plans that countries turn in must detail how, and how fast, they will cut emissions of such gases.

Within the next decade, Earth is likely to blow past 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit) since the mid 1800s, which is the internationally agreed-upon goal made in Paris. If nations do as they promise in their plans, the planet will warm 2.3 to 2.5 degrees Celsius (4.1 to 4.5 degrees Fahrenheit), the report calculates.

Current policies put the world on path for 2.8 degrees Celsius (5 degrees Fahrenheit) of warming, providing context for upcoming U.N. climate talks in Belem, Brazil.

Even super fast and deep cuts in emissions from coal, oil and natural gas will still more than likely mean global temperatures go up at least 1.7 degrees Celsius (3.1 degrees Fahrenheit) this century with efforts then to bring them back down, the report says.

Ten years ago, before the Paris Agreement, the world was on a path to be about 4 degrees Celsius (7.2 degrees Fahrenheit) warmer.

“We are making progress,” U.N. Environment Program Executive Director Inger Andersen told The Associated Press.

“We have to go faster,” she added.

The United States — which submitted a climate-fighting plan in 2024 from the Biden administration but now will exit the Paris agreement in two months — changes the future outlook significantly. Until the Trump administration decided to get out of the climate-fighting effort, the U.S. plan was promising some of the most significant cuts in future emissions, the report said.

Now the U.N. is calculating that the rest of world must cut an additional 2 billion tons a year of carbon dioxide to make up for what the report projects is growing American carbon pollution. Last year the world pumped 57.7 billion tons of greenhouse gases into the air and needs to get down to about 33 billion tons a year to have a chance of limiting warming to near the goal, the report said.

Climate Analytics CEO Bill Hare, who helps run a separate emissions and temperature projecting report called Climate Action Tracker, said that his calculations show the same as the report.

The numbers indicate “a lack of political will,” he said.

The project — formally known as the Fairfield-Congress Railroad Transmission Line — has generated intense local pushback over the impact that the transmission line would have as it passes over homes, businesses and churches, suspended from giant steel monopoles. Utility officials have countered that the proposed alternatives, including burying the line underground, would add hundreds of millions of dollars to the project’s costs, which would be paid back by customers across Connecticut.

Last month, the Connecticut Siting Council voted 5-3 to reject the project, with several members reversing their previous positions of support.

“As the Council has repeatedly found, there is a strong public need for this Project, which will replace 60-year-old, deteriorated UI transmission infrastructure, which sits atop 100-year-old, [state] owned railroad catenaries,” the company said in a formal petition asking the Siting Council to reconsider its ruling.

Additionally, the petition argued that the council’s sudden reversal left company officials “with no guidance as to what, if any, issues the Council had with the proposed solution to the important public need the Project sought to address.”

While the request is unlikely to yield a different outcome, it is necessary for United Illuminating to exhaust its options before the Siting Council in order to file a lawsuit seeking to overturn the decision.

The company gave further indication that it is pursing a legal appeal last month when its attorneys sent letters to members of the Siting Council, as well as local leaders in Bridgeport and Fairfield, advising them to preserve any documents or communications related to the project.

The letter, known as a “litigation hold,” often serves as a precursor to a formal lawsuit.

Officials in Fairfield and Bridgeport did not immediately offer comment Monday on UI’s latest request. A spokesperson for Gov. Ned Lamont’s office declined to comment.

The Fairfield-Congress transmission line was previously the subject of a lawsuit brought by officials in Bridgeport and Fairfield, along with other local critics, challenging the Siting Council’s decision to propose and approve an alternative plan that moved the proposed route of the transmission line from the south side of the Metro North railroad tracks to the north.

In April, a judge ruled that the council has overstepped its authority by modifying UI’s proposal with its own route.

The decision led the Siting Council to reconsider the original 7.3 mile route as proposed by UI in 2023. Over the next few months, the members of the council publicly wavered over their decision, holding a series of votes in which they went back and forth over whether to approve the project.

After a nonbinding straw vote was held in September in which a majority of the council indicated their support for the project, opponents declared the process “tainted” as a result of several members switching their positions from an earlier vote in June.

Those concerns evaporated, however, after the council switched positions again to reject UI’s proposal during the final and biding vote held on Oct. 16.

Instead, it is now the utility that is protesting the process. In its filing on Monday, the company stated that the Siting Council “acted illegally and arbitrarily in flipping its vote with absolutely no reasons provided.”

The transmission line is also of interest to communities outside of Bridgeport and Fairfield due to the construction costs that will be recouped from utility customers.

UI has estimated that the cost of building its proposed overhead transmission line will be around $300 million. That amount can be spread among the nearly 14 million electric customers in six states under rules established by the regional grid operator, ISO New England.

If the Siting Council forces those lines to be buried, however, the additional costs are borne by electric customers in Connecticut alone, according to ISO NE.

Burying the line could increase the costs of the project by up to $500 million, according to UI’s estimates. Critics, however, argue that the utility’s estimates are wildly inflated based on the costs of other recently completed underground transmission lines in the area.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80243/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/img_6500-771x5781762271054.jpg?h=59e55433&itok=FimF9YnS,N,,2025-11-04 11:04:23.844490

Among the most notable cancellations are major projects such as General Motors’ $4.3 billion plan to expand its electric pickup trucks facility in Michigan. The company recently reported a $1.6 billion impairment charge owing to the “termination of tax incentives for EV purchases,” referring to the $7,500 consumer credits which expired at the end of September.

Another major player, Toyota, canceled a $1.4 billion electric SUV facility in Indiana. In addition, Kore Power canceled plans for its $1.2 billion battery cell plant in Arizona after not receiving funds from an $850 million conditional U.S. Department of Energy loan.

All these project closures combined have affected an estimated 21,000 jobs this year, with more than 5,000 cuts in June and 3,000 in September.

These are not just temporary construction jobs, but long-term manufacturing positions to be filled once the facility becomes operational, said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2 and author of the Clean Jobs America report. These are “conservative numbers,” he added, because they exclude construction labor and many canceled projects never shared investment figures or job estimates when they were initially announced.

“The primary factor contributing to the billions of dollars in project cancellations this year is policy uncertainty caused by federal repeals,” said Robbie Orvis, senior director of modeling and analysis at Energy Innovation, a non-partisan energy and climate policy think tank.

Policy shift

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, passed in July, rescinded several tax credits and incentive programs for renewable energy initiatives.

The new policy made many energy projects ineligible for incentives earlier offered by the Biden administration under the Inflation Reduction Act. This led projects that were built on and heavily dependent on this funding to be paused, postponed, canceled or moved offshore.

In September, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in grants for 223 projects across 16 states. The funding cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub, which could have created 200,000 jobs.

About $20 billion in renewable energy funding remained frozen as courts weighed whether the Trump administration can legally claw back funds already distributed through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar for All programs, said Fox Swim, senior solar industry researcher at Aurora Solar. Beneficiaries of the incentive programs filed suits against the U.S. EPA for terminating the program and a federal appeals court recently ruled that the funds can be taken back.

Elimination of EV tax credits, which made vehicles produced in the United States more affordable, could lead to a decline in sales and reduced investment in the sector, Timberlake said. Meanwhile, he said, “tax credits for batteries and geothermal will remain but are now riddled with complex new restrictions.”

There are also new foreign entities of concern restrictions for the 45X manufacturing tax credit, which was originally designed to encourage the domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components, including solar panels, wind parts, battery components, inverters and critical minerals. The restrictions will limit the ability of foreign companies to claim the tax credits and work on U.S.-based projects.

“This will make it harder to build new giga-factories and compete globally in battery, solar and wind manufacturing,” Timberlake said.

“In addition to these policy changes, the Trump administration’s imposing tariffs and barriers to clean energy deployment — for example, refusing to issue necessary permits — has complicated financing and building new projects, causing many projects to be canceled,” Orvis said.

Instead, the Trump administration is taking measures to promote the use of fossil fuels.

“The Trump administration has made no secret of its stance on renewable energy,” Swim said. “In its view, the U.S. power grid should rely primarily on coal, natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear.”

To enable this, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders early this year. The first, “Unleashing American Energy,” directs federal agencies to remove what it calls “unnecessary constraints” on domestic fossil fuel production and to review or rescind renewable energy incentives that “distort market competition.” The second, “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” aims to limit states’ authority to block or regulate fossil fuel infrastructure projects under environmental or climate-based criteria.

Experts say the new policies make it harder for renewable energy technology manufacturers to operate and expand. In many cases, manufacturers like GM and Toyota have shifted to fossil fuel-based projects in response to changes in government funding and incentives.

What’s next for the energy sector?

The canceled projects aren’t just affecting the involved companies, but also disincentivizing the entire energy sector, experts said.

“The uncertainty created by recent regulatory changes and political opposition will make companies more hesitant to commit future investments in the U.S. clean energy market,” Timberlake said.

Orvis said this could lead companies to prioritize countries with more favorable and stable policies.

Over the long term, Timberlake said this could result in “hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic growth, with global competitors gaining ground as the U.S. steps back from a leadership role in clean energy.”

In the short term, companies might accelerate plans to take advantage of 45Y and 48E tax credits that will expire by the end of 2027. But the long-term outlook is gloomier, according to Orvis, as hundreds more grants get canceled.

“Continued hostility towards clean energy deployment and manufacturing will almost certainly lead to further project cancellations,” he said.

The ripple effects will be felt much beyond the manufacturing industry as cancellations at this scale could lead to large electricity price increases, Timberlake said, adding that “much of the damage is already done” and it may be too late to reverse course.

“With energy demand surging due to AI, data centers and EV charging infrastructure, scaling back clean energy development will constrain supply, strain the grid and drive up prices for households and businesses alike,” he added. “In 2024, renewables accounted for more than 92% of new power generation — slowing or reversing that trend will leave the country paying more for less energy.”

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.","As President Donald Trump sees it, environmental regulations that attempt to improve efficiency and address climate change only make products more expensive and perform worse. He has long blamed efficiency regulations for his frustrations with things like toilets and showerheads. He began his second term in office to “unleash prosperity through deregulation.”

But there’s at least one big way that American companies and households may end up paying more, not less, for the president’s anti-environment policy moves.

If you’re in the market for a vehicle, you’ve probably noticed: cars are getting more expensive. Kelley Blue Book reported that the average sticker price for a new car topped $50,000 for the first time in September.

And they aren’t just getting more expensive to buy; cars are getting more expensive to own. For most Americans, gasoline is their single-largest energy expenditure, around $2,930 per household each year on average.

While a more efficient dishwasher, light bulb, or faucet may have a higher sticker price up front — especially as manufacturers adjust to new rules — cars, appliances, solar panels, and electronics can more than pay for themselves with lower operating costs over their lifetimes. And Trump’s agenda of suddenly rolling back efficiency rules has simultaneously made it harder for many industries to do business while raising costs for ordinary Americans.

No one knows this better than the US auto industry, which has whiplashed between competing environmental regulations for over a decade.

President Barack Obama tightened vehicle efficiency and pollution standards. In his first term, Trump loosened them. President Joe Biden reinstated and strengthened them. Now Trump is reversing course again — leaving the $1.6 trillion US auto industry unsure what turn to take next.

Regulation whiplash

In July, the Environmental Protection Agency began undoing a foundational legal basis that lets the agency limit climate pollution from cars. Without it, the EPA has far less power to require automakers to manufacture cleaner vehicles, which hampers efforts to reduce one of the single biggest sources of carbon emissions.

Key Takeaways

Trump’s deregulation push could cost drivers more. By weakening fuel efficiency and pollution rules, the administration is setting up consumers to spend more on gasoline and vehicle maintenance — the opposite of what Trump says he’s aiming for.

Automakers hate the whiplash. Constantly shifting climate rules — from Obama to Trump to Biden and back — have made it nearly impossible for car companies to plan, adding costs that get passed on to buyers.

Rolling back standards means locking in pricier, dirtier cars for longer. Energy analysts estimate households could spend an extra $310 billion on fuel by 2050 as efficiency progress stalls.

The US is falling behind. While Europe and China double down on electric vehicles, Trump’s policies discourage EV investment.

The big picture: Policies meant to “save money” are instead locking Americans into higher energy bills, costlier cars, and a slower transition to cleaner, cheaper technology.

Trump’s Transportation secretary, Sean P. Duffy, said in a statement over the summer that these moves “will lower vehicle costs and ensure the American people can purchase the cars they want.”

But in reality, the shift may have the opposite effect.

That’s because when the rules change every few years, automakers struggle to meet existing benchmarks and can’t plan ahead. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group representing companies like Ford, Toyota, and Volkswagen, sent a letter to the EPA in September saying that the administration’s moves and the repeal of incentives for electric cars mean that the current car pollution rules established under Biden and stretching out to 2027 “are simply not achievable.” The Trump administration responded by zeroing out any penalties for violations — but the industry is already planning for a post-Trump world where rules could drastically change yet again.

Because it takes years and billions of dollars to develop new cars that comply with stricter rules, carmakers would prefer if regulations stayed put one way or the other. Every rule change adds time and expense to the development lifecycle, which ultimately gets baked into a car’s price tag.

Changing rules are also vexing for electric car makers, whose models are gaining traction both in the US and around the world, even as the Trump administration has ended tax incentives for EVs. Trump is making things even more difficult by pulling support for domestic battery production that would help US car companies build electric cars.

It all adds up to a huge headache for the industry. “Particularly in the last six months, I think ‘chaos’ is a good word because they’re getting hit from every angle,” said David Cooke, senior associate director at the Center for Automotive Research at Ohio State University.

And all that uncertainty is making cars more expensive to buy and run, with even more expensive long-term consequences for people’s health and the environment.

How Trump’s policies are costing drivers more

As the government relaxes efficiency targets, progress will stall and car buyers will get stuck with cars that cost more to operate.

Energy Innovation, a think tank, found that repealing tailpipe standards could cost households an extra $310 billion by 2050, mainly through more spending on gasoline. Undoing the standards would also increase air pollution and shrink the job market for US electric vehicle manufacturing due to lower demand.

Even the Trump administration’s own analysis of the effects of undoing the EPA’s greenhouse gas emissions regulations found that his moves would drive up gasoline prices due to more fuel consumption from less efficient vehicles.

“Repealing these standards in particular would set America back decades,” said Sara Baldwin, senior director for electrification at Energy Innovation.

While the Trump administration shifts gears, other countries are racing ahead. Automakers can design electric cars faster than conventional internal combustion-powered vehicles, since EVs generally have fewer components, and manufacturers don’t have to worry about designing pollution controls to meet tightening restrictions. Since EVs are mechanically simpler, they also need less maintenance. Conventional cars, by contrast, typically take around five years to go from the drawing board to dealer lots, so the gasoline-powered cars being designed now won’t come out until 2030 — when someone else will be in the White House.

The US auto industry also serves other countries. Markets like Europe are holding fast to their environmental regulations and are looking to ban the sales of internal combustion vehicles altogether. Meanwhile, China is making some of the cheapest and most popular EVs in the world.

That’s why some American carmakers are setting their sights beyond US shores and are continuing to bet on more EVs. Earlier this year, Ford announced that it was developing a $30,000 electric pickup truck for the US and for export, a sign the company sees huge potential in cheap electric cars despite the Trump administration’s efforts to pump the brakes on electrics.

Though car companies often grumble about the expenses and effort they have to expend when environmental regulations become stricter, regulatory uncertainty continues to be a much bigger nuisance. “These changes in regulations are really disruptive to the industry and are hurting our global economic competitiveness,” said Gregory Keoleian, co-director of the Center for Sustainable Systems at the University of Michigan. “It’s not only hurting in terms of setting us back with regard to decarbonization of the transportation sector, but the cost to consumers in the United States.”",https://platform.vox.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/11/Vox_Cars_GettyImages-97219709.png?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:16.326766

According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation.
This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state's water fund during this year's legislative session.
Disclosure: Texas 2036, Texas Rural Water Association and Texas Water Foundation have been financial supporters of The Texas Tribune, a nonprofit, nonpartisan news organization that is funded in part by donations from members, foundations and corporate sponsors.","LUBBOCK — Two years ago, Texas voters overwhelmingly approved the creation of the Texas Water Fund with an initial $1 billion allotment to help the state get its water systems back on track. Since then, the state's leading water agency has allocated nearly a quarter of that money to rural towns, according to state data reviewed by The Texas Tribune.

More than 40 projects totaling nearly $223 million have been approved for fixing water storage tanks and water service lines, building new water wells, and improving drinking water systems, state data shows. That money, paired with money allocated for projects that prioritize creating new water supply through water conservation and water loss mitigation, a statewide public awareness program and more, means more than $735 million has been committed by the Texas Water Development Board.

The data, which the Tribune requested, comes on the eve of another election in which Texas lawmakers are asking voters to spend $20 billion in sales tax revenue over the next two decades to secure the state's water supply.

Texas' water supply has long been under duress. Critical infrastructure has aged beyond repair, causing it to fail. More people are moving to the Lone Star State every day, which has spurred water demand, especially in areas that are already running dry. And climate instability is compounding matters.

Proposition 4, the ballot question that would authorize spending $20 billion, is one of 17 constitutional amendments on this fall's ballot. Election Day is Tuesday. If it passes, at least 50% of the funds, and possibly more, would be used for creating new water supplies that expand the state's water portfolio, including projects involving desalination, water conservation, reuse, and aquifer storage. The other portion of the money would be used for water infrastructure needs. And there would be stronger legislative oversight by creating a committee to review how the board administers the fund.

Supporters of the proposition — including Gov. Greg Abbott, state lawmakers, and water advocacy groups — have argued the state needs the money to continue the work started in 2023. At the time, nearly 80% of voters approved what seemed like a good start to address the growing water needs that plagued every region of the state.

While the Texas Water Development Board is in the final stages of spending the first billion, some of those same supporters are calling for better tracking and transparency of how funds are being spent to ensure lawmakers and taxpayers are willing to make more money available in the future.

""There's going to be an option for a future Legislature to continue it or renew it,"" said Jeremy Mazur, director of infrastructure and natural resources policy at Texas 2036. ""But in order for that to happen, there needs to be clear evidence that this funding stream has worked.""

Progress from the 2023 effort offers a look into the future if the $20 billion initiative is approved. In rural Texas specifically, the money has thrown a lifeline to communities struggling with inflation, supply chain issues and construction costs that make it impossible to make repairs on their own.

""This is not economically feasible otherwise,"" said Mary Alice Boehm-McKaughan, general counsel with the Texas Rural Water Association. ""These systems literally cannot afford to upgrade their system without access to these funds.""

The $1 billion tranche was more of a band-aid than a panacea, water experts said. At best, it helped clear a backlog of needs that had built up in recent years.

""That $1 billion injection was, in some ways, like if somebody has a wound and it's bleeding and you have to put a temporary stop on it,"" said Sarah Schlessinger, CEO of the Texas Water Foundation. ""All the programs are so oversubscribed that it's not like that was new money for new fun projects.""

Data obtained by the Tribune from the water board through a public records request shows the state has or will fund more than 40 projects. Most of those projects are in rural areas with fewer than 10,000 residents. Only six entities that serve a population between 10,001 and 150,000 residents were awarded grant dollars.

According to the data, these projects range from rehabbing water storage tanks and generators in the small town of Alba, in East Texas, and water service line and meter replacements in Benjamin, 130 miles east of Lubbock. The projects also include a new water well in Corrigan and Weimar, two towns with populations under 3,300 people, and drinking water system improvements in several towns, including Jefferson in far East Texas. Dozens of municipalities, including Matador and Paducah, two towns in the High Plains that both have less than 1,000 residents, were approved for water supply and distribution system improvements.

""Rural communities need this investment in critical infrastructure,"" said Kelty Garbee, executive director of Texas Rural Funders, a nonprofit that has championed the 2023 and 2025 constitutional amendments. ""Every dollar spent on water will deliver powerful results — repairing old systems, reducing waste, and keeping water affordable for Texas families and businesses.""

Clearer accounting wanted

There's rarely simple accounting in government. The $1 billion that voters approved in 2023 is no exception.

The water board received the money on Jan. 1, 2024, then took several months to plot a path with public input on how the money should be spent. In the summer of 2024, they put together a list of what programs they would like to make commitments to.

Ultimately, the money was divided among other accounts the water board manages, such as the Rural Water Assistance Fund, Water Loan Assistance Fund, and the State Water Implementation Fund for Texas.

The board later solicited project applications from waste and wastewater systems in Texas. According to the water board, it ended up receiving 68 applications that were focused on water conservation and water loss mitigation. Of those forms, 46 received funding, all of which went toward water infrastructure needs.

About $45 million was allocated for entities with populations of 1,000 or less to receive 100% grant funding from the rural assistance fund. According to Boehm-McKaughan, the East Medina County Special Utility District was able to fix leaks in more than a mile of water line thanks to that grant money.

""The good news here is that the board is prudently and rationally executing its due diligence,"" Mazur said. ""And doing what it needs to do to get money out the door in an appropriate manner.""

The board does not have a clear indication on how funds have been spent so far on their website, or for what projects. This spurred lawmakers to call for more transparency and oversight to the state's water fund during this year's legislative session.

Perry Fowler, executive director of the Texas Water Infrastructure Network, said the water board is under a lot of pressure to get the money out, but it also must vet projects to ensure tax dollars are used correctly.

""There probably are ways they could help demonstrate how money is being spent and when and where a little better,"" Fowler said. ""But I don't think they're being irresponsible.""

Senate Bill 7, which spells out in part how the $20 billion for water is to be spent, will add more oversight and require the water board to report on how the state is providing financial assistance and the progress being made toward addressing water infrastructure challenges.

Mazur said that moving forward, it would be helpful to have a clear description of the benefits to the communities when projects are completed.

""I think it's going to be important for the board to start telling a story with these projects when they're completed and what the actual tangible benefit will be to the communities they serve,"" Mazur said.

Fowler agreed that more transparency is important. However, he said the public should be more concerned about the volume of projects the board is able to approve.

""As great as this billion is, and if we're going to get it every year, it's never going to be enough,"" Fowler said. ""We're probably going to have to have additional appropriations because what we're seeing is we're not able to meet the demand we have.""

A Texas 2036 report estimates the state needs nearly $154 billion by 2050 for water infrastructure — an estimate that does not include money for projects that create new water supply.

By the water board's own estimates in the state's 2022 water plan, towns and cities could be on a path toward a severe shortage of water by 2030. This would happen if there are recurring, record-breaking drought conditions across the state, and if water entities and state leaders fail to put in place key strategies to secure water supplies.

""I don't think we're going to end up with a scenario where there's just money sitting around not being used,"" Schlessinger said. ""My gut says that $1 billion doesn’t get anywhere close to meeting the amount of project funding needs there are.""

Among the most notable cancellations are major projects such as General Motors’ $4.3 billion plan to expand its electric pickup trucks facility in Michigan. The company recently reported a $1.6 billion impairment charge owing to the “termination of tax incentives for EV purchases,” referring to the $7,500 consumer credits which expired at the end of September.

Another major player, Toyota, canceled a $1.4 billion electric SUV facility in Indiana. In addition, Kore Power canceled plans for its $1.2 billion battery cell plant in Arizona after not receiving funds from an $850 million conditional U.S. Department of Energy loan.

These are not just temporary construction jobs, but long-term manufacturing positions to be filled once the facility becomes operational, said Michael Timberlake, director of research and publications at E2 and author of the Clean Jobs America report.

In September, Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought announced the cancellation of nearly $8 billion in grants for 223 projects across 16 states. The funding cuts include $1.2 billion for California’s hydrogen hub, which could have created 200,000 jobs.

About $20 billion in renewable energy funding remained frozen as courts weighed whether the Trump administration can legally claw back funds already distributed through the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund and Solar for All programs, said Fox Swim, senior solar industry researcher at Aurora Solar. Beneficiaries of the incentive programs filed suits against the U.S. EPA for terminating the program and a federal appeals court recently ruled that the funds can be taken back.

Elimination of EV tax credits, which made vehicles produced in the United States more affordable, could lead to a decline in sales and reduced investment in the sector, Timberlake said. Meanwhile, he said, “tax credits for batteries and geothermal will remain but are now riddled with complex new restrictions.”

There are also new foreign entities of concern restrictions for the 45X manufacturing tax credit, which was originally designed to encourage the domestic manufacturing of renewable energy components, including solar panels, wind parts, battery components, inverters and critical minerals. The restrictions will limit the ability of foreign companies to claim the tax credits and work on U.S.-based projects.

“This will make it harder to build new giga-factories and compete globally in battery, solar and wind manufacturing,” Timberlake said.

“In addition to these policy changes, the Trump administration’s imposing tariffs and barriers to clean energy deployment — for example, refusing to issue necessary permits — has complicated financing and building new projects, causing many projects to be canceled,” Orvis said.

Instead, the Trump administration is taking measures to promote the use of fossil fuels.

“The Trump administration has made no secret of its stance on renewable energy,” Swim said. “In its view, the U.S. power grid should rely primarily on coal, natural gas, hydroelectric and nuclear.”

To enable this, President Donald Trump signed two executive orders early this year. The first, “Unleashing American Energy,” directs federal agencies to remove what it calls “unnecessary constraints” on domestic fossil fuel production and to review or rescind renewable energy incentives that “distort market competition.” The second, “Protecting American Energy from State Overreach,” aims to limit states’ authority to block or regulate fossil fuel infrastructure projects under environmental or climate-based criteria.

Experts say the new policies make it harder for renewable energy technology manufacturers to operate and expand. In many cases, manufacturers like GM and Toyota have shifted to fossil fuel-based projects in response to changes in government funding and incentives.

What’s next for the energy sector?

The canceled projects aren’t just affecting the involved companies, but also disincentivizing the entire energy sector, experts said.

“The uncertainty created by recent regulatory changes and political opposition will make companies more hesitant to commit future investments in the U.S. clean energy market,” Timberlake said.

Orvis said this could lead companies to prioritize countries with more favorable and stable policies.

Over the long term, Timberlake said this could result in “hundreds of billions of dollars in lost economic growth, with global competitors gaining ground as the U.S. steps back from a leadership role in clean energy.”

In the short term, companies might accelerate plans to take advantage of 45Y and 48E tax credits that will expire by the end of 2027. But the long-term outlook is gloomier, according to Orvis, as hundreds more grants get canceled.

“Continued hostility towards clean energy deployment and manufacturing will almost certainly lead to further project cancellations,” he said.

The ripple effects will be felt much beyond the manufacturing industry as cancellations at this scale could lead to large electricity price increases, Timberlake said, adding that “much of the damage is already done” and it may be too late to reverse course.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/gk1hbdP9NFoKPfUtYjgIuMD6_XpaStFGe3kSfBBPRCc/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMjM2NjI2MDU3X0VqV05ZbkMuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:01.645306

Further, U.S. solar cell production capacity has more than tripled this year, rising from 1 GW to 3.2 GW.
SEIA officials said that the U.S. solar manufacturing pipeline remains robust.

New data from SEIA shows that the entire solar supply chain has been reshored and U.S. manufacturing capacity has grown across every segment of the solar and storage supply chain.

So far in 2025, 65 new or expanded solar and storage facilities have come online, totaling some $4.5 billion in private investment. However, SEIA points out that more than 100 factories and over $31 billion in the pipeline could be at risk if the Trump administration continues its attacks on solar energy.

This year, U.S. manufacturing capacity has increased across every major segment of the solar and storage supply chain, according to SEIA’s Solar & Storage Supply Chain Dashboard. As of October 2025, the United States has surpassed 60 gigawatts (GW) of domestic solar module production capacity, a 37 percent increase from December 2024.

Further, U.S. solar cell production capacity has more than tripled this year, rising from 1 GW to 3.2 GW. In addition, battery cell manufacturing for stationary electricity storage applications has risen to over 21 gigawatt-hours (GWh).

“This growth is a testament to the power of American innovation,” Abigail Ross Hopper, president and CEO of SEIA, said. “We’re building factories, hiring American workers, and showing that solar energy means made-in-America energy.”

Also, U.S. manufacturing of inverters, which converts electricity produced by solar into usable power, has grown by nearly 50 percent since the end of last year, with capacity surging from 19 GW to 28 GW. Additionally, U.S. mounting system manufacturing has increased 14 percent and added 23 new factories.

Currently, there is 23 GW of solar module capacity, over 34 GW of solar cell capacity, 25 GW of inverter capacity, and 95 GWh of battery cell capacity either under construction or announced. However, Trump Administration policies, regulations, and trade actions which have contributed to industry uncertainty could stall this progress and reduce demand for the products made by American solar and storage manufacturers.

“We’re seeing strong growth today, but that momentum isn’t guaranteed. If the administration continues down this path, they risk driving investment overseas, stifling job creation, raising costs on consumers, and handing America’s manufacturing advantage to our competitors,” Hopper said. “This industry has proven what’s possible when businesses have the certainty to invest. If the administration does not reverse their harmful actions that have undermined market certainty, energy costs will rise even further, and the next wave of factories and jobs could be at risk.”",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_1696361656.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 12:12:53.477044

Wired for Profit: First in a series about Alabama Power’s influence over electric rates, renewable energy, pollution and politics in the Yellowhammer State.

MCCALLA — Mary Rosenboom is fed up.

Like 1.5 million other Alabamians, Rosenboom is forced to pay ever-increasing electricity prices set by Alabama Power and approved by the state’s Public Service Commission. Each month, Rosenboom forks over hundreds of dollars to the utility—and a massive hyperscale data center proposed near her home, she fears, will make the situation even worse.

Her electricity costs are already a huge financial burden. Rosenboom, who works as a sales professional, said she chooses not to run her air conditioner during much of the day to prevent an untenable power bill. Even that isn’t enough. Often, Rosenboom said she must turn to high-interest credit cards to keep the lights on.

“I’m robbing Peter to pay Paul,” she told Inside Climate News. “It makes me sick.”

Rosenboom’s plight isn’t unique.

Inside Climate News examined the 2024 federal filings of 100 of the largest electric utilities in the country.

None reported higher total residential electric bills, on average, than Alabama Power.

Because Alabama is one of the poorest states in the nation, that hits especially hard. Electricity customers here are among the most financially burdened in the nation, the U.S. Department of Energy found. And an analysis by think tank RMI showed that among households with extremely low incomes, Alabamians pay nearly a quarter of their earnings for electricity—the highest percentage in the country.

So why are power bills so high?

Experts point to lax regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which is charged with regulating Alabama Power and overseeing any large spending or rate increases proposed by the utility.

Robert Blanton, chair of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has been digging into the mechanisms that allow Alabama Power to earn record profits in such an impoverished state.

Ultimately, he said, there’s strong evidence that Alabama Power has effectively “captured” its regulator, the PSC. Academics use the concept of regulatory capture to describe a situation in which regulators are more beholden to the entities they are charged with regulating than the public they represent.

The commission conducts much of its regulation of Alabama Power behind closed doors, with little to no access for the public or outside interest groups. It has consistently granted Alabama Power unusually high profit margins. The company’s return on equity was 11 percent in 2023, according to a utility analysis by financial firm S&P Global.

That’s down slightly from the company’s historical average of around 13 percent, but still among the highest of any utility in the country. Nationwide, the average rate of return approved for electric utilities in 2024 rate cases was 9.74 percent, according to S&P.

“I don’t think there’s a single utility in the country that would be upset with an 11 percent earned ROE,” said Kent Chandler, former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, now a senior fellow in energy and environmental policy for the R Street Institute. “I mean, that’s like double what I know some utilities are actually earning.”

Meanwhile, Alabama Power and its parent, Southern Co., have boasted about their record profits. “Every quarter for 78 consecutive years, Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter,” the company said in a July press release.

In a statement, representatives for Alabama Power said the company’s rates were fair and its reliability was among the best in the nation. The company pointed to high per capita electricity usage in the state, the seventh-highest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the third-highest residential usage. The company said that its residential rate, not the total bill, is a more appropriate way to evaluate the company’s affordability.

“On those price-based measures—paired with our industry-leading reliability—Alabama Power’s residential service is fairly priced under PSC oversight,” the company said.

Alabama Power’s average residential rate last year was 16.77 cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than the national average of 16.48 cents and 35th highest out of 100 utilities examined by Inside Climate News.

But the national average includes places like Hawaii, Connecticut and Southern California, which are all among the top 10 states for median household income. Shipping fuel oil to Hawaii and wildfire prevention in California are also huge costs that don’t apply in Alabama.

Alabama Power’s combination of above-average rates with top-five usage yielded the highest total residential bills in the nation last year. Other states with similar or greater usage feature lower rates. One reason Alabama’s usage is so high: nearly 70 percent of Alabamians use electric heat, as opposed to natural gas, thanks in part to incentives offered by Alabama Power.

Louisiana, which has the highest per capita residential electricity use in the nation, has electric rates that averaged 11.64 cents/kWh in 2024, about 30 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rate. The average Alabama Power residential customer used 1,129 kWh of electricity per month last year, at a cost of about $189. A customer using the same amount of electricity in Louisiana would have paid $58 less every month. Those figures do not include state or local taxes, so the actual bills are even higher.

Average residential rates in the states bordering Alabama—Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida—are 15 to 25 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rates.

Alabama Power’s rates are also well above those of other providers in the state—46 percent higher than the average rate last year charged by Huntsville Utilities, which serves almost 200,000 residential customers in north Alabama.

The R Street Institute, the think tank where Chandler now works, gave Alabama an “F” in its ranking of electricity competition—how much choice consumers have about where their power comes from. No other state received such a bad grade.

The group only considered investor-owned utility companies in its rankings, and Alabama Power is the only such company in Alabama.

Alabama Power also charges about 16 percent more than Mississippi Power and about 8 percent more than Georgia Power, the other two utilities owned by its parent company, Southern Co.

The difference, at least in part, is that Alabama Power’s rates are driven up by the company’s ever-increasing profits.

The company reported a $1.4 billion profit in 2024, almost double the $712 million it earned in 2013, the year the PSC changed its formula for measuring Alabama Power’s profits. The company’s book value—its assets minus debt—more than doubled over that span, going from $5.5 billion to $13 billion.

Alabama Power said the increase in equity is driven by investments made to improve the system. “Growth in book equity primarily mirrors system investment—storm hardening, cyber and physical security, as well as transmission and distribution upgrades, along with other investments driven by reliability and compliance,” the company said.

Almost no public participation

In virtually all states with regulated utilities, rate cases force the company to justify its proposed increases in a public forum, providing sworn, expert testimony and allowing outside groups to challenge the projections and assertions made by the power company. Not in Alabama.

The PSC hasn’t conducted a formal rate case related to Alabama Power since 1982, more than four decades ago.

“There are no courtroom-style hearings on Alabama Power’s long-term energy planning or how those plans impact customers’ bills,” said Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Alabama office. “These types of proceedings are routine in other states. When the public can participate, we believe they’re better informed about how this process impacts their lives.”

Chandler, the former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said that while rate cases can be tedious, they are valuable to the public.

“One of the benefits of having rate cases is that you get a holistic look at a utility’s revenues and a utility’s costs,” Chandler said. “In my experience in Kentucky, consumers benefit from having periodic reviews by an objective regulator.”

And since regulated utilities earn profits on all their approved spending, the more they spend, the more they earn, he said.

“They have an incentive to over-invest,” Chandler said. “And if you never check things after the fact, then you’re just writing them a blank check.”

Wall Street has taken notice. A 2024 report by S&P Global put Alabama in a tier of its own atop the rankings in its State Regulatory Evaluations, examining the likelihood that state regulators might decrease or limit a utility’s profits. The report found no other state where a utility’s profits were as safe as in Alabama.

The last PSC commissioner to advocate for formal rate hearings for Alabama Power—Terry Dunn in 2013—was promptly voted out of office in the next election. Dunn, a self-described conservative Republican, faced a curious and largely anonymous campaign linking him to environmental groups.

Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, the former PSC president, described Dunn’s efforts to initiate formal reviews of Alabama Power as a “full frontal assault” by “extremist groups” and their “fancy San Francisco environmental lawyers.”

Dunn, who died last year, called the efforts “a smear campaign orchestrated against a Republican by fellow Republicans,” in a letter to the state party in 2013.

Later that year, about 10 people staged what many believe to be a faked environmental protest on the front steps of the PSC building. The protesters, wearing blue surgical masks and other items obscuring their identities, bore signs with slogans such as “Environmentalists [heart] Dunn,” and “Save the Warrior,” likely a reference to the Black Warrior River, which runs through Tuscaloosa. Representatives of environmental groups who were there to attend a meeting said they had no idea who the people were.

Ultimately, Dunn was defeated in the 2014 Republican primary by Chris “Chip” Beeker Jr., a cattle and catfish farm operator and former county commissioner in rural Greene County—a county whose largest employer was an Alabama Power plant. Beeker had help. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, whose lobbying firm represented Alabama Power’s parent company, organized a fundraiser for Beeker in 2013.

Beeker stepped down from the commission partway through his term last year, citing health issues. His son, Chris Beeker III, filled his seat after being appointed by Gov. Kay Ivey.

The PSC’s new president, Cynthia Lee Almond, has said transparency will be one of her priorities. But PSC staff would not make her or other commissioners available for an interview to discuss the absence of rate hearings or the public’s limited role in PSC affairs.

A profitable change

A turning point for Alabama Power’s profits came in 2013. That’s the year Alabama state regulators changed the way they measure Alabama Power’s returns, switching from the industry standard return on equity metric to a formula they created, called weighted retail return on common equity.

The weighted return rate rewards Alabama Power for having higher ratios of equity to debt. The idea was that by incentivizing company officials to carry a greater percentage of equity as opposed to debt, they would secure higher credit ratings and be able to borrow money under better terms, decreasing overall costs.

At the time, commissioners and the company said they expected electric rates to go down as a result.

“I will tell you as you see adjustments over the next few years, you are going to see a decrease,” then-PSC President Cavanaugh said.

That didn’t happen.

Instead, the company benefited from the change far more than its customers did.

Alabama Power’s electric rates have risen 45 percent across all customer groups since the novel rate formula went into effect. That’s far more than the national average, which increased 29 percent over the same span.

Meanwhile, the company’s profit nearly doubled, despite producing less electricity today than it did in 2013.

Since Alabama Power earns a return on all of its equity, having more power plants and infrastructure in place increases its profitability. The company also earns bonuses under the rate structure for maintaining positive credit ratings by financial agencies and for having a greater than 50 percent ratio of equity to debt.

The PSC, in a written statement, denied that its switch to weighted common equity was driving Alabama Power’s increased profitability.

“With regard to your analysis of public documents, which reflect the financial position of Alabama Power, please be advised there is no correlation between Alabama Power’s current financial position and the implementation of the weighted retail return on average common equality mechanism in 2013,” a commission representative told Inside Climate News.

Instead, the PSC said the increased net income was the result of Alabama Power’s “significant capital investments to modernize its systems,” which were approved by the PSC.

“If that’s not regulatory capture . . .”

Blanton, the political science professor at UAB, sees the absence of rate-making cases, the nation’s highest electricity rates and Alabama’s record profits as unmistakable signs that Alabama’s PSC has been captured by the company it regulates.

He points to three ways regulatory capture manifests itself in Alabama.

“One is campaign finance, the ability of the regulated industry to financially contribute towards the campaigns of regulatory bodies,” he said.

A 2024 analysis by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom, showed that of the states that elect the members of their utility regulator, Alabama tops the list of those receiving the most campaign finance cash from fossil fuel-linked interests.

Fifty-five percent of political donations to Alabama public service commissioners above $250 from 2013 to 2023 came from fossil-fuel interests, the analysis concluded.

“You don’t have to have a conspiratorial mindset to figure out that gives these donors leverage—if they’re the ones that are financing the campaigns of the people they’re supposed to be regulating,” Blanton said of such contributions.

Part of the problem, Blanton said, is that Alabama is one of 10 states that directly elects its utility commissioners. PSC commissioners say they don’t accept money directly from the utilities they regulate, but lax campaign finance laws provide ample opportunity for influencing regulators, Blanton said.

An examination of “information flows” in the state also points toward capture, he said. There’s a general opacity and complexity around the information involved and a relative dominance of the industry as the primary source for information for the regulators, according to Blanton.

The third aspect of regulatory capture is “cultural capture,” Blanton said, a concept that alludes to the extent to which industry and regulators share similar worldviews or perspectives.

“The key is whether or not regulators are likely to unquestioningly accept evidence and opinions put forth by the industry, and the extent to which regulators accept information from outside sources,” Blanton said.

Looking at these three lines of evidence, Blanton said there are some clear takeaways about where Alabama finds itself—captured.

“There’s no objective reason why Alabama should be an outlier. We’re not hotter than Texas. We don’t have worse conditions than Louisiana,” he said. “There’s just nothing that makes sense. … Any reasonable person, looking through the data, looking through the evidence, will say, ‘We have a situation that’s, if that’s not regulatory capture, I don’t know what is.’”

Data center angst

Inside Climate News interviewed more than a dozen Alabama Power customers for this story, and each shared the concerns voiced by Mary Rosenboom, the customer who lives near the proposed hyperscale data center—rising energy costs, a lack of transparency and fear about what the future may hold.

Rosenboom and others worry that construction and operation of power-hungry data centers will drive their electricity costs even higher.

“I know that’s what’s coming,” Rosenboom said. “And it’ll be us that foot the bill. It’s not good for the citizens. It’s good for Alabama Power’s pocketbook.”

Alabama Power and the PSC both insist that data center costs will not be passed on to other customers. But they also declined to say whether those agreements with data centers will be made public, making it impossible to verify those claims.

In a statement, a representative for the company said that it takes a “disciplined approach” to engaging with potential data center customers.

“We understand that budgets are tight, and affordability is central to our mission. That is why we work hard to connect customers with offerings like Budget Billing, payment plans, efficiency tools, and assistance programs,” the company’s response said.

Data centers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” the company said. “We work with the Alabama Public Service Commission to approve large-load customer contracts and any needed operational investments, ensuring a thorough process that validates needs and protects customers.”

Alabama Power declined to provide a list of planned data center projects and their anticipated electricity demand.

“Long-term capacity planning is reviewed with the PSC,” the company responded. “We don’t publish speculative load projections for individual customer classes or projects. Any major resource additions follow established processes to ensure reliability and fairness for all customers.”

Regulatory interactions involving Alabama Power and the PSC are often similarly opaque.

During depositions involving Alabama Power’s request to purchase a natural gas plant earlier this year, lawyers for environmental groups questioned company management about data centers and their anticipated loads.

The company’s representatives were often vague in their answers, though they did admit that data centers are the “primary driver” of increased load projections. When company lawyers did provide substantive information about specific load figures, their answers were redacted in PSC transcripts.

“I’ll say that some projects fall off of this list and some projects are added to this list and the net change is [redacted] megawatts,” Alabama Power forecasting manager Maria Burke said in a deposition. “They have a mixed answer because in the previous forecast I would say we only had [redacted] megawatts to data centers and in this forecast we have [redacted]. So the delta is [redacted].”

If built to capacity, a proposed data center campus in Bessemer, just southwest of Birmingham near Rosenboom’s home in McCalla, is expected to consume as much as 1,200 megawatts of electricity, running every hour, 24 hours a day, according to estimates provided to residents. That amount of energy is about 10 times the usage of all residences in nearby Birmingham or around 90 times the usage of all residences in Bessemer.

In one fell swoop, it could increase Alabama Power’s total demand across the state by around 10 percent.

“My power bill’s already not affordable,” said Brenda Small, who lives in a trailer park adjacent to the site of the proposed data center. “I had one bill that was $495. No one can afford that.”

Reliant on fossil fuels

Alabama Power’s electricity is not only expensive, it’s dirty and comes with a heavy environmental footprint.

The PSC has approved costly upgrades to old coal-fired power plants, allowing Alabama Power to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to delay their retirements by only a few years. The PSC greenlit massive natural gas additions in 2020, 2022 and 2025, making Alabama Power increasingly reliant on fossil fuels for decades to come and its customers vulnerable to price spikes in natural gas and supply shortages in times of heavy energy use.

Its coal-fired power plant near Birmingham, the James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant, has been the nation’s largest single source of greenhouse gases for nine years running. The company charges hefty fees to customers who install solar panels, smothering the small-scale renewable market. Alabama ranks second to last among states in energy efficiency efforts in a recent scorecard, and upgrades to its old and expensive coal plants seem destined to continue as electricity demand rises due to large data centers.

The company has also stuck to its guns on plans to leave nearly 77 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash in unlined ponds along Alabama’s rivers, leaching contaminants into the groundwater indefinitely, even as other utilities in the South have agreed to dig out some or all of their ash ponds.

And this environmental record, UAB’s Blanton said, has come under the watch of state regulators, who have minimized the effects of climate change and Alabama Power’s pollution.

A new profit formula review — with no public input

When adopting the 2013 profit formula, called Rate Stabilization and Equalization, or RSE, the commission agreed to review its performance every six years. The first review was conducted in 2019, with no changes made to the rate structure.

In its responses to Inside Climate News, the commission said the second review has already begun—with no public input—through a series of closed-door meetings with Alabama Power and the state attorney general’s office.

Whether outside experts or concerned members of the public will be provided an opportunity to weigh in on the review will only be decided after the commission’s staff has made its findings, the PSC statement said.

Tidwell, the Southern Environmental Law Center attorney, said public participation should be essential in utility regulation.

“Alabama Power customers who are impacted by the PSC’s decisions deserve to have a say in the process,” Tidwell said. “The Public Service Commission is tasked with ensuring that rates are just and reasonable not just for Alabama Power, but also for the public. … How can you protect customers’ best interests when there are almost no avenues for them to participate in the process?”

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015.","Brussels — The European Union is attempting to forge new climate goals on Tuesday before the U.N. climate talks in Brazil starting next week.

Ministers from across the 27-nation bloc are meeting in Brussels to try and get at least 15 to align their nationally-determined emissions targets in order to have a stronger negotiating position during the COP30 summit in Belém.

“We need to show to the world that we are leaders in climate change. We need to deliver adequate signals for investors. Today’s the day,"" Spanish climate minister Sara Aagesen said before the meeting.

The EU's long-held leadership of action on climate is under threat by domestic and international pressure.

Wildfires, heat waves, and floods have disrupted life across Europe, spurring calls for more climate action. But crises like Russia's war in Ukraine, and a newly volatile relationship with the United States, have increased political and economic pressure to curtail flagship environmental policies.

A recent weakening of a deforestation law by the European Commission, the EU's executive arm, disturbed environmentalists. They worried that it signaled a deeper disenchantment with green priorities by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In February, she had announced an economic policy that some said eroded her 2019 Green Deal. But von der Leyen said in September that “the world can count on Europe’s climate leadership” and pledged that the EU is “on our way to climate neutrality” and would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040.

She has linked climate investment to sovreignty and defense, arguing that a self-reliant Europe can better face threats like disruptive tariffs or export controls, armed conflict and environmental disasters.

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some see climate regulations as shackling the economy, while others say Europe will either make and sell renewables or be forced to buy energy or green products from countries like China.

Wopke Hoekstra, the EU's climate commissioner, said that the bloc needed to “bridge climate action with competitiveness and industrial savviness, if you will, and independence that is going to be the name of the game in the years that we have ahead of us.”

“We’ll do our utmost to be successful, but it takes 27 to tango,” he said of the negotiations on Tuesday.

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals has rattled Europe, whose climate vision was in part forged in partnership with the Democratic administrations of U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Joseph Biden.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

The EU's commitments in Paris have driven investment in renewable energies and electric vehicles, often in cooperation and at odds with Chinese companies. Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a height not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, according to the U.N. weather agency.

Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. The heat has been linked to more intense rains and floods, and the report predicts rainfall decline and more severe droughts in southern Europe.

“Today is about the level of ambition, and it’s about standing ground and not only sticking to talking the talk when it is easy, but also walking the walk when it becomes difficult,” Swedish climate minister Romina Pourmokhtari said in Brussels.

After revealing very little information about the vehicle itself back in August, when it focused on the potentially game-changing assembly procedures, the American automaker is back with new details.

The first vehicle based on Ford’s new Universal EV platform (UEV) is already being tested in the real world, and the component sourcing is nearly complete, according to the company’s head honcho, Jim Farley.

What’s more, the Louisville plant in Kentucky, which used to assemble the gas-powered Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair, will start getting new equipment installed later this year. Around the same time, the automaker will also start churning out lithium iron phosphate (LFP) cells at its battery manufacturing facility in Marshall, Michigan, which will power the entry-level EV.

“This is not a distant plan, it's right around the corner for us at Ford,” Farley said during the company’s third-quarter earnings call late last month. “Sourcing is at 95% complete now.

It’s no secret that Ford has postponed several new electric models, but it has done so to fast-track its revolutionary new platform, which does away with the traditional assembly line. In the new system, the rear, center and front sections of the vehicle are assembled on separate lines and then joined together toward the end. The company, which stands by its 2027 reveal deadline, says this new method saves a lot of money and makes manufacturing faster.

As for the batteries that will power the new Maverick-sized pickup, the entry-level version is poised to get LFP cells instead of the more traditional nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) type. LFP batteries are cheaper to make and can withstand full charging cycles more often, but they offer less energy density compared to a similarly-sized NMC pack. Whatever the chemistry, though, the carmaker made it clear that the batteries will run at 400 volts, and not 800 volts.

Ford hasn’t revealed exact numbers yet, but it mentioned that it’s aiming for a battery that’s 15% smaller than that of the Chinese-made BYD Atto electric crossover, which would mean a capacity of around 51 kilowatt-hours. That’s not a lot by modern standards, but if the company manages to keep the weight down, the secretive new EV could have just enough range for most people.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/W8qOvq/s1/a-teaser-of-ford-s-30-000-electric-pickup.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 08:57:40.844607

The figures, which Lucid has previously disputed in recent months as inaccurate, show a 40% increase from 670 vehicles a year earlier and a 3% gain from September’s 910 units.

The electric-vehicle maker, which reports only global quarterly figures, delivered 4,078 vehicles worldwide in the third quarter.

Motor Intelligence‘s US estimates for the period totaled 2,793 units, based on monthly tallies of 890 in July, 993 in August and 910 in September.

A Lucid spokesperson last month called Motor Intelligence‘s estimates “inaccurate and not even in the ballpark.”

The company didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment on the October data.

Motor Intelligence estimated that Lucid delivered 910 vehicles in September, following 993 in August and 890 in July.

This indicates that Lucid‘s total US deliveries for the third quarter would be at 2,793 vehicles. Last month, the brand reported 4,078 vehicles delivered globally during the same period.

October figures represent a 40% jump year over year, from 670 vehicles, and a slight 3% increase from September, by 25 units.

Sequential Growth Despite EV Credit Expiry

The numbers contradict the overall tendency of a sales slowdown after the federal EV tax credit expired on September 30.

After a new record with third quarter deliveries, Tesla saw its registrations tumble 31% sequentially and 24% year over year, according to the platform.

The Elon Musk-led company sold 40,650 vehicles in October, about 18,000 units below September.

Detroit automaker Ford lost 60% of electric vehicle sales from September to October, and 25% from a year ago.

Lucid and Rivian (whose registrations declined sequentially but increased year over year) were less affected by the expiration of the federal EV tax credit than other automakers.

Both companies offer vehicles that were priced above the program’s eligibility thresholds.

The Lucid Air starts at $70,900, exceeding the $55,000 cap for sedans, while the Gravity (in its Grand Touring trim, the only version available at the time) starts at $94,900, well above the $80,000 cap for trucks and SUVs.

Because these price caps did not apply to leased vehicles, both California-based EV makers relied on leasing to enable customers to benefit from the incentive.

Lucid Offers

In addition, Lucid started offering in 2023 a $7,500 credit on Lucid Air purchases through financing, to offset the lack of federal credit eligibility.

The offer has been extended after the federal credit expired, and has been renewed until November 30, according to its website.

The company also set a 0.99% APR on customers buying the sedan.

The company currently features several Gravity units in its inventory, across multiple US states. Prices start from $96,550.

According to Nick Twork, Lucid’s Head of Global Communications, the listings weren’t linked to demand but reflected efforts to assemble small batches around parts availability and align them with existing orders.

Production Ramp-up

The EV maker is targeting production of 18,000 to 20,000 vehicles in 2025, a target that was revised to include a lower-end in August.

Considering that Lucid produced 9,966 vehicles between January 1 and September 30, it must produce between 8,034 and 10,034 vehicles in the final three months of the year to stay within the guidance.

Production is ramping up, with a second shift having recently started operating in its Arizona plant, as exclusively reported by EV.

The company will disclose its third-quarter earnings results on Tuesday (November 4), after market close.

The north east of England is already driving innovation and growth within the UK’s offshore wind sector, and this facility will serve as a vital tool for companies to develop the latest cutting-edge technologies and solutions, helping the region stay at the forefront of the UK’s journey towards achieving clean power by 2030.”

The Technology Development Centre contains:

A 1MW drivetrain test rig for evaluating rotating machine components

A mini electrical grid system where clients can test and certify the electrical compliance of their devices for any grid in the world

A 100kW test rig, dedicated to smaller-scale subsystems and early-stage proof of concept work

A dedicated laboratory to enhance the longevity, reliability and performance of critical components working under harsh conditions

The facility also plans to support companies in advancing testing for energy storage systems, such as battery storage and hydrogen.

The Centre is part of the Energy Central Campus, a collaborative partnership between ORE Catapult, Port of Blyth, and Northumberland County Council, aiming to support the clean energy sector through delivering education, training, and pathways to employment in the local area.

North East mayor Kim McGuinness said, “We now have even more great green energy jobs right here in the North East as this brilliant new facility opens its doors. It’s yet more proof we’re a world leader in this industry. Just a few months ago, I officially opened the Energy Central Learning Hub in Blyth, nearby. This is how we’re investing, not just in technology and innovation, but also in the skills our communities need to get jobs in green energy for decades to come. This is a turning point for our region, and it is crucial we continue to support and invest in facilities like this.”

The 1500sqm former paper storage shed and surrounding land were secured and converted with investment from the North East Combined Authority (£2m), the Blyth Town Deal (£2m), Innovate UK (£1.3m) and ORE Catapult (£1m).

Councillor Glen Sanderson, leader of Northumberland County Council, said, ""This is another great day for Northumberland and the wider region, showcasing the cutting-edge innovation that the north east is famous for.

""Blyth is cementing its reputation as an international centre of renewable energy and advanced manufacturing growth, and this fantastic new facility is bringing new jobs and new opportunities to develop skills and is another step in the renaissance of the town.""

The company is looking to feed power to data centers, which have spawned massive demand for electricity to run artificial intelligence systems. Nuclear energy has gained popularity as a method to provide that electricity, though the industry is unlikely to deliver any new reactors for years.

Article content

First American says its gas-first model means it can start supplying electricity within the next few years while it pursues regulatory approval for its reactor. Other companies are pursuing a similar strategy, and Reinboth said he’s talking to potential data center customers.

Article content

The company is evaluating several sites in Indiana, where the goal is to eventually install six of the systems for about $4.2 billion. Together, the reactors would generate enough energy to power 1.5 million homes.

Happy Eco News reported that a team from National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University has developed a cell that can convert more than 36% of LED light into energy. It's a fascinating breakthrough that could help to power electronics, sensors, and health monitors — negating the need for batteries in certain scenarios.

""The implications of this development go far beyond convenience. These solar panels can help reduce electronic waste by replacing batteries in millions of devices that would otherwise require frequent replacement or recharging,"" Happy Eco News' Cyrene Oraya Reyes wrote.

The team is working with perovskite, a promising material that can turn light into electricity with astounding efficiencies when incorporated into panels. But short lifespans have been a significant hurdle. Solar Magazine reported that perovskite panels can last a couple of years, compared to 30-plus years for common silicon panels.

The cells needed some molecular tuning, particularly in the bonding agents, to achieve suitable charge transport in the wide-bandgap units. Additives also bind with unwanted ions, helping with longevity issues, per Happy Eco News.

It's a ""promising passivation strategy for the development of high-performance"" indoor light catchers, the experts wrote in the study.

It's an interesting take on renewable energy, often characterized by large wind turbines and massive solar farms. But experts are working on devices that can make energy from low wind speeds and dim or indoor light. University College London is also working on cells that capture artificial illumination.

It's all helping to limit demand for electricity from dirty power sources that produce heat-trapping air pollution, linked by the American Lung Association to respiratory and other health risks.

All of our devices suck up loads of electricity. In fact, unplugging energy vampires, such as unused chargers, can save you $165 a year. Reducing the number of gadgets that need to be plugged in to begin with can solve much of the problem.

It's important because energy prices have been rising faster than inflation, according to NPR. Goldman Sachs expects the growth of data centers to suck up 165% more electricity by 2030, straining the grid.

Household solar is one of the best protections against uncontrollable rate hikes. The free solar energy can be stored in batteries, offering blackout protection, or sold back to the grid for a profit when part of a virtual power plant. EnergySage can help you compare quotes, find a timely installer, and lock in federal tax breaks before they expire. The resource can save you up to $10,000 on upfront costs.

In Taiwan, replacing batteries with light-based energy can also help limit environmental risks. When improperly disposed of, lithium-ion batteries are a toxic hazard, according to the University of Texas, Dallas.

Happy Eco News reported that the team still has some work to do to boost efficiency in low-lit settings, but the progress is promising.

To date, BMW cooperates with more than 300 partners, including Samsung SDI and Solid Power.","Since 2022, the BMW Group and Solid Power have been collaborating to expedite the development of all-solid-state battery (ASSB) technology as part of a technology transfer agreement.

The pair has, as of this month, become a trio, with Samsung SDI joining to help with the validation and development of the ASSB tech in the automotive sector.

To date, the latest milestone is the integration of Solid Power’s large-format pure ASSB cells into a BMW i7 technology test vehicle.

A solid state journey

Under the new agreement, Solid Power is set to supply sulphide-based solid electrolyte to Samsung SDI.

After receiving the electrolytes, Samsung SDI aims to integrate these into the separator and/or the catholyte and use this to build cells – each case is subject to achievement of technical requirements.

Once the cells have been created, they will be evaluated based on performance parameters and requirements to be agreed between Samsung SDI and BMW.

“We are excited to partner with Samsung SDI and BMW to progress the development of all-solid-state batteries,” says John Van Scoter, President and CEO of Solid Power.

“Our solid electrolyte technology is designed for stability and conductivity and by working closely with global leaders in automotive and battery innovation, we strive to bring ASSB technology closer to widespread adoption.”

The overall aim is to integrate ASSB cells into a next generation of evaluation vehicles.

Partnering for ASSB tech

The collaboration is changing the game of the automotive sector, especially since “the partners believe in the potential of genuine ASSB technology and the promise of higher energy density combined with increased safety compared to today’s technologies by replacing liquid electrolytes with solid materials”, according to BMW in its press release.

As energy density increases, so can longer vehicle range, with the possibility of disregarding potential disadvantages when it comes to storage system weight.

""Technological competitiveness in batteries would ultimately lead to innovation in electric vehicles,"" says Stella Joo-Young Go, Executive Vice President of ASSB Commercialisation Team at Samsung SDI.

""Samsung SDI will work closely with great global partners like BMW and Solid Power to take the lead in commercialising ASSB.""

Partnering for a decade

BMW and Solid Power have been cooperating since 2016 via an extended “Joint Development Agreement”, supporting BMW’s investment in Solid Power in May 2021 as part of its financing round.

At the end of 2022, BMW and Solid Power agreed to further deepen their partnership, allowing BMW to operate a solid-state cell prototype line at CMCC in Parsdorf – on the basis of a research and development licence and with Solid Power’s experience and expertise.

Since 2008, BMW has been building up competence in the battery cell technology field and since 2019, this has been pooled at BMW’s Battery Cell Competence Center (BCCC) in Munich.

To date, BMW cooperates with more than 300 partners, including Samsung SDI and Solid Power.

Citing South Africa’s new Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM), the report describes a model Nigeria could adapt.
“SAREM exemplifies a comprehensive industrial policy framework aimed at localising renewable energy value chains, fostering inclusive economic growth, and facilitating a just energy transition,” the document explains.
Between 2014 and 2024, South Africa imported over R180 billion (about $10 billion) worth of renewable energy materials.
“SAREM aims to address this by promoting the establishment of industrial hubs and Special Economic Zones focused on renewable energy,” the report noted.","As the global energy transition accelerates, Africa, especially Nigeria, stands at a pivotal crossroads. The continent, long known for its wealth of natural resources, now has a once-in-a-generation opportunity to convert that endowment into economic power, by building local industries for renewable energy and clean technologies.

A new report by Sustainable Energy for All (SEforALL), “Fostering Industrial Hubs for Energy Transition Technologies in Africa”, highlights how Africa can harness this global shift to achieve inclusive industrialisation, job creation, and sustainable growth.

Drawing on lessons from G20 nations, the report outlined a roadmap for building energy-transition industrial hubs that can transform the continent’s economic landscape.

For Nigeria, the continent’s largest economy, the report signals both urgency and opportunity. With deliberate policy action, the country can transform from an importer of energy technologies into a regional producer, capturing value, creating jobs, and positioning itself at the heart of Africa’s clean energy future.

“Climate action and industrialisation must go hand in hand”

The SEforALL report situates Africa’s green industrialisation within a global context of shifting trade and technology. It noted that in 2024, G20 countries traded over $420 billion worth of solar modules, batteries, and electric vehicles, representing nearly 75 percent of global trade in these technologies.

However, the report warned that supply chains for these technologies remain highly concentrated. Over 90 percent of G20 imports of cobalt ores and concentrates came from the Democratic Republic of Congo in 2023, while 61 percent of graphite was sourced from China and 82 percent of lithium from Australia.

“The message is increasingly loud and clear,” the report stated. “Climate action and industrialisation must go hand in hand, requiring stronger collaboration to ensure that supply chains are diversified and benefits more equitably distributed.”

For Africa, this linkage between energy transition and industrialisation is both a challenge and an opening. As global powers seek to secure raw materials and manufacturing capacity, the continent can move beyond the “pit-to-port paradigm” of extraction to build industries that add value locally.

A $27 Billion Market Opportunity

According to SEforALL, Africa’s renewable energy ambitions already point to an emerging market of significant scale. “For Sub-Saharan Africa, total renewables capacity in the power sector is expected to triple to 165 GW by 2030, with nearly 40 GW of solar PV,” the report says.

This expansion represents “a $27 billion market opportunity in the solar PV sector alone between 2025 and 2030, including modules and balance of system components.” Demand for lithium-based batteries is also forecast to reach 10 GWh by 2030, generating a market opportunity of $10–15 billion annually.

The report observes that Africa imported more than $12 billion in finished energy-transition products between 2022 and 2024 — with South Africa, Nigeria, and Kenya among the largest importers. “If current trends continue and domestic manufacturing capacities remain underdeveloped, import costs will escalate,” it warned.

SEforALL argued that this rising demand, coupled with strong resource endowments, creates a foundation for local manufacturing. “Strategically investing in tailored localisation strategies for energy-transition technologies is not only a socioeconomic opportunity, it is also a future-proofing strategy,” it concluded.

Building hubs for green manufacturing

The report called for the creation of industrialisation hubs for energy-transition technologies, combining national action with regional and international collaboration. It identifies three key domains of focus: industrial policy, infrastructure, and partnerships.

“Advancing industrialisation hubs in Africa for energy-transition technologies requires a coordinated, whole-of-government strategy,” it said. Such an approach should align ministries of trade, investment, mining, energy, and skills development around a shared industrial mission.

Citing South Africa’s new Renewable Energy Masterplan (SAREM), the report describes a model Nigeria could adapt. “SAREM exemplifies a comprehensive industrial policy framework aimed at localising renewable energy value chains, fostering inclusive economic growth, and facilitating a just energy transition,” the document explains.

Between 2014 and 2024, South Africa imported over R180 billion (about $10 billion) worth of renewable energy materials. “SAREM aims to address this by promoting the establishment of industrial hubs and Special Economic Zones focused on renewable energy,” the report noted. By 2030, the plan targets an addition of 5 GW per year of renewable capacity and over 25,000 jobs.

For Nigeria, a similar roadmap could be developed under its Energy Transition Plan to link domestic renewable targets with local production of solar modules, inverters, and battery storage systems.

“The manufacturing sector is critical for employment generation”

SEforALL underscores that industrialisation is key to inclusive development. “The manufacturing sector is particularly critical for employment generation, as well as economic transformation,” it says. Yet manufacturing value added in Sub-Saharan Africa has stagnated at about 11 percent of GDP for two decades.

By 2030, “half of all new entrants into the global labour force will come from Sub-Saharan Africa, requiring the creation of up to 15 million new jobs annually,” the report observes. Green manufacturing could absorb much of this workforce.

The employment potential of renewable manufacturing is especially strong in solar energy. SEforALL estimates nearly 4 million person-years of labour in solar PV manufacturing between 2024 and 2050 — equivalent to 146,000 full-time jobs annually.

It concluded: “Renewables manufacturing can support job creation objectives with over 146,000 jobs annually in solar PV assembly alone.”

Trade integration and value chain development

The SEforALL report highlights trade policy as a cornerstone of Africa’s green industrialisation. “Clean energy supply chains are deeply trade-dependent,” it notes. Strategic trade measures — including calibrated tariffs, regional trade integration, and investment incentives — can unlock domestic manufacturing potential.

The report calls for deeper implementation of the African Continental Free Trade Area (AfCFTA) to build regional value chains. “Africa needs both regional and intercontinental trade agreements to build market linkages for intermediate and finished goods,” it stressed.

Intra-African merchandise trade currently accounts for just 13.7 percent of total trade, compared to 22 percent in ASEAN and 58 percent in the European Union. According to SEforALL, “Every 10 percent increase in regional trade in intermediary products correlates with a nearly 4 percent increase in manufacturing employment.”

The report also underscores the need to reconcile global trade rules with the industrialisation goals of developing countries. “There is an urgent need to promote dialogue on reconciling international trade regulations with climate action, particularly in the context of industrialisation goals of developing countries,” it said.

Technology and research gaps

Access to clean technology and innovation capacity remains one of Africa’s biggest obstacles. SEforALL points out that G20 countries owned about 91 percent of all patents in environmental technologies filed between 2000 and 2021, with China, Japan, the United States, Korea, and Germany accounting for the bulk.

“The development of industrialisation hubs for minerals beneficiation and clean energy manufacturing requires access to technology, skilled labour, and innovation ecosystems,” the report stated.

It urges stronger North–South and South–South collaboration to bridge this technology gap. “The G20 could serve as a key forum to facilitate partnerships and engagement to address key barriers and strengthen technology access and local innovation systems in developing countries,” it added.

Skills and workforce development

The report emphasises that building green industries also requires human capital. “For the energy transition to contribute to employment in Africa, the workforce needs to be trained with adequate technical and non-technical skills and be ready to take the occupations that will be required,” it said.

It calls for targeted interventions in curriculum updates, industry–academia partnerships, and regional skills certification frameworks. “Governments play a pivotal role in creating an enabling environment for skills development,” SEforALL noted, adding that public funding for vocational training and workforce inclusion will be crucial.

A call to action

The SEforALL report concludes with a clear appeal: Africa must act now to align industrial policy, investment, and regional cooperation if it is to capture the economic gains of the clean energy transition.

“The opportunity for African countries to build domestic value chains for energy-transition technologies depends on several factors, including resource endowment, existing production capacities, soft and hard infrastructure, and an enabling policy and regulatory environment,” it stated.",https://cdn.businessday.ng/2021/11/Energy-transition-1.png,N,,2025-11-04 10:18:37.866139

The site was originally home to a chemical processing plant owned by US company W. R. Grace, which produced commodities including sealants for rubber containers, latex products and resins, from 1954. However, in 1973, local residents complained about local air pollution around the plant, and testing from the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in 1978 found that two local wells had been polluted, which the EPA attributed to the dumping of “effluent wastes” in lagoons in the area.

The EPA closed chemical processing at the site, and placed the area on the National Priorities List in 1983.

Ministers from across the 27-nation bloc met in Brussels to try to get at least 15 to align their nationally determined emissions targets to have a stronger negotiating position during the Conference of Parties — known less formally as COP30 in Belem.

“We need to show to the world that we are leaders in climate change. We need to deliver adequate signals for investors. Today’s the day,” Spanish climate minister Sara Aagesen said before the meeting.

A draft proposal for an agreement on climate commitments seen by The Associated Press calls for loosening core climate regulations by giving priority to economic and energy security.

Climate ministers will discuss the proposal, which would allow nations to swap emissions between domestic economic sectors like manufacturing and agriculture. It also calls for larger allowances for EU nations to buy carbon credits outside the bloc.

The EU’s long-held leadership of action on climate is under threat by domestic and international pressure.

Wildfires, heat waves and floods have disrupted life across Europe, spurring calls for more climate action. But crises like Russia’s war in Ukraine, and a newly volatile relationship with the United States, have increased political and economic pressure to curtail flagship environmental policies.

A recent weakening of a deforestation law by the European Commission, the EU’s executive arm, upset environmentalists. They worried that it signaled a deeper disenchantment with green priorities by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. In February, she had announced an economic policy that some said eroded her Green Deal, a plan aimed at making Europe the world’s first carbon-neutral continent.

But von der Leyen said in September that “the world can count on Europe’s climate leadership” and pledged that the EU is “on our way to climate neutrality” and would slash carbon emissions by 90% by 2040.

She has linked climate investment to sovereignty and defense, arguing that a self-reliant Europe can better face threats like disruptive tariffs or export controls, armed conflict and environmental disasters.

Many EU governments have shifted to the right since the Paris Agreement in 2015. Some see climate regulations as shackling the economy, while others say Europe will either make and sell renewables or be forced to buy energy or green products from countries like China.

Wopke Hoekstra, the EU’s climate commissioner, said that the bloc needed to “bridge climate action with competitiveness and industrial savviness, if you will, and independence that is going to be the name of the game in the years that we have ahead of us.”

“We’ll do our utmost to be successful, but it takes 27 to tango,” he said of the negotiations on Tuesday.

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals has rattled Europe, whose climate vision was in part forged in partnership with the Democratic administrations of former U.S. Presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

The EU’s commitments in Paris have driven investment in renewable energies and electric vehicles, often in cooperation and at odds with Chinese companies.

Heat-trapping carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere jumped by the highest amount on record last year, soaring to a height not seen in human civilization and “turbocharging” the Earth’s climate and causing more extreme weather, according to the U.N. weather agency.

Europe is the world’s fastest-warming continent and has been heating up twice as fast as other regions since the 1980s. The heat has been linked to more intense rains and floods, and the report predicts rainfall decline and more severe droughts in southern Europe.

Permitting the First 6 GW of an 11 GW Campus will Clear the Path for Fermi America to Build One of the Largest Clean Natural Gas Projects in the World

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, emphasized, ""Energy independence is not just an economic issue — it's a matter of national security. President Trump and Governor Abbott are men of action, and they expect the private sector to provide answers, not power points. At Fermi, we are proud to be building this campus in real time to meet the needs of the country.""

As Fermi America's clean natural gas project comes online, 6 GW of power demand will not have to be drawn from the U.S. grid — enough energy, on average, to power New York City. Instead, Fermi will utilize minimal grid power as it ramps up in the coming months, until the initial gas generators, which are already en route to the campus, are installed and online in 2026. The entire premise behind the 11 GW private HyperGrid campus being built on clean natural gas, nuclear, solar, and battery power is that the nation's grid cannot grow fast enough to keep pace with the AI race, nor should consumers be expected to foot the bill through rising utility rates to support the most successful companies in the world.

""Hardworking Americans are tired of watching electricity costs rise while the grid ages,"" added Toby Neugebauer, CEO and Co-Founder of Fermi America. ""At Fermi, our private grid model ensures that the growing demand for AI is met privately — freeing up power on the public utilities to serve homes, schools, hospitals, and small businesses as intended. Together with our partners, we're building one of the cleanest, most efficient power fleets in the world, driven by American innovation — without asking taxpayers to foot the energy bill for the world's largest, highest-margin companies.""

Fermi America plans to integrate zero emissions solar into its power supply plan and utilize the latest technology and hybrid cooling systems, ensuring protection of air quality and water conservation. Additionally, Fermi's air quality analysis shows that the project meets all federal and state air quality, odor and health effect standards, ensuring that air quality is protective of all Carson County residents.

A company with connections to the cryptocurrency industry is considering drilling for natural gas near the Deep River north of Sanford in Lee County, North Carolina.

If approved, the project would be the first commercial well drilled into the Triassic Basin, a natural gas repository underlying North Carolina and other Eastern Seaboard states.

Deep River Data, based in Alamance County, is interested in accessing gas from Butler Well No. 3, just south of U.S. Highway 421 near the Lee-Chatham county line, according to emails obtained under public records law.

Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.

“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.

Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.

Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.

Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.

Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.

Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.

“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”

Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.

“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”

Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.

Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”

The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.

The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.

The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”

The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”

Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.

“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.

The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.

The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.

“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.

Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.

Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.

Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.

Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.

Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.

It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.

Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.

Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.

Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.

HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.

Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.

“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.

“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”

Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry a?airs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.

Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.

Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On Oct. 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.

They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.

Quarter-over-quarter, the deficit worsened due to a continued fall in sales, as US tax credit incentives for EV purchases ended in September.

Samsung SDI is putting energy storage system (ESS) sales at the heart of its turnaround strategy, particularly in the US. That said, in European Union (EU) markets, the company still intends to capitalise on an expected peak in demand for EVs towards the end of the year. Indeed, the company signed more than 110GWh of supply contracts with automotive manufacturers during the quarter.

South Korean battery makers chase FEOC advantage

US battery storage projects still qualify for investment tax credit (ITC) incentives. However, new provisions introduced with the One, Big, Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) budget reconciliation legislation mean developers receiving material assistance above a certain threshold from foreign entities of concern (FEOC) companies will be unable to avail of the capex subsidies.

FEOC restrictions will apply to Chinese, Iranian, Russian and North Korean entities, and of course, in the battery space, that effectively means China, given the industry’s heavy dependence on the East Asian powerhouse for everything from materials processing to finished products.

Rules introduced under the Biden Administration already awarded a domestic content bonus for ITC-eligible projects, and ultimately, the US government wants to see the market served overwhelmingly by products made domestically.

Samsung SDI’s fellow South Korean rival LG Energy Solution (LG ES) has announced an uplift in ESS battery sales that helped keep the company’s most recent quarter profitable, even as EV battery sales slumped for LG ES, too.

South Korean companies, which had already invested in EV battery lines in the US, now hold the cards with a first-mover advantage to supply the energy storage market by retooling those EV battery factories.

The difference between them is that LG ES has already got ESS battery cell production lines up and running in the US, at its factory in Holland, Michigan. These lithium iron phosphate (LFP) production lines were repurposed from producing nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) cells for electric vehicles.

LG ES aims to have 17GWh of annual production capacity across four lines in Michigan by the end of this year and 30GWh within the US by the end of next year, meaning that from a relative standing start, Samsung SDI plans to achieve a similar level of production much faster. SK On is pursuing a similar strategy of investing in US production of LFP cells.

Tesla deal reports, NCA cell production already underway

In September, at this year’s RE+, the biggest clean energy industry event in the US, Samsung SDI debuted two battery energy storage system (BESS) products it will make within the country, Samsung Battery Box 1.7 (SBB 1.7) and SBB 2.0.

Both are 20-foot containerised BESS solutions, but SBB 1.7 is a 6.14MWh high energy density system utilising nickel cobalt aluminium oxide (NCA) battery cells and SBB 2.0 uses LFP cells. Although Samsung SDI did not offer a capacity for SBB 2.0 in launch materials, some sources speculated that it would hold a similar capacity to SBB 1.7.

SBB 1.7 will come onto the market sooner than its LFP counterpart. The company said in its results release that local production of NCA batteries already began last month at a factory in Indiana, through StarPlus Energy, a joint venture (JV) with auto OEM Stellantis.

Mass production of LFP batteries will begin this quarter. Samsung SDI highlighted its position in the market as the only non-Chinese manufacturer of prismatic LFP cells, which would mean its cells could be a simpler drop-in solution for system integrators used to working with Chinese suppliers.

Earnings improvement is expected in the fourth quarter, according to Samsung SDI, driven by growth in EV demand in Europe and ESS demand in the US.

New Delhi: Brookfield Asset Management is planning to invest $12 billion in Andhra Pradesh's renewable energy sector over the next three years, said people with knowledge of the matter, in what would be the largest overseas commitment in that sector for India.

The purse could grow as the global investment firm is looking to establish a township, as well as multiple hotels under its Leela brand, they said.

Brookfield, which is eyeing investments across the value chain in the green energy sector, is likely to invest in Indosol's integrated manufacturing facility and Navayuga's renewable energy portfolio, besides manufacturing and green hydrogen projects.

The commitment was made at a meeting of Andhra Pradesh IT and electronics minister Nara Lokesh and Brookfield asset management managing partners Nawal Saini, Ankur Gupta and Arpit Agrawal.

Live Events

Investments in realty, hospitality too

It follows a September meeting between Lokesh and Brookfield global president Connor Teskey in London.

Andhra Pradesh has received major investments in the renewable energy sector by the likes of Premier Energies and Renew Power. Apart from renewable energy, Brookfield is planning to invest in other sectors in the state. The investment in the satellite township, planned to be set up north of Vizag, has not been worked out yet, said the people cited.

“The number of Leela hotels has not been finalised,” said one of them. “But in the meeting, the broad contours of this have been agreed upon.”

The investments in the real estate and hospitality sector will be over and above the $12 billion pledged for clean energy. Brookfield aims to expand its India portfolio from $30 billion to $100 billion in various sectors by 2030. The Andhra government is likely to ink a deal with Brookfield at its partnership summit on November 14-15 in Vizag.

Permitting the First 6 GW of an 11 GW Campus will Clear the Path for Fermi America to Build One of the Largest Clean Natural Gas Projects in the World

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, emphasized, ""Energy independence is not just an economic issue — it's a matter of national security. President Trump and Governor Abbott are men of action, and they expect the private sector to provide answers, not power points. At Fermi, we are proud to be building this campus in real time to meet the needs of the country.""

As Fermi America's clean natural gas project comes online, 6 GW of power demand will not have to be drawn from the U.S. grid — enough energy, on average, to power New York City. Instead, Fermi will utilize minimal grid power as it ramps up in the coming months, until the initial gas generators, which are already en route to the campus, are installed and online in 2026. The entire premise behind the 11 GW private HyperGrid campus being built on clean natural gas, nuclear, solar, and battery power is that the nation's grid cannot grow fast enough to keep pace with the AI race, nor should consumers be expected to foot the bill through rising utility rates to support the most successful companies in the world.

""Hardworking Americans are tired of watching electricity costs rise while the grid ages,"" added Toby Neugebauer, CEO and Co-Founder of Fermi America. ""At Fermi, our private grid model ensures that the growing demand for AI is met privately — freeing up power on the public utilities to serve homes, schools, hospitals, and small businesses as intended. Together with our partners, we're building one of the cleanest, most efficient power fleets in the world, driven by American innovation — without asking taxpayers to foot the energy bill for the world's largest, highest-margin companies.""

Fermi America plans to integrate zero emissions solar into its power supply plan and utilize the latest technology and hybrid cooling systems, ensuring protection of air quality and water conservation. Additionally, Fermi's air quality analysis shows that the project meets all federal and state air quality, odor and health effect standards, ensuring that air quality is protective of all Carson County residents.

Gerrard compiled a list of environmental cases for Inside Climate News, based in part on the Sabin Center’s Climate Litigation Tracker.
Although not specifically an environmental case, that outcome now has bearing on one of the largest environmental case categories being litigated in Trump’s second term.","In President Donald Trump’s first term, the federal courts helped put the brakes on his administration’s retreat on environmental protection.

Nine months into the second Trump term, the courts appear divided on whether to allow the administration’s far more aggressive dismantling of policy on climate change, clean energy and environmental justice.

In the 14 environmental policy cases so far in which there have been rulings on legal issues, the outcomes appear to be roughly even, with six clear wins for the Trump administration, five for the challengers and three mixed decisions, according to an Inside Climate News analysis. But in the Trump administration’s six victories, there’s an ominous sign: Three came when U.S. Circuit Courts of Appeal overturned lower court rulings. That means that as of Nov. 4, all of the appeals court decisions in environmental cases have gone the president’s way.

The most important appellate panel—the Supreme Court—has yet to weigh in on any environmental cases from Trump’s second term. But emergency orders the high court has issued on other issues—education and health, for example—portend trouble for the many lawsuits over the Trump administration’s wholesale termination of environmental justice grants.

The case outcomes are a sign that the environmental law battles of Trump’s second term will be different from those of his first term. They are playing out in federal courts that he has shaped with 251 appointments (his nominees hold 28 percent of 870 judgeships on courts established under Article III of the Constitution). And in the years Trump was out of office, his judicial appointees helped transform the laws governing federal regulation, giving agency decision-makers less deference and narrowing the scope of their authority. The changes have emboldened Trump’s second-term team leaders, like Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin, to push the envelope, including with a bid to rescind his agency’s authority to address climate change.

But all of the second-term court rulings so far have been on preliminary issues—mainly whether to put a hold on Trump administration actions while core case issues, such as constitutionality, are decided. Moreover, in the vast majority of environmental cases involving the Trump administration—24 out of 38—there have been no substantive rulings so far.

“It’s far too early to tell how they’ll go,” said Michael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University. “The three where the courts have denied preliminary injunctions have gotten attention, but it’s only three” out of a much larger number of cases, he said. Gerrard compiled a list of environmental cases for Inside Climate News, based in part on the Sabin Center’s Climate Litigation Tracker.

Even if the second Trump administration is a more challenging legal environment, environmental advocates and Democratic state attorneys general are pushing forward with litigation, arguing that Zeldin and other Trump policymakers have overplayed their legal hand. And they maintain there’s reason to believe the courts ultimately will curb Trump rollbacks, especially on important regulatory issues, like the proposed repeal of the EPA’s endangerment finding on greenhouse gas emissions, that are yet to be finalized and litigated.

A Changed Legal Landscape

Records show challengers were successful in holding back many of the first Trump administration’s gambits to roll back environmental protection. One advocacy group, the Natural Resources Defense Council, says it sued the first Trump administration 163 times, winning nearly 90 percent of its cases. NRDC’s suits helped put a stop to the first Trump administration’s effort to restart the Keystone XL pipeline, to open areas of the Arctic and the Atlantic oceans to drilling and to eliminate energy efficiency standards.

The litigation tracker of the Institute for Policy Integrity at New York University, which zeroed in on regulatory disputes, showed that 76 percent of 135 court cases over agency environment, energy and natural resources rules were decided against the Trump administration between 2017 and 2021. Courts in those cases, for example, determined that the Trump EPA failed to follow the law in its weakening of rules on the potent greenhouse gases known as HFCs, on its handling of toxic wastewater discharges from power plants and in its delay of rules on methane emissions from landfills.

The current array of environmental policy cases is quite different from the mix in Trump’s first term, reflecting how much policy he has sought to make through executive action, without resorting to the formal regulatory and deregulatory process. For example, there are four challenges related to Trump’s executive orders to halt offshore wind energy development before the courts—and in one of those cases, the Revolution Wind project off Rhode Island succeeded in getting an injunction lifting Trump’s stop-work order and allowing it to resume construction.

Trump’s assertion of executive authority on renewables decision-making cuts both ways; the administration has been sued by two anti-wind-energy groups over its decision to allow another offshore project, Empire Wind, to proceed. A U.S. district judge in Washington, D.C. ruled on Oct. 23 in favor of the Trump administration, which is a win for Empire Wind.

A district judge in Washington state has blocked, for now, the Trump plan to suspend the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure charging network, known as NEVI. And a district judge in New York ruled that New York City’s new congestion pricing program should be allowed to go into effect while litigation over whether Trump has power to stop it proceeds.

Although the cases are varied, observers see common threads in the executive actions at issue.

“The theme that runs throughout is they’re doing everything they can to maximize both the supply of and the demand for fossil fuels,” Gerrard said.

In four cases, the Trump administration is directly challenging states’ authority to pursue their own climate policy. The Justice Department is seeking to overturn the climate “superfund” laws of Vermont and New York, and to block Michigan and Hawaii from suing fossil fuel companies to recover climate change costs, such as the expense of infrastructure to address sea level rise and to protect populations from extreme heat events. There have been no rulings in those cases so far.

One case that embodies the division among federal judges ruling on Trump environmental policy is the challenge to his siting of a migrant detention camp in the Everglades. The property known as “Alligator Alcatraz” is in the midst of wetlands that filter and store water for millions of Floridians, land that is sacred to Florida’s Miccosukee Tribe. A federal judge on Aug. 22, acting on a request by the tribe and environmentalists, ordered that the facility be dismantled and wound down. But in a 2-1 decision on Sept. 4, the 11th Circuit Court of Appeals temporarily lifted that order, while the courts decide if an adequate environmental review was conducted. The two judges who sided with the Trump administration were among the six Trump appointees on the 12-judge 11th Circuit, which hears appeals throughout the Southeast.

The federal judicial system was designed to insulate judges from politics, requiring that appointees be confirmed by the Senate and be given lifetime appointments. Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts has vociferously defended the judiciary’s independence, declaring in 2018, “There are no Obama judges or Trump judges,” but “an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.”

Nevertheless, legal scholars have documented the partisan shift in judicial philosophy on the Supreme Court, with its conservative majority bolstered by three Trump appointees. And litigants are increasingly choosing where they file challenges against the federal government based on the political leanings they perceive in the Circuit Courts of Appeal, according to data compiled by the Institute for Policy Integrity.

The 177 active U.S. Courts of Appeal judges are closely divided in terms of appointees of Republican (51 percent) and Democratic (49 percent) presidents overall. But there are stark regional differences, with Republican presidential appointees holding 91 percent of the seats on the 8th Circuit in the Mountain West, and Democratic appointees holding 100 percent of the judgeships in the 1st Circuit in New England.

In the federal trial courts, (known as district courts), usually the first step in the legal process, Democratic appointees hold 61 percent of the 626 active judgeships, compared to Republicans’ 39 percent. And some decisions by Republican-appointed district judges have gone against the Trump administration. For example, Revolution Wind won its injunction from U.S. District Judge Royce Lamberth in Washington, D.C., an appointee of President Ronald Reagan.

And U.S. District Judge William Young in Massachusetts, another Reagan appointee, issued an order in June blocking the Trump administration’s cancellation of 2,100 National Institutes of Health grants. The Trump administration petitioned the Supreme Court and got an emergency order to reverse Young’s decision. Although not specifically an environmental case, that outcome now has bearing on one of the largest environmental case categories being litigated in Trump’s second term. The Trump administration is arguing, and a number of judges are agreeing, that the district courts have no jurisdiction over challenges to his administration’s termination of billions of dollars of grants, mostly for disadvantaged communities.

A Grenade From the Shadow Docket

At least nine lawsuits are underway over the Trump administration’s termination of the green bank and environmental justice and clean energy grants that Congress authorized in the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law of 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. The grant cancellations are erasing one of President Joe Biden’s most important climate initiatives.

Grantees scored early wins, with federal judges in Maryland, Rhode Island, South Carolina and Washington, D.C. ordering funds released while the legal challenges are heard. “EPA contends that it has authority to thumb its nose at Congress and refuse to comply with its directives,” wrote U.S. District Judge Adam Abelson, a Biden appointee, in deciding the Maryland case. The cases raise serious constitutional issues as well as statutory ones—in the South Carolina case, for example, the issue of whether grantees had been illegally targeted because of their viewpoints in violation of the First Amendment.

But since June, environmental grantees have seen a slew of defeats. The shift came after a divided Supreme Court issued two emergency orders favoring the Trump administration in its cancellation of education and NIH grants. A 5-4 majority of the high court backed the Trump administration’s view that such lawsuits were simple breach-of-contract matters that should be decided in a specialized venue, the Court of Federal Claims.

The rulings were consequential. The Claims Court only has the power to award money to grantees, not to reinstate terminated programs or decide on the big legal issues that the grantees have raised. For example, it has no authority to rule on charges that the Trump administration acted unconstitutionally or violated laws such as the Administrative Procedures Act, which is meant to protect citizens from “arbitrary and capricious” government actions. Ten of the 16 active judges on the Claims Court were appointed by Trump.

And because the Supreme Court took these cases from its emergency docket—its “shadow” docket, as critics call it—the big legal issues were barely aired. “Barebones briefing, no argument, and scarce time for reflection,” said Justice Elena Kagan in her dissent in the education grants case, chiding the majority from making new law from the emergency docket, as the court has done increasingly in recent years. Another dissenter, Justice Ketanji Brown Jackson, called the majority’s ruling on the education grant terminations “equal parts unprincipled and unfortunate,” and in the NIH case, she lamented that “a half paragraph of reasoning” was justifying cutting off millions of dollars for life-saving biomedical research, and had the potential to derail other grantees raising similar claims.

The Court, she said, “lobs this grenade without evaluating Congress’s intent or the profound legal and practical consequences” and is “sending plaintiffs on a likely futile, multivenue quest for complete relief.”

In three environmental grants cases so far—two in the appeals courts and one in the Washington, D.C. district court—judges have followed the Supreme Court majority’s reasoning, saying the cases likely belong in the Claims Court. The rulings have stymied efforts to save one of Biden’s largest climate programs, the $27 billion Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund. This so-called “green bank” was designed to act as a revolving fund, providing low-interest loans to give disadvantaged communities access to financing for renewable energy and efficiency upgrades. Initially seeking to claw back $20 billion of the fund, the EPA’s Zeldin leveled allegations of corruption against the recipients and the Biden administration. A lower court judge said the EPA had not offered any evidence of wrongdoing, and ruled that the funds should be released, before she was overturned by a 2-1 vote of a panel of the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals. The two judges who sided with Zeldin were Trump appointees.

Now, some grantees are trying to be proactive in anticipation that judges will move their complaints to the Claims Court. On Oct. 15, a coalition of states launched a two-pronged legal attack against Zeldin’s August cancellation of the remaining portion of the green bank fund, the $7 billion Solar for All program, by filing lawsuits simultaneously in the district court and the Claims Court. The move puts a large environmental grant program in line to be the first adjudicated in the Claims Court. The Solar for All case could become an early indicator of what kind of money damages, interest and attorneys fees the United States Treasury may be forced to pay because of the Trump administration’s wholesale termination of grant programs.

For now, most climate and environmental justice grant recipients have been denied access to their funds. But the grantees believe the Supreme Court has offered a narrow window of opportunity to have their legal issues heard. Roberts sided with the liberal justices in ruling that challenges to the grants’ terminations should not be funneled to the Claims Court. And Justice Amy Coney Barrett provided a crucial swing vote in the NIH grant ruling; joined by Roberts and the three liberal justices, Barrett said the plaintiffs could still challenge the Trump administration’s internal agency guidance determining which grants were cancelled.

Jackson expressed doubt as to whether Barrett’s compromise provided any meaningful opportunity for the grantees to have their claims heard: “It splits review of the grant terminations from review of the grant termination policy—thereby preserving the mirage of judicial review while eliminating its purpose: to remedy harms,” Jackson wrote in her dissent.

Nevertheless, arguments were heard in the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals on Oct. 23 seeking to revive the South Carolina case and its claims that the Trump administration had acted unconstitutionally.

Counting on Judicial Independence

To affirm the value of pushing back against Trump in the courts, some environmental advocates can point to wins they obtained just by filing lawsuits that brought to light the impact of Trump administration actions. After the Northeast Organic Farming Association of New York filed suit, the U.S. Department of Agriculture in May restored climate-smart agriculture information it had purged from its website. (Among the pages that were missing for a time were those that helped farmers access billions of dollars in support for conservation practices.)

And after the Environmental Defense Fund filed a lawsuit, the U.S. Department of Energy disbanded a committee of five well-known climate science deniers it had assembled to produce a controversial review of climate science. EDF argued that the creation of such a secret committee was a clear violation of the transparency and fairness mandates in the 53-year-old Federal Advisory Committee Act. The Trump administration has argued that the case is moot now that the committee is disbanded, but EDF is continuing the litigation.

“If the administration had followed federal law, full records of the deliberations and meetings of the climate working group would have been made available,” said Vickie Patton, general counsel of the EDF. “We believe that the American people are entitled to those records, and we are going to continue to press for them.”

Asked if she was concerned about whether the federal courts, with so many Trump appointees, would serve as an effective check on Trump in his second term, Patton expressed confidence in the system. “Our experience has been that there are courts and judges that are stewards of the rule of law and operate with the highest degree of integrity,” she said. “And I think everyone should ask that of our judiciary and our judicial system. It’s vital for our constitutional democracy.”

The most important challenges to Trump’s environmental rollbacks will come when federal agencies finalize their deregulatory proposals, including EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s pledge to wipe 31 pollution rules from the books.

A key case to watch will be the inevitable legal challenge to Zeldin’s planned repeal of the EPA’s 16-year-old finding that greenhouse gases endanger human health and welfare, the foundation on which all of the EPA’s other climate rules are based. Zeldin’s proposal leans heavily on a series of decisions that the Supreme Court has delivered in the past three years that limit an agency’s authority to act without explicit direction from Congress, especially in matters of great economic significance: the court’s so-called “major questions doctrine.”

“We can no longer rely on statutory silence or ambiguity to expand our regulatory power,” the EPA said in its proposal.

Climate action advocates will argue it was the Supreme Court itself that ruled in its landmark 2007 Massachusetts v. EPA case that greenhouse gases fit the definition of “pollutant” under the Clean Air Act, and directed the EPA to lay out its reasoning for or against regulation grounded in the language of that law. In the wake of that ruling, the Supreme Court rejected bids to overturn the endangerment finding, and ruled to limit state actions on climate change specifically because the EPA has the governing authority over climate regulation. But the five justices who decided the case for Massachusetts are dead or retired. Three of the dissenters, Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, remain on the court, along with three Trump appointees who have voted for limited EPA power on climate change.

Nevertheless, if the Supreme Court were to now agree with the Trump administration’s view that the EPA never had the authority to act on climate under the Clean Air Act, it could unravel all of the case law on the subject since the Massachusetts decision.

“They’re betting that they can get the current six-member majority to say, ‘We don’t care about Massachusetts, and frankly, we don’t care about the three other climate decisions we made that built on and accepted Massachusetts,’” said David Doniger, senior attorney and climate and energy strategist for NRDC. “They’re betting the court is just going to bless the Trump administration doing whatever it wants and I don’t think that kind of lawlessness is going to prevail.”

The EPA has received more than 568,000 public comments on its endangerment finding repeal proposal, and the law is clear that the agency must provide a “reasoned response” to any substantive comments. In fact, the Supreme Court last year blocked the Biden administration cross-state air pollution rule from taking effect, ruling that his EPA had failed to adequately address public comments.

All eyes will be on whether the Supreme Court holds the Trump EPA to the same standard.

“I count on the independence of the courts,” Doniger said. “We’re all counting on that for so much.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2205531023-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 05:57:52.595409

“I think the commission’s focus here is really ensuring that customers, existing customers, aren’t ultimately left paying for or subsidizing this (data center) customer,” MPSC Chair Dan Scripps said.
DTE has been insistent that power rates will not go up because of the data center.
To completely serve the data center with solar power, the utility would have to build 3.2 gigawatts of solar arrays, Bilyeu said.
But Bilyeu said DTE’s renewable power strategy will allow it to meet renewable portfolio standards even with the addition of the data center.","DTE Energy Co. is asking Michigan regulators to bypass public hearings and fast-track approval of a new data center planned for farmland outside Ann Arbor while citing potential of cost cuts to utilities for residential households.

In a filing Monday, the utility company outlined how the proposed data center — backed by a real estate development company tied to billionaire megadonor Stephen Ross' Related Companies and tech companies Oracle and ChatGPT maker OpenAI — would reduce costs despite using as much energy as is needed to power more than 1 million average American homes.

Exactly how much households could save is unclear, in part, because DTE cannot lower utility rates without going through the Michigan Public Service Commission, the state's energy regulator.

Michigan Public Service commissioners, who will decide whether the project moves forward, are focused on ensuring the plan protects DTE ratepayers if the data center developer doesn’t follow through on its plans for using power.

“I think the commission’s focus here is really ensuring that customers, existing customers, aren’t ultimately left paying for or subsidizing this (data center) customer,” MPSC Chair Dan Scripps said.

DTE has been insistent that power rates will not go up because of the data center. That's partly because of a Michigan law prohibiting residential users from shouldering the costs of data centers and partly because the sprawling facility planned for Saline Township will pay for a higher chunk of DTE's overall fixed costs.

The deal between DTE and the joint-venture data center calls for regulator approval by Dec. 5, although when the commission takes up the case is beyond the control of DTE and the company. Scripps said the commission will not take the case up this week.

“We need to carefully review the proposal and make sure the modeling is correct, the cost assumptions are correct, that the actual pledges the customer is going to be responsible for … are well documented,” Scripps said. “We have a fair amount of work ahead of us.”

It's also up to the commission to decide whether the deal is approved without public hearings. Commissioners are allowed to rule on such cases without a notice or public hearings if there are no added costs to consumers, but the commission can open the case for broader feedback at its discretion.

The project has been met with pushback since its inception. Related Digital previously sued Saline Township over officials' initial decision to oppose its rezoning, but the town board eventually allowed the project to move forward in lieu of a court battle.

Environmental groups are still figuring out how they will respond to DTE’s proposal, said Bryan Smigielski, Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Michigan campaign organizer. The groups intervened in Consumers Energy’s request to build a framework for contracts it drafts with data centers and have advocated for renewable energy and ratepayer protections.

“Anything that could have a big impact on our energy system should be a contested case,” he said. “If it’s going to impact health or climate targets or people’s bills, I would expect that.”

Climate impact

Environmental advocates have warned that building a new data center of this scale could pressure utilities to continue relying on fossil fuels to save money and meet energy needs.

Scripps said DTE proposed using batteries in what's called an energy storage system to store more power from its existing sources — such as renewables or baseload coal, natural gas or nuclear power — in order to serve the data center’s initial electricity needs. That could lead to the utility firing up fossil fuel-based power sources more often to charge the batteries.

""What are the batteries going to be charged from?"" said Daniel Abrams, senior associate attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center. ""If it's 1.4 gigawatts of energy storage — it's one thing if they're charged by the Monroe Coal Plant, and it's another thing if they're charged by solar. So we want to make sure that we're not prolonging the life of DTE's fossil fleet through the use of this storage resource.""

Legislation adopted in 2023 under the then-Democratic-led Michigan Legislature imposed a 100% clean energy standard for utilities by 2040. It also shifted power from local governments to the state to authorize large-scale wind and solar projects so the projects could move forward at a quicker pace.

In his testimony to the MPSC, DTE Director of Renewable Energy Planning and Strategy Kevin Bilyeu said the company’s renewable power target will increase by approximately 30.5% with the addition of the new data center.

The amount of power it would have to develop to serve the data center varies depending on the source of that renewable power and the number of renewable energy credits DTE puts toward the effort. To completely serve the data center with solar power, the utility would have to build 3.2 gigawatts of solar arrays, Bilyeu said. If the company used all of its expected renewable energy credits on this project, it would only have to build 443 megawatts of renewable power, he said in his testimony.

But Bilyeu said DTE’s renewable power strategy will allow it to meet renewable portfolio standards even with the addition of the data center.

""Bringing on new data center load of this magnitude actually creates affordability — and therefore headroom — to comply with the state’s clean energy targets,"" DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot said in an email. ""DTE's contract with the data center will by itself lead to the near-term deployment of enough battery storage in Michigan to satisfy the requirements of the state’s energy storage mandate.""

DTE will evaluate its renewable energy development plan during its next integrated resource planning process, which starts next year.

Smigielski questioned DTE’s statements that the utility has excess capacity it could use to serve a hyperscale data center that demands 1.4 gigawatts of power. Utilities have to deal with variations in demand, so they need excess capacity in order to supply their customers on the hottest days of summer when energy demand peaks.

If DTE starts pumping out as much electricity as it possibly can every day, then it would have to build additional power to satisfy its customers on peak demand days, Smigielski said.

Smigielski also pointed to DTE executives’ previous statements that the company is in discussions with multiple large data center customers, all of whom would increase demand for electricity.

“There’s simply no way that can not require additional generation,” he said.

""What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power.
The units would be co-located at an existing Constellation generation facility.
Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 megawatts of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.","BALTIMORE (Nov. 4, 2025) — Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG) today announced a long-range proposal to invest in up to 5,800 megawatts of power generation and battery storage projects in Maryland to meet rising demand for electricity, lower utility bills and usher in the next generation of clean and lower-carbon energy resources to power the state’s economic growth. The proposal offers Maryland leaders a menu of options so they can make informed decisions about how to power the state’s economy and address climate change in the most cost-effective way for generations to come.

To meet the state’s near-term needs, Constellation submitted battery storage and gas generation proposals to the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) on October 31 as part of a state program to fast-track permits for large-scale energy projects. These projects would by themselves cover more than 5 percent of the state’s peak load with battery storage and increase total power generation capacity about 10 percent, representing billions of dollars of private-sector investment in Maryland energy infrastructure. Longer term, the company has proposed a range of new and existing nuclear investments, including a plan to work with state leaders to explore building new nuclear power plants in Maryland.

""Constellation already has invested over $1 billion of its own money on Maryland wind, hydro and 24/7 clean nuclear energy resources to power Maryland families and businesses for generations to come. Today, we announce an ambitious plan to make billions of dollars of new investments in Maryland without seeking any electricity rate increases, including options ranging from new natural gas to battery storage and nuclear energy,"" said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO, Constellation. ""Constellation hopes to be a thought partner as Governor Moore and other policymakers consider the state’s many choices. For example, while there is a good deal of consensus on the need for battery storage, the future of natural gas in our state is less clear. Some Maryland stakeholders support new natural gas development, including the pipeline work that would be needed, while others oppose it even if that means building transmission lines and importing electricity from natural gas-rich states like Pennsylvania. We believe that natural gas generation should be an option, but there are pros and cons to consider and, quite naturally, we do not want to build what our state does not want. Therefore, our plan presents natural gas generation as one of a number of options, with an explanation of the utility work that will be needed to secure this option.

""What is clear to us is that we must build and retain resources that produce abundant, reliable and clean power. The best way we know to do that is to make state-of-the-art investments in our state’s existing nuclear, hydroelectric and renewable energy resources to get them to operate better and longer, and then to build on top of that great foundation. The historic agreement reached by Maryland and Constellation this September paves the way for extending the life of the Conowingo Dam for another 50 years, providing clean energy for hundreds of thousands of families for generations, while also investing $340 million to preserve wildlife and this beautiful watershed that we all enjoy. Likewise, Constellation has extended the lives of our wind assets for another 20 years, and we are working with willing customers to support the relicensing of the Calvert Cliffs clean nuclear plant.

""Finally, we are excited to work with Governor Moore, other state policymakers, and all Maryland stakeholders to investigate the development of new nuclear power in our state just as dozens of states across America are doing today. Importantly, all our investments have been and will be done without any cost to Maryland families and businesses. We are not now and never will be a monopoly that seeks guaranteed profits. We are a company that competes for its opportunities just like all our hardworking customers do — every single day. We rely on the talent and ingenuity of our Maryland team of power generation experts to make prudent investments, understanding that we will bear 100% of the risks of any cost overruns, delays or bad decisions that sometimes plague utility investments. That is the way it should be because the privilege to serve our customers and earn profits should be won, not guaranteed. Maryland is our home state and Constellation looks forward to continuing to offer competitive and innovative solutions to our state to create a prosperous and brighter future for Maryland families and businesses.""

The full plan starts with more than 1,500 megawatts of fast-track projects that could help address near-term needs, including:

State-of-the-art battery storage: Constellation is offering up to 800 megawatts of battery storage capacity that can release electricity to the grid quickly during times of peak demand, maintaining a stable power supply on the hottest days and coldest nights.

Investments in natural gas-powered generation: More than 700 megawatts (six units) of existing gas-fired power generators that could be rapidly deployed in Maryland and later converted to operate on carbon-free hydrogen fuel to reduce emissions. The units would be co-located at an existing Constellation generation facility. Constellation’s proposed options also include the potential for extending the operational usefulness of over 350 megawatts of existing Maryland power plants that are called upon during times of peak energy usage.

Longer term, the company has proposed potential investments in up to 4,000 megawatts of new and existing nuclear projects that, with customer support, could power the state’s economy with clean energy well into the next century, including:

Extending the life of the Calvert Cliffs Clean Energy Center: Relicensing the state’s only nuclear plant to operate for another 20 years would preserve nearly 2,000 megawatts of clean generation that serves more than 1.3 million homes. Absent the license extension, the plant’s two units would shut down in 2034 and 2036, respectively.

Investing in uprates to increase output: With new equipment and technology, Constellation can increase the output of Calvert Cliffs by 10 percent, or 190 megawatts, which is more than all the existing wind and solar generation in Maryland.

New advanced nuclear units: Constellation will explore building 2,000 megawatts of new, next-generation nuclear at Calvert Cliffs, effectively doubling the site’s output and creating enough clean generation to power future economic growth.

If fully realized, nearly 70 percent of the combined near- and long-term investments would be in clean, emissions-free energy resources and would increase the share of energy Maryland gets from clean resources from just over 50 percent today to about 70 percent once all the projects come online, supporting the state’s ambitious climate goals.

In addition to investments in new generation, Constellation is leading the way to make better use of the energy resources already available in the region by working with large businesses to lower their consumption during peak times, helping to free up capacity for new energy users, relieve strain on the grid and lower overall costs. Constellation plans to make these ""demand response"" programs more impactful by using AI and American ingenuity to create a 1,000 megawatt ""virtual power plant"" on the regional grid — the equivalent of a new nuclear reactor.

Constellation could bring all — or any combination — of these new projects forward to meet Maryland’s energy generation needs at the lowest possible cost to consumers, provided we have clear direction and enabling legislation from Maryland’s policymakers. Local utilities also have a critical role to play by supporting faster connections to the grid and ensuring we have the necessary infrastructure to deliver fuel to new gas-fired generation.

By adopting this approach, Maryland can preserve the benefits it has received over the past 20 years by being part of PJM, the grid operator serving Maryland, 12 other states and the District of Columbia. In PJM states, power generators like Constellation compete to provide the lowest cost generation resources across the region with no guarantee of earning a profit on their investments. As a result, the cost of power generation in PJM — the part of the bill that is not regulated by the state and is paid for with private investment – has remained flat for more than 15 years, even factoring in recent increases in generation capacity charges resulting from higher electricity demand. By contrast, studies have shown that utility spending on poles and wires — which earn a guaranteed rate of return that is charged to every business and household — is largely responsible for recent increases in utility bills across the country, including in Maryland.

With power demand projected to rise further in PJM states over the next five years, Constellation has proposed reforms that would make the competitive market work even more effectively for Maryland consumers. The company has joined with technology companies and other energy suppliers on policies that would speed investment in new generation and lower costs while minimizing risk to utility ratepayers. These policies would improve PJM’s method of forecasting electricity use, increase use of demand response programs that reduce energy use on the grid at times of peak demand, and help spur further investment in new power sources. You can find a complete list of those proposals here.

Once fully operational in 2028, the modernized facility is projected to churn out 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer each year.
Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, emphasized the dual benefits of the partnership.
“By utilizing Honeywell technology, we are paving the way for cleaner fertilizer production in the United States,” Williams added.","Honeywell today announced a landmark agreement with Wabash Valley Resources, LLC (WVR) to integrate its industry-leading carbon capture technologies into a project that will revive and modernize an idled gasification facility in West Terre Haute, Indiana. The ambitious initiative aims to produce hydrogen and ammonia fertilizer with a significantly reduced carbon footprint, addressing national priorities for food security and energy dominance.

The project, one of the first in the U.S. to produce low-carbon intensity hydrogen and ammonia, received a substantial boost from the U.S Department of Energy (DOE), which secured a $1.559 billion loan for WVR. This funding was granted through a program focused on maximizing the utilization of domestic energy infrastructure in agricultural sectors.

Central to the West Terre Haute facility's low-carbon profile is the implementation of Honeywell’s carbon capture solution. This technology is engineered to capture and permanently store nearly 1.65 million tons of CO2 annually underground. This sequestration effort is equivalent to the carbon absorbed by over 1.65 million acres of U.S. forests in a year, marking a significant environmental achievement for the industrial sector.

Once fully operational in 2028, the modernized facility is projected to churn out 500,000 metric tons of anhydrous ammonia fertilizer each year. This scaling of domestic production is expected to be a game-changer for American agriculture, aiming to replace half the imported supply for farmers across the critical Corn Belt, including in Illinois, Indiana, and Ohio. By reducing reliance on foreign imports, WVR hopes to exert downward pressure on fertilizer prices, directly benefiting farmers.

Ken West, president and CEO of Honeywell Energy and Sustainability Solutions, emphasized the dual benefits of the partnership. “As energy demand increases, Honeywell's carbon capture technologies help customers like Wabash Valley Resources optimize operations and reduce emissions to help boost the domestic production of important inputs like ammonia to support American agriculture,” West stated.

Dan Williams, CEO of Wabash Valley Resources, echoed this sentiment, stating the facility’s goals are to strengthen America's fertilizer supply chain and advance cleaner production methods. “By utilizing Honeywell technology, we are paving the way for cleaner fertilizer production in the United States,” Williams added.

The engineering and design of the facility are being handled by SAMSUNG E&A, a total solutions provider for the global energy industry.

The new — and final — state roadmap eliminates a Biden-era regulation that would’ve required people in the area to get an energy rating before selling their homes, and Alaska’s Department of Environmental Conservation is now in the process of repealing the requirement from the state’s administrative code. The regulation was set to take effect at the beginning of next year.

The EPA’s decision may mark the end of a yearslong policy tug-of-war – but only if the remaining methods to clean up the air succeed.

Energy audits removed

Scientists and state officials have repeatedly said smoke from wood stoves contributes the most to the Fairbanks area’s notoriously poor wintertime air quality. Energy audits aim to collect information on homes’ energy efficiency and heating systems, like wood stoves, then compile that data and give residences a rating.

But local realtors and elected officials argued that requiring them in the nonattainment area as part of the plan would’ve been a mistake. Heather Ferguson, a real estate agent and the legislative chair for the Greater Fairbanks Board of Realtors, said she’s glad federal and state officials are dropping the regulation.

“The energy rating itself is not doing anything to improve the air quality,” she said. “It was a data grab on … like the biggest thing a consumer can own.”

Ferguson also said paying for the mandated energy ratings would’ve burdened home sellers, and that the limited availability of energy raters would’ve created a bottleneck in the local housing market. According to the Alaska Housing Finance Corporation, there are currently four qualified energy raters in the Fairbanks North Star Borough.

“It was going to cripple our real estate market until we got more auditors,” Ferguson said.

Air quality plan gets final approval

The state’s federally-required plan to improve Fairbanks air quality has undergone multiple iterations and a fair amount of turbulence since 2009. That’s when the feds first determined that the amount of harmful particulate matter of 2.5 microns or less, or PM2.5, was exceeding federal standards in Fairbanks and North Pole air.

In 2019, the nonattainment area was reclassified from “moderate” to “serious.” The finding forced the State of Alaska to develop a new blueprint for how to fix the problem, called the Serious Implementation Plan (SIP).

In 2023, as part of the problem’s more recent history, the EPA decided some portions of the SIP weren’t good enough. That triggered a penalty called a conformity freeze, which has since been limiting how local and state transportation officials can use federal funds for infrastructure projects in the nonattainment area.

The state DEC then spent more than a year seeking to address the EPA’s concerns, and in early January, soon before President Donald Trump’s inauguration, the administration under then-President Joe Biden proposed approving a revised version of the state plan.

The next month, after the public comment period on that proposed approval had ended, both the Fairbanks City Council and Fairbanks North Star Borough Assembly passed resolutions urging federal officials to reconsider the mandated energy audits, which had been introduced in the SIP as a “compromise” with the EPA following the 2023 disapproval. The EPA under Trump then reopened public comment on the plan this March, citing local pushback to the home energy rating regulation.

In last week’s announcement, the federal agency decided the state’s air quality improvement measures still fulfill the Clean Air Act, even without the home energy audits. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said “Alaskans shouldn’t have to sacrifice their way of life to protect human health and the environment,” and that the state’s plan “proves that both goals are achievable.”

But Patrice Lee, a Fairbanks resident and spokesperson for the group Citizens for Clean Air, thinks Zeldin is wrong.

“To sacrifice human health and the environment is a recipe for destroying lifestyle,” she said in a prepared statement. “Nothing puts a damper on lifestyle like not being able to breathe, or heart problems.”

In response to follow-up questions, Lee also said the plan doesn’t have enough teeth, and that repealing the audits just weakens it further.

“It’s voluntary whether or not you change out your wood stove. It’s voluntary now whether or not you tell a buyer what the status of the home heating system is that they’re potentially going to purchase,” she said. “Everything is voluntary.”

What’s next

Though the EPA has approved the plan, Fairbanks air quality still must get in line with federal standards by the end of 2027, and Lee said she’s not convinced that’ll happen.

According to state data, the monitoring site at Hurst Road in North Pole continues to register the worst air quality in the area. PM2.5 levels there dropped significantly between 2012 and 2018, but they’ve since stayed pretty stagnant, and the levels are still roughly double federal maximums for the pollutant.

In the approved plan, the state said that 2027 reflects reaching attainment “as expeditiously as practicable.” State Division of Air Quality Director Jason Olds said by email Monday that if the Fairbanks area still has too much PM2.5 in its air at that time, the EPA would make a “finding of failure,” and the state would have to amend the plan yet again.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/488eb64/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2016x1058+0+227/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F32%2F2e%2F737362824af4aa8fc4ca3c9fa536%2Fstovepipedb.jpg,N,,2025-11-04 10:05:21.456544

The company reached a strategic partnership with Woodside Energy (WDS) under which it will invest in the 16.5 Mtpa (2.5 Bcf/d) Louisiana LNG project. WMB will acquire a 10% interest in Louisiana LNG and has committed to a 1.5 Mtpa (~200 MMcf/d) offtake obligation.

Under the deal announced Oct. 22, Williams will also acquire an 80% ownership stake and become operator of Driftwood Pipeline. The company will assume responsibility for construction of Driftwood Line 200, a 3+ Bcf/d header line extending from Lake Charles to the Gillis hub. At Gillis, Driftwood Line 200 will connect with WMB’s Transcontinental and Louisiana Energy Gateway (LEG), as well as several other pipelines. In total, WMB expects to invest $1.9B under the agreement.

The deal with Williams gives Woodside much-needed counterparty backing for Louisiana LNG. WDS in late April announced a $17.5B project FID, despite having only one customer (a 1 Mtpa sales and purchase agreement with Uniper) at the time. WDS in April sold a 40% stake in the project to Stonepeak for $5.7B.

Along with the Woodside announcement, WMB and GEP Haynesville II reached an agreement with JERA to sell 100% of their respective interests in the South Mansfield upstream assets in DeSoto Parish, LA. The properties produce more than 500 MMcf/d currently, and the deal includes a plan to develop ~200 undeveloped locations to grow production to over 1 Bcf/d. JERA is one of the largest buyers of US LNG, with a total of 5.5 Mtpa contracted between five LNG projects (see table).

This is just the latest in a string of Haynesville land grabs by Japanese companies in an effort to ensure security of supply. Last year, Tokyo Gas bought Rockcliff Energy for $2.7B, and Mitsubishi reportedly was in talks to buy Aethon Energy Management earlier this year. Mitsui has been among the companies active in the exploratory Western Haynesville, alongside Comstock Resources (CRK) and Aethon. Expand Energy (EXE) also recently committed to the emerging play, acquiring 75,000+ net acres in the region for $178MM.

All of this buzz around the Haynesville is for good reason. East Daley Analytics’ current balanced forecast in the Macro Supply & Demand Report sees nearly 4 Bcf/d of ArkLaTex production growth in 2026. While this amount of growth is ambitious based on current producer guidance, we expect a step change in gas demand from new LNG facilities and data centers will put serious upward pressure on gas prices next year. Among leading gas basins, the Haynesville has demonstrated a unique ability to respond quickly to changing fundamentals. See our upcoming Dirty Little Secrets publication for in-depth analysis of the full range of possibilities next year and beyond. – Oren Pilant Tickers: CRK, EXE, WDS, WMB.

Market Implications

The expiration of the federal tax credit has had a profound impact on EV sales across the board. Ford CEO Jim Farley suggested that the EV market share could fall to around 5% from the 10-12% recorded in September. This projection comes despite the US EV sales reaching a record 438,487 units in the third quarter, up 40.7% from the previous quarter.

Bright Spot: Hybrid Sales

While pure EV sales have taken a hit, there's a silver lining for some manufacturers. Hyundai, for instance, reported a 41% year-over-year increase in hybrid sales. This boost helped the company's total electrified sales increase by 8%, despite the 57% drop in pure EV sales.

Industry Outlook

Industry analysts described the decline as expected, given the expiration of the federal tax credit. The sudden drop in sales highlights the significant role government incentives play in driving EV adoption. As the market adjusts to this new reality, it remains to be seen how automakers will adapt their strategies to maintain growth in the EV sector.

The dramatic shift in EV sales underscores the volatility of the emerging electric vehicle market and the impact of policy changes on consumer behavior. As the industry navigates these challenges, the coming months will be crucial in determining the long-term trajectory of EV adoption in the United States.

Ana Toni, Brazil’s climate change chief and CEO of COP30, said meeting those goals would only be possible by engaging mayors.
“Now, it is an existential fight between the climate wreckers and climate defenders,” Khan said.

The summit was organized by C40, a network of mayors from big cities that has pushed to be included in decisions on how to combat global warming and adapt to its effects.

Selwyn Hart, the U.N. special adviser and assistant secretary-general for climate change, said at the opening that mayors are on the front lines of the climate crisis.

“In the midst of all the geopolitical tensions and divisions, it is truly amazing and inspirational to see what is happening in this room and on the ground in your cities,” Hart said, adding that local leaders are needed “more than ever” as the world enters the second decade of implementing the 2015 Paris Agreement.

The Paris Agreement aims to keep average global temperature from rising beyond 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees), and ideally limit it to 1.5 degrees Celsius (2.7 degrees Fahrenheit), compared to the 1850s. To do that, the agreement says nations must slash planet-warming pollution that results when coal, oil and gas are burned.

Ana Toni, Brazil’s climate change chief and CEO of COP30, said meeting those goals would only be possible by engaging mayors. “It is you, mayors, who have to make very hard decisions in daily life, together with people,” Toni said.

Criticism of Trump and administration policies

The U.S. decision to withdraw from the Paris Agreement and set back its climate goals seemed to loom large at the mayors’ summit.

London Mayor Sadiq Khan said mayors have “long been climate doers, while too many nations and states have been the climate delayers or, indeed, climate deniers.” Now, he added, the challenge has moved beyond a battle against climate denial.

“Now, it is an existential fight between the climate wreckers and climate defenders,” Khan said. “Among the wreckers is the president of the United States of America, someone who stood up at the U.N. only a matter of weeks ago and called the climate crisis a scam.”

Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego drew applause from the audience after saying she was bringing “good news from the United States” and asked fellow American city leaders to raise their hands.

“We have 50 cities from the U.S. that are here, all committed to ambitious climate action. So, while our national government goes backward, these cities go forward,” Gallego said.

Gallego addressed how extreme heat is affecting her city, which has repeatedly broken temperature records in recent years. “This year, we hit 118 degrees — nearly 48 Celsius — not once, but twice,” the mayor said.

She then introduced the city’s plan to plant trees and install shade structures, develop pilot cool-surface technology, and offer heat-relief training to first responders, such as paramedics handling heat emergencies.

Scientists say that 4 billion people, about half the world’s population, experienced at least one extra month of extreme heat because of human-caused climate change from May 2024 to May 2025.

The extreme heat caused illness, death, crop losses and strained energy and health care systems, according to the analysis from World Weather Attribution, Climate Central and the Red Cross. Yvonne Aki-Sawyerr, C40 co-chair and former mayor of Freetown, Sierra Leone’s capital, said that extreme heat stands now as the deadliest weather related disaster and contributed to an estimated 489,000 deaths each year.

“And the economic consequences are staggering. Global extreme heat is projected to cause $2.4 trillion dollars of loss productity by 2030, as it becomes too dangerous for working outdoors,” she said, mentioning businesses like construction and agriculture.

Cooling cities down

On Monday, the C40 mayors launched a global coalition to prepare cities for a hotter future through an effort called the Cool Cities Accelerator.

A coalition of 33 cities — including Austin, Texas; Boston, Buenos Aires, Argentina, Freetown, Sierra Leone, London, Nairobi, Kenya; Phoenix, Paris and Singapore — has pledged to collaborate, share best practices and report progress on emergency measures such as strengthening early warning systems and ensuring access to cooling projects.

Within five years, cities aim to improve building standards, expand urban tree cover and shade, and future-proof critical infrastructure.

The Accelerator has implementation support from ClimateWorks Foundation, Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, Z Zurich Foundation and Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs.

The Rockefeller Foundation is also contributing just under $1 million to help cities launch the effort.

Cities will report back every two years on progress toward protecting residents from heat, said Emilia Carrera, the foundation’s director of health. Key metrics will include the establishment of cooling centers, the design of cooler urban spaces and updated building codes.

“Mayors see these challenges very closely,” Carrera said. “They have a fresher perspective and an ability to respond more quickly.”

Hannah Machado, an urbanist and climate researcher in the City +2°C Program at the Center for Urban Studies at Insper Research Institute in Sao Paulo, said cities have a long way to go to adapt to the changing climate.

“Especially because the effects of extreme climate events are felt in cities,” she said.

Cities, however, have reduced emissions faster than national governments, according to the C40 group. The group’s cities said they have cut emissions five times faster than the global average.

“In this year of major geopolitical shifts, that’s an understatement, city leadership has become even more important,” said Catherine McKenna, Canada’s former climate minister who also served at the U.N. as the chair of the Net-Zero Emissions Commitments.

Several years ago, before nonprofit solar incentives existed, Mitchell worked hard to get his Reform Jewish temple in Los Angeles to install solar panels.
His solution was to create the Jewish Solar Challenge, which shortens the payback period by offering direct matching grants to Jewish nonprofits willing to install solar and implement other sustainability measures.
In the past three years, the Jewish Solar Challenge has helped synagogues, schools, Hillels and Jewish camps add $2 million worth of solar panels, preventing 1,272 metric tons of CO?
Yosef Abramowitz is Nobel Prize-nominated entrepreneur and activist and serves on the board of the Jewish Solar Challenge.","According to an annual study of U.S. nonprofits, 47% of respondents said they do not have the adequate funds to execute their programs and services in 2025 and 50% are concerned about their current financial situation. Yet many organizations overlook one of the most effective ways to cut overhead — a solution that’s literally on the roof over their heads: switching to solar power.

Aside from salaries, the cost of energy to power lights, heating, cooling and refrigeration is the highest operational expense for many synagogues, JCC’s and other Jewish nonprofits. Every dollar spent on power is a dollar that could otherwise support services and expand programming. While the upfront cost of installing solar panels may seem daunting, it pays for itself over time by reducing energy bills year after year.

And there’s no better time than now to make the switch. The Inflation Reduction Act included unprecedented federal solar incentives for nonprofits, houses of worship and schools. While those tax credits sunset at the end of the year, you shouldn’t let that stop your nonprofit from embracing what is now the cheapest form of energy available.

Several years ago, before nonprofit solar incentives existed, Mitchell worked hard to get his Reform Jewish temple in Los Angeles to install solar panels. He was surprised to find the process so challenging, but the money folks at nonprofits tend to plan in five-year cycles and it often takes five to 10 years for the energy savings generated by solar panels to offset the upfront costs.

His solution was to create the Jewish Solar Challenge, which shortens the payback period by offering direct matching grants to Jewish nonprofits willing to install solar and implement other sustainability measures. The results have been transformative, benefiting both the environment and the bottom line of the nonprofits we’ve supported.

In the past three years, the Jewish Solar Challenge has helped synagogues, schools, Hillels and Jewish camps add $2 million worth of solar panels, preventing 1,272 metric tons of CO? emissions and saving grantees nearly $500,000 in annual electricity costs. And the impact has even gone global: The installation of solar panels on one Jewish community center in Tikvah, Uganda, provided the community’s first consistent source of power for Shabbat — which the community had previously conducted in the dark.

As part of the grant application process, organizations must explain how they will advance long-term sustainability goals within their communities. Installing solar becomes a catalyst for other environmental initiatives, sparking conversations about stewardship and inspiring individuals to consider how they can reduce their own carbon footprint.

Judaism teaches its adherents to be strong stewards of the Earth, so going solar is mission-aligned. Many nonprofit donors also want their grantees to adopt more sustainable practices, but there’s also a pragmatic financial reason for all Jewish nonprofits and their funders to opt for harnessing the power of the sun: Even without federal incentives, solar power is now the cheapest form of energy, with installation costs plummeting. Today’s panels cost less than half what they did in 2010, while producing nearly twice as much energy.

Solar panels build critical financial resilience, stabilizing budgets and protecting programs as philanthropy dollars fluctuate. For funders, few investments deliver such concrete, long-term results: a one-time grant lowers costs for decades, all while multiplying impact.

The bottom line is clear: Even as incentives phase out, solar remains the most responsible energy choice – both morally and fiscally. Philanthropy has a role to play in accelerating this transition, whether by funding solar projects directly, championing sustainability among grantees or modeling the shift themselves.

Act now to capture the best deal, but if you miss this window, remember: The sun keeps shining, and solar will continue to pay dividends — for your budget, your Jewish community and the planet.

This isn’t the first time Newport has tried to turn over a new leaf.
Newport cleans up, plants trees to showcase change in the 1980s Saratoga Street, which runs through the center of Newport, is lined with trees.
“We want to plant trees [for] shade,” said Josh Tunning, a municipal specialist with Newport.
“We had a slogan back then on the shirts, ‘A new leaf for life,’ and I think the leaf has turned into a bunch of leaves,” Ferrara said.","For the second year in a row, Newport is planting a massive amount of trees. The city aims to add 1,000 to its west side by 2028 to address inequity in its tree canopy cover.

Only 10-12% of the western areas in Newport are covered by trees, compared to 24-54% in other neighborhoods, according to ReNewport, a community development nonprofit. People there also experience higher levels of heat stress, poor air quality and lower life expectancy.

The city hopes by planting more trees, more residents will have access to the benefits they provide, like shade, improved health and even increased property values.

This isn’t the first time Newport has tried to turn over a new leaf.

Newport cleans up, plants trees to showcase change in the 1980s

Saratoga Street, which runs through the center of Newport, is lined with trees. They tower over nearby houses and cast shadows that reach across the road on sunny days.

Tom Ferrara remembers four decades ago when the trees were just saplings starting to take root where abandoned railroad tracks used to be.

“I'm sitting here looking at how big that tree is,” Ferrara said. “This is some of the last trees we planted.”

He was a city commissioner in the 1980s, part of a reform government working to clean up Newport and get rid of its 'Sin City' reputation.

“What we did behind the scenes — getting rid of gambling and all that kind of stuff — nobody saw that other than the people that used to come over here and do it,” Ferrara said. “So, we wanted to show something visible.”

Then-city manager Dennis Phelan started asking businesses along Monmouth Street if they wanted to buy a tree. Most got on board.

City crews cut up concrete sidewalks and filled them with dirt. Then on weekends, Phelan, Ferrara and a host of volunteers would get in the dirt and plant the trees.

“It was amazing, especially in the spring when they started to bloom,” Ferrara said. “Green on Monmouth Street? Come on. Other than the facades of the buildings, there was no vegetation out there. It felt good.”

Ferrara estimates, in all, the city planted more than 100 trees along Monmouth, York, Second and Saratoga Streets.

Branching out

Back then, trees were mostly being planted to beautify the city. Kate McElwain lived in the Gateway neighborhood and volunteered with both city and east side neighborhood tree plantings.

“We planted the 800 block of Maple. Of course, we put all Maples on there, which was kind of a mistake because if a certain disease comes, it's going to kill all the trees on the block,” McElwain said.

So far, they're standing tall.

McElwain says in time, people began to understand the role trees could play in their city in a different way. Research on the urban heat island effect shows the concrete-filled west side can be 10 to 20 degrees hotter than the tree-lined east side.

When McEllwain moved to the west side of Newport about a decade ago and felt the heat herself, she knew something had to be done. She and a group of neighbors banded together.

“Every year we did a tree planting,” McEllwain said. “It didn't matter... even if it was five or six trees, even if it was 10 trees. Every year, we put a couple trees in the ground.”

A new tree planting effort takes root

That laid the groundwork for today. The city of Newport got behind the west side residents' tree planting movement and, in 2023, it got a major boost from the federal government: a $1 million dollar grant to plant 1,000 trees.

Cities from New Orleans to Nashville also received federal dollars through the Inflation Reduction Act for similar efforts.

“We want to plant trees [for] shade,” said Josh Tunning, a municipal specialist with Newport. “It's better for our air quality. In an urban area like this, it helps the water runoff... It helps calm traffic. But, too, it just brings some vibrancy to the neighborhood. People want to be outside more when there's trees.”

This March, the Trump administration clawed back that money. Tunning says that’s not stopping the city from planting trees.

“We could wait around and complain about things not getting done, point the finger. Or we can get to know our neighbors, build friendships, build community, and say, ‘You know what, we're just going to work together and get this done,’ ” Tunning said.

The city's moving forward with help from state grants, private donations, and volunteers who give up their Saturday mornings to dig holes and put trees in the ground, just like in the 80s.

Back on Saratoga Street, former city commissioner Ferrara admires the trees he helped plant decades ago.

“We had a slogan back then on the shirts, ‘A new leaf for life,’ and I think the leaf has turned into a bunch of leaves,” Ferrara said. “We're growing, and we're continuing to grow, continuing to improve.”

He says he's proud to have seen Newport change over the years, one tree at a time.

Because of this, forecasts for EV sales over the next several years have been cut in half compared to what they were a year ago.

The average new car purchase price in the U.S. is roughly $48,000.This is somewhat uninformative considering that there are still some new cars that cost less than $20,000 and while others are priced in six figures. Regardless, electric cars are generally perceived as being more expensive than gas-powered vehicles. This is to some extent true, although it is often difficult to make an apples-to-apples comparison. In any event, any intrinsic manufacturing cost advantages of gas cars are shrinking away.

Nonetheless, the situation has unquestionably damaged the electric car market. Manufacturers are employing various strategies to soften the blow, for example offering $7,500 credits on leases obtained through their separate leasing subsidiaries who purchased the cars before the expiration of the credit. At least 17 states offer tax credits for EV purchases, and some are increasing those credits. New York’s EV tax credit is $2,000.

Half the world’s population experiences severe water scarcity for at least part of the year, with poorer communities worst affected, threatening livelihoods, health and economic output. Industry could help address these scarcity issues by reducing their own water use and increasing energy efficiency.

Globally, the industrial sector is the second biggest user of freshwater after agriculture, accounting for just under 20% of freshwater withdrawals while simultaneously being the largest user of energy, accounting for almost 40% of the world’s total annual energy consumption.

While water and energy are often managed as separate resources in industry, adopting an integrated approach that combines energy and water management can improve energy efficiency and reduce water losses. Efficiency measures that lead to water and energy savings can lower water and energy bills, create jobs, lower emissions and reduce risks related to water scarcity. Many synergies emerge from an integrated view of energy and water management.

Water is essential for almost every aspect of supplying energy. Water is used in energy extraction and transformation for process cooling and other operational needs, and it is also used for the transportation of fuels and energy goods. On average, the global energy sector withdraws around 0.6 billion cubic metres (bcm) of freshwater for each 1 EJ of energy demand. By reducing energy use, water is saved too.

There are many inefficiencies in energy use in the industry sector. A recent analysis of the manufacturing sector in the United States, shows that just under 50% of all energy used onsite for manufacturing is lost. Globally, increased uptake of energy management and of AI-enabled savings in industry could result in 28% less energy being used to produce the same unit of value added in 2035. Considering the average volume of water needed to supply energy, this energy demand reduction would correspond to roughly 17 bcm less freshwater being withdrawn – that’s the same amount of water all municipalities in Sub-Saharan Africa used in 2020.

Globally, about 30% of freshwater is wasted due to leaks and inefficient use. This leads to more energy being used to extract, treat and transport larger volumes of water. In some countries, average losses in water supply and treatment systems reach 60%. Water users are also responsible for substantial losses. Analysis by Thames Water in the UK indicates that more than 25% of the water supplied to business customers could be lost due to leaks on premises. Some industrial sectors experience water losses as high as 50% due to leaks, outdated equipment, and inefficient practices.

Water leaks and inefficient use also lead to higher costs. Electricity costs typically account for 25–40% of a water treatment plant’s operational expense. Energy costs constitute almost 50% of the operating expenditures of desalination plants. Many industries, such as the semiconductor, pharmaceutical and food and beverage industry rely heavily on ultrapure water (UPW), which comes at an even higher energy cost for treatment (4 - 18 times more when compared to drinking water).

Combining energy and water management could help slash both energy and water losses and reduce costs. Integrated approaches, combined with better data, can provide a full assessment of costs and benefits of efficiency measures, including upstream and downstream impacts. Integrated energy and water audits, for example, could save companies time and money. Also, industry can often use water that has lower quality and is available on-site, such as process water or treated wastewater, reducing freshwater demand and saving on energy costs associated with water transportation.

There is emerging evidence that water conservation programmes can, in some cases, deliver even more energy savings than programmes that focus on energy efficiency alone. Implementation of water audits and recommended measures at industrial sites have been shown to deliver water savings in the range of 10-50% with additional savings of up to 20% in reduced costs for energy and water treatment chemicals.

A comprehensive analysis of water and energy use by the manufacturing sector in the United States indicates that investing in water efficiency is ten times more cost effective than investing in alternative water supply, and could result in water usage reduction of 60%.",https://iea.imgix.net/08b4c27b-c7ca-4236-86a4-6633fc2db551/shutterstock_2688869573_Integratedenergyandwatermanagementwillboostsavingsinindustr.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&fit=min&h=600&q=80&rect=0%2C117%2C800%2C400&w=1200,N,,2025-11-04 05:19:24.049581

Campbell Generating Plant across electricity ratepayers in the multi-state Midwest power grid, the company said in its filing.
A spokesperson for Consumers said the company is continuing to comply with federal orders and is prepared to continue operating the plant.
""Every coal plant emits massive quantities of sulfur dioxide and mercury and lead.
The U.S. Energy Department Department of Energy has said there's a risk of an electricity shortage if the coal plant shuts down.","Running a coal-fired power plant near Lake Michigan, which the Trump administration has ordered Consumers Energy to keep operating despite the company's plans to shut it down at the end of May, cost $80 million through September 30, the company said in a recent filing with federal regulators.

Consumers plans to spread the cost of operating the J.H. Campbell Generating Plant across electricity ratepayers in the multi-state Midwest power grid, the company said in its filing.

A spokesperson for Consumers said the company is continuing to comply with federal orders and is prepared to continue operating the plant. The company said it plans to file a request later this year with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to recover the costs of keeping the plant running.

Sanjay Narayan, an attorney with the Sierra Club’s Environmental Law Program, said emergency orders, like the one keeping the Campbell plant open, create a lot of uncertainty around the future because there is no long-term plan in place. “Each emergency order lasts 90 days, but it can be renewed, and the administration has already renewed it once,” he said.

“One consequence of not being able to plan is that you can’t make the best choices because you can’t reliably control what’s going to happen,” Narayan said. “And that’s going to cost people money.”

Coal: a dirty energy source

Narayan said coal is dirtier, more expensive, and less efficient than other energy sources like solar, battery, and wind power.

""Every coal plant emits massive quantities of sulfur dioxide and mercury and lead. They are among the dirtiest industrial facilities,"" and the Campbell plant is one of many aging coal plants in the country that is unable to compete economically with more modern forms of generation, Narayan said.

Bryan Smigielski, Michigan campaign organizer with the environmental group the Sierra Club, said Consumers was moving towards more advanced technologies and an evolving electricity grid, which contributed to the company's decision to close the plant, but the Trump administration had other ideas.

The U.S. Energy Department Department of Energy has said there's a risk of an electricity shortage if the coal plant shuts down. Consumers and the Michigan Public Service Commission, which regulates utilities in the state, have both said their plans account for energy demands.

Smigielski said the emergency order was also motivated by a desire to provide energy for data center development for big tech and AI companies.

In a statement, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said that “maintaining access to affordable, reliable, and secure power is always our top priority.”

The cost

Consumers has said its plan to end coal power generation, led by shutting down the Campbell power plant, was going to “save customers an estimated $600 million through 2040,” in addition to providing an array of environmental benefits.

Smigielski added that sulfur dioxide emissions from coal plants are tied to a wide range of health problems, including asthma attacks, heart disease, neurological damage, early onset dementia, and death, according to Smigielski.

“We don’t have a need for it in the community,” Smigielski said. “So all of its emissions, all of its costs … there’s not a lot of upside. It’s hard to name who’s actually winning from keeping it online.”

Smigielski added that he has received many complaints from Michigan residents. “They have said loud and clear that they do not want to pay for dirty energy generation. People that are already spending over 6% of their income on energy bills don’t have extra money to fund a coal plant we don’t need.”

Permitting the First 6 GW of an 11 GW Campus will Clear the Path for Fermi America to Build One of the Largest Clean Natural Gas Projects in the World

6 GW of Clean Energy, Enough to Power New York City, to Be Removed from Public Grid Demand, Empowering National Security While Protecting American Pocketbooks

Fermi Site is the Go-To for Companies Seeking to Protect Consumers from Rising Utility Costs, While Ensuring Low Emissions

AMARILLO, Texas, Nov. 4, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America™ (Nasdaq: FRMI) in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, announced the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality (TCEQ)'s preliminary approval of 6 GW of clean natural gas-based power generation, of the projected 11 GW campus, which will make Project Matador one of the largest clean natural gas power generation facilities in the world.

The approval — subject to a formal meeting and ongoing process for public input — places Texas at the forefront of a historic shift in how America powers the future of AI, answering President Donald Trump's call for energy and AI dominance, and Texas Governor Greg Abbott's charge to ensure national security, while not burdening consumers with higher utility prices.

Understanding that the United States faces an energy arms race for the computing power that defines global leadership in defense, data, and AI, Fermi America is building its Panhandle private grid campus in real time.

Fermi's, the federal government's, and Texas's collaborative sense of urgency is not about powering apps on smartphones, e-commerce websites, and robotics, but because America's entire infrastructure, including law enforcement, military operations, banking and finance networks, communication, transportation, education, healthcare, and energy grids, all rely on cloud computing power.

""The era of burdensome permitting processes stalling critical infrastructure is over,"" stated Texas Tech University System Board of Regents Chairman Cody Campbell. ""Project Matador aligns directly with President Donald J. Trump's Executive Orders on energy security and AI leadership. This creates an unprecedented opportunity for public and private sectors to work together to strengthen the grid, protect taxpayers, and secure America's AI future—without delay. With Governor Abbott's leadership and TCEQ's accelerated work on next-generation power and responsible, timely regulation, while ensuring low-emission projects, Texas is once again leading the way.""

Co-Founder of Fermi America and former U.S. Secretary of Energy Rick Perry, emphasized, ""Energy independence is not just an economic issue — it's a matter of national security. President Trump and Governor Abbott are men of action, and they expect the private sector to provide answers, not power points. At Fermi, we are proud to be building this campus in real time to meet the needs of the country.""

As Fermi America's clean natural gas project comes online, 6 GW of power demand will not have to be drawn from the U.S. grid — enough energy, on average, to power New York City. Instead, Fermi will utilize minimal grid power as it ramps up in the coming months, until the initial gas generators, which are already en route to the campus, are installed and online in 2026. The entire premise behind the 11 GW private HyperGrid campus being built on clean natural gas, nuclear, solar, and battery power is that the nation's grid cannot grow fast enough to keep pace with the AI race, nor should consumers be expected to foot the bill through rising utility rates to support the most successful companies in the world.

""Hardworking Americans are tired of watching electricity costs rise while the grid ages,"" added Toby Neugebauer, CEO and Co-Founder of Fermi America. ""At Fermi, our private grid model ensures that the growing demand for AI is met privately — freeing up power on the public utilities to serve homes, schools, hospitals, and small businesses as intended. Together with our partners, we're building one of the cleanest, most efficient power fleets in the world, driven by American innovation — without asking taxpayers to foot the energy bill for the world's largest, highest-margin companies.""

Fermi America plans to integrate zero emissions solar into its power supply plan and utilize the latest technology and hybrid cooling systems, ensuring protection of air quality and water conservation. Additionally, Fermi's air quality analysis shows that the project meets all federal and state air quality, odor and health effect standards, ensuring that air quality is protective of all Carson County residents.

Communities across the country have noted an increase in wildfires, heat waves and powerful hurricanes. These challenges have spurred debate among legislators, scientists and community members about how to maintain human livelihood while addressing issues such as biodiversity loss and pollution.

Origins of environmental policy in the United States

Environmental science in government policy has roots dating back to the mid-20th century. Americans began to have conversations about protecting the environment in the ’60s. Concerns about pollution, major oil spills and the Cuyahoga River’s spontaneous combustion heightened public awareness.

The Air Pollution Control Act of 1955 was the first national legislation concerning air pollution which aimed to “provide research and technical assistance relating to air pollution control.”

However, that 1955 legislation dealt only with monitoring and research. The first legislation concerning the control and regulation of air pollution did not come until the Clean Air Act of 1963, which led to the establishment of a federal program in conjunction with the U.S. Public Health Service. The 1967 Air Quality Act later placed primary responsibility for air pollution problems on state and local governments, though “the federal government could step in if the state failed to adequately act on its own.”

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency was established in December 1970, following congressional approval of a reorganization plan proposed by former President Richard Nixon. Reorganization Plan No. 3 of 1970 not only contained guidelines for the establishment of the EPA but also the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. This allowed for a more coordinated and effective response to environmental issues than previous initiatives.

One significant piece of legislation was the Clean Air Act of 1970, later amended in 1977 and 1990, which regulates air emissions from stationary and mobile sources. The act establishes a national right to safe air, preventing polluting industries from simply relocating to more rural areas.

Some of the earliest research conducted by the EPA involved studying photochemical reactions of emitted chemicals, which led to further research on the correlation between ozone concentration and health effects. Over the following decades, research confirmed a clear link between ozone levels and adverse health outcomes.

Particulate matter, or soot, was also studied — generated from vehicles, industry, wildfires and “other combustion-related sources.” This led the EPA to issue the first air quality standards for fine particulate matter, known as PM2.5, in 1997.

In response to evolving air quality standards, EPA researchers implemented Federal Reference Methods and Federal Equivalent Methods to measure air quality more accurately.

Plans and enforcement

The federal government sets national air quality standards, but state and tribal governments must enact and enforce those standards themselves. Each state can set stricter standards for emission sources than those required at the federal level.

One goal of the EPA was to set and achieve National Ambient Air Quality Standards for six principal criteria air pollutants: nitrogen oxides, sulfur oxides, particulate matter, carbon monoxide, ozone and lead. This could be achieved through state implementation plans by enforcing pollutant standards within each state.

A typical state implementation plan generally contains three main components: state-adopted control measures such as statutes and regulations; “non-regulatory” components or additional provisions required by the EPA; and plans for maintenance and enforcement. The EPA collaborates closely with state and local agencies throughout the development of these plans. Once a state implementation plan, or a portion of it, receives EPA approval, its control measures become federally enforceable.

If a state agency fails to submit an acceptable plan — or if the EPA disapproves the submission — the agency is required to establish a Federal Implementation Plan to ensure compliance with national air quality standards.

Current issues and actions

While significant improvements in air quality followed the Clean Air Act and its amendments, environmental challenges persist. In the late ’90s, transitions in climate cycles — coupled with ongoing changes in temperature, drought and snowmelt — likely contributed to conditions fueling more frequent and intense wildfires across parts of the United States.

Wildfire smoke is now one of the largest and fastest-growing sources of air pollution in the country, serving as the leading source of particulate pollution (PM2.5) in the western United States. It accounts for roughly 50–75% of annual PM2.5 emission and contains the same pollutants regulated under the Clean Air Act.

In 2007, the Supreme Court’s ruling in Massachusetts v. EPA determined that greenhouse gases are regulated under the Clean Air Act, giving the EPA authority to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases. This decision significantly expanded the agency’s authority beyond traditional air pollution to include climate change mitigation.

Following the decision, the EPA introduced several initiatives, including the Clean Power Plan, which established a national carbon dioxide emissions performance rate for power plants.

While fossil fuels will continue to be an important source for the nation’s energy, the Clean Power Plan ensures that power plants operate in a more efficient and climate-friendly manner.

The deal would cover about 10 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate battery cells a year, starting as early as 2026, generating an estimated 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion won in annual revenue for Samsung SDI.
“Securing a major client like Tesla in the fast-growing ESS market marks a significant milestone for Samsung SDI,” said Lee Ho-geun, a car engineering professor at Daeduk University.
“A long-term partnership will enhance its credibility and help expand its complete ESS solution lineup, including products such as the Samsung Battery Box in the US.” Tesla’s pivot toward Korean suppliers follows its effort to diversify away from Chinese battery maker CATL, which had supplied most of its cost-effective ESS battery cells.
Amid this expansion, Tesla’s deepening partnerships with Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution are expected to cement Korea’s position as a key supplier in energy storage.","Samsung SDI is reportedly in final talks with Tesla to supply around 3 trillion won ($2.1 billion) worth of energy storage system battery cells, signaling the US electric vehicle giant’s growing reliance on Korean battery makers amid Washington’s push to reduce dependence on Chinese supply chains.

According to industry sources and media reports Tuesday, Tesla’s ESS division executives visited Korea last week and reached near-final terms with Samsung SDI on a multiyear supply contract. The deal would cover about 10 gigawatt-hours of lithium iron phosphate battery cells a year, starting as early as 2026, generating an estimated 1 trillion to 1.5 trillion won in annual revenue for Samsung SDI.

The Korean battery maker is expected to produce the cells at its joint venture with Stellantis in Indiana, converting part of the facility’s existing EV battery lines into ESS-dedicated production for North American clients, including Tesla.

“The reported deal likely involves cell-level supply for Tesla’s Megapack assembly lines in California,” an industry source said. “Tesla is expected to integrate the cells into its own Megapack ESS products.”

Samsung SDI’s domestic rival LG Energy Solution, which signed a contract in July to supply Tesla with 20 GWh of LFP ESS battery cells annually, is reportedly negotiating to raise that volume by 50 percent to 30 GWh. If both deals proceed, the combined Korean supply of cells to Tesla could reach 40 GWh per year.

Following reports of the potential deal, Samsung SDI’s share price jumped to a 52-week high of 354,500 won early Tuesday before easing to 335,500 won, up 2.6 percent at the closing bell. The company later confirmed discussions were ongoing but said “no details have been finalized.”

Industry observers say the potential Tesla contract would give Samsung SDI a much-needed boost after recent financial headwinds. In the third quarter, the company’s revenue fell 22.5 percent on-year to 3.5 trillion won, and it swung to an operating loss of 591.3 billion won.

Unlike LG Energy Solution and SK On, which operate independent plants in the US, Samsung SDI currently relies on its joint venture with Stellantis for North American output. Reports indicate the Indiana plant’s utilization rate remains below 50 percent due to the EV market downturn.

“Securing a major client like Tesla in the fast-growing ESS market marks a significant milestone for Samsung SDI,” said Lee Ho-geun, a car engineering professor at Daeduk University. “A long-term partnership will enhance its credibility and help expand its complete ESS solution lineup, including products such as the Samsung Battery Box in the US.”

Tesla’s pivot toward Korean suppliers follows its effort to diversify away from Chinese battery maker CATL, which had supplied most of its cost-effective ESS battery cells. After the US imposed tariffs of around 60 percent on Chinese batteries, Tesla accelerated sourcing from non-Chinese partners and began limited in-house LFP cell production in Nevada.

The Nevada plant, with an annual capacity of 10 GWh, incorporates CATL’s design and equipment but will cover only a fraction of Tesla’s ESS needs. The company plans to scale total annual ESS capacity to 100 GWh within three years — meaning its current 50 GWh supply from in-house and Korean partners still meets only half that target.

“With US tariffs factored in, Korean-made LFP cells could achieve cost parity or even a price advantage over Chinese supplies,” another industry insider said.

According to Mordor Intelligence, the US ESS market’s installed capacity is projected to grow from 49.5 GW this year to 131.8 GW by 2030, representing an annual average growth rate of 21.6 percent.

Amid this expansion, Tesla’s deepening partnerships with Samsung SDI and LG Energy Solution are expected to cement Korea’s position as a key supplier in energy storage.

Assigning a proactive team to address nuclear energy communications would enable continual responses to the public throughout the licensing, siting, construction, and operation of the project, further building trust for nuclear energy advancement.
Action 4a: Scale the workforce for nuclear energy development The potential rapid expansion of advanced nuclear power could create workforce opportunities for states.
Advanced nuclear energy projects may face significant workforce challenges, particularly because of shortages in critical skilled trades and specialized expertise required for building, operating, and maintaining advanced nuclear technology.
These efforts are designed to build a robust talent pipeline and attract advanced nuclear supply chain investments, reinforcing Virginia’s role as a regional hub for nuclear innovation.63","Strategy 1: Build public trust and acceptance

Public acceptance and community support are critical aspects of nuclear energy projects. Some residents may be nervous about living near nuclear energy sites because of historical concerns surrounding safety and waste disposal.11 Rather than dismissing risk perception, addressing uncertainties proactively and communicating risks appropriately, while building public trust in regulators and organizations involved in nuclear energy development, can lead to a better understanding of the risks and merits of nuclear energy.12 State regulators, nuclear energy developers, and technical experts can help earn trust through proactive, authentic, and continuous community engagement throughout the project life cycle.

Reflecting Deloitte’s “Infrastructure for Good” approach, building public trust requires more than outreach—it demands authentic, ongoing engagement that puts people and communities at the center. As highlighted in Deloitte’s “Community Engagement for Good” framework, “putting people at the center of infrastructure decision-making” is essential. By identifying, engaging, and collaborating with local organizations early and creating joint solutions, project leaders can ensure that nuclear initiatives are designed not just for energy needs but for lasting community prosperity.

Action 1a: Identify and engage local organizations

Community organizations, environmental groups, and interested public influencers could be engaged early and visibly on substantive issues. Illinois’ Climate and Equitable Jobs Act13 requires community-benefit considerations and workforce-transition plans for the relevant areas before permits are issued. Every proposed nuclear site would convene a local stakeholder committee empowered to monitor environmental baselines and negotiate benefit packages (for example, tax stabilization, job training, air-quality monitoring). Measures such as regular town hall meetings and an online document portal—tactics used effectively by the Washington State Department of Ecology to involve residents in decisions regarding nuclear waste cleanup at the Hanford Site14—can give residents a meaningful voice and surface potential issues early, enabling developers to address issues, increasing the probability that well-designed nuclear projects proceed on time and on budget. In Kentucky, communities can self-identify as nuclear-ready communities, signaling that they have undertaken formal consultations with their citizens regarding hosting part of the nuclear supply chain and its citizens have agreed to engage industry.15 This streamlines the community engagement process, creates an initial down-selected list of viable sites for nuclear development, and starts the process from a mutually agreeable position.

Identifying and engaging local communities depends on a well-developed outreach strategy. Any project outreach can include a variety of community members in feedback solicitation and enable the accessibility of engagement meetings. As described in Deloitte’s framework for trusted communication,16 an effective outreach strategy taps into the three elements of trust: competency, humanity, and integrity. In the context of nuclear energy projects, an effective communication strategy, designed to build trust with communities, could include these key elements:

Competency: Developers and regulators can show that they fully understand all aspects of nuclear energy and how to mitigate risks in its use.

Humanity: State governments can show community members that they make decisions with genuine empathy and care for their constituents, and that they acknowledge and take into account residents’ concerns into the decision-making process.

Integrity: States and nuclear energy industry players can be transparent with local communities, providing clear insight into challenges and the development process.

Action 1b: Design feedback mechanisms to continually solicit and respond to the public

Community trust cannot be built without state representatives, legislators, regulators, energy developers, and utilities actively responding to community concerns, feedback, and desires. Mechanisms to solicit community feedback can exist throughout the nuclear energy project life cycle and result in tangible changes that community members recognize. Industry players involved in the siting and design processes of nuclear energy development can use public input gained early in the project to see that these designs and the location of sites are aligned with public values to minimize opposition to licensing processes. Community concerns can be addressed and reflected in the iterative design review process, thereby building public trust in regulators, developers, and other industry players.17 Additionally, mechanisms such as advisory boards, town halls, door-to-door campaigns, and other continual feedback mechanisms can enable these players to continually receive and respond to feedback.

Project leaders should consider being willing to dedicate the resources needed to both listen and respond to local communities, for example, with an agile, specialized team. States can create a “rapid response” team that anticipates communication needs and forms proactive plans at each step of the decision-making process. Assigning a proactive team to address nuclear energy communications would enable continual responses to the public throughout the licensing, siting, construction, and operation of the project, further building trust for nuclear energy advancement.

Strategy 2: Conduct comprehensive energy planning

Small modular reactors and advanced nuclear plants can deliver consistent, around-the-clock baseload electricity. For example, a single SMR can power approximately 300,000 homes, providing the grid stability needed to support both residential and industrial growth.18 Reliability is essential for energy-intensive sectors, such as advanced manufacturing, critical infrastructure and data centers, whose energy usage could triple by 2028.19 In these sectors, even brief power disruptions can have significant economic or social consequences. States can estimate where sufficient demand will exist to site possible nuclear energy assets and enable interconnection with the grid. By integrating advanced nuclear into their energy mix, states can help safeguard against fuel price volatility, reduce dependence on imported commodities, and enable a stable supply of electricity in the face of rising demand.

For instance, France's power supply is more reliable than many European countries due to its heavy reliance on nuclear power, which provides a stable, clean baseload, generating about 70% of its electricity with a fleet of 56 reactors.20 Thanks to its nuclear fleet, France’s electricity grid maintains a legal standard limiting supply interruptions to less than three hours per year—one of the most reliable levels in Europe.21 Nuclear energy enables consistent output, enabling France to maintain energy security and export surplus electricity, earning the country more than €3 billion per year from export activity.22

Action 2a: Perform energy strategy planning and modeling

To effectively integrate advanced nuclear technologies into their energy mix, states can develop a comprehensive energy strategy plan that aligns nuclear deployment with long-term energy goals, grid reliability needs, and decarbonization targets. This plan can begin with a holistic assessment of current and projected electricity demand, identifying high-demand regions like data centers or industrial hubs where SMRs’ consistent baseload power can provide maximum value. States can consider incorporating stakeholder input from utilities, industry, universities, and communities to prioritize energy security, and cost-effectiveness. By mapping existing infrastructure, such as transmission lines and retired generation sites, and forecasting future grid needs, the plan can pinpoint optimal advanced nuclear plants locations and integration strategies.

This strategic framework can set the stage for advanced modeling studies to demonstrate how nuclear energy can strengthen grid resilience, complement renewables, and support economic growth while minimizing risks and costs. States can leverage three key types of modeling studies to inform advanced nuclear buildout and deployment:

Strategic demand forecast modeling employs sophisticated forecasting tools to analyze future electricity demand, informing the optimal integration of nuclear energy into the grid to enable sufficient capacity, reliability, and alignment with long-term energy goals.

Economic viability and dispatch optimization modeling assesses the economic competitiveness of advanced nuclear plants by analyzing operational costs, fuel expenses, and maintenance alongside their integration with other grid-connected assets like solar and wind. This analysis optimizes dispatch strategies to minimize costs, maximize efficiency, and enable cost-effective energy delivery to consumers.

Transmission grid integration assesses the grid's physical limitations and identifies optimal locations. This analysis determines necessary transmission upgrades, enables efficient power delivery, enhances grid stability, and quantifies the impact of nuclear power on load balancing, decarbonization, and overall infrastructure needs, guiding strategic deployment decisions.

Action 2b: Guide strategic site assessment and regional collaboration

Comprehensive due diligence studies can help to evaluate the technical, economic, and environmental viability of advanced nuclear energy deployment. These studies could consider site-specific factors, such as seismic risks, water resources, and proximity to high-demand sectors, while leveraging opportunities to repurpose retired power generation sites with existing infrastructure and a skilled workforce. Rigorous cost-benefit analyses, including decarbonization impacts, operational costs, and community support, are essential for informed decision-making and expedited project timelines. Wyoming's TerraPower project in Kemmerer exemplifies the benefits of this approach. The project team evaluated factors such as local community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the ability to obtain a license from the US Nuclear Regulatory Commission, and access to existing infrastructure and the needs of the grid.23 By combining rigorous site evaluations, technology assessments, and regional cooperation, states can accelerate advanced nuclear energy deployment, minimize disruptions, and maximize economic and environmental benefits.

Action 2c: Strengthen energy security and emergency response frameworks

Nuclear power can maintain electricity supply during most extreme weather events, including hurricanes, extreme heat or cold, at times when other energy sources may experience disruptions.24 Between 2010 and 2020, lost generation due to weather-related events in the US nuclear fleet was less than 0.1%. Nuclear plants can deliver steady baseload power even when fuel supplies, supply chains, or portions of the grid are compromised, helping maintain critical services during disasters.25 Building on this strength, states can leverage tools and resources from the US Department of Energy’s Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security, and Emergency Response (CESER), and the National Association of State Energy Officials (NASEO) to prepare or strengthen energy security plans.26 These plans can incorporate the advanced tools CESER has developed in collaboration with industry and the national laboratories to address a spectrum of threats, including natural disasters like floods and earthquakes, operational incidents, and cybersecurity vulnerabilities that could have an impact on nuclear operations or grid stability. The Council of State Governments and the National Emergency Management Association can also contribute to sharing effective strategies across states, ensuring alignment with national standards like those set by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.27 For example, North Carolina developed an Energy Security Plan in alignment with CESER’s frameworks, and provided a strategic roadmap to assess energy supply risks, strengthen security, and enable rapid recovery, offering a model for states to safeguard nuclear energy deployments, and deliver reliable, affordable energy.28

With the growing digitalization of energy infrastructure, cybersecurity has become a critical pillar of emergency preparedness for nuclear deployments. Advanced nuclear plants rely on advanced control systems and grid interconnections that are vulnerable to cyber threats, including ransomware or targeted attacks on critical infrastructure. States can work with CESER’s Cybersecurity for the Operational Technology Environment program to implement robust cybersecurity standards, conduct regular threat assessments, and develop incident response protocols tailored to advanced nuclear facilities.29

In addition to providing resilient power, advanced nuclear plants incorporate safety enhancements that further reinforce emergency preparedness. Advanced nuclear designs include passive safety systems, like passive cooling, that do not require operator action or external electricity to prevent overheating, even in the most severe scenarios.30 By integrating these advanced nuclear energy innovations into emergency planning, while proactively managing physical and cyber risks, states can safeguard nuclear operations, maintain grid stability, and build lasting public trust in nuclear energy’s role as an anchor of energy security and resilience.

Strategy 3: Create regulatory structures and incentives

The technology behind small modular and other advanced reactors is progressing rapidly, creating potential economic opportunities for states. For states that plan to incorporate nuclear power into their future energy portfolio, the real test in the coming years is whether policy frameworks can keep pace. Long, sequential reviews and permitting processes, uncertain cost-recovery rules, and weak price signals can add years and billions of dollars to a project’s timeline, while every gigawatt that does reach the finish line can support thousands of well-paid, qualified jobs and sustained economic growth. Early state-level initiatives, from Illinois’s Zero Emission Credit program31 to the fast-tracked permits in Tennessee,32 Wyoming,33 and Virginia,34 illustrate how legislatures, utility commissions, and economic-development agencies can coordinate their levers to create a more favorable environment for future nuclear projects and pave the way for a markedly more profitable industry, aligned with long-term energy goals.

The following policy actions—drawn from emerging state experience—offer a practical playbook for turning nuclear ambition into investible reality:

Action 3a: Streamline permitting and regulatory processes

Long, fragmented approval timelines are one of the biggest cost drivers in nuclear development. Even after a company secures a federal license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, it often still needs separate state and local signoffs for land use, water rights, transmission interconnection, tax treatment, and environmental reviews.35 Because these processes typically run in sequence and vary from county to county, developers could finance multiyear “dead zones” with no revenue in sight, which can add hundreds of millions of dollars in interest expense and deter would-be investors. States control virtually every other permit on the critical path, so their ability to synchronize and accelerate those reviews is central to making projects viable.

A traditional reactor can spend almost a decade in preconstruction limbo. One-stop approaches in Idaho36 and Wyoming37 for mining and carbon-capture projects demonstrate that faster does not have to mean looser; there can be concurrent reviews, clear timetables and direction on the steps, and early engagement with local communities.

Action 3b: Attract investment and secure cost recovery

Securing investment for a new reactor begins well before concrete is poured and most of the bill comes due long before a single kilowatt-hour is sold. The first hurdle is therefore to de-risk the up-front phase so developers can raise the billions required to break ground; the second is to assure investors that their initial investment will be repaid while the plant is still under construction.

States are tackling the front-end challenge by pairing predictable, guaranteed minimum revenue with public-sector credit enhancements. For example, Illinois established a pioneer Zero Emission Credit (ZEC) program in 2016 to provide financial support to at-risk nuclear power plants.38 Under this program, utilities are required to purchase ZECs at a fixed price, creating a stable revenue stream for nuclear operators. This mechanism helped ensure the continued operation of the Clinton and Quad Cities nuclear plants, demonstrating how guaranteed revenue can de-risk investment and attract the necessary capital for nuclear energy projects.39 Some banks in Connecticut and New York have gone a step further, layering in subordinated loans and loan guarantees that cover roughly 15% of the total cost. By absorbing first losses, they crowd in senior lenders who may otherwise price the risk too high.40 Indiana now authorizes 40-year securitized bonds whose maturities match a reactor’s economic life,41 while the Utah Associated Municipal Power Systems consortium in the Mountain West uses take-or-pay contracts in which each of its dozens of city-owned utilities agrees to pay for its share of the plant’s output whether it ends up taking the power or not, so all participants share the risks and rewards together.42 Together, these tools could narrow or eliminate the equity gap that typically stops first-of-a-kind builds at the drawing board.

Because first-of-a-kind advanced nuclear projects lack a proven cost track record, several states have adopted conditional financial incentives to help manage project risk, while aiming to limit the effects on ratepayers. These include grants or tax credits that are contingent on qualifying activities, such as research, development, or construction, as well as cost-recovery provisions that allow utilities to recoup development expenses during the early stages of a project. For example, Virginia enacted legislation that allows utilities to recover up to 80% of their advanced nuclear development costs—such as engineering, licensing, and site permitting—on a current basis from ratepayers, providing early-stage financial certainty and helping to de-risk investment in first-of-a-kind nuclear projects.43 Similarly, Indiana enacted a tax credit equal to 20% of qualified investments made in manufacturing small modular nuclear reactors in the state and specified that tax credits can be carried forward.44 At the federal level, the Department of Energy’s Advanced Reactor Demonstration Program (ARDP) has utilized a milestone-based funding approach, releasing funds in phases as projects achieve specific technical and regulatory milestones.45 States could potentially implement similar milestone-based support mechanisms, which would encourage innovation and promote the investment of public funds in projects that demonstrate measurable progress and risk reduction.

Once the funding is in place, the focus can move to bridging the period between breaking ground and the moment the plant starts producing electricity and earning revenue. Construction-work-in-progress accounting (CWIP) enables utilities to place verified expenditures into the rate base as they occur, turning sunk costs into billable assets and preserving investment-grade credit.46 Florida employs a similar statute,47 and more than 10 other states now authorize some form of advanced-nuclear cost recovery, typically reinforced by prudency audits and performance-based true-up accounting that align shareholder returns with on-time, on-budget delivery.48

When revenue certainty, first-of-a-kind risk mitigations, subordinated public capital, long-term bonds, and balanced cost-recovery mechanisms operate in concert, they can help turn nuclear energy from a speculative gamble into a financeable infrastructure play, attracting cheaper capital, anchoring local supply chains, and accelerating the clean-energy transition.

Action 3c: Modernize market design to reward clean firm power

Most wholesale markets pay primarily for the next kilowatt-hour of energy, not for its multiple attributes, such as zero carbon, on-demand availability, and voltage support, that keep the lights on when solar production fades and gas prices spike. This focus can discourage investment in resources like advanced nuclear that, despite operating 24/7 with minimal emissions, requires long-term revenue certainty to secure financing. Because states set integrated-resource planning rules, oversee utility cost recovery, and influence regional market tariffs, they hold some of the levers to broaden compensation from the cheapest electrons now to the highest system value in the long run.

In multiple states, policy shifts are beginning to reflect that broader view. Washington State’s Clean Energy Transformation Act explicitly designates nuclear as a clean-firm asset that can satisfy utilities’ decarbonization mandates, providing a profitable compliance pathway.49 Illinois50 and New Jersey51 have extended their Zero-Emission Credit programs to prospective builds, turning avoided carbon into a predictable revenue stream rather than a retrospective subsidy. The California Public Utilities Commission is currently considering a staff proposal for technology-neutral, round-the-clock capacity solicitations that would enable nuclear to compete directly against combinations of renewables, storage, and demand response on the basis of reliability-adjusted cost.52 Industry analyses help back the economic case: Electricity markets with remuneration mechanisms such as capacity markets or contracts for difference, which recognize the contribution of nuclear energy to system reliability and resilience, are essential for supporting new nuclear investments, especially as grids incorporate higher shares of variable renewable energy.53

Action 3d: Collaborate regionally to amplify impact beyond state borders

Advanced reactors are capital-intensive assets designed to serve regional rather than strictly local demand. Stand-alone utility load forecasts and competitive market structures may not provide sufficient market signals to incentivize the development of a large nuclear reactor, especially in mid- and smaller sized markets, indicating the need for collaboration or shared investment approaches among utilities. Fragmented state rules on siting, cost recovery, and transmission planning often compound the problem by forcing every project to negotiate a unique regulatory maze. The result is chronic under-subscription: Developers struggle to line up enough credit-worthy offtakers, while states pursuing go-it-alone strategies miss out on economies of scale and may leave federal incentives on the table. Because states control zoning, resource-planning mandates, and most retail-rate design, they are uniquely positioned to convene multi-jurisdictional coalitions that pool demand, standardize criteria, and unlock shared infrastructure.

For example, the Midcontinent Independent System Operator’s study of multistate cost allocation for new transmission54 illustrates how coordinated planning can lower unit costs and shorten schedules. By agreeing on common siting parameters and synchronized procurement, member states create a single, reliable market rather than a patchwork of small bets. In April 2025, the governors of Utah, Idaho, and Wyoming signed a Memorandum of Understanding to collaborate on nuclear energy development.55 This tri-state agreement focuses on multiple topics, including aligning energy policies to support innovation and private investment, jointly navigating regulatory and environmental, and coordinating infrastructure development. A report published by the Southeast Nuclear Advisory Council shows the potential payoff for regional collaboration. In the Southeastern US region alone, the nuclear industry generates nearly $43 billion in annual economic impact, supports more than 152,000 jobs, and contributes $13.7 billion in labor income and $3.7 billion in annual tax revenues across five states. Interstate collaboration is key to achieving these outcomes, as it enables states to pool resources, harmonize workforce development initiatives, and coordinate supply chains—ensuring a steady pipeline of skilled talent and robust technical support for advanced nuclear projects.56 By working together, states can streamline regulatory processes, accelerate technology deployment, and may attract greater private investment, ultimately maximizing the economic and innovation benefits of advanced nuclear energy for the entire region.

Together, these four actions form a practical playbook that moves from siting and licensing through financing, revenue certainty and regional collaboration can help convert nuclear energy from a perceived high-risk gamble into a competitive advantage for economic development.

Strategy 4: Develop the workforce and supply chain

Advanced nuclear energy presents a significant opportunity for states to develop a new skilled and diverse workforce. The deployment of advanced nuclear energy and exploration of fusion technologies will increase the demand for talent in areas like construction, operations, manufacturing, and supply chain management. Achieving the US target to quadruple US nuclear capacity from 100 GW to 400 GW by 2050 will require a dramatic workforce expansion.57 According to the US Department of Energy, in 2024, approximately 100,000 workers supported the operation of nearly 100 GW of nuclear capacity.58 By 2050, an estimated 375,000 additional workers will be needed—100,000 for ongoing operations and 275,000 for construction and manufacturing.59 This potential surge in demand spans a wide range of skill sets, from engineers and reactor operators to welders, electricians, project managers, and supply chain specialists. States can position themselves as leaders in nuclear innovation by ensuring they have a workforce trained in advanced technologies and supported by local supply chains. By focusing on localizing the nuclear supply chain and using state-level incentives, states can meet the demand for nuclear energy while also promoting economic growth and creating career opportunities for their residents.

Action 4a: Scale the workforce for nuclear energy development

The potential rapid expansion of advanced nuclear power could create workforce opportunities for states. To realize the full potential of this sector, states can take a proactive approach to developing a robust, skilled, and varied talent pipeline—one that spans technical and nontechnical roles across construction, operations, manufacturing, engineering, and supply chain management.

Advanced nuclear energy projects may face significant workforce challenges, particularly because of shortages in critical skilled trades and specialized expertise required for building, operating, and maintaining advanced nuclear technology. To address these gaps, states can take proactive steps such as identifying and tracking constrained trades and critical skill shortages, offering financial incentives to attract and upskill workers, and establishing regional education and training programs in partnership with industry, labor unions, and educational institutions. Additionally, broadening recruitment and outreach initiatives to include non-traditional talent such as local unions, technical schools, high schools, adjacent industries, veterans, and former industry workers can be beneficial to building a robust nuclear workforce.

Action 4b: Identify and address potential workforce gaps

States can move beyond general workforce expansion and directly address specific gaps in skills and labor availability. This requires a data-driven, collaborative approach to workforce planning and development.

States could proactively:

Map current and future needs: Conduct comprehensive assessments to identify critical skill shortages and forecast future workforce requirements for advanced nuclear energy projects. Evaluate whether robust, granular data systems and tracking capabilities exist to identify workforce-related gaps. Additionally, assess whether existing workforce development institutions have the expertise and resources to address the unique labor demands of nuclear energy.

Leverage data and partnerships: Use labor market analytics and collaborate with industry, labor unions, and educational institutions to align training programs with real-time needs. Facilitate coordination among workforce development agencies, economic development authorities, and industry partners to maintain an up-to-date understanding of evolving skill requirements and respond quickly to changing market signals.

Targeted upskilling and reskilling: Develop and fund specialized training, apprenticeships, and certification programs for high-demand roles in nuclear construction, operations, and supply chain.

Expand talent pools: Launch outreach initiatives to attract workers from adjacent industries, Navy veterans with nuclear training, and local communities.

Monitor and adapt: Establish mechanisms to track progress, measure outcomes, and adjust strategies as workforce needs evolve.

Pennsylvania has leveraged its existing nuclear infrastructure to attract major private-sector investment. In partnership with Amazon, the state facilitated the development of data centers adjacent to Talen Energy’s Susquehanna nuclear facility. Amazon has committed to investing at least $20 billion in Pennsylvania to build multiple high-tech cloud computing and AI campuses, creating at least 1,250 high-paying tech jobs and thousands of construction roles, the largest private investment in Pennsylvania history.60 The initiative includes partnerships with local schools and workforce organizations for training and STEM education, while the state will invest $10 million in workforce development to support the further growth of that industry in the state.61

States can work to develop a skilled and diverse workforce for the nuclear sector through input and output economic modeling, strategic workforce development, and advising effective incentives and recruitment. By fostering collaboration and creating nuclear-specific technical education pathways and apprenticeships, states can attract the talent needed for successful nuclear energy deployment and operation.

Action 4c: Localize and lead the nuclear supply chain

Deploying advanced nuclear energy plants, as well as fusion technologies hinges on establishing robust, localized supply chains, robust inventories, and component redundancies for critical components such as reactor vessels, cooling systems, specialized valves, advanced fuels, and unique control systems. This positions states to become first-movers in a competitive global market. States can achieve this by investing strategically in nuclear manufacturing capabilities, fostering innovation through state-funded research and development grants, and creating economic zones to attract different types of manufacturers with tax incentives, infrastructure support, and streamlined permitting processes. Key actions include launching specialized training programs at community colleges and vocational schools to build a skilled manufacturing workforce, forging strong partnerships with domestic and international suppliers to enable a resilient supply network, and coordinating regional efforts to establish advanced manufacturing hubs that align supply chain strategies with national energy goals. States can also collaborate with industry stakeholders to share information and analyze supply chain vulnerabilities, with a special focus on identifying risks and gaps related to the most critical components in the nuclear value chain. This localized approach not only supports nuclear energy deployment but also drives economic diversification, generates high-skill jobs, and reduces potential reliance on foreign supply chains.

Virginia’s 2023 nuclear innovation package demonstrates the power that state-level incentives can have in driving workforce and economic development.62 By awarding competitive grants to support workforce development, research, and education, they established partnerships between the state’s universities, community colleges, and industry leaders. These efforts are designed to build a robust talent pipeline and attract advanced nuclear supply chain investments, reinforcing Virginia’s role as a regional hub for nuclear innovation.63",https://media.deloitte.com/is/image/null:1200-x-627,N,,2025-11-04 03:58:52.386659

Just a year ago, the sector seemed poised for rapid growth, with East Coast states making offshore wind a centerpiece of their clean-energy and reliability strategies. Today, that progress has been sharply interrupted.

The reversal has been swift.

The agreement provides price certainty for the project while supporting the state’s renewable energy targets and grid decarbonisation objectives.

In total, 1.1GW of renewable energy projects were selected for an LTESA.

The Stubbo Solar project will generate approximately 1,000GWh of electricity annually and features nearly one million solar PV modules across the site, which will continue to support grazing activities underneath and between the solar arrays in the form of agrivoltaics.

Readers of PV Tech will likely be aware that Acen Australia committed to recycling one million modules from the 400MW solar PV power plant last week, making Stubbo Solar the first large-scale project to earn certification from the Circular PV Alliance.

ACEN Australia managing director David Pollington hailed the project’s completion, stating that its development started “long before” the policy frameworks now shaping Australia’s renewable energy landscape were in place.

“As the market evolves, costs are rising, delivery conditions are changing rapidly, and market dynamics are shifting – these pressures are real, and they reinforce the importance of partnership between government and industry to ensure policy settings remain responsive, effective and investment-ready,” Pollington added.

Acen Australia began construction of the 400MW PV project in 2023, with the facility now amongst the largest solar projects built in Australia.

Stubbo Solar includes provision for a future 200MW/800MWh battery energy storage system (BESS), positioning the site to provide firming capacity as the electricity grid transitions to higher renewable energy penetration.

The battery component will enhance the project’s ability to provide dispatchable renewable energy during periods when solar generation is unavailable.

Emissions

China emits over 30 percent of global greenhouse gases -- an estimated 15.6 gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalent in 2024, according to the latest UN figures.

Both its total historical emissions and its emissions per capita are still below those of the United States, but are catching up fast.

Coal, a major source of pollution, accounted for nearly 60 percent of Chinese power generation last year, though massive installations of renewable energy are helping meet new electricity demand.

It is also a leader in the electric vehicle market, accounting for over 70 percent of global production. Almost half of new cars in China were electric battery-powered or plug-in hybrids in 2024, according to the International Energy Agency.

Reduction targets

In September, China announced its first numerical greenhouse gas reduction targets, pledging to slash emissions by 7-10 percent by 2035.

There is hope however that China will ""underpromise but overachieve"" as it has with some previous targets, including on renewable energy.

Beijing had previously committed to a peak in emissions by 2030 and to achieve net-zero carbon status three decades later.

Some analysts believe emissions have already peaked or are close to doing so thanks to the rising use of renewables and nuclear power.

- Renewable goals –

China's official climate roadmap this week confirmed President Xi Jinping's September target announcements.

The plan was welcomed by UN climate chief Simon Stiell as ""a significant moment in our collective climate effort.""

It includes new targets for renewables, including increasing solar and wind power capacity by six times their 2020 levels to 3,600 gigawatts (GW) by 2035.

China said earlier this year it currently has 1,482 GW of wind and solar capacity.

Reaching Beijing's new goal would require installing around 200GW of wind and solar capacity a year, far less than China added in 2024.

Though renewable energy growth could slow, analysts widely view China as likely to hit and possibly exceed its 2035 target early.

Fossil fuels, EVs

China wants to raise the share of non-fossil fuels in its total energy consumption to over 30 percent by 2035.

That too is considered an achievable and unambitious pledge given recent forecasts already project that figure will hit 36 percent in a decade.

The Chinese president also promised to ensure ""new energy vehicles"", which include electric vehicles (EVs), become the ""mainstream"" in new sales.

That is arguably already the case given EVs make up over 40 percent of new purchases.

Emissions trading, forest cover

China's new commitments include a pledge to expand its carbon emissions trading scheme to cover all high-emission sectors.

The scheme is already in the process of expanding from the power sector to cover heavy industry including cement, steel and aluminum, and officials have signalled plans to apply it to even more sectors.

Beijing's 2035 pledge also targets forest cover of 24 billion cubic metres, up from 20 billion currently, according to official figures.

This reaction eliminates carbon dioxide emissions entirely at the reduction stage, representing the most significant environmental advancement in steel production technology.
Green Hydrogen Production Requirements Near-zero emissions ironmaking demands approximately 55-65 kg of hydrogen per ton of steel produced, representing massive hydrogen consumption volumes.

Technology Roadmap Through 2050 Industry projections indicate near-zero emissions ironmaking technology could capture 35-45% of global steel production by 2050, representing a complete transformation of the industry.","The steel industry stands at the forefront of a revolutionary transformation with near-zero emissions ironmaking technology, which promises to eliminate over 95% of carbon dioxide emissions from traditional steel production. This groundbreaking approach replaces coal-dependent blast furnaces with hydrogen-powered systems, fundamentally altering how iron ore transforms into metallic iron. Furthermore, this technological shift represents a critical component of the global energy transition strategy, addressing one of the most carbon-intensive industrial processes.

The technology centres on replacing carbon-based reducing agents with hydrogen gas, fundamentally altering the chemical reactions that transform iron ore into metallic iron. This shift eliminates the primary source of CO2 emissions in steelmaking while maintaining product quality and production efficiency.

Core Technology Components

Modern near-zero emissions ironmaking relies on three interconnected technological systems working in harmony. Hydrogen-based direct reduction reactors serve as the primary processing units, where iron ore undergoes chemical transformation using hydrogen as the reducing agent. Electric smelting furnaces powered by renewable energy sources handle the final melting and refining stages.

Advanced gas recycling mechanisms capture and reprocess hydrogen throughout the system, maximising resource utilisation while minimising environmental impact. These integrated systems operate at lower temperatures than traditional blast furnaces, typically between 800-900°C, which reduces energy consumption while achieving superior environmental performance.

Environmental Impact Comparison

Production Method CO2 Emissions per Ton Primary Energy Source Water Byproduct Traditional Blast Furnace 2.1-2.3 tons CO2 Coal and coke Minimal Near-Zero Hydrogen Process 0.05-0.1 tons CO2 Renewable hydrogen Water vapour only Improvement Factor 20-45x reduction 100% fossil-free potential Zero harmful emissions

How Does Hydrogen-Based Direct Reduction Transform Iron Production?

Hydrogen direct reduction fundamentally reimagines the metallurgical processes that have defined steelmaking for centuries. Instead of carbon monoxide from coal combustion, this technology employs hydrogen gas that reacts directly with iron oxides at controlled temperatures and pressures.

The process follows the chemical equation: Fe₂O₃ + 3H₂ → 2Fe + 3H₂O, producing only water vapour as a byproduct. This reaction eliminates carbon dioxide emissions entirely at the reduction stage, representing the most significant environmental advancement in steel production technology.

Chemical Process Breakdown

The hydrogen reduction process occurs in multiple stages, each optimised for maximum efficiency. Iron ore particles are exposed to hydrogen-rich atmospheres where oxygen atoms bond with hydrogen rather than remaining with iron. The resulting metallic iron maintains the same structural properties as traditionally produced material while requiring approximately 30% less energy per ton.

Temperature control proves critical throughout the process, with precise management ensuring complete reduction while preventing unwanted side reactions. However, modern process technologies enable advanced monitoring systems that track gas composition, temperature gradients, and reaction progress in real-time.

Fluidised Bed Reactor Innovation

Revolutionary fluidised bed reactor (FBR) technology allows fine iron ore particles to react directly with hydrogen without requiring expensive pelletisation processes. This innovation reduces capital investment requirements by eliminating pelletising plants, which traditionally consume 3-5% of total steelmaking energy.

""Fluidised bed systems can process iron ore fines with particle sizes as small as 0.1mm, expanding the range of suitable raw materials and reducing preprocessing costs significantly.""

The fluidised bed design creates optimal contact between hydrogen gas and ore particles, achieving reduction rates 40-60% faster than conventional shaft furnace systems. This acceleration translates to smaller reactor footprints and reduced capital costs for new facilities.

What Role Do Electric Smelting Furnaces Play in Clean Steel Production?

Electric smelting furnaces (ESF) represent the final transformation stage in near-zero emissions steel production, where hydrogen-reduced iron undergoes melting and chemical refinement using electricity rather than fossil fuel combustion. These systems achieve temperatures exceeding 1600°C through electric arc or induction heating methods.

Renewable Energy Integration

When powered by renewable electricity sources including solar, wind, and hydroelectric generation, ESF systems achieve complete decarbonisation of the smelting stage. This integration requires sophisticated energy management systems capable of handling variable renewable power supply while maintaining consistent steel production quality.

Grid integration technologies including battery storage and demand response systems enable steel plants to operate efficiently with intermittent renewable energy sources. In addition, some facilities achieve 90% renewable energy utilisation through strategic scheduling and energy storage deployment, aligning with broader sustainability transformation initiatives across the manufacturing sector.

Operational Advantages Over Traditional Methods

Electric smelting furnaces offer several operational benefits compared to traditional blast furnace and basic oxygen furnace combinations:

Precise temperature control enabling consistent product quality

Rapid startup and shutdown capabilities supporting flexible operations

Reduced maintenance requirements due to fewer moving components

Lower emissions of particulates and sulfur compounds

Modular design allowing incremental capacity expansion

Which Companies Are Leading Near-Zero Emissions Ironmaking Development?

BHP and POSCO Strategic Partnership

The collaboration between mining giant BHP and South Korean steelmaker POSCO represents one of the most significant advances in commercial-scale near-zero emissions ironmaking technology. BHP and POSCO have partnered to advance hydrogen-based ironmaking technology, focusing on POSCO's HyREX process.

The partnership centres on POSCO's demonstration plant in Pohang, South Korea, designed to process 300,000 tonnes annually. Construction is expected to begin soon, with commissioning targeted for 2028. This facility will be the first to integrate hydrogen-based fluidised bed reactor technology with electric smelting furnaces at commercial scale.

Under their agreement, the companies will share technical expertise and conduct trials using BHP's Pilbara iron ore, providing crucial data for scaling the technology globally. BHP Chief Commercial Officer Rag Udd emphasised that this collaboration marks an important step toward decarbonising the steel industry.

Global Industry Initiatives

Major steel producers worldwide are committing substantial resources to hydrogen-based production methods. European steelmakers lead in investment commitments, driven by stringent emissions regulations and carbon pricing mechanisms. Consequently, Asian producers focus on technological development and demonstration projects, while North American companies emphasise integration with renewable energy infrastructure.

Company Technology Focus Investment Scale Timeline POSCO HyREX demonstration $300M+ facility 2028 commercial ArcelorMittal Multiple H2-DRI projects €7B transition commitment 2030 targets Thyssenkrupp Integrated hydrogen plants €2B+ development 2027 first phase Nucor Renewable-powered DRI $1.7B investment 2026 startup

What Are the Economic Implications of Near-Zero Emissions Ironmaking?

Capital Investment Requirements

Transitioning to near-zero emissions ironmaking demands substantial upfront investment, with new hydrogen-based facilities costing 25-35% more than equivalent traditional plants. However, operational cost advantages emerge through reduced raw material requirements, elimination of coking coal purchases, and potential carbon credit revenues.

The higher capital costs reflect the need for specialised equipment including hydrogen generation or storage facilities, advanced process control systems, and renewable energy infrastructure. These investments typically achieve payback periods of 8-12 years under current economic conditions.

Green Steel Premium Market

Early market development shows growing demand for verified low-carbon steel products, particularly from automotive manufacturers, construction companies, and consumer appliance producers. Premium pricing for green steel ranges from 10-20% above conventional products, depending on certification standards and market conditions.

Major automakers including BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Toyota have announced commitments to source low-carbon steel for their vehicles. For instance, construction firms developing LEED-certified buildings increasingly specify green steel to achieve sustainability targets.

Long-term Cost Competitiveness

Economic modelling suggests near-zero emissions ironmaking technology will achieve cost parity with traditional methods between 2035-2040, driven by several converging factors:

Declining renewable energy costs reducing hydrogen production expenses

Expanding carbon pricing increasing traditional steelmaking costs

Technology learning curves improving efficiency and reducing capital costs

Scale economies as production volumes increase globally

""Current green hydrogen costs of $3-5 per kilogram must decline to $1.50-2.00 per kilogram for full cost competitiveness with coal-based steelmaking.""

This year’s COP30 in Belém, Brazil, will offer an opportunity for reflection and course-correction pertaining to previous announcements and commitments.

The United States has withdrawn from multiple key climate finance and mitigation pledges since COP29, leaving major gaps in funding and progress.

Regulatory frameworks for carbon markets and methane mitigation are advancing, even as nations fall short of meeting these goals.

Each year at the United Nations (U.N.) climate change summit, formally known as the Conference of the Parties (COP) to the U.N. Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), countries from all over the world—alongside companies, non-governmental organizations, and subnational governments—convene to set new climate goals while building on past commitments to confront the climate crisis.

While the expectation is that these commitments will result in measurable action, there is no guarantee as it is challenging for countries to ultimately hold each other accountable. This year’s COP30 in Belém, Brazil, will offer an opportunity for reflection and course-correction pertaining to previous announcements and commitments. In November 2024, COP29 resulted in numerous advancements, such as the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance (NCQG) as well as the finalization of technical guidance for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which is related to carbon markets. There were also developments related to previous agreements like the Loss and Damage Fund and Global Methane Pledge. This article will summarize where these key efforts stand.

New Collective Quantified Goal on Climate Finance

After lengthy negotiations, COP29 in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded with countries agreeing on an updated climate finance commitment to support developing countries’ climate action plans. The NCQG consists of core financing of $300 billion annually through 2035 from developed countries, with an additional call for $1.3 trillion per year, primarily from private financing. The NCQG is a key part of the 2015 Paris Agreement, with Article 9 stating that “developed country parties shall provide financial resources to assist developing country parties.” COP29’s NCQG expands both quantitatively and qualitatively on the first climate finance goal of $100 billion per year, established at COP15 in 2009. The new goal specifies transparency guidelines and improved access arrangements, in addition to outlining channels for disbursement and different financial instruments that can be used. Despite the expanded financing, many countries and observers have expressed that NCQG is not ambitious enough, as it represents merely a fraction of developing countries’ climate finance needs. According to Carbon Brief, developing countries' climate finance needs are already predicted to reach $200 billion a year by 2030 even without additional efforts, indicating that the latest NCQG is inadequate to address the larger, growing need for climate funding. By some estimates, developing countries need $2.7 trillion annually by 2030 to meet their climate goals.

After COP29, negotiators, experts, and stakeholders gathered in summer 2025 at the Fourth International Conference on Financing for Development (FfD4) in Seville, Spain, to address financing challenges related to the U.N. Sustainable Development Goals. This event marked the first time the FfD process was meaningfully connected to UNFCCC decisions. The resulting document, the Seville Commitment, called for resources to support the NCQG and other UNFCCC decisions.

Meanwhile, the United States has made dramatic cuts to its climate finance portfolio since COP29. The U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID), which had historically provided about one-third of all U.S. climate finance (including $3 billion in 2023), has been shuttered. Though some of its operations have been moved to the State Department, much of them have been canceled. Due to significant budget cuts in 2025, 150 climate and clean energy contracts and grants worth $1.2 billion have been terminated. The United States also withdrew its commitment of $4 billion for the Green Climate Fund, which provides climate-related grants and loans to developing countries. These cuts directly impact the NCQG target of raising $300 billion from developed countries every year.

The U.N. Environmental Programme’s (UNEP’s) Adaptation Gap Report 2025, issued in October 2025, found that the NCQG-–which covers both mitigation and adaptation—will not be achieved unless adaptation financing is dramatically increased. The report underscores the drastic gap in adaptation funding for developing countries, noting that wealthy countries are not upholding their commitments. They promised $40 billion annually by 2025 in adaptation aid but provided only $28 billion in 2022 and $26 billion in 2023 with limited signs of a turnaround. And the $40 billion goal is in any case completely insufficient compared to the $365 billion per year in adaptation funding that developing countries need according to the United Nations. The report does highlight that countries have made progress on closing the planning and implementation gap, with 172 countries now having a national climate adaptation plan.

Ahead of COP30, the COP29 and COP30 presidencies jointly announced the Baku to Belém Roadmap to $1.3 Trillion to support NCQG implementation. In April, the Ministry of Finance of Brazil (the country presiding over COP30) identified five priority areas to support the roadmap: multilateral development bank reform, the expansion of concessional finance and climate funds, improvements to domestic capacity to attract sustainable investments, the development of innovative financial instruments for private capital mobilization, and improved regulatory frameworks for climate finance. The two presidencies issued an initial working plan in May 2025, with June updates highlighting further consultations and engagement opportunities. COP30 will facilitate further discussion on how to implement and ensure accountability and transparency of the NCQG.

Loss and Damage Fund

Stakeholders at COP29 signed key agreements to fully operationalize the Loss and Damage Fund, which was launched at COP27 to address permanent climate change harms in developing countries. At the signing ceremony, COP29 President Mukhtar Babayev declared that funding would flow in 2025. “This is an important win for vulnerable communities,” he said. “It is the result of years of work.”

In April, the U.N. Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage met in Barbados to discuss strategies to roll out funding. The workplan, named the Barbados Implementation Modalities, will provide $250 million between 2025 and 2026 to developing countries to respond to climate losses and damages, with 50% of the Fund’s capital going to small island states and the least developed countries. Participating countries have pledged around $760 million to the Fund, but have only paid $321 million so far. The United States pulled out of the board of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage in March 2025, raising doubts as to whether its pledged $17.5 million will be fulfilled. The Fund’s $760 million commitment is still well shy of the $400 billion needed to fully cover developing countries’ permanent climate costs, according to the Loss and Damage Collaboration.

Article 6 Carbon Markets

COP29 marked progress on the Paris Agreement’s Article 6 as countries agreed on international standards for a centralized carbon market, in addition to a mechanism for updating the standards. Carbon markets are trading systems through which countries may buy or sell units of permitted greenhouse gas emissions (“carbon credits”) in an effort to meet their emission reduction targets. The centralized standards agreed upon at COP29 are intended to direct resources to developing countries, save up to $250 billion per year when implementing national climate plans, and vastly accelerate climate plan implementation.

Since COP29, the European Union has proposed reintroducing international carbon credits to help meet its 2040 climate target of reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90% relative to 1990 levels. The proposal would allow the European Union to use these international credits starting in 2036 to meet up to 3% of its 2040 climate target, provided they meet ""robust and high integrity"" criteria and align with Article 6. Indonesia also announced that it will allow international trade in carbon credits to resume after its 2021 moratorium. Prior to the moratorium, Indonesia was one of the largest suppliers of carbon credits to the international market. This new decree aims to attract foreign investment and advance Indonesia’s 2060 zero-emissions climate target.

The governments in Kenya, Singapore, and the United Kingdom have also launched and expanded plans this year for their respective countries' carbon credit regulations. Looking to COP30, the three countries announced the Coalition to Grow Carbon Markets, a government-led initiative designed to boost voluntary demand for carbon credits.

Global Methane Pledge

Announced at COP26, the Global Methane Pledge aims to reduce anthropogenic methane emissions by at least 30% by 2030 from 2020 levels. The United States, Azerbaijan (the COP29 presidency), and China led a summit at COP29 on reducing global methane and non-carbon dioxide greenhouse gas emissions to make further progress toward the pledge’s goal. In 2024, 159 countries, along with the European Union, signed the pledge (however, membership alone does not signal action). According to the International Energy Agency, current methane policies and regulations are projected to reduce emissions by around 25% by 2030, falling short of the goal.

The Methane Emissions Reduction Program (MERP) has been a significant part of the U.S. commitment to the Global Methane Pledge goal, providing up to $1.36 billion to reduce U.S. methane emissions through monitoring, detection, measurement, and quantification. However, with the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (P.L.119-21), $150 million dedicated to helping companies and communities cut emissions has been rescinded, and the program’s 2024 Waste Emissions Charge for polluters has been delayed until 2034. MERP’s Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which aims to increase transparency and accountability for oil and natural gas facilities, is also being reconsidered as of October 2025.

Meanwhile, a number of other countries have announced plans to reduce their methane emissions. In 2024, the European Union announced its regulation on the reduction of methane emissions in the energy sector, which targets methane emissions from fossil fuel operations. China issued a new air pollution standard, the Coalbed Methane (Coal Mine Gas) Emission Standard, which requires coal mine operators to capture gas with an 8% or higher methane concentration and a flow rate of at least 10 cubic meters per minute. Kazakhstan has also made headway on reducing methane emissions by announcing a commitment at COP29 to develop methane regulations in the fossil fuel sector as well as upholding fines on companies violating flaring regulations. In the private sector, the U.N. Environmental Programme’s International Methane Emissions Observatory reported that over 150 energy companies—representing 42% of global oil and gas production—are improving their methane reporting.

Other notable updates

COP26 in 2021 saw the launch of the Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs), an initiative by wealthier nations to help fund clean energy transitions in coal-dependent developing nations. Since then, the program has mobilized $50 billion in pledges from the European Union, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan (among others) to be directed to energy transitions in South Africa, Indonesia, Vietnam, and Senegal. This year, the United States withdrew from JETP, leaving the remaining funder countries to fill in the gaps.

COP27’s Early Warnings for All Action Plan (EW4ALL) called for targeted investments of $3.1 billion between 2023 and 2027 to improve disaster risk knowledge, observations and forecasting, preparedness and response, and communication of early warnings for every person on Earth. EW4All National Consultative Workshops were held in The Gambia, Tanzania, Kenya, Belize, and Guyana in 2025 to advance this goal. The U.N. Development Programme announced a five-year project starting in 2025 to improve multi-hazard early warning systems for the most vulnerable communities in Antigua and Barbuda, Cambodia, Chad, Ecuador, Ethiopia, Fiji, and Somalia.

COP29 marked the first COP that included tourism in its action agenda, with talks culminating in the COP29 Declaration on Enhanced Action in Tourism signed by over 70 countries, including the United States. This declaration builds on momentum from COP26’s Glasgow Declaration on Climate Action in Tourism. On World Tourism Day in September 2025, global leaders, industry experts, and community leaders met in Malaysia at the World Tourism Conference, which was themed “Tourism and Sustainable Transformation.” The event highlighted talks about driving sustainable tourism forward.

(AP) — New Jersey Republicans are trying to ride the coattails of Donald Trump’s 2024 electoral momentum, with gubernatorial candidate Jack Ciattarelli courting voters in a key — and traditionally Democratic — stronghold that contributed to the president’s gains in the state.

Ciattarelli and Virginia candidate Winsome Earle-Sears are crisscrossing their respective states, while Trump spoke at telephone rallies with voters later Monday. This comes after their opponents, U.S. Rep. Mikie Sherrill and Abigail Spanberger, campaigned over the weekend alongside former President Barack Obama.

It’s a delicate balance for Republicans, who want to catch some of Trump’s electoral energy by drawing infrequently voting conservatives to the polls while not dismissing concerns about increasing costs. Democrats are urging voters to see the off-year election as a referendum on Trump’s economic policies and his efforts to expand his power.

Trump said Monday that Virginia voters should back “Republicans up and down the ballot” in an effort to make the state more affordable. “Republicans will bring back everything that you want,” he said at the virtual town hall alongside Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin.

Still, the president was seemingly hesitant to assert himself in the race. Despite throwing barbs at Spanberger, Trump avoided key opportunities to endorse Earle-Sears by name. The lieutenant governor did not speak during the call.

Ciattarelli paid a visit to a crowded Irish bar in Passaic County, one of the traditionally blue areas that highlighted Trump’s strength in 2024. It’s also a county where the Department of Justice is set to send poll watchers.

At the bar, a reporter pointed out the president’s absence on the campaign trail and asked Ciattarelli: Is Trump a “liability” to him? The candidate was also asked to respond to attacks from his opponent that he would not stand up to the Republican president.

“New Jerseyans know who I am. I will fiercely defend the 9 million citizens of this state every day,” Ciattarelli said.

The stop featured a surprise appearance of the candidate’s son, Army Capt. Jake Ciattarelli, who flew in from Kuwait and showed up in uniform. Defense Department regulations impose broad restrictions on troops participating in partisan activity, especially in uniform, in an effort to maintain the military’s historically apolitical role in American society.

Sherrill, the Democratic opponent, spoke in Morristown, where her first campaign for Congress in 2018 got its start. She tried to cast the contest in New Jersey in clear national terms.

“It’s going to be up to the next governor to take on the federal administration to claw back as much money as possible and have them in court if they refuse to run programs that they should be running for the people of New Jersey,” Sherrill said. She has seized on the Trump administration’s decision to abruptly freeze funding for a project on the Hudson River to replace the aging rail tunnels that connect New Jersey to New York City.

In Virginia, Democratic National Committee chair Ken Martin was knocking on doors for Spanberger and other Democrats. He said he felt confident that Democrats’ focus on affordability would pay off on Tuesday.

Martin said he felt the diverse array of candidates, from Spanberger and Sherrill to Zohran Mamdani, the party’s New York City mayoral candidate, did well because they put the economy at the forefront of their campaigns.

“People are going to vote their pocketbook issues, their kitchen table issues, their own family anxieties about their future, before any other issue they care about,” Martin told The Associated Press.",https://www.louisianafirstnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/80/2025/11/6909512d3501a1.98989418.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-04 00:58:31.684255

We were the state that put the world on wheels and powered a great American century. That legacy of leadership, building and innovation is precisely what the Michigan House of Representatives voted to reclaim last week by passing House Bills 4124-4129, a bipartisan package designed to cement Michigan’s place at the center of the Great American Nuclear Renaissance.

Nuclear energy is the essential foundation for a secure and independent energy future. It operates 24/7, keeping our hospitals running, our manufacturing lines moving and our homes heated, regardless of the weather. By paving the way for next-generation reactors, we’re ensuring our grid is robust, reliable and ready for the demands of tomorrow.

But this bill package is more than just an energy policy; it’s a comprehensive blueprint for economic leadership and job creation. We are building a complete ecosystem right here in Michigan.

Investing in our people: We are establishing higher education grants to help colleges, universities and trade schools create and expand specialized training programs in nuclear and hydrogen technologies. This ensures high school graduates have a direct, affordable path to high-paying, skilled-trade careers, keeping our best and brightest right here in Michigan.

Attracting and retaining talent: The package creates a workforce attraction and retention scholarship program, offering grants and credits to graduates who commit to working at a nuclear or hydrogen facility in Michigan for at least three years. This is a deliberate strategy to grow our technical workforce and compete with neighboring states for talent.

Incentivizing innovation: We are introducing research and development tax credits to spur the design and development of next-generation reactor technology. We’re also implementing a production tax credit to reward companies that commit to manufacturing, refining and deploying that technology in our great state. We want them to build the future of energy in a state that knows how to build things.

This successful vote in the House reflects a powerful coalition — business groups, labor unions, academics, utilities and even environmental organizations — all united behind a single, shared vision. The momentum is undeniable. With the historic restart of Palisades already underway, and this comprehensive policy framework advancing, the world is watching Michigan.

We’ve cleared the House. Now, it’s up to the Michigan Senate to act swiftly to pass this essential, bipartisan package. Let’s send this to Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's desk and show the nation that Michigan is still the state that innovates, leads and is ready to define the future of American energy.

The green transition is not a single act of redemption; it is a vast material process, and like every process it leaves marks on the world.
When green turns geopolitical The green transition is no longer just an environmental project.
The green transition is no longer a story about carbon.
The United States now treats access to nickel, cobalt and rare earths as a matter of national security.","The global transition to clean energy is often treated as an unquestioned moral good. Electric cars line up in glossy advertisements as symbols of virtue — the modern expression of a world finally learning to live within its limits. To drive electric is supposed to represent being on the right side of history.

But moral certainty can be a dangerous comfort. Decarbonising the planet is an ethical imperative, but how we pursue it matters no less than why. The green transition is not a single act of redemption; it is a vast material process, and like every process it leaves marks on the world.

The quest to save the planet from the consequences of one resource is, quietly, being fuelled by another. Let me explain what I mean.

The hidden weight of clean energy

Cars are responsible for roughly 15 per cent of global carbon emissions, and electrification is central to the effort to decarbonise transport. Yet electric cars, for all their climate promise, come with a far larger appetite for raw materials.

An electric car is, in essence, a moving assemblage of the Earth’s most precious elements. Beneath the clean surface of its design lies a complex web of extraction: nickel, cobalt, lithium, graphite — each mined from landscapes that pay their own hidden price. On average, building an electric car requires several times more raw minerals than a petrol car. And as the world races toward electrification, the demand for these materials is set to multiply many times over in the next two decades.

This points to an uncomfortable truth: the clean-energy transition is, in material terms, one of the most resource-intensive undertakings in human history. And these minerals are not evenly distributed across the planet.

In effect, the world’s decarbonisation effort depends on a handful of regions that bear the environmental and human burden of extraction — places where clean energy’s promise looks very different from its marketing. The transition that aims to reduce carbon in the atmosphere risks increasing pollution, inequality and vulnerability elsewhere.

Cobalt is largely mined in the Democratic Republic of Congo, where artisanal miners — many of them children — dig by hand in dangerous conditions, feeding a global supply chain that is often opaque. Nickel increasingly comes from Indonesia, where the high-pressure acid leaching process used to extract it generates toxic waste and large greenhouse emissions if powered by coal.

Lithium is drawn from brine fields in Chile’s Atacama Desert, where water use has sparked tension with local Indigenous communities and ecologists. Graphite, though abundant, is overwhelmingly refined in China, which has introduced new export controls, and has turned processing into a strategic chokepoint.

For many of these countries, the irony is painful. They supply the world with the minerals essential for the clean-energy transition, yet they see little of the wealth it generates.

The Democratic Republic of Congo, for instance, produces almost three-quarters of the world’s cobalt, but earns a fraction of the profits once the metal leaves its borders to be refined elsewhere. Indonesia, despite its vast nickel reserves, relies heavily on foreign investment and technology for processing — a dependence that often limits local economic returns and deepens environmental risk.

This imbalance reveals an old pattern in a new disguise. Nations rich in natural resources, yet poor in processing capacity, are forced to sell their raw materials cheaply, while wealthier economies capture the high-value stages of the supply chain.

The energy transition may be green, but it is not automatically fair. Without deliberate reforms, it risks repeating the same colonial logic: extraction in the Global South to sustain consumption in the North.

When green turns geopolitical

The green transition is no longer just an environmental project. It has become an enormous industry — and with trillions of dollars at stake, a geopolitical one. The minerals that power the clean-energy economy are now instruments of national strategy, quietly replacing oil as the currency of global influence.

The green transition is no longer a story about carbon. It’s a story about power. The United States now treats access to nickel, cobalt and rare earths as a matter of national security. China, which dominates their refining, has tightened export controls in quiet assertion of its leverage. Europe is legislating self-sufficiency. The technologies designed to stabilise the climate are now reshaping the world’s balance of power. The green race is, increasingly, a minerals race.

What began as a moral and environmental imperative has become a geopolitical chessboard. And that shift raises a deeper question: if the pursuit of a cleaner planet reproduces the same extractive patterns and rivalries that scarred the last century, have we really changed course?

Who pays the price of progress?

As demand climbs, attention is shifting from land to the ocean floor — one of the last resource frontiers we barely understand. Across the Pacific, especially in the Clarion-Clipperton Zone between Hawai‘i and Mexico, the seabed is scattered with potato-sized polymetallic nodules rich in nickel, cobalt and manganese: exactly the metals modern batteries need.

Why look offshore at all? Because nodules offer high metal concentrations without digging pits or clearing forests. But the trade-offs are different, not smaller. Collecting nodules with seabed vehicles can crush slow-growing organisms, generate sediment plumes that spread far beyond the mining track, and disturb carbon-rich layers that have been stable for millennia.

Governance is racing to catch up. The International Seabed Authority is still finalising a mining code to govern commercial extraction in areas beyond national jurisdiction. Several state-sponsored contractors and private consortia are positioning themselves to apply once rules are in place, while a number of countries and scientific bodies have called for caution or moratoria until ecological risks are better understood.

The stakes are not only environmental. Many of the likely operational areas lie within or adjacent to the interests of small Pacific Island states that depend on healthy oceans yet have limited leverage in global supply chains.

In plain terms: the same pressures that once mapped oil politics onto deserts and coastlines are beginning to map battery-metal politics onto the deep ocean.

The ethics of the green future are complex

The clean-energy transition will not be judged only by how fast it cuts emissions, but by how fairly it shares its costs. The next phase of climate policy must reckon not just with carbon, but with conscience.

We already know the mechanics: smaller cars, better recycling, cleaner supply chains. But policies that treat the planet as an engineering problem miss something deeper. The transition is also a social contract — one that links the comfort of a driver in Melbourne to the safety of a miner in Kolwezi or a fisherman in Sulawesi. The true test of climate policy is whether it narrows those moral distances or deepens them.

This will demand more than technological optimism. It will require transparency about where materials come from and under what conditions, trade agreements that value environmental standards as much as efficiency, and public subsidies that reward restraint rather than excess. A future of heavier, more luxurious electric SUVs, powered by ever-larger batteries, would be a moral paradox dressed as progress.

Governments can set rules, but markets respond to demand — and that means us. The green industry will happily sell a car whose battery contains “dirty nickel”, if consumers remain content to drive it. If we truly care about sustainability, we must also care about the unseen human and environmental costs behind it, and demand better.

That means asking harder questions before we buy, supporting companies that source responsibly, and accepting that cleaner supply chains may cost more. Real change will not come from guilt, but from insistence — insisting that the technologies of the future are built on the ethics of the present.

Ethical consumption cannot be passive, and it may not be cheap either. If we care about clean energy, we must also be prepared to say so with our wallets and votes.",https://live-production.wcms.abc-cdn.net.au/b2551142aac41a4bfedbe6b7d58895cc?impolicy=wcms_crop_resize&cropH=2250&cropW=4000&xPos=0&yPos=234&width=862&height=485&imformat=generic,N,,2025-11-04 00:01:27.611312

The Louisiana Environmental Action Network filed suit Friday against Atalco Gramercy LLC in the federal court for the Eastern District of Louisiana. The company operates the Atlantic Alumina facility that straddles the border of St. James and St. John the Baptist parishes on the west bank of the Mississippi River.

The 17-page pleading is based largely on pollution discharges state inspectors discovered during a series of visits to the facility beginning last year. The Illuminator detailed the extent of the pollution and its impact in a series of reports this year. The reports shed light on the high concentrations of toxic metals found in water and soil samples collected from the polluted areas. Much of the information was unknown to neighboring residents and local leaders.

The Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality has cited the facility for dozens of violations stemming from breaches in the levees surrounding the facility’s “red mud” waste containment lakes and numerous wastewater discharges into the river that exceeded permitted limits.

Atalco did not respond Monday to a request for comment.

The lawsuit cites many of the regulatory violations in a 606-page inspection report the Department of Environmental Quality began in September 2024 and completed in March. It also includes violations LDEQ inspectors discovered in subsequent visits to the facility in May and June.

Runoff from Atalco alumina refinery into Mississippi River raises environmental concerns

“In the aggregate, this litany of violations demonstrates that Defendant’s lack of care for the proper operation of the Facility has been reckless and with egregious disregard for the environmental and human impacts of its mismanagement,” the lawsuit states.

The Louisiana Environmental Action Network is asking the federal court to award an unspecified amount in civil penalties and legal fees and to declare Atalco’s unpermitted actions as violations of the Clean Water Act and Resource Conservation and Recovery Act. The group is also asking for an injunction to prevent further violations and require Atalco to install appropriate treatment technology at the facility.

Atalco refines bauxite, a rust-colored rock containing raw metals, at the refinery into alumina, turning it into an ultra-fine white powder. Atalco sells the alumina to metal smelters that need it to make finished aluminum.

Opened in 1958 as Kaiser Aluminum, the Gramercy facility is the only remaining bauxite refinery in the United States, making itthe nation’s only domestic source of a critical metal feedstock.

For every ton of aluminum produced from Atalco’s work, bauxite refining generates an estimated 2.5 tons of waste byproduct, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Atalco stores the waste, most of which takes the form of a thick red mud containing highly corrosive and toxic chemicals, in large containment ponds surrounded by 50-feet-high levees.

In August 2024, federal inspectors discovered breaches in some of Atalco’s levees in which the toxic slurry formed erosion channels and flowed offsite into public areas. State inspectors then discovered several more levee breaches in the subsequent months. Atalco made repairs to its levees but inspectors found new erosion channels during a follow-up visit in May.",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/5C5A8788-scaled-e1762215226969-2048x1232.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:03:50.174455

SEOUL (Reuters) -South Korea's Samsung SDI is discussing supplying ESS (Energy Storage System) batteries to Tesla in an order reported to be worth around 3 trillion won ($2.11 billion) or more. The deal, if signed, would mark the latest push by Tesla to reduce reliance on China for key parts. Tesla has signed deals with South Korean companies, Samsung Electronics and LG Energy Solution, to source chips and batteries in recent months. South Korean battery makers are also scrambling to repurpose electric vehicle battery production lines to produce energy storage systems, hit by the elimination of U.S. subsidies. Samsung SDI said during an earnings call earlier this month that it has seen a big fall in battery demand from joint venture partner Stellantis, and will convert some of its EV production lines in the U.S. state of Indiana to make ESSs. South Korean newspaper the Korea Economic Daily said on Monday that Samsung SDI had reached an agreement to supply Tesla with ESS batteries over three years. Tesla did not have an immediate comment.

The U.S. Supreme Court will hear arguments Wednesday on Trump’s unprecedented use of an emergency powers law to slap broad-based tariffs on imports from Canada and other major trading partners.

On social media Trump has called it “THE MOST IMPORTANT CASE EVER” and repeatedly claimed that the Ontario government’s anti-tariff ad campaign featuring an address by the late Ronald Reagan was an attempt to interfere with the case.

Many billions of dollars are at stake. If the administration loses in the Supreme Court, it may have to return tariffs paid by importers since the spring and will forgo a source of revenue that Trump has claimed is making America rich again.

Elizabeth Wydra, president of the Constitutional Accountability Center, a legal advocacy nonprofit in Washington, D.C., says the stakes are also high for the functioning of U.S. democracy and for the Supreme Court.

“They have so far in this second Trump administration been very much acquiescent in Trump’s power grabs,” Wydra said in an interview with CBC News. “From a separation-of-powers, constitutional standpoint, the question is huge.”

Under the U.S. Constitution, only Congress has the power to tax or tariff, unless it passes a law that gives the president that authority.

Trump used a 1977 law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act (IEEPA) to levy broad-based tariffs over a pair of what he declared to be national emergencies: the cross-border trafficking of fentanyl (for tariffs on imports from Canada, Mexico and China) and the deep trade deficits the U.S. has with dozens of countries around the world (what Trump called his “Liberation Day” tariffs).

What the case hinges on

Whether IEEPA gives the president the legal authority to impose tariffs in this way and for those reasons is the fundamental issue before the court.

The case does not test the long-established power of a president to impose tariffs sector by sector, as Trump has done with imports of steel, aluminum and automobiles, to protect specific U.S. industries.

More than 40 organizations, individuals and interest groups have submitted “friends of the court” briefs ahead of Wednesday’s hearing in an effort to sway the justices.

Nearly all of those submissions, also known as amicus briefs, urge the court to rule that Trump’s use of IEEPA is illegal.

The list of those who’ve submitted legal briefs opposing the tariffs crosses a wide range of ideology, geography and profession, including some high-profile names:

Carla Hills, the former U.S. trade representative and lead negotiator of NAFTA in the George Bush administration.

Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist, whose name is on a brief from a group of academics.

Ben Bernanke and Janet Yellen, who served as successive chairs of the Federal Reserve Board from 2006 to 2018, are among the signatories of a brief from economists.

There are also friend of the court submissions from:

A group of small businesses in Florida who say they’ve been ‘grievously harmed by the illegal tariffs.”

Another group of import-dependent small companies led by a clothing business called Princess Awesome.

The owner of a small vineyard in Oregon whose lawyers say he believes empowering the president to impose tariffs in this way would be “the most evident unconstitutional transfer of legislative authority in his lifetime.”

The National Taxpayers Union Foundation, saying the tariffs “will ultimately hurt, not help, the economy.”

The submissions by the Trump administration’s legal team paint a completely different picture.

The tariffs “are necessary to rectify America’s country-killing trade deficits and to stem the flood of fentanyl and other lethal drugs across our borders,” says the main submission to the court from Solicitor General John Sauer on behalf of the Department of Justice.

Sauer says that IEEPA empowers the president with “a broad range of tools” to address international emergencies, and tariffs should not be excluded as an option.

His predecessors have used its powers to levy sanctions on enemy regimes, to ban transactions with groups that are deemed terrorist organizations or to freeze the assets of designated transnational criminal organizations.

Wydra says neither the long-running trade deficits nor the cross-border fentanyl trafficking are actually the kind of “unusual and extraordinary” threats that give the administration the authority to impose tariffs under IEEPA.

“Even if they did, they don’t have the power to enact tariffs this big. And even if they had that authority, they don’t have the authority to enact tariffs for an indefinite period of time,” she said.

Trump said last month that he might attend the oral arguments, but ruled it out Sunday night. He told reporters on Air Force One that he does not “want to do anything to deflect the importance” of the case.",https://www.theusconstitution.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Web-Previews_facebook.png,N,,2025-11-03 20:03:58.173265

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.
CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground.
More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December.
Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.","California is halting its landmark electric bike voucher program with no announcement and millions of dollars still in the bank, and transit advocates are frustrated that the money appears to be going to a program geared toward electric cars instead.

The Electric Bicycle Incentive Program offered up to $2,000 to lower-income Californians to purchase e-bikes beginning last year. In a statement, the California Air Resources Board said only that it has redirected the funds toward another program “due to state budget constraints.”

“This is a recent outcome of legislative direction, and we have just started informing program partners,” CARB spokesperson Joe DeAnda said in an email, adding that it’s possible funding could be allocated for the program in future years.

But Kendra Ramsey, the executive director of the California Bicycle Coalition (CalBike), said she was told in mid-October that CARB would shift the program’s remaining funds to Clean Cars 4 All, a similar incentive program for electric vehicles.

While she said she felt the conversation was meant to be private, she expected it would be followed by a more formal announcement from the agency.

“That direct communication from CARB never came,” Ramsey told KQED.

According to Ramsey, about $17 million — more than half of the $30 million that’s been allocated to the e-bike program since its inception in 2022 — is set to go to the program for electric vehicles.

She said she was told that the funds were reallocated based on direction from Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office to use any available CARB funding to continue supporting electric vehicle purchases as the federal government does away with its own incentives.

The Trump administration’s controversial “Big Beautiful Bill” passed in July ended federal tax credits of up to $7,500 toward electric vehicle purchases.

“I think that’s really unfortunate that we’re responding to the current federal situation by limiting Californians’ ability to get really the cheapest and most economical, sustainable transportation option, instead of sort of doubling down and saying, ‘We have this really low-cost option that opens trips up for more people, and then we also have this other option for people who need cars,’” Ramsey said.

CARB’s e-bike program, created by a bill passed in 2022, faced difficulties getting off the ground. It wasn’t until 2024 that the agency began issuing $1,750 vouchers for a range of approved bikes to people whose annual household income fell under 300% of the federal poverty line. An additional $250 was available to applicants who met further income criteria.

The program was designed to expand access to an affordable transportation model, especially for non-drivers and people with limited mobility.

While it was heralded initially as an ambitious, and significant, step toward clean transportation, it also invited widespread criticism after a slow rollout, multiple pushed-back application timelines and two state investigations into Pedal Ahead, the nonprofit chosen to administer the vouchers.

Applicants also expressed frustration over technical issues with the application process once it got underway.

While the state’s electric vehicle incentive program has a rolling application process, the e-bike voucher program, by contrast, requires people to log onto the website at a prescribed time, click the application portal at just the right moment and enter their information under a time crunch.

“I found it a little bit surprising that the same entity would have two similar voucher programs run completely different ways … when they had an existing program that was already working, that was distributing a large amount of money as well,” Ramsey said.

More than 100,000 people flooded the application site during the first drop of 1,000 vouchers last December. A second drop in May yielded a similar interest level.

“There were a lot of challenges. I don’t think anyone will tell you different,” Ramsey said.

Still, she said, at least some of the technology and availability frustrations the program spurred were also a sign of its value.

“The program was successful in showing that if you give people the opportunity to get an e-bike in an affordable manner, that they will take that opportunity and they will use e-bikes,” Ramsey told KQED.

Future drops were expected incrementally as long as funding was available. DeAnda said a third application round had been planned for next year before funds were redirected.

Ramsey estimated that money could have funded around 4,000 more vouchers.

“Such a popular program shouldn’t be ended,” said Christopher White, the executive director of the San Francisco Bicycle Coalition. “It should be operated well and fully funded because it promises to transform the mobility habits of tens of thousands of Californians to be more sustainable, far safer, [and it’s] far less expensive for the individuals to operate their new vehicles.

Like many transit advocate groups, he said he only found out about the shift in program funds from CalBike.

“It definitely gives the sense that CARB knows that this is the wrong direction to be moving in, to keep it so quiet,” he said.",https://cdn.kqed.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/10/2025/04/240823-ValenciaTelegraphBikeLanes-33-BL_qed-1020x680.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 19:18:04.470596

If you keep doing it anyway, the only way to make use of your extra solar power is to add batteries, which add costs.
And the administration should drop its fossil-fuel identity politics and let the private sector keep building wind and solar facilities.","AMERICAN energy policy is currently locked in a fierce battle between people who say renewables will make electricity less expensive and people who say they won’t.

You’d think there would be a reasonably clear answer to this question, but this a case where both sides have it wrong.

Environmentalists, citing the falling costs of wind turbines and photovoltaic panels, tend to agree with Bill McKibben that “power from the sun and wind is now the cheapest power in the world.”

Meanwhile, Energy Secretary Chris Wright says that renewables “raise the system cost of electricity” because they are only intermittently available, and President Donald Trump’s administration is doing everything in its power to block their deployment.

In fact, the best answer to the question of how renewables affect retail electricity prices is unsatisfying: It depends.

As a new report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory makes clear, the extremely varied geography of the United States means that the cost per megawatt of generation is extremely variable.

In addition, the economic value of a given increment of renewable energy depends on what else is going on.

The adminstration’s argument that wind and solar power are essentially useless because they’re not dispatchable on demand is wrong.

For starters, batteries – which turn any source of electricity into a dispatchable one – are getting better all the time.

But beyond that, non-dispatchable power is useful because it complements other sources of power.

A renewables-heavy electricity grid might function better, for example, with gas-fired plants that ramp up and down according to how hard the wind is blowing.

The presence of wind turbines would still dramatically reduce gas consumption and therefore generation costs.

At the same time, environmentalists like to use metrics like the “levelised cost of energy,” which make renewables look cheaper than they really are.

It’s fine to look at how many megawatts a given solar array generates over the course of a year and calculate that this adds up to a low cost per megawatt.

But you still have to consider the cost of keeping the system up and running when the sun isn’t shining.

Value deflation

The big problem here is the concept of “value deflation.” When you start adding renewables to a previous all-fossil grid, they are extremely valuable.

You can use every electron your new solar panels generate, and save money by burning less coal, oil and gas.

As you add more, the price of daytime electricity falls. But that means that adding even more solar panels becomes less attractive.

If you keep doing it anyway, the only way to make use of your extra solar power is to add batteries, which add costs.

And while gently ramping your fossil fuel usage up and down to save fuel during times of high renewable generation is cost-effective, at a certain point you find yourself bearing high costs to maintain extensive amounts of backup infrastructure.

This is where a critical distinction drawn by the Lawrence report comes in.

In many states, mostly red ones like South Dakota and Texas, there are no policies in place to encourage renewable adoption, but the falling cost of wind and solar infrastructure has led to large investments that have lowered costs.

But other states, mostly blue ones, have adopted “renewable portfolio standard” policies designed to force utilities to increase their reliance on renewables regardless of whether it makes economic sense.

These policies raise costs.

It’s an awkward quirk of political fate that most of the states with the best geographic fundamentals for wind and solar growth happen to be politically conservative states on the Great Plains.

Conversely, the Northeast is politically progressive but not especially windy or sunny.

What’s more, renewables take up a lot of space, and northeastern voters tend to be reluctant to cut down forests or take up green space to build utility-scale renewable projects.

Misguided policies

The result is some very misguided policies, such as Maine’s now-eliminated programe to subsidise rooftop solar generation.

Because roofs are small and rooftop solar installations are labour-intensive, they are not very cost-effective compared to larger renewable projects.

Maine is also just not a very good place for solar power, as it’s not very sunny and is so far north that there is huge seasonal variation in the hours of daylight.

But geography isn’t everything. California has plenty of sunshine, and a non-coerced market would lead to plenty of renewable use.

But that wasn’t good enough for California policymakers, who’ve insisted on pushing the envelope on regulatory mandates, which have contributed to rising costs.

On some level, this debate is both unsurprising and inevitable.

Renewables emit less pollution than oil and gas, so environmentalists are willing to pay some economic cost to accelerate their adoption.

This is a tough sell for voters, though, so proponents of renewable energy are left with two discordant arguments: On the one hand, they say, renewables will reduce costs. On the other, they say that they are worth adopting even when they aren’t cost-effective.

None of this, however, comes close to justifying the Trump administration’s anti-renewable zeal.

In many places that neither mandate nor discourage renewable growth, renewables are growing rapidly in ways that reduce costs.

The price of batteries is steadily falling, meaning the amount of renewables the grid can efficiently absorb is growing. What’s more, electricity demand is now rising after a generation of stagnation, which means concerns about value deflation are much less pressing.

Environmentalists should admit that their preferred agenda of maximum feasible decarbonisation costs money compared to just letting markets and technology work.

And the administration should drop its fossil-fuel identity politics and let the private sector keep building wind and solar facilities. — Bloomberg

The assumption that the energy transition will mean a simple, linear decline in fossil fuel use is misleading.
Africa, for example, holds 60% of the world’s best solar potential yet receives less than 2% of global clean energy investment.","The global energy transition is often framed as a balancing act between climate commitments on one hand, and sufficient energy and economic security on the other. That framing assumes the transition will mean less: less energy, less growth, and a steady decline in fossil fuel use. But this rhetoric is, as Ambassador Anthony Agotha put it at last week’s Berlin Climate Security Conference, a “false choice.”

The reality is far more complex — and far more uneven across countries and regions. The question isn’t whether the transition will happen, but whether it will happen everywhere, in time, and in ways that foster stability and economic opportunity.

Building Partnerships to Unlock Economic Opportunities

For many low- and middle-income countries, the challenge isn’t a lack of climate ambition — it’s a lack of energy access. Globally, there are about 750 million people who still lack steady and reliable electricity.

Nowhere is this more evident than in sub-Saharan Africa, where about half of the population — an estimated 600 million people — lack access to electricity. Now, consider the pace of growing demand in the region, whose population is projected to nearly double by 2050, from 1.3 billion to 2.1 billion. In Somalia, for example, where only 50% of the population currently has access to electricity (just 24% in rural areas), the population is expected to double from 19.7 to 38 million people over the same period.

For many low-income countries, the “energy transition” is not about decarbonization — it’s about unlocking enduring economic development opportunities by providing power to homes, businesses, schools, and hospitals. But expanding energy infrastructure while lowering emissions will require financial, technological, and political partnerships that prioritize energy access by de-risking investment and localizing clean energy technologies and jobs. Without partnerships that provide an on-ramp for countries to simultaneously grow their economies and expand access, the global transition will stall.

Flipping the Narrative on Decline

Discussions of climate ambition are often framed as being in tension with energy and economic security. But fossil fuel dependence — with its price volatility, supply disruptions, and concentrated control — is rarely the picture of stability.

The question is not whether countries can balance climate ambition with energy security — it’s whether they can afford not to. Done right (recognizing that there is a lot packed into those two small words), the energy transition can be a pathway to stronger economies, more stable societies, and more secure futures.

The economics of clean energy are shifting fast. In 2024, renewables met 83% of global increases in electricity demand, according to Ember, with solar generation up 33% and wind up 7%. Yet the benefits are not evenly distributed. China and India were largely responsible for those increases. The International Energy Agency reports that only 15% of global clean energy investment — about $2 trillion annually — has gone to the Global South (excluding China). Meeting global targets will require that share to rise five- to seven-fold by 2030, reaching $1.7 trillion per year.

Meanwhile, the economic toll of climate inaction is already staggering. Between 2014 and 2024, nearly 4,000 extreme weather events affected 1.6 billion people and cost the global economy an estimated $2 trillion. In just the past two years, global economic damages reached $451 billion — a 19% increase over the previous eight years. In some countries, a single disaster can erase more than a year of GDP.

Last year, in the United States alone, 27 weather and climate disasters led to the deaths of 568 people and cost more than $1 billion in damages, collectively totaling $182.7 billion — about 20% of the Department of Defense’s budget for that year.

In fragile and conflict-affected states, the consequences are even more devastating. In 2023, torrential rains from Storm Daniel — made 50% worse by climate change, according to research — caused two dams to burst in Libya, killing nearly 6,000 people. Years of underinvestment in water infrastructure and near-total dependence on oil exports left Libya’s economy both highly exposed and poorly equipped to adapt.

The assumption that the energy transition will mean a simple, linear decline in fossil fuel use is misleading. Global energy demand continues to rise, but again, the drivers of that demand vary widely. In industrialized countries, AI is driving an increase in power-hungry data centers. But for poorer countries — those least responsible for climate change — energy access remains essential to development and industrialization. For many of those countries, fossil fuels are a necessary part of the equation. The question, then, is not if they are used, but how — with what technologies, under what rules, and with what accountability. Framing the transition exclusively around fossil fuel decline risks alienating the very countries that must be part of it. A better narrative is one centered on diversification, modernization, and energy security — not scarcity.

Pathway Dependency

The success of the global transition depends on what the largest economies (and largest greenhouse gas emitters) do — and how consistently they do it. Last April, acting assistant secretary of international affairs at the U.S. Energy Department, Tommy Joyce, said that net-zero policies put the US at a disadvantage compared to China. “…There are no wind turbines without concessions to or coercion from China,” he said.

China’s control over critical minerals and clean energy supply chains gives it enormous leverage, but it didn’t get there on its own. China’s accelerated economic growth presented an existential challenge to global ambitions to rein in global warming. The first decade of the 2000s was marked by significant cooperation between the U.S. and China, including a US-China Clean Energy Research Center. But while China adopted large-scale, industrial policies to solidify its leadership on renewable energy and elevate its role on the global stage, policy vacillations and inconsistencies in the U.S. have created structural disadvantages that hobble U.S. innovation, industry, and market access.

And while climate ambition has grown since the 2015 Paris Agreement, global emissions have not yet begun to decline. Much of the growth comes from emerging economies that still lack the means to transition quickly. Africa, for example, holds 60% of the world’s best solar potential yet receives less than 2% of global clean energy investment.

In its wake, investment in the U.S. electric vehicle industry accelerated. But in 2025, President Donald Trump’s so-called One Big Beautiful Bill Act eliminated most of the incentives, and U.S. investment collapsed.

Hitting the brakes on electric vehicles will clearly mean less progress in reducing transportation emissions and less strategic U.S. leadership in a key technology of the future. But in a new study, my colleagues at Carnegie Mellon University and I find that fewer electric vehicles will also mean less investment to clean up the electricity sector.

How We Got Here

U.S. electric vehicle adoption lags behind the rest of the world—especially China, which has invested heavily and strategically to dominate electric vehicle markets and supply chains and to leapfrog the historical dominance of American, European and Japanese manufacturers of vehicles powered by internal combustion engines.

Electric vehicles are much simpler to engineer, and this opened a window for China to bet big on EVs with investment, incentives and experimentation. As battery prices dropped dramatically, electric cars became real competition for gasoline cars—especially for the massive Chinese market, where buyers don’t have strong prior preferences for gasoline. China now dominates the supply chain for battery materials, such as lithium, nickel, cobalt and manganese, as well as the rare earth minerals used in electric motors.

In 2022, the U.S. took action to change this trend when Congress passed the Inflation Reduction Act. The law encouraged EV adoption by lowering costs to manufacturers and consumers. But it also encouraged automakers to find ways to build EVs without Chinese materials by making the largest incentives conditional on avoiding China entirely.

After the law passed, investment soared across hundreds of new battery manufacturing and material processing facilities in the U.S.

But in 2025, Congress passed and Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated most of the incentives. U.S. investment in EV-related production has collapsed.

Electric Vehicles Are Cleaner

As a scholar of electric vehicle technology, economics, environment and policy, I have conducted numerous peer-reviewed scientific studies characterizing benefits and costs of electric vehicles over their life cycle, from production through use and end of life. When charged with clean electricity, electric vehicles are one of the few technologies in existence that can provide transportation with near-zero emissions.

With today’s electricity grid, EV emissions can vary, depending on the mix of electricity generators used in the region where they are charged, driving conditions such as weather or traffic, the specific vehicles being compared, and even the timing of charging. But EVs are generally better for the climate over their life cycle today than most gasoline vehicles, even if the most efficient gas-electric hybrids are still cleaner in some locations. EVs become cleaner as the electricity grid becomes cleaner, and, importantly, it turns out that EVs can even help make the electricity grid cleaner.

This matters because transportation and electricity together make up the majority of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions, and the passenger cars and light trucks that we all drive produce the majority of our transportation emissions.

In its efforts to prevent the government from regulating greenhouse gas emissions, the Trump administration is now claiming that emissions from cars and trucks are “not meaningful” contributors to climate change. But in reality, a technology that cleans up both transportation and electricity at the same time is a big deal.

An Opportunity for Cleaner Electricity

Our research has found that turning away from electric vehicles does more than miss a chance to curb transportation emissions—it also misses an opportunity to make the nation’s electricity supply cleaner.

In our paper, my co-authors Lily Hanig, Corey Harper and Destenie Nock and I looked at potential scenarios for electric vehicle adoption across the U.S. from now until 2050. We considered situations ranging from cases with no government policies supporting electric vehicles to cases with enough electric vehicle adoption to be on track with road maps targeting overall net-zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.

In each of these scenarios, we calculated how the nation’s power grid and electricity generators would respond to electric vehicle charging load.

We found that when there are more electric vehicles charging, more power plants would need to be built—and because of cost competitiveness, most of those new power plants would be solar, wind, battery storage and natural gas plants, depending on the region.

Once wind and solar plants are built, they are cheaper to operate than fossil fuel plants, because utilities don’t need to buy more fuel to burn to make more electricity. That cost advantage means wind and solar energy gets used first, so it can displace fossil-fuel generation even when EVs aren’t charging.

A Virtuous—or Vicious—Cycle

Our analysis reveals that what’s good for climate in the transportation sector—eliminating emissions from vehicle tailpipes—is also good for climate in the power sector, supporting more investment in clean power and displacing more fossil fuel-powered generation.

As a result, encouraging electric vehicle adoption is even better for the climate than many people expected because EV charging can actually cause lower-emitting power plants to be built.

Gasoline vehicles can’t last forever. The cheap oil will eventually run out. And EV batteries have gotten so cheap, with ranges now comparable to gas cars, that the global transition is already well underway. Even in the U.S., consumers are adopting more EVs as the technology improves and offers consumers more for less. The U.S. government can’t single-handedly stop this transition—it can only decide how much to lead, lag or resist. Rolling back electric vehicle incentives now means higher emissions, less clean energy investment and weaker U.S. competitiveness in a crucial industry of the future.

Our findings show that slowing electric vehicle adoption doesn’t just affect emissions from transportation. It also misses opportunities to help build a cleaner power sector, potentially locking the U.S. into higher emissions from its top two highest-emitting sectors—power generation and transportation—while the window to avoid the worst effects of climate change is closing.

John Ketchum, NextEra chairman, president and CEO, said that the company expects to return the 615-MW Duane Arnold nuclear power plant in Iowa to service by early 2029 or possibly in the fourth quarter of 2028 — earlier than some analysts had expected.

On Oct. 27, the company announced it had signed a 25-year power purchase agreement with Google to reopen the plant, which stopped operating in 2020. The deal is still subject to regulatory approval.

In addition to reopening Duane Arnold, a second deal with Google will enable the companies to explore building new, advanced nuclear generation in the U.S., Ketchum said. The company continues to speak with other large tech companies and data center operators about potential deals, he added.

NextEra could also “optimize” its 1,185-MW Point Beach nuclear plant in Wisconsin and its 1,250-MW Seabrook nuclear plant in New Hampshire, according to Ketchum.

Those plants and Duane Arnold could accommodate about 6 GW of small modular reactors, he said.

Renewables and storage backlog grows

NextEra is well positioned to serve hyperscale tech companies who may be required to bring their own generation if they want to interconnect to the grid, Ketchum said. It can attract customers initially with the rapid deployment of renewable resources and energy storage — the company signed contracts for 1.9 GW of battery storage in the third quarter — and follow up later with gas generation, Ketchum said. The company also has the ability to build transmission and new natural gas lines to serve data center campuses, he said.

At the same time, NextEra plans to renegotiate a growing number of power purchase agreements on existing assets for higher prices as those contracts begin to expire, Ketchum said.

“Returns have [never] been higher than I’ve ever seen them in this industry,” he said. “It’s just supply and demand. It’s that simple. There’s a lot of demand out there, and there’s just not as much supply to match it. And so that’s commanding premiums in the market and high and attractive returns.”

Its NextEra Energy Resources, or NEER, subsidiary added 3 GW of renewables and storage to its project backlog in the third quarter, including 1.9 GW of battery storage, 800 MW of solar and 300 MW of repowering existing projects, the company said.

The additions brought the company’s total backlog of renewables to 29.6 GW, net 1.7 GW of projects that were placed into service and 900 MW that were removed from the queue due to permitting and other delays.

Ketchum said he expects all or most of the delayed 900 MW to return to the backlog at a later date.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/6rVR7glnFAZJf9g0kadNiQzGXjppdVlq6Rki6_6pqQs/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9IQ0VfQnJvbmNvUGxhaW5zSUktMi5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-03 18:19:02.908902

(AP) — A multi-state carbon capture pipeline began operating in September, reducing emissions from Midwest ethanol plants and carrying that carbon dioxide gas to be forever buried underground in Wyoming — an achievement after years of complaints, lawsuits and legislation blocked similar efforts by other companies.

Other projects prompted intense opposition, including one that has run up $1 billion in spending with no guarantee of success, but the Tallgrass Trailblazer Pipeline is being praised. The reason: community negotiations and financial support.

“I wish all energy companies would treat communities with a lot more respect like Tallgrass did,” said Jane Kleeb, whose group Bold Nebraska has fought other carbon capture and oil pipelines.

Carbon capture pipelines

The Tallgrass pipeline has started moving emissions from 11 ethanol plants in Nebraska and one in Iowa to a site in southeast Wyoming, where the greenhouse gas will be buried 9,000 feet underground.

The fermentation process to convert corn into fuel releases carbon dioxide. By capturing it before it’s released into the air, plants can lower their carbon intensity score, making the ethanol more attractive for refinement into so-called sustainable aviation fuel — a market some believe could climb to 50 billion gallons annually. The Midwest-based ethanol industry sees jet fuel as essential to its future, offsetting expected declines in demand for motor vehicle fuel as more drivers switch to electric vehicles.

The federal government encourages carbon capture through lucrative tax credits to pipeline operators. The Biden administration wanted to encourage a practice that could reduce greenhouse gas emissions and the Trump administration has let the credits continue.

“If an ethanol plant captures the carbon, it lowers their carbon index and they become a low-carbon fuel, and there’s a premium for that,” said Tom Buis, CEO of the American Carbon Alliance, a trade group. “And they can also produce sustainable aviation fuel out of it. Sustainable aviation fuel is a huge, gigantic market just waiting for someone to step forward and take it.”

Routing a pipeline isn’t easy

At least three other companies have proposed carbon capture pipelines in the Midwest, but aside from Tallgrass, only Iowa-based Summit Carbon Solutions is persisting — and it hasn’t been easy.

Summit has proposed a multibillion-dollar, five-state pipeline network encompassing dozens of ethanol plants, thousands of miles and underground storage in North Dakota.

Despite strong support from agricultural groups and the ethanol industry, Summit has dealt with persistent opponents who don’t want their land taken for the pipeline and fear a hazardous pipe rupture. Landowners sued to block the pipeline and sought help from legislators. South Dakota’s legislature banned the use of eminent domain for such lines.

In response Summit has asked Iowa regulators to amend its permit so the company retains an option for a route that would avoid South Dakota.

“Our focus remains on supporting as many ethanol partners as possible and building a strong foundation that helps farmers, ethanol plants, and rural communities access the markets they’ll depend on for decades to come,” Summit said in a statement.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency oversees a rigorous process for underground carbon dioxide injection, involving permits for construction and injection and regulations to protect underground sources of drinking water, Carbon Capture Coalition Executive Director Jessie Stolark said. Typically, porous rock formations similar to a sponge will store or trap the carbon dioxide more than a mile underground, she said.

How did Tallgrass do it?

Tallgrass had one big advantage at the starting point — it converted an existing natural gas line. The natural gas was put on a different pipeline as Trailblazer was retrofitted. The company built branches off the 400-mile mainline to connect to ethanol plants.

But Tallgrass also took pains to engage with communities along its route.

The company worked with people to get its project done “instead of trying to push it down our throat,” said Lee Hogan, chairman of the Adams County commission in Nebraska, whose home is a half-mile from the pipeline.

It helped that Tallgrass worked with Bold Nebraska, a citizens group, to create a community investment fund that will make annual payments to organizations related to early childhood development, Medicaid-eligible senior care and food pantries.

Tallgrass will make an initial $500,000 contribution followed by annual payments based on 10 cents per metric ton of carbon dioxide sent through the pipeline. The Nebraska Community Foundation, which will manage the fund, expects more than $7 million will be given out through 2035 across 31 counties in four states.

It’s a unique arrangement, and a possible template for future projects, said Nebraska Community Foundation leader Jeff Yost.

“I’m just really impressed that folks that could have just approached this purely as opponents have come together to find a really productive middle ground,” Yost said.

Tallgrass spokesman Steven Davidson said the investment fund is just one piece of the company’s agreement with Bold, which he said emphasizes being cooperative and transparent, such as when surveying land and valuing easements.

Lessons from Tallgrass

While lauding Tallgrass’ cooperative approach, Jack Andreasen Cavanaugh, who studies energy policy at Columbia University, said it may be hard to replicate the experience since few if any natural gas pipelines will be available for retrofitting, given increases in supply and demand for natural gas domestically and abroad. Tallgrass’ line crosses his family’s land in Nebraska.

Still, companies can do better to engage and negotiate with communities, and that includes spending money, he said.

Kyle Quackenbush, a Tallgrass vice president, said his advice to other pipeline companies is to listen.

“I think the biggest advice we would have for people is to take those concerns seriously,” he said, “and figure out what it takes to be able to help people get comfortable and understand that this infrastructure is a benefit for their community and not something that they need to be afraid of.”",https://media-cdn.socastsrm.com/wordpress/wp-content/blogs.dir/2431/files/2025/01/carbon-capture-pipelines-generic.png,N,,2025-11-03 22:17:18.079838

Schneider Electric Canada is implementing a strategy to promote low-carbon fuels through technological partnerships with domestic industries. The company is leveraging its experience in Denmark, where its automated solutions power the world’s first commercial e-methanol facility, to demonstrate the industrial viability of this model in Canada.

A proven model for new alliances

The Kassø facility in Denmark produces up to 42,000 tonnes of e-methanol annually using renewable electricity from a 304-megawatt solar park and captured biogenic carbon dioxide. The industrial site is fully automated with Schneider Electric technologies and operates through an integrated digital platform combining energy management, automation, and industrial software.

Based on this experience, Schneider Electric Canada aims to expand the approach through partnerships with energy producers, industrial operators, and technology suppliers across Canada. The objective is to support these players in transitioning to low-emission operations while securing energy and operational performance.

Technologies supporting joint projects

The company highlights a suite of technologies including Modicon M580 programmable logic controllers, Altivar Process low-voltage drives, and Trihal dry-type transformers. These solutions are interconnected via the AVEVA System platform, enabling centralised facility management and real-time resource optimisation.

This system allows for the creation of Unified Operations Centres (UOC), capable of coordinating multiple industrial sites with remote control and enhanced energy performance. These tools support the deployment of joint projects, notably in refining, chemicals, or heavy transport.

The Canadian market as a deployment ground

Schneider Electric considers Canada’s renewable resources, national technical expertise, and supportive regulatory environment as favourable conditions for developing alternative fuels such as e-methanol. The company is engaging in discussions with several potential partners to replicate the Danish model within Canada.

Schneider Electric’s leadership asserts that these partnerships are essential to accelerating the energy transition of industries while strengthening the competitiveness of the industrial base. By structuring a joint offer based on automation, digitisation, and energy management, the company aims to build a long-term collaboration ecosystem around clean fuels.

Literally burning that money.” — Michelle Solomon, Energy Innovation Last week’s funding announcement advances Trump’s commitment to restore U.S. energy dominance, the official press release read.
The decline of coal energy is due to rising coal prices and the proven cost-effectiveness of alternative energy sources, including solar, wind and natural gas, said Solomon.
“Their pro fossil fuel agenda is intent on keeping deadly and expensive coal plants alive while Americans foot the bill and suffer the public health damage,” Drupp added.
But the reliability of coal plants may be overstated.","The U.S. Department of Energy has announced up to $100 million in federal funding for projects modernizing the nation’s remaining coal plants, nearly half of which were slated to close by 2030.

The investment, a fraction of what would be needed for a comprehensive upgrade, is unlikely to make coal power more affordable, energy experts and anti-coal advocates say.

On Friday, U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright issued the Notice of Funding Opportunity, calling for applications to design, implement, or test refurbishments and retrofit systems that allow coal plants to “operate more efficiently, reliably, and affordably.”

The announcement outlined three key areas for development projects: advanced wastewater management systems, systems that enable plants to switch between coal and natural gas, and advanced “co-firing” systems that allow simultaneous combustion of both fuel types.

The funding comes just a month after the department announced $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate” America’s coal industry.

That investment already included $350 million to recommission closed coal power plants or modernize plants and $100 million for the three development areas outlined in Friday’s announcement. The DOE did not respond to questions about why additional funds were announced just a month later.

Trump’s investments in coal are a drop in the bucket of what would realistically be needed to revamp the plants, said Michelle Solomon, a manager in the electricity program at Energy Innovation, a nonpartisan energy and climate policy research firm based in San Francisco.

“Those types of retrofits for a single plant can cost hundreds of millions of dollars,” said Solomon. “To do that for every plant in the coal fleet, you’re looking at billions of dollars. And you’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”

In April, following Trump’s “Beautiful Clean Coal” executive order, the Department of Energy rolled out a series of actions intended to reinvigorate American coal production. The department reinstated the National Coal Council as a federal advisory committee, offered long-term financing for coal infrastructure, designated coal as a critical material and mineral and ended a moratorium prohibiting new coal mining leases on federal land.

“You’d be putting those billions of dollars into clunkers. Literally burning that money.”

— Michelle Solomon, Energy Innovation

Last week’s funding announcement advances Trump’s commitment to restore U.S. energy dominance, the official press release read.

“For years, the Biden and Obama administrations relentlessly targeted America’s coal industry and workers, resulting in the closure of reliable power plants and higher electricity costs,” U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the report. “Thankfully, President Trump has ended the war on American coal and is restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

Yet Trump’s attempt to save coal from the brink is unlikely to succeed.

In 2001, coal made up half of the electricity generated by utility-scale facilities in the United States. Today, it accounts for less than a fifth of generated power; the decline reflects the changing energy landscape.

The decline of coal energy is due to rising coal prices and the proven cost-effectiveness of alternative energy sources, including solar, wind and natural gas, said Solomon.

Analysis by Energy Innovation found that coal prices increased 28 percent between 2021 and 2024, while inflation rose only 6 percent in that time.

At 99 percent of U.S. coal plants—209 out of 210—it would be cheaper to replace energy with new wind and solar than to keep them operating, a 2023 Energy Innovation analysis found.

The Sierra Club has led the charge to close power plants in the U.S. through their decades-long “Beyond Coal” campaign. The new coal funding is “just the latest Trump administration action that harms people and the planet,” Sierra Club climate policy director Patrick Drupp wrote in a statement to Inside Climate News.

“Their pro fossil fuel agenda is intent on keeping deadly and expensive coal plants alive while Americans foot the bill and suffer the public health damage,” Drupp added.

Trump’s emergency orders to keep operating multiple coal plants slated for retirement have cost ratepayers tens of millions of dollars in the last year alone.

A 90-day emergency order requiring continued operation of Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan has generated an additional $80 million in costs since May. The company has said that it will seek payment from ratepayers across the Midwest, in accordance with the cost-collection process set by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Trump has repeatedly argued that coal is critical to improving the reliability of the American energy grid amid surging power demand. But the reliability of coal plants may be overstated.

Between 2013 and 2024, forced-outage rates (excluding planned outages for maintenance) for coal exceeded those for other major sources of electricity, including gas, nuclear and hydroelectric power, according to a report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation.

Most coal plants in the U.S. were built before 1990. Keeping those plants running as they age requires more and more money, leading utilities to schedule retirement dates for nearly half of all plants.

Solomon uses the analogy of car ownership to explain the decline of coal energy in the U.S. “If you have a car that has 250,000 miles on it, very little is going to bring that car back to new,” she said. “You can only do so much when the infrastructure is that old.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-1240947794-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:22.657156

The expansion comes four years after the initial solar plant installation in 2021, and allows the plant to now generate more than 3 million kilowatt-hours of electricity each year, which is enough to power around 300 homes.

“This project represents another important investment in the cleaner, more efficient future we’re building across Bendix,” said Luis Quiñones, Bendix environmental and sustainability engineer. “It reflects our continued commitment to renewable energy, to our community, and to doing what’s right for the environment.”

By utilizing solar power, the BDC will avoid about 1,145 tons of CO₂ emissions each year, reducing the company’s dependence on the regional power grid, lowering site energy costs, stabilizing energy expenses, and cutting greenhouse gas emissions.

The solar panels cover pollinator-friendly vegetation that attracts bees, butterflies, and other species, all while enriching the soil and aiding stormwater absorption.

The site includes a one-for-one replacement commitment for any trees cut down during construction.

“Integrating biodiversity into industrial projects is one of the most meaningful ways we can multiply our positive impact,” said Quiñones. “This installation doesn’t just generate power – it regenerates the land it sits on.”

With more than 400 employees, Huntington is home to one of Bendix’s largest manufacturing, assembly, and distribution sites – and one of its greenest.

“This project shows what’s possible when engineering and environmental stewardship work hand in hand,” said Quiñones. “It’s a model we’re proud to keep moving forward.”",https://www.wane.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/11/Bendix-Huntington-Solar-2025.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:45.704630

Denver-based Vantage Data Centers on Thursday announced it has partnered with the Wisconsin Building Trades Council to build the Lighthouse data center campus in Port Washington.

In October, Vantage revealed that Oracle and OpenAI were the investors for an artificial intelligence data center campus west of Interstate 43, which will have four data center buildings built on 500 acres and use more than a gigawatt of electricity. Through LLCs, Vantage bought around 2,000 acres of farmland north of the city of Port Washington.

Oracle and OpenAI partnered to invest $500 billion and add 10 gigawatts of capacity to AI-focused data centers across the country.

The partnership with WBTC will require a “peak workforce of more than 4,000 skilled construction workers over a three-year period,” Vantage officials said. The developer will rely on local union labor “to the fullest extent possible,” they added. Further details of the deal weren’t shared.

Vantage officials said construction will begin “very soon” and is expected to be completed in 2028. In addition to 4,000 construction jobs, officials said the facility will create more than 1,000 long-term jobs.

“This pledge recognizes the importance of building complex digital infrastructure with the best skilled professionals who deliver projects safely, on time and to the highest quality standards,” said Emily Pritzkow, executive director of the Wisconsin Building Trades Council, in a statement. “We are excited to start working on this project, which represents a historic opportunity for Wisconsin workers to complete apprenticeships, support their families and invest in their communities.”

“Wisconsin has one of the most skilled and highly trained workforces in the country, and agreements like this prove it,” said Dan Bukiewicz, president of the Milwaukee Building and Construction Trades Council, in a statement. “Every job created here means another opportunity for our local tradespeople to showcase their expertise and build careers right at home. When we invest in Wisconsin workers, we invest in Wisconsin’s future.”

“Vantage is proud to partner with Wisconsin’s union workers to build a once-in-a-generation, sustainable data center campus in Port Washington. We look forward to collaborating with local officials, the community and the Governor to break ground on this project with union support,” said Simon Casey, chief delivery officer of North America at Vantage Data Centers in a statement. “This is part of our ongoing commitment to the local economy and community, all while positioning Wisconsin as a leader in sustainable digital infrastructure.”

Vantage Data Centers officials didn’t immediately respond to a request for comment.

The company will invest $175 million in infrastructure improvements in the facility area, including new water and sewer systems, and Port Washington will reimburse the company through a proposed tax incremental financing district.

The city council is scheduled to meet Nov. 4 to review the district plan, which will need final approval from the Joint Review Board. The board will likely meet later in November.

Vantage operates 39 data center campuses across five continents, according to its website.

While the department put forth the new general permit in 2020, a string of legal challenges have kept the permit from taking effect.
Under Roos’ final decision, concentrated animal feeding operations cannot apply their waste to land as fertilizer in January, February and the first two weeks of March.
Roos also approved a ban on feeding operations giving away animal waste during the winter months.
“Now it’s time for the [feeding operations] to step up, be good neighbors, and stop the endless legal wrangling.","After meeting in August to hear arguments on updates to how the state permits large-scale animal feeding operations, Phil Roos, the director of the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes and Energy issued his final opinion Wednesday, laying out new terms for how the state permits livestock facilities.

Clean water advocates have applauded the new requirements, while agricultural industry representatives have begun exploring legal options to challenge Roose’s decision.

While the department put forth the new general permit in 2020, a string of legal challenges have kept the permit from taking effect. EGLE is required to issue new permits every five years, leaving the state to operate under the conditions of its 2015 permit for the past decade.

According to a 2024 report from the Environmental Law and Policy Center, which argued in favor of stricter permit requirements, the 290 confined animal feeding operations in the state produce 62.7 million pounds of waste daily, with many dairy and hog farms storing liquid waste in lagoons, which third parties apply to crop fields as fertilizer.

This waste can carry contaminants like E.Coli, phosphorus and nitrates, leading to harmful algal blooms in nearby waterways and polluting nearby drinking water.

In his decision, Roos agreed with EGLE attorneys’ recommendations to reinstate a ban spreading animal waste on snow-covered ground that was previously stripped from the permit by an administrative law judge. Under Roos’ final decision, concentrated animal feeding operations cannot apply their waste to land as fertilizer in January, February and the first two weeks of March.

The judge’s decision to remove this provision was not based on science or the department’s mandate to ensure compliance with water quality standards, but rather “convenience to farmers,” Roos said.

Roos also approved a ban on feeding operations giving away animal waste during the winter months.

Roos’ determination also permits EGLE to impose site-specific regulations for industrial feeding operations in watersheds that do not meet the state’s water quality standards, and individualized ground water monitoring requirements.

He also modified the 2020 permit’s date of issuance for the permit to expire five years from his Oct. 29, 2025 final decision.

While the decision did not adopt every recommendation put forth by EGLE and the many environmental advocacy groups who sought tighter protections, the decision was hailed by many of the intervenors as a step in the right direction for water quality.

“The legal and administrative challenges to this commonsense permit have wasted five years, during which [these feeding operations] were allowed to keep polluting Michigan’s waters,” Katie Garvey, a senior attorney at the Environmental Law and Policy Center, said in a statement. “Now it’s time for the [feeding operations] to step up, be good neighbors, and stop the endless legal wrangling. EGLE must now take swift action to implement the new [concentrated animal feeding operation] water permit.”

Megan Tinsley, the water policy director for the Michigan Environmental Council similarly called for a quick implementation of the permit’s new provisions, noting that more rivers and streams are impaired each year while water bodies cannot be used for their designated uses, like swimming.

“Our waters inspired the motto ‘Pure Michigan’ and support a $13.9 billion outdoor recreation economy,” Tinsley said. “EGLE must quickly implement the provisions in this long-overdue permit to prevent further degradation.”

However, the Michigan Farm Bureau, which has led the opposition to the permit changes, is already examining their legal options.

In an article published by Michigan Farm News, an official publication of the bureau, Laura Campbell, the group’s senior conservation and regulatory relations specialist, said Roos’s decisions would hinder farmers’ ability to provide nutrients and meet crop needs, while placing them under complex new requirements that will incur additional costs.

Both Campbell and Allison Eicher, assistant general counsel for the group, said Michigan Farm Bureau would be meeting with other industry groups and farmers to determine their next steps, with Campbell noting an appeal of the decision could be in the cards.",https://michiganadvance.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-170046503-700x383-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 18:00:25.525394

Holding all current Democratic seats isn’t a given.
Vance’s tie-breaking vote would give the Republicans control.
The Democrats are likely to pick up House seats, but will they pick up enough of them to matter?
They also disagree about Maine: Cook thinks it’s likely Democratic but Sabato thinks it only leans that way.","Here’s what things look like now, but a lot could change.

We’re now one year from Election Day. Because of polarization, environmental policy is closely tied to political party. The outcome of the election will shape environmental policy. If the Republicans maintain control of Congress, Trump will be relatively unchecked. Democratic control of the House or the Senate would prevent further rollbacks from Congress and would put the brakes on some of Trump’s anti-environmental efforts.

My observations are based on two well-established political websites, Cook and Sabato. Given all that’s happening, the situation will surely shift in the next year, but here’s what things look like right now.

Will the Democrats Take the Senate?

The “out-party” typically does well in off-year elections, but the Senate map is tough for the Democrats. Republicans currently hold 53 seats and the Vice-Presidency, so Democrats need to hold all of their current seats and pick up four more for control. Holding all current Democratic seats isn’t a given. Sabato and Cook both rate Michigan and Georgia as toss-ups at this point.

Picking up four new seats wouldn’t be easy. The best two shots are North Carolina and Maine (now considered toss-ups.). Ohio is next, rated by lean Republican by Cook and Sabato. After that, you’re into states that are rated “likely Republican”: Iowa and Texas. Democrats would have to carry one of those, and will need some strong tailwinds to do so.

However, even without flipping control, closing the gap in the Senate could still make a big difference. For instance, if the Democrats win North Carolina, Maine, and Ohio, then the Senate would be tied. Vance’s tie-breaking vote would give the Republicans control. But Lisa Murkowski would then be an essential vote for Republicans, and she’s a maverick who could play a role like Manchin did for Democrats under Biden.

Will the Democrats Win the House?

Gerrymandering will make a big different next November, since Republicans are trying to eliminate competitive seats in their states and Democrats are retaliating in their own states. Cook sees 17 and Sabato sees 18 toss-up House races. In Cook’s count, Democrats need to keep all their own toss-up seats and pick up 6 GOP seats to win control, Republicans only need to win only 2 toss-up races. Sabato sees 13 toss-ups, but fewer Democratic seats that category. This results in more of a level playing field, with Democrats needing to win 7 of the 12 toss-up races in seats currently held by Republicans, while Republicans only need 5. Either way, Republicans have at least a slight edge.

This edge is a tribute to the success of Republican gerrymandering in eliminating competitive districts. (I’m simplifying things – there are also a bunch of “Lean” districts, and wins in those districts would provide a cushion for either party in the toss-up races.) If Prop 50 passes in California, which is now expected, that would make the prospects more balanced between the parties.

The Democrats have two big advantages going into the race. The first is the long history of out-party success in off-year elections. The second is that turnout in those elections is lower than in presidential elections, and Democrats now have strong support from the affluent, educated voters who have the highest turnout. Trump won with the support of people who don’t usually vote but turned out for him. It may be hard to duplicate that when he’s not on the ballot.

Candidate quality will make a difference in these close races. But the biggest factor will be the nation’s political mood. Will Trump be seen as successful (even if some supporters don’t like him that much)? Or will there be a huge backlash? That may turn on the state of the economy as much as anything. The Democrats are likely to pick up House seats, but will they pick up enough of them to matter?

What About the Statehouses?

Governors are important players in state climate policy. Sabato and Cook agree that the races in Arizona, Michigan, and Wisconsin are toss-ups; New Jersey leans or is likely Democratic, and both Kansas and Iowa lean Republican. Cook thinks Georgia and Nevada are toss-ups; Sabato thinks they lean Republican. They also disagree about Maine: Cook thinks it’s likely Democratic but Sabato thinks it only leans that way.

I suspect that the outcomes will be driven partly by candidate quality and partly by whether there’s a national wave (although governor’s races seem slightly less nationalized than House race or Senate races).

Obviously, it’s early days. The Democrats will need to get some luster back on their brand and see some tarnishing of Trump’s if they’re to prevail. Otherwise, it will be more of the same in Congress until 2028.",https://legal-planet.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Midterm2026-blog.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:18:47.710576

Michigan has been working to counter actions taken by Trump and other Republican officials that would deal a blow to the state’s clean energy efforts.
In 2024, Michigan was awarded $156 million in Solar for All funding for 13 pilot projects around the state.","Michigan’s clean energy future has faced major setbacks, with companies scaling back projects and laying off workers due to federal policy changes and funding cuts made by President Donald Trump’s administration.

According to new reporting from Climate Power, a national public relations and advocacy organization dedicated to climate justice, 158,000 clean energy jobs across the country have been canceled or delayed since Trump entered his second term. Michigan accounts for over 6,000 of those jobs, including the 1,200 workers General Motors announced in late October would be laid off at an electric vehicle plant in Detroit.

“Donald Trump’s policies are singlehandedly engineering a collapse of manufacturing projects in Michigan,” Climate Power communications director Alex Glass said in a statement. “On the campaign trail, Donald Trump promised to bring back jobs and lower costs – instead, he’s leaving Americans with higher utility bills and pink slips. Michigan Republicans will have to answer to voters for why they’ve co-signed an agenda that is sending American manufacturing jobs overseas and making daily life unaffordable.”

Michigan has been aggressive in its push toward clean energy in recent years, even setting a goal of reaching 100% carbon neutrality by 2040. According to Climate Power, Michigan was the No. 1 state in the nation in 2024 in its number of clean energy projects: From 2022-2024, the state announced 74 projects totaling over 26,000 jobs and roughly $27 billion in federal funding.

That progress has been disrupted under Trump, who has long been critical of the country’s climate policies and the development of clean energy technology. He’s made false claims that climate change is a hoax and that wind turbines cause cancer. Since taking office again in January, Trump has unsuccessfully attempted to pause funding awarded to climate groups through President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and signed an executive order to boost coal production.

Michigan has been working to counter actions taken by Trump and other Republican officials that would deal a blow to the state’s clean energy efforts.

Most recently, Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel announced in a press release on Oct. 17 that the state had joined officials of 22 other states in suing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin for what they charge was their illegal ending of the Solar for All program, a $7 billion initiative aimed at lowering energy costs for low-income households.

In 2024, Michigan was awarded $156 million in Solar for All funding for 13 pilot projects around the state. The attorney general’s office says in the press release that the loss of federal funding has halted these projects and “denied disadvantaged communities across Michigan the benefits the program was designed to deliver.”

“The Trump Administration’s decision to illegally rescind congressionally approved grants – funds that were already being put to work in our communities – is unlawful and deeply harmful to residents across Michigan and the country,” Nessel said. “We’ve seen this playbook from the White House before. The administration has tried to pull the same stunt by canceling congressionally mandated programs, and we stopped them then. We plan to do the same now to ensure the Trump Administration cannot unlawfully strip away these important investments that lower energy costs and make clean energy more accessible to Michigan families.”",https://michiganindependent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/SolarPanelsDetroit_23109645366259.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:01:57.766323

Email address Thank you!

With the first month of sales reports coming in post-tax-credit, U.S. EV sales have taken an absolute drubbing. The highly publicized end of EV subsidies had the precise effect analysts predicted, encouraging sales in the final months of its availability (and likely leaving demand depressed for months to come). Even in cases where brands stepped in with their own incentives, the sales have essentially vanished, and as automakers flex away from electric models to ICE vehicles in the coming, we expect the segment to stay relatively cool.

Bear in mind that not all automakers report their sales figures monthly anymore, so we won’t have a clearer picture of what’s happening industry-wide until January (after Q4/full-year sales are announced). Here’s a preliminary look:

Hyundai – Ioniq 5 sales took an absolute beating, dropping more than 60% compared to a year ago. Total Ioniq 5 sales are still up nearly 25% for 2025, so it’s not all bad news there. Ioniq 6 sales were down 52% in October and remain down 4% for the year; worse than that, it was only moving in triple-digit monthly volumes to begin with. Hyundai’s sold fewer than 10,000 of the sedans this year. Hyundai sold nearly as many Ioniq 9s as it did Ioniq 6s, but that’s not saying a whole lot…

Kia – EV6 sales likewise dropped by two-thirds compared to last October, as did sales of the three-row EV9. EV6 sales have declined by a third in 2025 overall, going the opposite direction of the Hyundai Ioniq 5. Kia doesn’t break down Niro sales by powertrain, but the smaller crossover was up by 75% last month despite a lingering full-year sales deficit.

Honda – It should come as no surprise that the Prologue took it on the chin in October (down 80% to just over 800 units). That was still better than the (now dead) Acura ZDX, which recorded just 25 sales last month (down from 1,200 a year ago).

Subaru -It may surprise you to learn that Subaru was generally on pace to match its 2024 total of just over 10,000 Solterras sold in 2025, but that came to a screeching halt in October. Subaru sold just 13 of the EVs last month.

Short version: It’s a bloodbath. It likely won’t stay this ugly long-term, but we’re not expecting any big surprises from the segment any time soon. A lot of pent-up demand was just satisfied by EVs being discounted while the credit was still good, so even in cases where prices haven’t changed all that much, it stands to reason that the automakers were spending more to move metal while the feds were still picking up the tab for the discounts.

The end result may not have changed all that much for the customer, but a whole lot of potential profit evaporated overnight, and automakers would rather focus on selling models that won’t lose them money outright.

We’ll keep our eyes peeled for any other big news on the EV sales front; in the meantime, if you’re hunting for a leftover, your favorite brand might be in the mood to deal just to get it off the lot. Can’t hurt to try.

Synthetic graphite is an essential component in lithium-ion batteries and is critical for a range of defence and industrial applications. Vianode’s production facility was featured as part of Canada’s leadership in the G7 Critical Minerals Production Alliance and will contribute to the diversification of resilient, domestic supply chains that use this critical mineral.

The project is structured as a phased, multi‑billion‑dollar investment, starting with an initial investment of over CAD 2 billion. Over time, planned expansions will bring total capacity to as much as 150,000 tons annually, supporting a secure North American supply chain for critical minerals that power strategic industries.

“North American supply chains are heavily reliant on graphite sourced from China for lithium-ion batteries, defence technologies, nuclear technology and more. A large-scale facility in Ontario delivering high-performance anode graphite solutions will provide Canada with domestic capacity that will make supply chains more resilient. This scalable project is a key building block that aligns with recent shifts in trade policy and supports our ambition to be a leading and trusted supplier for G7 supply chains,” says Burkhard Straube, CEO of Vianode.

“Canada is proud to support Vianode in advancing critical mineral development that aligns with our national priorities and international commitments, and proud they chose Canada for North America’s first large-scale low-emission synthetic graphite production facility. Through the Critical Minerals Production Alliance, we are working with trusted partners to deploy sovereign tools, mobilize investments and financing, and secure offtake arrangements to accelerate the development of secure, resilient critical minerals supply chains. These minerals will power the clean energy transition, strengthen our defence and manufacturing capabilities, and position Canada as a trusted supplier to our allies,” says the Honourable Tim Hogdson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

“Canada’s support for Vianode reflects our commitment to responsible resource development and international collaboration. By advancing projects that align with the goals of the Critical Minerals Production Alliance, we are helping to build resilient supply chains, drive innovation, and bolster Canada’s position as a trusted global partner in the continued development of more clean energy and advanced manufacturing,” adds Claude Guay, Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Energy and Natural Resources.

Synthetic graphite is essential not only for EV batteries, but also for semiconductors, grid-scale electrical storage, nuclear reactors, defence systems, and steel production. As demand accelerates globally, supply chain security is a pressing issue.

Vianode’s planned facility will establish a resilient and sustainable battery supply chain in North America and enhance the region’s access to strategic materials, in addition to creating around 300 highly skilled jobs in the initial phase and up to 1000 at full capacity.

Ontario was chosen after an extensive selection and due diligence process. A front-end engineering design (FEED) study has been conducted, and ground preparation works are under way to enable start of production in 2028.

“Canada and Vianode are a perfect match. Ontario is home to major manufacturing hubs, with access to world-class infrastructure and a low-carbon electricity grid. The province has all the characteristics we are looking for. During our North American selection process, I have seen first-hand a strong shared commitment to closing the strategic gaps in the critical minerals supply chain and creating jobs that will strengthen Canada’s economic resilience,” says Emanuele Tricca, Vianode’s Managing Director in Canada.

Vianode has produced synthetic anode graphite at its industrial pilot facility in Kristiansand, Norway since 2021, and in 2024, the company started operations at the world’s most sustainable synthetic anode graphite plant Via ONE at Herøya, Norway. Vianode recently launched the first high-performance anode graphite solution based on recycled materials, as part of its next-generation material series.

The agency posted changes on the individual websites of the Office of Air and Radiation, Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, and Office of Land and Emergency Management.

In an email, spokesperson Brigit Hirsch said the changes “will directly benefit the American people and better advance the agency’s core mission, while Powering the Great American Comeback,” a reference to the administration’s slogan for its EPA agenda.

The agency, meanwhile, “continues to work through the reorganization process for the remaining program offices and will provide updates as they become available,” Hirsch added.

She didn’t respond to followup requests for more detail on the reorganization’s expected benefits and whether employee layoffs — technically known as reductions in force — will accompany any of the three reorganizations.

POLITICO’s E&E News reported last week that EPA was poised to unveil new structures for the air and solid waste offices. The potential impact of the enforcement office makeover left one retired agency official scratching his head.

“It doesn’t look like it did anything dramatic, but it’s hard to tell without more detail,” Larry Starfield, who served as the enforcement office’s principal deputy assistant administrator, said in an interview.

A new organizational chart for the land office shows a pared-down Office of Land and Emergency Management, down from 10 suboffices to five. The Superfund, federal facilities and emergency response offices have been condensed into one — the Office of Superfund and Emergency Management — and gone are the stand-alone offices dedicated to communications, management and staffing.

OLEM’s other flagship programs, including Brownfield grants, resource conservation and regulating underground storage tanks, saw few changes to their organizational structures. While Trump administration officials have voiced intentions to expedite hazardous waste cleanups with fewer resources, it is still not clear how the redesign will impact daily functions.

For the air office, however, the changes loom as the most significant since implementation of the 1990 Clean Air Act amendments.

Gone are the Office of Atmospheric Protection, which handled most of EPA’s climate work, and the Office of Air Quality Planning and Standards (OAQPS), which set national limits for smog, soot and other common pollutants and write regulations for power plants and other industries.

To varying degrees, the standards office’s responsibilities will now be divvied out among the newly created Office of Clean Air Programs and the Office of State Air Partnerships.

“Overall, I can’t say this is a bad thing for OAQPS as the functions all still seem to be there,” Chet Wayland, a retired senior air manager, told E&E News in a text message after reviewing the new structure. “But the reality of what each of those branches gets tasked to actually work on will be interesting.”

Wayland saw no evidence of greenhouse gas or climate initiatives surviving in the new structure.

Meanwhile, Energy Star, the energy efficiency rating program for appliances, has been moved from the now defunct Office of Atmospheric Protection to the Office of Radiation and Indoor Air.

What’s next for Energy Star?

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s plan to abolish Energy Star provoked opposition from both industry and environmentalists. The New York Times on Saturday reported that Zeldin is reconsidering. But Hirsch said Monday that “no final decision has been made at this time.”

It’s unclear how much economic activity is generated by Energy Star, as it “does not preclude the purchase or sales of any product,” Hirsch said.

“The Trump EPA is committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars and a program that essentially is a government-sponsored advertising scheme doesn’t seem like a good use of hard-working Americans’ money,” she said.

Two people familiar with internal operations said the fate of the program remains uncertain.

“I think [EPA] realized it’s a little more complicated … given how many industries use it,” said a person granted anonymity because they are not authorized to speak on internal deliberations.

“It doesn’t seem like they’ve made any decision,” the person said.

Unlike the Department of Energy’s mandatory efficiency rules, Energy Star is voluntary. EPA sets standards that businesses can choose to meet and verify independently before displaying the program’s blue label on appliances, buildings and homes.

Energy Start supporters say federal data shows that the program saves consumers and businesses more than $40 billion a year — an amount higher than its annual appropriations.

More than 1,000 companies, cities and organizations sent a letter to EPA in April urging support for Energy Star, which they called “among the most successful public-private partnerships in U.S. history.”

Zeldin has called for privatizing the program, telling lawmakers in May it requires “a big taxpayer-funded staff.”

The restructurings unveiled Monday arrived about two weeks after EPA announced comparable reorganizations of its chemical safety and research wings. Throughout the process, agency leaders have provided little information on staffing or the potential effects on the agency’s mission to protect human health and the environment.

The restructurings are all part of an agencywide retrenchment that Zeldin announced this spring in the course of a downsizing drive predicted to save more than $300 million this fiscal year and cut EPA’s workforce to levels close to those found during the Reagan administration.",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/b4/aa/8513fcea441ba7747d29070ee854/epa-17823.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 17:01:32.972127

Here's what our experts are looking for: Embrace Climate Action as an Economic Strategy Ani Dasgupta, WRI President and CEO About COP30 The 2025 UN climate summit (COP30) runs from Nov.10-Nov.21, 2025 in Belém, Brazil.
On the finance front, leaders set a target last year to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually from all international sources for developing countries' climate action by 2035.

This work provided key input to the Baku-to-Belém Roadmap and was an important step toward better integrating finance ministers, who are key to scaling up climate finance, into international climate talks.","While the impacts of climate change are becoming ever-clearer, so too are the benefits of action.

The shift toward technologies like renewable energy and electric vehicles is already cleaning the air and preventing deaths from pollution. Countries investing in greener development models are creating millions of new jobs in areas like power and manufacturing. Clean energy is lowering electricity costs and bringing power to those without.

Yet this transition is not happening nearly fast enough to prevent increasingly dangerous climate impacts, and progress remains uneven. As some countries forge ahead on low-carbon development, others are pulling back. Meanwhile, the cost of climate change continues to rise: Extreme weather caused over $300 billion in damages last year alone.

What we need now is a step change. The world must move from setting targets to delivering them. The upcoming UN climate summit (COP30) in Belém, Brazil is a prime opportunity to do so.

WRI experts have laid out four key areas where COP30 can put the world on track for a safer, more prosperous future:

Deliver robust national climate commitments, using detailed global and country plans to close the gap in climate action.

Transform the global financial system so that all forms of finance (public and private, domestic and international) support the transition to green, inclusive, resilient economies. Ensure that funds reach the countries and communities that need them most.

Step up climate resilience by recognizing that investing in adaptation means investing in growth, security and development; by delivering an ambitious new adaptation finance goal; and by setting clear, measurable indicators for tracking progress.

Protect nature, reform food systems and advance Indigenous land rights: three key elements for tackling the interconnected climate and nature crises together.

So, what must COP30 achieve in these areas and beyond to be considered a success? Here's what our experts are looking for:

Embrace Climate Action as an Economic Strategy

Ani Dasgupta, WRI President and CEO

About COP30

The 2025 UN climate summit (COP30) runs from Nov.10-Nov.21, 2025 in Belém, Brazil. To learn more about the key issues at stake and explore the latest news, research and events, visit WRI's Resource Hub

Right now, we face many headwinds for climate action and multilateralism. The U.S. has stepped back, and there are similar discussions of slowing down in parts of Europe. But that's not the whole story. Across the 50 countries WRI works in, what we see on the ground is that progress is happening.

All of the leaders I speak to from developing countries see this transition as their best economic opportunity, not as a burden. This is especially true in large middle-income countries. China and India are driving record renewable deployment, especially solar. Economic growth driven by clean energy is now even more of a motivator than climate. As COP host, Brazil is also showing how an economy rooted in forest protection, rather than destruction, can create over $8 billion in additional GDP and more than 300,000 new jobs in the Amazon region by 2050. For these countries, economic prosperity, energy security and decarbonization are essentially the same thing, driving the momentum we're seeing today.

There's a geopolitical realignment of climate leadership taking place. These middle-income countries played a key role in shaping the outcome [at COP29 in 2024] in Baku. With their large populations, substantial emissions and significant stores of biodiversity, they will continue to play an outsized role in determining the success of the global transition for people, nature and climate. We are watching closely to see what form their leadership will take at COP30.

Accelerate Action on National Climate Commitments, Finance and Adaptation

Melanie Robinson, Global Climate, Economics and Finance Director, WRI

All countries are due to deliver new national climate plans (known as ""nationally determined contributions,"" or ""NDCs"") this year. Sixty-five countries had formally submitted NDCs as of Oct. 27 — and the current plans fall far short of what's needed to meet the Paris Agreement's goals. Several major emitters are still expected to put forward plans ahead of or during COP30, which could help. But a substantial gap remains.

In Belém, leaders must agree on a decisive global response to address this shortfall. This includes: 1) reaffirming the 1.5 degree C goal and developing an ""Ambition Framework"" which sets out how to close the gap to achieve it; 2) accelerating sector-specific strategies to cut emissions from areas like energy and transport before 2030, reflecting the outcomes of the 2023 Global Stocktake on climate action; and 3) clarifying pathways to achieve countries' net-zero goals, particularly through updated long-term strategies.

On the finance front, leaders set a target last year to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually from all international sources for developing countries' climate action by 2035. The forthcoming Baku-to-Belém Roadmap will lay out pragmatic strategies to achieve this goal, showing how countries can get all sources working together as a system to deliver finance for the transition at scale. At COP30, countries must demonstrate how they will turn this plan into action. One promising development to look for is the unveiling of ""country platforms"": various country-led approaches that aim to align all sources of finance behind countries' climate and development plans, policy reforms and investment pipelines.

As for climate resilience, the 2021 ""Glasgow pledge"" to double adaptation finance expires this year, and countries must decide on a new goal at COP30. Some developing countries are calling for a needs-based target while others are calling to triple adaptation finance by 2030. Our own forthcoming analysis shows that a tripling is achievable by 2035, but it would take increases across all sources (including multilateral development banks' funds for the poorest, bilateral funds, new sources of concessional finance, and more private finance being mobilized), and finance working better as a system.

COP30 also offers an opportunity to adopt a set of progress indicators under the Global Goal on Adaptation. This will create a common language to track resilience-building efforts and the support needed. Done right, this can help put resilience at the heart of countries', communities' and corporates' core economic, development and business planning.

Strengthen Pledges that Align Action on Climate and Nature

Mariana Oliveira, Director of Forests and Land Use, WRI Brasil

We won't meet our climate goals — not on mitigation, not on adaptation — if forests and ecosystems aren't part of the plan. The science is clear that protecting and restoring nature and transforming food systems are powerful tools to cut emissions, build resilience and reduce climate impacts. The challenge? Mobilizing the resources to scale these solutions.

One initiative to watch at COP30 is the Tropical Forest Forever Facility (TFFF) that will be launched by the Brazilian government. This bold proposal offers predictable, performance-based payments to countries that keep their forests standing, moving away from dependence on philanthropy. Brazil has already pledged $1 billion to the fund, and other countries, such as the U.K., Colombia, Norway and Indonesia, have expressed their support for it. But for the TFFF to work, it needs at least $25 billion to be announced during COP. Whether developed countries will step up is a key question.

Countries should also deliver a strong package to bolster Indigenous Peoples' and local communities' land tenure rights and increase funding to them. While these communities are some of the world's most effective forest stewards, their territories are under constant and increasing threats, and many lack legal rights to the lands they manage. COP30 can help by delivering an improved Forest Tenure Pledge 2.0 and ensuring that Indigenous Peoples and local communities receive at least 20% of funding from the TFFF.

Equally essential is unlocking investments in sustainable agriculture and land restoration. One development to watch is the launch of the RAIZ (Resilient Agriculture Investment for Net-Zero Land Degradation) initiative. This proposes innovative financial mechanisms to fund the restoration of up to 250 million hectares of degraded land by 2050 — while at the same time increasing global food production.

Alongside RAIZ, complementary initiatives already underway in Brazil (such as the National Productive Forests Program and the Action Plan for Deforestation Prevention and Control in the Amazon) underscore the country's emerging leadership in integrating action on climate, nature and food systems. Advancing this cohesive agenda more broadly can help ensure that COP30 delivers not only on climate ambition, but also on resilience, equity and shared prosperity.

Under Brazil's Leadership, Make This the 'COP of Implementation'

Karen Silverwood-Cope, Climate Director, WRI Brasil

In its role as COP president, Brazil is bringing a clear and ambitious vision to COP30: to make Belém the ""COP of Implementation."" The Presidency's central challenge is to turn promises into real-world action — bridging divides between developed and developing countries, ambition and equity, mitigation and adaptation. The Brazilian Presidency has outlined three priorities that began to be articulated and implemented in 2024 and will culminate in Brazil's COP Presidency by the end of 2026.

First, Brazil has been working to align climate and economic priorities over the last year through convenings like the G20 and BRICS [Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa] summit, putting finance at the heart of international climate talks. Brazil also launched the COP30 Circle of Finance Ministers, bringing together representatives from 37 countries who developed concrete recommendations on concessional finance, multilateral bank reform, country investment platforms and regulatory frameworks to unlock capital flows. This work provided key input to the Baku-to-Belém Roadmap and was an important step toward better integrating finance ministers, who are key to scaling up climate finance, into international climate talks.

Second, Brazil is redefining regional leadership, rooted in cooperation between emerging economies. For example, the Rio Declaration at the recent BRICS summit signaled a readiness among emerging economies to lead a resilient, low-carbon transition — from green bonds and tropical forest protection to new trade and carbon accounting initiatives.

Finally, Brazil's presidency is working to weave together the broader web of actors that drive progress outside of formal COP negotiations. It aims to deliver an ""Action Agenda"" that can better align all actors behind various climate commitments and processes (like the Global Stocktake, NDCs and long-term strategies), promoting transparency and accountability in climate action.

Other key deliverables to watch for at COP30 under Brazil's leadership include progress on the Just Transition Work Programme and the Gender Action Plan and the development of indicators for the Global Goal on Adaptation.

“This technology is the best way to move forward in the clean energy transition and reduce peak load demands on the grid.” News item from Clean Energy For Maryland","Environmental and consumer advocates are asking the Maryland Public Service Commission (PSC) to lower Marylanders’ electricity bills by rapidly acquiring new, low-cost clean energy and storage as authorized by the Next Generation Energy Act, which the legislature passed with bipartisan support and was signed into law by Gov. Wes Moore in April.

The Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club, the Center for Progressive Reform, Chesapeake Climate Action Network, Earthjustice, Elders Climate Action Maryland, Environment Maryland Research and Policy Center, Maryland League of Conservation Voters and Maryland PIRG Foundation sent a letter encouraging the PSC to move quickly to acquire storage and to prioritize storage connected to solar energy projects.

“The Next Generation Energy Act wisely requires the state to expand energy storage capacity and renewable buildout and we encourage the legislature, Gov. Moore and Maryland Public Service Commission to move quickly to deploy clean energy to drive down rising electricity prices,” said Josh Tulkin, director of the Maryland Chapter of the Sierra Club.

It helps utilities meet peak demand, potentially replacing expensive and polluting “peaker plants.” When paired with solar power and other clean energy, energy storage allows the grid to maximize clean energy potential and reduce pollution from fossil fuel power plants.

The Next Generation Energy Act requires the PSC to solicit proposals for up to 1,600 MW of energy storage capacity, with an initial proposal deadline of January 1, 2026. In comparison, the Brandon Shores coal-fired power plant outside of Baltimore has a generating capacity of 1,289 MW.

Approving clean energy and storage projects ahead of the January deadline will enable Maryland to benefit from expiring federal tax credits and help drive electricity prices down. In light of expiring tax credits, Colorado, Connecticut, Maine and Oregon have moved to expedite similar processes and Maryland advocates are calling for the state to follow suit.

“Pairing battery storage with solar power is a win-win for energy customers and the planet,” said Brittany Baker, Maryland director for Chesapeake Climate Action Network. “This technology is the best way to move forward in the clean energy transition and reduce peak load demands on the grid.”

The parties argue the partnership is in accordance with the President’s May 23, 2025 Executive Orders, which were meant to quadruple domestic production of nuclear power within the next 25 years. At the center of the new strategic partnership, at least $80 billion of new reactors are targeted to be constructed across the United States using Westinghouse nuclear reactor technology.

“Our administration is focused on ensuring the rapid development, deployment, and use of advanced nuclear technologies,” said Howard Lutnick, Secretary for the United States Department of Commerce. “This historic partnership supports our national security objectives and enhances our critical infrastructure. Together with Westinghouse we will unleash American energy. This partnership embodies the bold vision of President Trump – to rebuild our energy sovereignty, create high-paying jobs, and drive America to the forefront of the nuclear renaissance.”

The parties also maintain that the partnership will facilitate the growth and future of the American nuclear power industry and the supporting supply chain. Each two-unit Westinghouse AP1000 project creates or sustains 45,000 manufacturing and engineering jobs in 43 states, and a national deployment will create more than 100,000 construction jobs, Westinghouse said. As part of the partnership, at least $80 billion of nuclear reactors will be constructed using Westinghouse technology.

“Our highly successful partnership with Brookfield as owners of Westinghouse will be further strengthened through this collaboration with the U.S. Government,” said Tim Gitzel, CEO of Cameco. “We expect this new partnership to support the global growth opportunities for both Westinghouse’s and Cameco’s nuclear products, services and technologies, adding significant long-term value for our stakeholders and enhancing energy, national and climate security around the world. As a strategic partner, Cameco is a secure and reliable western-based supplier of the uranium fuel needed to support the civilian deployment and long-term reliable operation of Westinghouse’s technology in the U.S. and globally.”

The partnership also contains profit sharing mechanisms that provide for all parties once certain thresholds are met.

To speed up the development of nuclear power, President Trumps’ recent executive orders granted the U.S. energy secretary authority to approve some advanced reactor designs and projects, taking authority away from the independent safety agency that has regulated the U.S. nuclear industry for five decades.

The orders would reorganize the independent Nuclear Regulatory Commission to ensure quicker reviews of nuclear projects, including an 18-month deadline for the NRC to act on industry applications. The measures also create a pilot program intended to place three new experimental reactors online by July 4, 2026 and invoke the Defense Production Act to allow emergency measures to ensure the U.S. has enough uranium and other reactor fuel for a modernized nuclear energy sector.

The orders also call for the Energy and Defense departments to assess the feasibility of restarting closed nuclear power plants and explore siting reactors on federal lands and military bases.

According to a report by S&P Global, datacenter grid power demand is expected to rise 22% in 2025 alone and nearly triple by 2030. After decades of relatively flat electricity usage in the United States, datacenters are expected to draw vast amounts of power, creating demand strain on the grid.

“When we announced our AI data center in Richland Parish, Louisiana, last year we committed to working with our partners to bring new energy to the grid – and this agreement with Treaty Oak does just that,” said Urvi Parekh, head of global energy, Meta.

The two Louisiana projects are expected to generate over $100 million in lifetime state and local tax revenue and create jobs in rural areas during project construction. About 300 jobs are expected to be created during peak construction.

Appliance manufacturers and retail stores in particular like Energy Star because it helps sales.","Washington, D.C. – The New York Times reports that Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency is facing backlash against its unpopular decision to end Energy Star, an appliance efficiency standards program that saves Americans more than $40 billion on household energy costs each year. The program, which has had bipartisan support for more than three decades, was targeted by Trump as part of his reckless and revenge-driven war on clean energy.

“Donald Trump promised to lower costs – and instead, his energy policy is sending costs through the roof and making appliances more expensive. It’s no wonder his policies are also deeply unpopular with everyone from business leaders to fellow Republicans. Eliminating this program will suck money out of Americans’ wallets and create even more uncertainty for businesses already reeling from Trump’s tariffs,” said Climate Power senior advisor Alex Witt. “American families are already struggling to pay their bills – and instead of offering relief, Trump is trying to do everything he can to make life even more expensive.”

The New York Times: E.P.A. Retreats From Plans to End the Energy Star Program

Lee Zeldin, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, has quietly retreated from plans to eliminate Energy Star, a popular program whose iconic blue labels help consumers to choose energy efficient dishwashers, refrigerators and other home appliances.

In a rare shift, Mr. Zeldin is reconsidering his announcement from May that he would end the program, which triggered intense pushback from business leaders and congressional Republicans, according to four people briefed on the matter who were not authorized to discuss it publicly.

Shortly after Mr. Zeldin said he would eliminate Energy Star, the E.P.A. renewed four contracts with ICF, a consulting firm that helps administer the program, according to federal records. One contract was renewed through September of 2030. The company did not respond to requests for comment.

Brigit Hirsch, a spokeswoman for the E.P.A., said in email that “no final decision has been made at this time” on whether to keep Energy Star…

“It is unclear what the economic activity generated by the Energy Star program is versus what the economic activity would be without this program,” Ms. Hirsch said, adding that “the Trump E.P.A. is committed to being good stewards of taxpayer dollars.”

Since its creation in 1992, Energy Star has helped households and businesses save more than $40 billion annually in energy bills, according to a 2023 federal report. The E.P.A. has spent a fraction of that amount — about $32 million — to run the program each year.

Mr. Zeldin is weighing options for keeping Energy Star in some form, although a final decision has not been made and could be delayed by the government shutdown, said the four people briefed on the matter.

One option is transferring staff and funding for Energy Star to the Energy Department, which already plays a small role in running the program, the people said. Another is requiring appliance manufacturers to pay fees that would help cover the cost of the initiative.

Either choice would represent an unusual reversal for the E.P.A. In their zeal to terminate what President Trump has called the “green new scam,” agency officials have scrapped several other policies that even their allies in the oil, automotive and utility industries were not clamoring to reverse.

Regardless of what Mr. Zeldin decides, many E.P.A. employees who work on Energy Star have quit, retired or taken a buyout package since Mr. Trump took office. Other workers in the program have been furloughed as part of the government shutdown or reassigned as part of an agencywide reorganization…

“Energy Star is a hugely successful, voluntary program and the Energy Star logo is probably one of the most well-known logos in the country, if not the world,” said Francis Dietz, vice president of public affairs at the Air-Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute, a trade group.

But for years, Mr. Trump has railed against efficiency standards for home appliances, saying in April that more efficient shower heads did not spray enough water on his “beautiful hair.” Russell T. Vought, the White House budget director, has also pushed the E.P.A. to slash what he sees as wasteful green spending.

Yet on Capitol Hill, Energy Star has attracted rare bipartisan support, with lawmakers in both parties saying the program lowers energy costs at a time of rising electricity prices nationwide.

“I know that my constituents like knowing what the energy usage is of a particular appliance so that they can factor that into their buying decisions,” Senator Susan Collins, Republican of Maine and chair of the Senate Appropriations Committee, told CNN in May.

Ms. Collins declined to comment on Energy Star when asked by a reporter on Wednesday. In July, the Senate and House Appropriations Committees bucked Mr. Trump by proposing to provide level funding for the program for the next fiscal year.

The wrangling over Energy Star’s fate began in early May, when E.P.A. managers announced during an internal staff meeting that the program would grind to a halt.

“The Energy Star program and all the other climate work, outside of what’s required by statute, is being de-prioritized and eliminated,” a manager told employees during the meeting, according to a recording of the remarks reviewed by The New York Times.

During a congressional hearing two weeks later, Mr. Zeldin claimed that Energy Star was “not a statutory obligation set by Congress” and that “this program is an example of one that can be run outside of the government.” In fact, the Energy Policy Act of 2005 required the E.P.A. and the Energy Department to run the program. (The E.P.A. officials who helped Mr. Zeldin prepare for the hearing were not aware of this mandate, according to two people familiar with the matter.)

The pushback was swift and intense.

The following month, in June, a coalition of industry groups wrote in a letter to congressional leaders that they would “strongly support continuation” of the program. The groups represented a range of businesses, including appliance manufacturers, chemical companies, home builders, retail stores and even bakery owners and hot tub distributors.

Appliance manufacturers and retail stores in particular like Energy Star because it helps sales. Around 90 percent of Americans recognize the program’s logo and many see it as a trustworthy way to identify efficient products, surveys have shown.

“We’re very supportive of the program remaining in the federal government,” said Jill Notini, a spokeswoman for the Association of Home Appliance Manufacturers, one of the groups that signed the letter…",https://climatepower.us/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Meta-Image_Climate-Power.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 20:04:01.454672

The partnership between the departments of Defense and Commerce and Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies seeks to enable 10,000 metric tons of magnet production in the U.S. each year.

Vulcan Elements said in a press release it will be able to build and operate a 10,000 metric ton magnet facility in the U.S.

Company chief of staff Jonah Glick-Unterman told The Hill in an email that the magnets in question can be used for virtually all electronic devices: satellites, robotics, drones, electric motors, hard disk drives and nearly all defense systems.

Under the deal, the military will provide Vulcan Elements with a $620 million loan from its Office of Strategic Capital, while an additional $50 million will come from the Department of Commerce under the CHIPS and Science Act.

The Office of Strategic Capital will also give ReElement Technologies an $80 billion loan to expand its recycling and processing operation.

The press release states the Commerce Department will get $50 million worth of equity in Vulcan Elements while the Pentagon will get “warrants” in both Vulcan Elements and ReElement Technologies.

Stock warrants would give the government the right to purchase a stock at a certain price. It’s not entirely clear how big a stake in the companies the government will seek to take, and the Defense Department did not immediately respond to questions from The Hill.

The Trump administration has been focused on shoring up its supplies of minerals and particularly rare-earth elements, seeking to use them in military applications in particular.

It has also sought to take a share of several companies it provides funding to, including in the minerals sector.

The magnets in question are neodymium iron boron magnets, with neodymium considered to be a rare-earth element. Such minerals are not necessarily rare, but are often found in small deposits on the Earth’s surface and can therefore be uneconomic to mine.

For this reason, we recommend that Congress begin by creating a Commission on Policy Evaluation, modeled on the successful Commission on Evidence-Based Policy Making.","In principle, there is a long-standing and broad bipartisan consensus in favor of robust ex-post evaluation of federal environmental policy. Proponents of ex-post evaluation note its many possible benefits—these include identifying (and eliminating) ineffective programs; improving the quality of ex-ante analysis; and facilitating regulatory experimentation. In reality, a number of political, institutional, and cultural barriers have blocked the emergence of any consistent practice of ex-post review. These barriers have persisted for decades, through administrations of both political parties and during periods of both united and divided government. They arise from consistent features of the administrative state, rather than the temporary politics of any particular moment. Overcoming them will likely require sustained reforms efforts.

Based in part on a series of interviews with senior government officials with decades of experience in environmental policymaking, this report identifies a set of ten interrelated barriers that have inhibited the development of a robust practice of environmental policy evaluation at federal agencies. These barriers are partially the result of political dynamics, but they also arise from agency institutional constraints, incentives, and cultures. Our research identifies the following leading barriers to ex-post evaluation:

Many agencies lack dedicated funding to carry out ex-post evaluation.

Agencies have highly constrained agenda space, making it difficult to prioritize ex-post evaluation.

Agencies face adverse political incentives to engage in self-scrutiny that may open them to political attacks.

Although agency personnel often have essential domain knowledge, they may lack the expertise to carry out rigorous ex-post analyses.

Agencies may lack (or believe they lack) legislative authority to carry out certain types of ex-post review.

It is often not clear how agencies should integrate the results of ex-post evaluation into decisionmaking, given that major regulatory decisions are rare.

The self-evaluations of agencies, even if carried out in good faith, may not be perceived as trustworthy by relevant stakeholders.

Ex-post evaluation often raises difficult questions of causal inference that agencies may be ill-positioned to address.

It is often difficult for agencies to collect the data needed to engage in ex-post evaluation.

Many agencies have not developed a culture of evaluation.

Given the identified barriers, we propose a suite of potential reforms for Congress to consider. These proposals are based on prior experience with ex-post review, analogous efforts within and outside the government, or suggestions that interviewees raised. We offer options at different levels of ambition, recognizing that enthusiasm to dedicate substantial congressional effort to the project of improving ex-post evaluation may vary. These levels of ambition can also be understood as scaling with time, so that more ambitious proposals, while perhaps unrealistic in the short term, may be more plausible over longer time horizons.

At the lowest level of ambition, Congress could use the appropriations process to direct funds to environmental policy evaluation. So as not to interfere with agency operations, and to avoid the impression that policy evaluation necessarily comes at the expense of programmatic goals, such funds should be made as additions to agency budgets, rather than as reallocations of existing resources. Appropriations directed to ex-post review would, most obviously, address the barrier of a lack of dedicated funds. Such appropriations would also require agencies to prioritize, to at least some degree, ex-post evaluation, regardless of their limited agenda space. Additional funding would also facilitate the acquisition of expertise as needed.

At a similar level of ambition, Congress could contemplate small-bore reforms that could ease the process of ex-post evaluation. For example, the Paperwork Reduction Act places procedural and substantive limits on agencies’ ability to collect data—a core prerequisite of ex-post evaluation. Given limited agency resources and competing priorities, these burdens act as additional roadblocks that can sap momentum from evaluation efforts. Targeted reforms to the Paperwork Reduction Act could reduce these burdens while still ensuring that the core purposes of the Act are protected. Efforts to identify other similar facilitating reforms may be warranted.

At a higher level of ambition, Congress could create legal requirements for agencies to engage in policy evaluation, either of specific programs or more broadly. The most extensive ex-post analysis of environmental policy making that has been carried out to date was prompted by section 812 of the Clean Air Act Amendments of 1990. In response to this congressional directive, the Environmental Protection Agency developed considerable expertise and dedicated significant resources to estimating the costs and benefits of air quality policies. Similar mandates could be effective, especially if coupled with additional funding and facilitating reforms. Legislative mandates would require agencies to devote at least some of their finite agenda space to ex-post evaluation, and, based on prior experience, would likely result in agencies accessing the expertise needed to carry out these evaluations in a rigorous fashion. Mandates would also clarify that agencies have authority to carry out ex-post evaluations.

A further measure at a similar level of ambition would be the creation of a specialized group of policy evaluation experts, within the Executive Office of the President, tasked with coordinating and facilitating ex-post evaluation efforts. Ideally, such a Policy Evaluation Group (PEG) would operate across a wide range of agencies (not only those with environmental portfolios), would be structured to be as politically neutral as possible, and would serve a supporting, rather than overseeing, role. The primary function of the PEG would be to provide human resources and expertise for agencies that are interested in engaging in policy evaluations. In this way, it would address issues of funding and expertise. A reform along these lines could also help increase the perceived trustworthiness of ex-post evaluations, given that outside experts would be part of the team that designed and implemented the analyses.

A more ambitious step that Congress could take would be the creation of a National Institute for Policy Evaluation and Review (NIPER), modeled on other scientific funding institutes. This new agency would fund collaborations between academic institutions and government agencies to engage in large-scale policy evaluations designed to identify and address key areas of uncertainty across a range of policymaking domains. Environmental policies would be one of several portfolios that could be overseen by a funding agency of this kind, which could also support research in areas such as education and criminal justice. A NIPER-like entity would have considerable potential to address most of the barriers to ex-post evaluation.

Finally, Congress could contemplate deeper statutory reforms designed to encourage agencies to integrate the results from ex-post evaluations into regulatory decisionmaking. Ex-post evaluations are only useful if they provide information that serves as an input into agency decisionmaking. However, the laborious rulemaking process, which includes litigation and the attendant risk of judicial invalidation of agency decisions, means that agencies are not well-poised to update rules based on new information. Recent moves by the US Supreme Court to reduce agency discretion has further constrained the ability of agencies to act on the information from ex-post evaluations. Congress may wish to contemplate legislation to ensure that the process of judicial review does not interfere unduly with flexible and responsive agency decisionmaking.

Reforms of some significant ambition are likely needed to address barriers that, for decades, have inhibited ex-post evaluation. But such reforms require considerable study and coalition building before they would become politically feasible. For this reason, we recommend that Congress begin by creating a Commission on Policy Evaluation, modeled on the successful Commission on Evidence-Based Policy Making. This new Commission would be charged with studying policy evaluation across the federal government, examining state and comparative analogies, and consulting with experts to generate a set of concrete recommendations for additional congressional action. The Commission would help generate the knowledge base necessary to support well-informed congressional action and could also act as a forum for bipartisan coalition building.",https://media.rff.org/images/shutterstock_2447977967.width-600.png,N,,2025-11-03 19:04:54.330101

This story is republished as part of our partnership with Inside Climate News.

A company with connections to the cryptocurrency industry is considering drilling for natural gas near the Deep River north of Sanford in Lee County.

If approved, the project would be the first commercial well drilled into the Triassic Basin, a natural gas repository underlying North Carolina and other Eastern Seaboard states.

Deep River Data, based in Alamance County, is interested in accessing gas from Butler Well No. 3, just south of U.S. Highway 421 near the Lee-Chatham county line, according to emails obtained under public records law.

Company adviser Dan Spuller, who is both a crypto entrepreneur and a natural gas landman, contacted the state Oil & Gas Commission in September about applying for a drilling unit, a parcel of land where drilling would occur. He said the natural gas would be for a data center to power “AI workloads,” not crypto mining. Both applications are energy-intensive, running server farms around the clock to power streams of computer computations.

“We want to submit a packet that is complete on first impression—avoiding delays and making the Commission’s review as straightforward as possible,” Spuller wrote.

Duke Energy recently projected data centers could add nearly 6 gigawatts to demand in North Carolina, which has prompted the construction of new natural gas plants and pipelines, major sources of planet-warming methane and carbon dioxide.

Methane, which leaks upstream from well heads, pipelines, and compressor stations, traps 86 times more heat over 20 years than carbon dioxide, the primary greenhouse gas, which power plants emit when burning fossil fuels.

Nationwide, some data centers have not only tapped into the grid but revived shuttered coal and nuclear plants for their power. The Lee County project would tap into the natural gas reserves in the Deep River Basin, which spans 150 miles over 11 counties in central and southern North Carolina.

Spuller told Inside Climate News the company will use conventional drilling, rather than fracking, to produce the gas. Fracking is a particularly destructive type of extraction. It requires horizontal drilling beneath the ground and often uses toxic chemicals mixed with large volumes of water injected at high pressures to crack the shale formations and free the gas trapped within small fissures.

Fracking is legal in North Carolina, but has never been deployed. Lee County enacted two-year fracking moratoria in 2017 and in 2019; both have expired.

“We are evaluating whether the well can safely and efficiently produce gas using conventional methods,” Spuller said. “It remains in a pre-feasibility phase—we are still evaluating whether development is even viable. Nothing has been approved, permitted or built.”

Butler Well No. 3 was drilled vertically in 1998 to a depth of 2,655 feet, according to a 2011 report by the North Carolina Geological Survey. The well lies within a geological region of black shale and old coal deposits, a legacy of the area’s mining history.

“The Oil and Gas Commission must look carefully at this proposal to exploit the gas well near the Deep River, as well as those who want to develop it,” said Therese Vick of the Blue Ridge Environmental Defense League. “It is incumbent on the commission to do its due diligence. Having worked with communities in Lee and Chatham Counties for over a decade, my concerns are many.”

Depending on their size, data centers can also consume enormous amounts of water to cool their computer servers. The project would be less than a tenth of a mile from the Deep River and Patterson Creek.

Spuller said water use “would be minimal” and that “there are no plans to withdraw water from the Deep River.”

The project could tap into groundwater or a public water main that runs along the north side of U.S. Highway 421.

The company is considering closed-loop systems and other sustainable options, he said. Some closed-loop systems, however, use more energy to run the coolers.

The project will likely need standard utility interconnections, Spuller said, such as electricity, fiber and “basic access roads typical of small-scale data facilities. There are no heavy-industrial or extraction components proposed.”

The state Geological Survey noted that Butler Well No. 3 is located within three and a half miles of a 6-inch distribution line to the Sanford Industrial Park, “which has large volume gas users.”

Stephanie Stephens, the Deep River Riverkeeper, said she’s concerned the project could be a harbinger of more data centers along the Carolina Core, an area that includes Sanford and is targeted for economic development.

“We would like to be choosy about the types of industry that come in,” she said.

The proposed data center would also be near the new Boone Trail kayak and canoe access site.

The Deep River is a troubled waterway. Nearly 23 miles are on the federal impaired waters list, and it contains 1,4-Dioxane, a likely carcinogen, discharged from the City of Asheboro’s wastewater treatment plant. Another 131 miles of tributaries to the river are also impaired, state records show.

“We already have a polluted river,” Stephens said.

Lee County records show Butler Well No. 3 is on a 643-acre forested tract owned by Ed Myrick of Pompano Beach, Florida. However, Dan Butler, who lives in Southern Pines, purchased the mineral rights beneath that property in 1975 from the previous land owner, Weyerhauser, the timber company.

Butler owns more than 2,700 acres of mineral rights in Lee County, state records show.

Since 1998, several companies have conducted exploratory drilling of Butler Well No. 3. However, given the comparatively small amount of gas and lack of a pipeline to transport it, they determined it wasn’t economically feasible and abandoned their projects.

Butler is a third-generation oil and gas developer. His grandparents were born in western Pennsylvania, where he owns “oil wells being drilled by the hundreds in the Alleghany State Forest,” according to a transcript of his comments at a 2012 Legislative Research Commission meeting.

Butler’s father, Howard, was the superintendent of the Coal Glen Mine in Chatham County in 1925 when it exploded and killed 53 men.

It’s uncertain whether the property, which currently allows residential and agricultural uses, would need to be rezoned. There are no provisions for data centers in Lee County’s current unified development ordinance, said County Zoning Administrator Thomas Mierisch. The UDO went into effect in 2006, before data centers and cryptomines “were really a thing,” Miersch said.

Spuller became a registered landman in North Carolina in 2021, according to state Department of Environmental Quality records. In this capacity Spuller can negotiate business agreements for exploration or development of natural gas.

Although Deep River Data officials also work for other cryptocurrency interests, Spuller said the project would not be a cryptomine. “It is envisioned as a modular data-infrastructure project” that would include AI workloads and other compute-intensive research, he said.

Deep River Data was incorporated on April 30, according to the North Carolina Secretary of State business registry. The company’s officers work in cryptocurrency: Spuller, Dan Fisher and Gerald Wilkie, Jr. A separate Wilkie-run enterprise, HM Tech, which operates out of a large, blue warehouse on South Maple Street in Graham, is listed as a “managing member” of Deep River Data.

HM Tech is a bitcoin mining facility and repair center. Two other top executives, Alun Williams and Murray Stahl, are with Horizon Kinetics, a New York-based investment firm whose funds include cryptocurrency.

Wilkie was among 55 cryptocurrency company representatives who signed a letter in 2022 to U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Michael Regan disputing the industry’s environmental harm. Two dozen congressional Democrats had previously sent a letter to Regan expressing their “serious concerns regarding reports that cryptocurrency facilities across the country are polluting communities and are having an outsized contribution to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Wilkie signed the letter in his role as founder and president of HMTech.

“There are no pollutants, including carbon dioxide, released by digital asset mining,” the cryptocurrency companies wrote. “Associated emissions are a function of electricity generation, which is a consequence of policy choices and economic realities shaping the nature of the electrical grid. Digital asset miners simply buy electricity that is made available to them on the open market, just the same as any industrial buyer.

“It is imperative that elected officials in the United States recognize that bitcoin … is the most important financial, economic, and accounting innovation in the history of humanity.”

Wilkie did not respond to an email and voicemail from Inside Climate News requesting an interview.

In addition to Deep River Data, Spuller is the executive vice president of industry aﬀairs for the Blockchain Association, headquartered in Washington, D.C. However, Deep River Data is separate from that work, he said.

Earlier in his career, Spuller worked as the communications director for former Republican Gov. Pat McCrory’s inaugural committee. Spuller parlayed that connection for a marketing position at the state Department of Commerce, according to his LinkedIn page, where he worked closely with the Office of the Commissioner of Banks to help negotiate and pass the North Carolina Money Transmitters Act of 2016.

Former Lt. Gov. Dan Forest appointed Spuller to the North Carolina Blockchain Initiative in 2019, where he was a co-chairman and member until this year. From 2016 to 2020, he led membership and growth at the Chamber of Digital Commerce.

On October 20, Spuller, representing the Blockchain Association, and Eric Peterson, senior government affairs manager at Kraken Digital Assets Exchange, appeared before the first state House Select Committee on Blockchain and Digital Assets.

They were advocating for legislation favorable to stablecoin, which is considered less volatile than other types of cryptocurrency. It can also be used to transfer funds between different crypto tokens.

Spuller was urging the passage of House Bill 92, the North Carolina Digital Assets Investment Act. It would authorize the state treasurer to invest a portion of public funds in the digital assets, study employment employee investment options, and evaluate the creation of a state-level digital asset reserve.

This measure passed the House earlier this year, but is still waiting for Senate approval.

“Hopefully they will pass it because I think that would also send really a fantastic message to the global economy that our state’s open for business,” Spuller said. “There’s no reason not to pass that. That would be on my wish list.”",https://www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Untitled-design.png,N,,2025-11-03 17:02:05.627399

You know, our goal is still to maximize coverage, reliability and accessibility to EV charging across the state,"" she said.
He said he would like to see Indiana use that funding to address concerns about the charging program that advocates have raised over the years.
Abdul-Rahman said having EV chargers could also reduce emissions in those communities.","The state is moving forward with its plans to place electric vehicle chargers along Indiana's interstates. The Indiana Department of Transportation paused the federally-funded program in February while awaiting new guidance from the Trump administration.

The goal of the program is to reduce the fear that EV travelers will run out of battery life before reaching a charging station. The Trump administration originally sought to rescind funding for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program, but changed course after facing lawsuits.

Among other things, the new guidance no longer requires chargers to be placed every 50 miles and within one mile of an interchange or major corridor.

Natalie Garrett with INDOT said this will help get chargers installed more quickly — potentially in places with less access. She said locations may have to change if some of the 2024 awardees are no longer interested in hosting an EV charging station.

""I think overall, improved flexibility is a benefit. You know, our goal is still to maximize coverage, reliability and accessibility to EV charging across the state,"" she said.

Garrett said the process ""streamlined and simplified"" Indiana's plan. States also no longer have to address several things under the new guidance, including ""consumer protections, emergency evacuation plans, environmental siting, resilience and terrain considerations.""

David Konisky is a professor at the O'Neill School of Public and Environmental Affairs at Indiana University in Bloomington. He said the new guidance is not ideal, but getting more chargers on the road is the most important thing at this early stage — and the gaps in coverage could be filled in later.

""Right now across the United States and here in Indiana, they're just not enough of these fast chargers — what were called 'level three chargers' — to really facilitate the driving of electric vehicles, especially on long trips,"" Konisky said.

The guidance was also stripped of references to diversity initiatives. Indiana is no longer required to engage with minority and women-owned businesses or make sure chargers benefit disadvantaged communities.

Jorden Giger is the assistant director of project outreach for the nonprofit Black Sun Light Sustainability.

""There's going to have to be intentional organizing, you know, on the part of organizations like ours, minority business associations to be able to connect diverse businesses to the opportunities,"" he said.

Giger said 10 percent of the NEVI funding is set aside for technical assistance for states. He said he would like to see Indiana use that funding to address concerns about the charging program that advocates have raised over the years.

The new guidance also encourages the chargers to be located ""at retail locations with onsite amenities that could provide safe locations and restrooms."" The Federal Highway Administration doesn't spell out what it means by ""safe locations.""

Denise Abdul-Rahman is Black Sun Light Sustainability's CEO and founder. She is also the state chair for environmental climate justice for the NAACP of Indiana.

""So just wondering what that will mean to make sure that communities that aren't invested in — and may be considered unsafe areas — can still benefit from these economic investments and all of the benefits that come with that,"" Abdul-Rahman said.

People looking to charge their EVs may spend money food or shopping while they wait for a charge. Abdul-Rahman said having EV chargers could also reduce emissions in those communities.

Garrett said INDOT is still going to take the public feedback it received about the Charging the Crossroads program into account as it moves forward.

Black Sun Light Sustainability will hold an event to connect INDOT with diverse contractors on Friday, Dec. 12 at The Nest Event Center in Indianapolis from 2:30 p.m. to 7:30 p.m.

The Las Vegas Convention Center during Industry Week is typically alive with the roar of muscle cars and the smell of high-octane fuel, but Jeff noticed that the exhibit areas were instead filled with silent, humming displays of onboard diagnostics, telematics and computer-driven systems.

At one booth, a representative for a new in-car network — labeled a digital “nervous system” — proudly explained how its technology would restrict access to vehicle data, reserving it exclusively for licensed, factory-certified technicians.

A chill went down Jeff’s spine. This was about more than diagnostics; it was about locking independent service and repair shops out of the system entirely. A simple wrench, he realized, would no longer fix a software glitch. This wasn’t just a change in technology; it was a technological chokehold on his livelihood.

An Alliance of the Unlikely

Jeff remembered that one of his customers had been struggling with a recurring electrical issue in a new vehicle, a problem his scanners simply could not diagnose. He called a friend at the dealership, who sheepishly admitted the new diagnostic software was proprietary and not shared. Frustrated and at a dead end, Jeff posted his problem on LinkedIn, Facebook and YouTube.

Eleanor Vance works for the Federal Bureau of Automotive Regulation. For years, her job has involved drafting and enforcing rules for safety, emissions and fuel efficiency. But as she walked through the exhibits, she recognized that the data-driven revolution was more than making cars safer and greener — it was a power grab for control.

Eleanor was searching for examples of technological barriers hindering automotive shops while she toured the convention center exhibits. Her search led her to the same forum where Jeff had been. Intrigued, she sent him a private message introducing herself.

Jeff was skeptical but desperate enough to agree to a video call. Eleanor listened intently as Jeff explained his predicament. She explained her own concerns about the industry’s direction. An unlikely alliance between Jeff and Eleanor resulted, united by the need to preserve an open market.

The Regulator’s Revelation

Eleanor saw the booth presentations, watching as automakers built digital fences around their vehicles’ information. She spoke with a supplier whose frustration was obvious. The supplier complained that without access to proprietary codes, obtaining parts was almost impossible.

Coincidently, she overheard a conversation between Jeff and a younger technician — a moment that reinforced her growing concern. They discussed how independent technicians were losing business to dealerships because they could not access the same proprietary information.

Eleanor realized the government’s role had to evolve. Regulations designed for a world of replacement parts were now obsolete. She envisioned a future where independent shops like Jeff’s would become relics.

A monopoly on repair would mean higher costs and fewer choices for consumers. She began to formulate a plan to protect auto shops. Energized by the growing “Right to Repair” movement, she listened to a gathering of independent shops and repair advocates.

Their strategy was simple but spirited: focus on what AI could not yet do. They would specialize in the “ghosts in the machine” — the problems that were too complex or obscure to solve.

The Lawmaking Battle

Eleanor began drafting legislation, dubbed the “Automotive Data Access and Repair Act.” It was not an easy sell; lobbyists from major manufacturers began contacting her office. They argued that providing proprietary data would compromise safety and intellectual property, claiming independent shops were not prepared for complex repairs and that only factory-certified technicians could perform them.

Meanwhile, Jeff became the public face of a movement. He started a popular video series called “What the Code Won’t Tell You.” He highlighted the frustrating situations faced by independent shops. His simple and heartfelt videos gained a massive online following, showing a knowledgeable technician forced to turn away customers simply because of a digital lock. This grassroots support, fueled by frustrated consumers, provided Eleanor with the public pressure she needed.

The turning point came during a congressional hearing. Jeff testified about the problem, showing a video of a car that was towed to his shop. He then displayed the incomprehensible code from the vehicle’s onboard computer.

“This,” he said, holding up a small, worn-out wrench, “used to be the tool for understanding. Now, this is what we have.” He held up his generic scanner, which could only read surface-level problems. “The dealerships have the full book. We just have the cover.”

Jeff’s shop became a case study for the success of a new model. His team, now certified “AI-Assisted Technicians,” used artificial intelligence to analyze sensor data and predict part failures before they occurred, offering initiative-taking maintenance. They were no longer just fixing vehicles; they were preventing breakdowns from happening, building long-term relationships with customers.

The government’s role had shifted from a clumsy regulator to a nimble facilitator, fostering an environment where innovation and human ingenuity could coexist. Artificial Intelligence became a job-enhancer, not a job-killer, and the independent shop became more essential than ever.

Epilogue

Jeff’s shop flourished. With the new regulations, he was able to invest in advanced training and software, and his team became specialists in the very technologies that had once threatened to put him out of business. He even partnered with a local community college, creating a pipeline to train the next generation of technicians.

Takeaway:

This automotive service and repair tale is not a story of death but one of evolution and resilience. While the rise of EVs and computer driven systems presents significant challenges, it also creates new opportunities.

For savvy managers that embrace new technologies, diversify their services, and invest in their workforce, the future is still positive. Meanwhile, auto shops that do not adapt will face increasing pressure from market trends and competitors.

There is no single “Federal Bureau of Automotive Regulation,” but the primary federal agencies that regulate the automotive industry are the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) setting Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS). Other relevant agencies include the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) for commercial vehicles and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) for consumer protection in auto sales.

Solar power is far from unprofitable.

According to N.C. DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson, providing communities with solar power would improve North Carolina’s resiliency to natural disasters.
Transitioning our energy supply from finite resources like coal, oil and gas to infinitely renewable sources, like solar power, isn’t some uppity environmentalist principle — it’s an inevitability.","The Environmental Protection Agency is joining the fight against climate change — on the side of climate change — and it’s costing you money.

This August, citing governmental “self-dealing and conflicts of interest,” EPA administrator Lee Zeldin terminated the $7 billion “Solar for All” program, denying state environmental regulatory agencies funds that would have been used to install rooftop solar power systems in low-income communities. $156 million within this program had been allocated to the North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality, which had already initiated implementation plans.

Last week, North Carolina, along with 21 other states, sued the EPA for terminating the Solar for All program, arguing that the EPA did not have the authority to rescind these funds that had already been appropriated by Congress.

Zeldin’s vision of the EPA is of an agency that “will be an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars” dedicated to its “core mission of protecting human health and the environment, not a frivolous spender in the name of ‘climate equity.’” Does the health of low-income communities and their environment not count? Trussed up in cost-cutting, corruption-culling rhetoric, the EPA’s choice is nothing more than a capitulation to the oil and gas industry.

Solar power is far from unprofitable. If Solar for All had been implemented, N.C. DEQ anticipated helping more than 12,000 households install solar panels, saving North Carolinians an average of $400 on monthly utility bills. The installation process would have created about 140 jobs, concentrated in rural parts of our state, which would encourage economic development.

But Solar for All wouldn’t just have saved money, it could have saved lives. According to N.C. DEQ Secretary Reid Wilson, providing communities with solar power would improve North Carolina’s resiliency to natural disasters. Solar panels would give households and businesses access to independent power sources, so during catastrophes like Hurricane Helene, critical emergency services could be kept running if the main power grid fails. Not only would quotidian utility bills be cheaper, but in times of crisis, lives could be saved. Calling aid to North Carolinians' “frivolous climate equity spending” is more than plain mean — it violates the EPA’s mission to protect human health and the environment.

The lawsuit against the EPA illustrates a broader struggle against federal attempts to appease corporate interests at the expense of Americans. In September, Zeldin announced the EPA’s plan to deregulate the fossil fuel industry in favor of “beautiful clean coal.” America is the fourth-largest global producer of coal. People depend on this industry for economic stability. But coal is finite, and the industry is in decline. Far from “clean,” coal is one of the dirtiest energy sources: It worsens climate change by emitting carbon dioxide, causes air pollution, creates coal ash contamination, produces acid rain and much more. The cost of cleaning up these externalities far outweighs the short-term profit of mining, but short-term profits seem to be the only thing with which Zeldin and the other 40 Trump administration picks with direct ties to the oil, gas and coal industries are concerned.

We will run out of coal. Transitioning our energy supply from finite resources like coal, oil and gas to infinitely renewable sources, like solar power, isn’t some uppity environmentalist principle — it’s an inevitability. “The long run is a misleading guide to current affairs. In the long run we are all dead,” wrote economistJohn Maynard Keynes, but even Keynes would agree that a bit of long-term planning is necessary for when we run out of the resource that powers society. The EPA’s choice to abandon the transition to renewable energy and instead deregulate and subsidize “beautiful clean coal” reflects short-term, profit-seeking nihilism that will only harm Americans — be it their pockets or their health — in the long-run.",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dth/21604d47-6aba-4030-851b-8c60c67df408.sized-1000x1000.png?w=800&fit=crop&crop=faces%2Cedges&ar=16%3A9,N,,2025-11-03 15:20:35.705928
,Texas Environment,2025-11-03 20:08:08+00:00,National Taxpayers Union,Stopping Tax Increases Before They Start: Texans Decide on Propositions 2 and 6,Alexander Ciccone,,,,,https://www.ntu.org/publications/detail/stopping-tax-increases-before-they-start-texans-decide-on-propositions-2-and-6,"With no state income tax on individuals or corporations, investment is flocking to the Lone Star State and boosting industries throughout the state’s economy.
Proposition 2 would prohibit the state of Texas from imposing a tax on realized or unrealized capital gains of individuals, estates, and trusts.
Capital gains taxes apply to profits from investments like stocks, real estate, or other assets.
This ensures households and businesses can plan, invest, and save without the threat of new capital gains taxes being enacted in the future.
By banning both capital gains taxes and occupation taxes on securities, Propositions 2 and 6 will create the regulatory certainty that will allow capital markets to thrive in Texas.","When it comes to protecting taxpayers and ensuring people keep as much of their hard-earned money as possible, Texas usually leads the way. With no state income tax on individuals or corporations, investment is flocking to the Lone Star State and boosting industries throughout the state’s economy.

This November, Texas voters will decide on two pro-taxpayer ballot measures that would bolster the state’s reputation as the best place to do business in the country by prohibiting taxes on capital gains and financial transactions. Together, Propositions 2 and 6 will safeguard financial security, promote investment, and maintain a business-friendly climate that supports growth and innovation.

Proposition 2 would prohibit the state of Texas from imposing a tax on realized or unrealized capital gains of individuals, estates, and trusts. Capital gains taxes apply to profits from investments like stocks, real estate, or other assets. Since Texas does not currently levy a state-wide capital gains tax, Proposition 2 acts as a preventative measure that ties the hands of lawmakers who would try to raise taxes. This ensures households and businesses can plan, invest, and save without the threat of new capital gains taxes being enacted in the future.

Proposition 6 builds on this by banning taxes on securities transactions, like stock trades, and blocking occupation taxes on those working in the securities industry, including banks, brokers, and dealers. Like Proposition 2, it preemptively blocks tax hikes and creates certainty for investors and businesses, ensuring routine investment activity isn’t subject to unpredictable levies. Together, these measures create a stable tax environment that supports entrepreneurship and cements Texas’s reputation as a state that is open for business.

A quick survey of the state’s tax system illustrates why these two ballot measures are especially important for taxpayers. Texas relies primarily on sales and property taxes to fund government operations. Local governments, including school districts, counties, and cities, collect property taxes to pay for public services. By banning the imposition of capital gains and securities taxes in the future, Propositions 2 and 6 shield taxpayers from new financial burdens and prevent the gradual expansion of the state’s tax base.

A simple, predictable tax system is a cornerstone of a thriving economy. Businesses make decisions on where to expand their operations based on local tax climate, regulatory certainty, and the ability to reinvest profits without interference. By enshrining these safeguards into state law, Texas signals to entrepreneurs and investors alike that it values long-term capital formation and innovation. This ensures Texas maintains a competitive edge over other states that may be raising taxes or adopting more aggressive regulatory policies.

Other states’ missteps demonstrate why Propositions 2 and 6 are so important for taxpayers. Proposals for financial transaction taxes in New York and New Jersey during the COVID-19 pandemic alarmed investors and jeopardized retirement accounts, even prompting discussions about moving the Nasdaq stock exchange to another state. Although both states ultimately abandoned those taxes, the episode illustrates the harm spendthrift lawmakers can do without adequate legal constraints on their powers.

The planned Texas Stock Exchange, backed by BlackRock and Citadel Securities, illustrates how the state is increasingly becoming a major player in the financial sector to better compete with states like New York and Illinois. By banning both capital gains taxes and occupation taxes on securities, Propositions 2 and 6 will create the regulatory certainty that will allow capital markets to thrive in Texas. Moreover, preempting these taxes ensures that a Texas-based stock exchange can flourish, attracting both capital and financial talent to the state.

Financial firms have already begun fleeing jurisdictions with heavy-handed tax and regulatory policies for more welcoming destinations. From 2019 to 2023, nearly 160 Wall Street firms moved their headquarters out of New York, taking approximately $1 trillion in assets under management with them. Capital is highly mobile, and states must be careful to craft business climates that actually reward risk-taking and entrepreneurship rather than drive it away.

These measures also protect taxpayers by promoting sound governance. By taking the option of new taxes off the table, lawmakers will be incentivized to manage existing resources more prudently, rather than seeking additional revenue through new levies. This approach will, in turn, encourage more responsible spending and enhance predictability for households and businesses alike.

Texas voters should carefully weigh the long-term fiscal implications of Propositions 2 and 6. These measures are more than technical tax reforms, they are a thoughtful decision about the kind of economy Texas wants to foster. Should voters approve them, Texas will maintain a competitive edge over high-tax states like New York and California all while putting the interests of taxpayers first.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2019/10/texas-state-capitol-4066441-1920.jpg?v=20191028111800,N,,2025-11-03 20:59:46.485395

The plant, operated by eVAC Magnetics LLC, is designed to produce neodymium-iron-boron and samarium-cobalt permanent magnets. The facility received federal support through a $111.9 million Qualified Advanced Energy Project Tax Credit and a Defense Production Act Title III grant.

The project expands U.S. manufacturing capacity for rare-earth magnets. Asia, especially China, currently supplies most of the global market. The Sumter County site will employ about 300 full-time workers. It will begin commercial production in early 2026.

eVAC Magnetics is part of Vacuumschmelze GmbH & Co. KG (VAC Group), a Germany-based producer of magnetic materials with facilities in Europe. The South Carolina operation will serve industrial and defense markets in North America.

Supply of high-purity rare-earth oxides

On November 3, 2025, Ucore Rare Metals Inc. signed an agreement with VAC and eVAC Magnetics. The deal strengthens North America’s rare-earth supply chain. The companies will connect Ucore’s refining sites in Louisiana and Ontario with eVAC’s magnet plant in South Carolina. Ucore will supply high-purity rare-earth oxides. eVAC will use them to produce permanent magnets for industrial and defense markets.

The partnership builds a regional production network and reduces reliance on Asian imports. It supports demand from electric vehicles and renewable energy systems. Executives say the plan creates one of the few closed-loop supply chains in North America.

Completion of the South Carolina facility adds momentum to U.S. efforts to expand critical-mineral production. Public and private investments continue to boost domestic refining and manufacturing capacity. Together, they reflect the nation’s shift toward electrification and cleaner energy technologies.

The platform’s NDC Tracker, launched at COP29, provides a snapshot of progress on the new round of nationally determined contributions (NDCs). Countries were due to submit their updated NDCs, which map out national climate ambitions through 2035, in February 2025. As of today, 67 countries—representing 36% of global emissions—have submitted a new NDC, while 130 countries have yet to submit one. So far, this latest round boosts the emission reductions from the 2020 NDCs by 1.9 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent, equal to the annual emissions from roughly 500 coal-fired power plants.

NDC Breakdown: Notably missing from the new NDC submissions are China and the EU. China, the world’s largest emitter, foreshadowed its NDC at the September 2025 UN General Assembly meeting, promising to peak emissions by 2030 and achieve net-zero emissions by 2060. Meanwhile, the EU, the world’s fourth-largest emitter, shared in September that its upcoming NDC is expected to include a 66.25-72.5% cut in emissions by 2035 and a net emissions reduction of 90% by 2040, both compared to 1990 levels.

Update on Global Stocktake Progress: A new report from the International Renewable Energy Agency, the COP30 Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance assesses global progress following the first global stocktake, which was agreed to at COP28. The resulting UAE Consensus established a goal to triple renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency efforts by 2030. The report finds that two years later, energy efficiency modifications in buildings have been nominal and renewable energy growth has fallen short—despite record-breaking renewable energy capacity being added to grids around the world.

EESI briefing: The First Global Stocktake

Climate Action off the Rails: Last week, WRI’s Systems Change Lab published the State of Climate Action 2025. The annual report uses 45 indicators to assess global progress on meeting the Paris Agreement goal of limiting warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F). The Systems Change Lab determined that, of the 45 indicators, 29 are “well off-track,” six are moving in the right direction but falling behind, five are going in the wrong direction completely, and there are insufficient data for the rest.

Granary of Solutions: Each year, the COP Presidency appoints a high-level climate champion responsible for advancing the “Action Agenda” around COP. The Action Agenda is designed to connect the negotiations to real-world, on-the-ground climate work. This year, it has six themes and 30 objectives, as well as a “Granary of Solutions” that provides case studies of “existing solutions [that] accelerate and scale up impact in alignment with the global stocktake and the goals of the Paris Agreement.” There is an open call for engagement, solutions, and input. In alignment with the Action Agenda, the Business Council for Sustainable Energy has created its own Granary of Solutions to highlight U.S. businesses leading the way on greenhouse gas emissions reductions at home and abroad.

About Stella Vita

Self-sufficient design: Stella Vita is built to be a self-sustaining ""house on wheels,"" using solar energy to power itself and its internal systems.

Travel and living: The solar panels on its roof provide enough energy for both driving and living, including cooking, running a fridge, and charging devices.

Pop-up roof: When parked, the roof slides up to provide standing room, and additional solar panels fold out to double the solar surface area for more efficient charging.

Aerodynamic shape: While driving, the roof collapses to create a more aerodynamic, teardrop shape that minimizes air resistance.

Range: On a sunny day, Stella Vita can travel approximately 730 km (about 453 miles) without needing to charge at a station.

Demonstration trip: The student team completed an 1,800+ mile road trip from the Netherlands to Tarifa, Spain, to demonstrate its capabilities

""Stella and its successors Stella Lux, Stella Vie and Stella Era are a series of solar racing family cars, built for the World Solar Challenge in Australia, sofar winning its Cruiser Class all four times it was held – in 2013, 2015, 2017 and in 2019. Stella is considered the world’s first solar-powered family car and was given the 'Best Technology Development' Award at the 8th annual Crunchies in San Francisco in 2015.

""Being the only competing vehicle with a license plate, the road registration of Stella contributed to the winning score in the races. The vehicles are designed and built by ""Solar Team Eindhoven"" (STE) — some 26 students of different faculties of the Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e) in the Netherlands. The group have set up a non-profit foundation to promote their concepts for practical solar vehicles for adoption on a broader scale."" (Wikipedia)

""Stella won the inaugural edition of the new for 2013, Michelin-sponsored Cruiser Class of the WSC, completing the 3,022 kilometres (1,878 mi) race distance in 40 hours and 14 minutes, at an average speed of 75 kilometres per hour (47 mph), while typically carrying three occupants, for a total of 9,093 occupant kilometres (5,651 passenger miles).

""The Stella is a very boxy, but low-built car. With only 1.15 metres (45 in) height, and its two large doors opening upwards, it is as tricky to get in and out of as a super-sportscar. However, once inside, reviewers found it surprisingly comfortable.

""The whole of the top of the car is covered in solar panels, and the rear slopes down to create a teardrop shape to reduce air resistance. The car weighs only 388 kilograms (855 lb) thanks to being constructed largely out of carbon-fiber, reinforced by welded aluminium tubing."" (Wikipedia)

Our Self-sustaining House On Wheels

""Stella Vita is our Self-Sustaining House On Wheels. A mobile home wherein you can live and work while travelling on the energy of the sun. Stella Vita generates energy through its solar panels on the roof and uses this energy for both driving and living,"" the Stella Vita official website says.

""Stella Vita generates enough solar energy to drive, shower, watch TV, charge your laptop and make coffee. You are completely self-sustaining and independent. Hereby, you are free to go wherever you want, without harming the environment.""

""It is fully equipped with living essentials including a double bed, sofa, kitchen area and a bathroom with a shower, sink and toilet. It can fit two people, who can drive, cook breakfast and watch television using just the vehicle’s solar-charged battery, according to its creators – 22 students at the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands,"" the CNN reports.

""The vehicle can typically travel up to 600 kilometers (373 miles) on its 60-kWh battery when fully charged, even at night and when it is cloudy.

""On a day when the sun is shining throughout, its range increases by an extra 130 kilometers (81 miles). The team drove approximately 300 kilometers (186 miles) between each destination, at a top speed of 120 kilometers (75 miles) per hour.""

""A group of 22 coeds working under the name Solar Team Eindhoven has just unveiled Stella Vita, the world’s first entirely solar-powered camper, according to Ars Technica,"" the Robb Report says.

""The vehicle features a pop-up roof lined with solar panels that the students claim produce enough electricity to travel over 450 miles in a single day.

""The Stella Vita, which the team calls a self-sustaining “house on wheels,” features a teardrop design that slopes dramatically in the rear. It’s not the most aesthetically pleasing of designs, but the long roof provides plenty of surface area for solar panels.""

""The vehicle has a pop-up roof lined with solar panels that is said to generate enough electricity to cover 730 kilometers in a day.

Stella Vita is described as a self-sustainable motor home. It features a design with a sloping roof to increase the surface area of ​​the solar panels,"" the Telegrafi says.

""Two separate towers below the roofline protrude from either side of the vehicle, effectively doubling the surface area of ​​the solar panels to 17.5 square meters. Inside there is a small cooking area with a solar-powered fridge, as well as a toilet, a sofa and a full-sized bed with space for two adults.

""It was created by a group of 22 students from the Eindhoven University of Technology in the Netherlands, working under the name Solar Team Eindhoven.""

""The world's first fully self-sufficient 'house on wheels' - designed and developed by students from Eindhoven University of Technology - will arrive in Tarifa, the southernmost tip of Spain, on Friday. This means that Solar Team Eindhoven has reached the final destination of its tour from the Netherlands to Spain on energy from the sun. The student team organised the trip to show the future of sustainable mobility with their self-built green campervan,"" the Eindhoven University of Technology says.

""In one and a half years, Solar Team Eindhoven designed and built Stella Vita, as the futuristic-looking vehicle is called. The solar vehicle has a roof that slides up electrically when standing still, giving you a standing height of 2.5 metres.

""This makes it easy to stand inside to cook, sleep or work. Additional solar panels fold out when the roof is up, doubling the solar surface area to a whopping 17.5 square metres.""

Docket ID No: EPA-HQ-OAR-2025-0186

Introduction

Business Roundtable appreciates the opportunity to provide comments on the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reconsider and remove program obligations for most source categories under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP) and suspend program obligations for other sources until reporting year 2034.

Business Roundtable remains concerned by the growing risks from global climate change, including significant economic risks (e.g., technological and market shifts and regulatory and policy risks). Business Roundtable member companies are leading by example, developing and deploying ambitious emissions reduction plans, and exporting innovative technologies that will help lower emissions in the United States and globally, while simultaneously spurring innovation, manufacturing and economic growth. Business Roundtable looks forward to helping advance policies that leverage U.S. leadership, competitiveness and innovation to mitigate the impacts of global climate change while growing our economy.

Business Roundtable welcomes the Administration’s commitment to addressing burdensome regulations, including paperwork and reporting burdens. However, we are concerned that a sudden change to the current program could result in piecemeal, duplicative, incomplete and more burdensome greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting obligations for U.S. companies that also disadvantage them globally. We urge EPA to carefully consider options that would allow the GHGRP reporting framework to continue so that it is not inadvertently recreated at an even greater expense to U.S. business in a scattershot, non-uniform way via other state and foreign governmental avenues. We also urge the agency to hear from stakeholders directly and indirectly affected by the agency’s actions and take the necessary steps to coordinate across federal agencies that would also face impacts from the proposal.

GHGRP Data is a Critical Tool for Various Reporting, Disclosure and Compliance Obligations

The GHGRP provides standardized, facility-level emissions data that U.S. companies have relied on for effective regulatory enforcement, tax credit administration, international trade compliance and voluntary disclosures. The proposed changes risk fragmenting emissions reporting across the U.S. economy, introducing regulatory uncertainty and upending an existing process for international trade compliance, particularly for U.S. exports. The comprehensive data set that GHGRP provides, including current emissions levels and historical trends, is also important for helping to prevent ill-informed policies from being adopted.

GHGRP data is central to the administration of the 45Q tax credit for carbon capture, utilization and storage (CCUS).2 Under current IRS rules, CO₂ injected into secure geologic storage qualifies only if verified under Subpart RR with an EPA-approved monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) plan. Removing this pathway would potentially jeopardize sequestration projects, create regulatory uncertainty and chill investment. This would undermine the recently passed One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) that preserved 45Q and increased the value of the credit in some circumstances. At a minimum, elimination of GHGRP will require the IRS to amend its regulations to require new monitoring, reporting and verification protocols—prior to EPA finalizing this rule. Timing is of the essence to ensure the left hand is aware of the right hand’s actions, such that a gap between changes does not undermine investments in major infrastructure projects, including projects based on 45Q credits that taxpayers are relying on in the 2025 tax year.

Other credits such as 45V (clean hydrogen), 40B (sustainable aviation fuel), 45Z (clean fuel production credit) and 48C (advanced energy projects credit) rely on emissions factors from Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) Greenhouse gases, Regulated Emissions, and Energy use in Technologies (GREET) model,3 which uses this federally verified GHGRP data as a key input. It is unclear how this data can be replicated in a cost effective or timely way should EPA remove GHGRP obligations, thus creating uncertainty for past, current and future investment decisions relying on these credits. Again, if EPA were to move forward with a final rule that prevents companies from utilizing GHGRP data to claim inextricably linked federal tax credits, Business Roundtable would encourage ample time be afforded to stakeholder engagement to build consensus with private businesses that have relied on U.S. tax policies enacted and sustained with bipartisan support in Congress, which could be abruptly undermined if EPA does not engage across government agencies, particularly with the Department of Treasury in this instance.

Elimination of GHGRP Likely Will Result in Piecemeal Reporting Obligations That Are Incompatible, Incomplete and More Expensive

GHGRP provides a trusted dataset used by state regulators and private companies. If GHGRP obligations were to cease, some states can be expected to step into the void and promulgate their own data collection and reporting obligations. These new requirements, adopted on a piecemeal state-level basis, are at significant risk of becoming inconsistent, creating a cumbersome, balkanized and more expensive reporting obligation for companies subject to the requirements than if the current GHGRP were to continue as is.

EPA estimates the total cost of reporting to be $303 million per year, with subpart W reporting accounting for $256 million of the annual costs.4 Under EPA’s proposed rule, subpart W companies would be relieved of their reporting obligations until 2034.

Companies that are subject to GHGRP have made the necessary investments to monitor emissions, and capture and report the required data. One-time hardware and software investments and employee training necessary to be able to report the data required by GHGRP far exceed on-going costs associated with the program. While on-going reporting costs are not inconsequential, we would expect them to be significantly less than the costs that would be incurred by businesses if they are required to recreate and comply with differing monitoring and reporting obligations likely to emerge at the state and international level if GHGRP were to end. This fragmented reporting system would in turn result in higher costs and less data consistency than if the current GHGRP was left in place. Simply put, the result of the repeal of the GHGRP will be to impose costs that are likely to far exceed the estimated savings associated with repealing the current program in exchange for a sub-optimal, inconsistent, fragmented reporting system.

U.S. Competitiveness in Foreign Markets Would be Undermined

U.S. exports of energy-intensive products would be disadvantaged under the proposed rule. Data transparency provides the backbone of the U.S. competitive position on energy dominance. Credible and verified GHGRP data is vital for U.S. competitiveness in global markets, especially with the European Union’s carbon border adjustment mechanism (CBAM), low carbon fuel (LCF) and methane regulations. Without federally verified GHGRP data, U.S. exporters may face default emissions penalties, higher compliance costs and loss of market access. The United States is Europe’s largest Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) supplier and a major oil exporter to these markets. Moreover, without the GHGRP data to demonstrate our manufacturing emissions profile, the United States may end up with a higher default value under CBAM, thereby undermining U.S. competitiveness in Europe. The net result of eliminating GHGRP could inadvertently harm U.S. competitiveness by weakening exports and run counter to the President’s “Energy Dominance” agenda.

EPA Should Maintain GHGRP as a Voluntary Program if it Determines the Clean Air Act (CAA) Cannot Legally Support a Mandatory Program

In its proposal, EPA indicated that it “considered the alternative of transitioning the GHGRP from mandatory to voluntary reporting” but ultimately rejected this option because it “could also result in submittal of incomplete or piecemeal reports, and the verification and accuracy of the data submitted would be limited.”5 EPA also concludes that “maintaining continuous or intermittent reporting under any of these source categories, including voluntary reporting, is inconsistent with CAA section 114 (emphasis added).”6

Business Roundtable believes EPA’s authority to administer a voluntary program is consistent with section 114. CAA section 114 allows EPA to collect emissions information for GHGs as the CAA contains an underlying statutory purpose to reduce “air pollutants” that can potentially be regulated under the CAA. EPA recently acknowledged its authority to regulate GHGs under the CAA, even if it declines to exercise such authority in the proposed rescission of the 2009 Endangerment Finding (“’Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate’” GHG emissions,7 quoting the Supreme Court’s decision in AEP v. Connecticut “The critical point is that Congress delegated to EPA the decision whether and how to regulate carbon-dioxide emissions from power plants.”).8

Business Roundtable maintains that EPA has the legal authority to regulate GHG emissions if it makes the requisite findings and closely hews any regulatory response to the limitations of the Clean Air Act. In Massachusetts v. EPA9 the Court determined that GHGs are covered by the CAA’s section 302(g) definition of “air pollutant,” and that therefore EPA can impose regulations of GHG emissions once the EPA makes the requisite findings under the CAA. Neither UARG v. EPA10 nor West Virginia v. EPA,11 two cases that struck down EPA’s expansive claims of authority to regulated GHGs, disturbed this central finding.

Although EPA asserts that “since 2011 [the EPA] has not used most of the information collected to carry out other provisions under the CAA”12, EPA can potentially use this information for regulation of GHGs. GHGRP supplies the data necessary for informed decision-making for deciding whether, when and how to regulate GHGs. Accordingly, we believe EPA retains the authority to regulate GHGs and as a corollary, to allow voluntary data collection efforts to inform the agency’s future regulatory efforts.

If EPA is concerned about incomplete data, it may still establish minimum standards for voluntary participation, and we encourage it to do so if it chooses to maintain a voluntary program.

EPA has experience with voluntary programs, including programs directly associated with greenhouse gas emissions.13 Retaining GHGRP as a voluntary program should not be unduly burdensome, nor is it inconsistent with EPA’s legal views regarding the limitations of section 114. Moreover, retention of GHGRP in some form will avoid the multiple rulemakings, inconsistent reporting obligations and international trade and regulatory uncertainty that will result if GHGRP is repealed.

Business Roundtable remains committed to working with the Administration to provide the certainty and predictability that American businesses need to thrive and compete, including by ensuring access to reliable, affordable energy.

SM Energy’s net income for Q3 fell despite an increase in oil production

Shares of SM Energy (SM) and Civitas Resources (CIVI) were trading higher in premarket on Monday, after the energy companies announced a merger agreement.

$12.8 Billion Combined Entity

SM Energy and Civitas Resources announced an all-stock transaction to create a combined oil and gas company with an enterprise value of about $12.8 billion. The merger is expected to close in the first quarter of 2026.

Under the deal, Civitas shareholders will receive 1.45 shares of SM Energy common stock for each Civitas share. SM Energy shareholders will own around 48% of the combined entity, while Civitas stockholders will own approximately 52%.

The merger combines an asset base of approximately 823,000 net acres, which includes the Permian Basin in the southern US. The basin is known for its rich petroleum and natural gas deposits.

The combined firm is expected to generate over $1.4 billion in free cash flow in 2025 and achieve an annual production value of $200 million, potentially rising to $300 million. The transaction is projected to be immediately accretive to key per-share metrics.

“This merger combines two premier operators and establishes a company with transformative scale in the highest-return U.S. shale basins. By combining two complementary portfolios, we expect to unlock significant free cash flow to strengthen our balance sheet, accelerate stockholder returns, and position us for sustainable growth through every cycle,” said Beth McDonald, President and Chief Operating Officer of SM Energy.

SM’s Q3 Results

Earlier in the day, SM Energy posted its Q3 results. Production in the third quarter totaled 19.7 million barrels of oil equivalent. Total daily production rose 26% while oil output jumped 47%. Net income for the quarter was $155.1 million, compared with $240.5 million a year earlier. The decline in earnings was mainly due to lower realized prices, reduced derivative gains, and higher depreciation, depletion, and amortization (DD&A) expenses.

What Are Stocktwits Users Saying?

The news of the merger prompted a shift in retail sentiment to ‘bullish’ from ‘neutral’ for both companies on Stocktwits.

SM Energy shares were up 2.9% at $21.5, while Civitas’ stock shot up 4.8% to $30.2.

Both stocks have been under heavy selling pressure this year, with CIVI’s stock declining 38.3% and SM’s shares tanking more than 47%.

Driving an electric vehicle could soon mean charging as you go. A new wireless charging pilot in France is showing how coils built into the road can transfer more than 300 kilowatts of power to moving EVs. This breakthrough could make long trips possible without stopping at a charging station.

The road that powers your vehicle

The technology comes from Electreon Wireless, working with Vinci Construction, Gustave Eiffel University, and Hutchinson. Together, they’ve installed about a one-mile stretch of road near Paris that can transfer energy to EVs in motion.

So far, the system has powered a truck, van, car, and bus-all equipped with special pickup coils. Early tests show the system can deliver peak power over 300 kW, and more than 200 kW under steady conditions. That’s strong enough to keep large cargo trucks rolling for miles without a pit stop.

Charging ahead: Why it matters

If widely adopted, dynamic wireless charging could change how America powers transportation. Heavy-duty trucks could use smaller, cheaper batteries. Delivery vehicles and buses could stay on the road longer with less downtime.

For drivers, it could mean never having to worry about range anxiety again. Instead of hunting for the nearest charger, the highway itself could be your power source.

The roadblocks ahead

The big questions now are about cost and control. Who pays to install these power roads? How much will it cost to use them? Public-private partnerships may hold the key, but until those details are ironed out, large-scale rollout remains a challenge.

Still, with global momentum building, it’s only a matter of time before dynamic wireless charging becomes part of everyday driving.

What this means for you

This innovation is not limited to Europe. In Detroit, Michigan, a public road on 14th Street already uses embedded charging coils that can send power to EVs as they move. In Indiana, Purdue University and the Indiana Department of Transportation are building a quarter-mile highway section designed to charge electric vehicles, including heavy trucks, while they travel.

For drivers, this technology could make owning an EV easier and more practical. Your vehicle could recharge during normal trips without the need to stop, plug in, or wait. That level of convenience could help expand EV adoption across the United States, lowering emissions and fuel costs for millions.

Kurt’s key takeaways

Wireless charging roads are moving from concept to construction and showing real promise for a new era of electric travel. The idea that vehicles could charge while driving has the potential to transform how we move goods, commute, and use energy. There are still big questions about who will fund widespread installation and how well the system will perform under real traffic and weather conditions. The technology is advancing fast, but scaling it will take time, collaboration, and investment. If these challenges can be overcome, dynamic wireless charging could redefine the way we think about mobility and sustainability.

In 2000, voting technology standards were in a much less developed and formalized state.
Since the 2000 election, the numbers for mail-in voting and early voting in person have continued to rise.","On the eve of another election, in addition to the party and candidate messages, there is a familiar air of dispute over how we run elections. Various states are considering mid-decade redistricting, and parties are disputing issues of voting technology, mail-in ballots, and noncitizens on the voting rolls. Despite what the presence of these debates in each election cycle might imply, America has dramatically improved its election system over the past few decades. Issues remain, but understanding them requires a look at the problems we have already resolved.

For many Americans, our current focus on election administration began 25 years ago, during the 2000 Bush versus Gore election, when the country got an education in election administration. This look behind the curtain of running elections was not pretty. The long recount process, court challenges, and political posturing revealed ballot design issues, inconsistent vote-counting standards, and questions about registration and overseas voters. It also unleashed a cacophony of conflicting information from various federal and state courts, local and state election administrators, and other public officials. Before 2000, average Americans thought little about these matters, and even the fields of election law and political science had mostly ignored the running of elections as a subject of study.

The good news, however, is that in the intervening 25 years, the way we run elections has changed dramatically for the better. Florida was not the only state that had imperfect election administration in 2000. A long recount to decide the presidency in many other states would have revealed similar issues. But to Florida’s credit, a sustained process of reform and improvement has now made it one of the model states for election administration.

In the aftermath of Bush v. Gore, Congress passed the bipartisan Help America Vote Act (HAVA). While impactful, this act was not a perfect piece of legislation, nor is it the sole reason for the dramatic changes we have seen since. But its passage—a substantial and truly bipartisan piece of legislation that emerged from a hotly disputed presidential election, roiled by a weeks-long recount and polarizing Supreme Court decision—was a feat that is hard to imagine today.

Among other things, HAVA provided billions of dollars to upgrade election technology (the first federal money ever spent on election administration), designed a process to develop voting technology standards for manufacturers, required states to upgrade their voter registration systems, and gave voters safeguards such as provisional ballots and error-checking mechanisms.

Tackling Voting Tech

The first area where American elections have seen dramatic improvement is in voting technology. In the 2000 election, a variety of election technologies proliferated. Infamously, punch card machines required the voter to punch out a perforated hole next to their candidate of choice. The resulting “hanging chads,” in which the ballot hole was not made cleanly and the paper chad hung on to the hole, and “pregnant chads,” in which a dimple was made but the ballot paper was not penetrated, came into the common lexicon during the recount. More troubling were the varying counting standards to deal with these anomalies and the potential deterioration of ballots in the counting process.

Other older technologies were banned, like lever machines, in which a voter would indicate their candidate of choice by moving levers on the wall of a physically imposing machine with a mechanically operated privacy curtain. The technology was loved by some voters, but in the end, the machines had no backup record of a vote, and the physical mechanisms were subject to breakage, sometimes unbeknownst to the voter and election officials, potentially losing votes not recorded properly.

The biggest changes to voting technology were initiated by HAVA, which essentially banned all voting technologies but two: scanning devices, similar to the machines that scan the results of multiple-choice tests on paper, and direct recording devices, which require an input on a screen like an ATM. The act provided billions of dollars for state and local jurisdictions to purchase new machines, often replacing years-old technologies.

But voting technology development took an unexpected turn after many of the initial systems were purchased and deployed. Critics in the voting world and the computer science community expressed concerns about the direct recording devices. In particular, they worried that, with only a touch screen entry, there was no paper record that voters could see and election officials could ultimately count, recount, and audit.

After the initial burst of purchases of these direct recording devices, the calls for a paper trail or paper backup won the day. These direct recording devices were either retrofitted to include a paper record that the voter could see or abandoned altogether in favor of scanning devices, in which a paper ballot is created, scanned by a machine, and retained. Today, the vast majority of votes cast (over 90 percent) have a paper record, and the remaining legacy direct-recording devices are likely on their way out in the next few years.

HAVA also initiated a process by which the testing and certification of voting technology could be improved. In 2000, voting technology standards were in a much less developed and formalized state. Some states had standards, and professional election administration associations made valiant efforts to develop standards. But HAVA created the US Election Assistance Commission—which, with the National Institute of Standards and Technology and advisers from across the country, develops voluntary standards. Many states use these standards in whole or in part.

These improvements have led to tangible results. After the 2000 election, experts from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and California Institute of Technology looked at the existing infrastructure and found it was losing many votes due to errors. Millions of ballots were thrown out due to “overvoting,” in which a voter selects two candidates for a race. Many others were potentially lost in “undervotes,” or ballot lines left blank or with marks that the voting technology did not pick up. Today, with the improvement of voting technology and HAVA’s requirement for systems that catch overvotes and sometimes identify undervotes, millions of ballots that would not have been counted before 2000 are successfully cast.

There are still issues with voting technology, and there is room for vigilance in looking for flaws in current technology and developing even better systems in the future. But we now have a country with many more ballots counted, improved standards and testing, and a paper backup for nearly all ballots.

Revamping Voter Registration

Beyond the voting technology itself, the way we register voters has matured substantially in recent decades. In 2000, only seven states had statewide, computerized voter registration systems. HAVA mandated that all states move toward these systems, and today, all states have since met this objective.

This improved infrastructure means that states can better keep their rolls accurate and up-to-date. The systems may also allow states to have a live connection to the voter registration database, facilitating services like check-in at polling locations. And it allows for the possibilities of vote centers, allowing voters to choose a location in their county to vote early, alleviating long lines on Election Day.

There are still many issues with voter registration, including how we perform voter list maintenance, the ways we register voters, and how we identify noncitizens on voting rolls. There is also no formal way to share data across states, even though some states do so voluntarily. But the leap forward since 2000 has been dramatic, and the computerization of our lists sets the stage for potential future improvements in all these areas.

Bolstering Mail-Ins Ballots and Early Voting

A development not directly related to the 2000 election is the growing adoption of voting by mail and early voting in person at polling sites.

In 2000, we were near the beginning of a trend toward greater mail-in and early voting in person—a trend that has only accelerated in ensuing years. In 2000, approximately 10 percent of the country voted by mail, and another 4 percent voted early at polling places. This was up from the pattern that prevailed for most of the second half of the 20th century, when less than 5 percent of voters cast absentee ballots and we had no measures of the small amounts of early voting at polling places. States in the West, starting with California, introduced no-excuse absentee voting in 1978. Two decades later, Oregon was the first state to adopt 100 percent mail-in voting. In the 1990s, Texas and Tennessee started some of the first early-voting programs at polling places at scale.

Since the 2000 election, the numbers for mail-in voting and early voting in person have continued to rise. By 2016, about 41 percent of voters voted before Election Day, including 24 percent by mail and 17 percent early in person. Then, in 2020, during the global pandemic, the numbers for voting by mail rose dramatically. Over 40 percent voted by mail and over 25 percent voted early in person.

It was not until 2024 that we saw something of a return to non-pandemic trends. Voting on Election Day was barely the most common form of voting. Early in-person voting saw a strong rise, and mail-in voting dropped from 2020 levels but still showed an increase over 2016 levels. We are a country now where the three modes of voting are relatively comparable.

Recognizing Progress

These dramatic changes have supporters and critics. Especially in 2000, the issue of voting by mail became much more polarized, with Democrats seeing it as their preferred mode of voting and Republicans expressing significant distrust. These views have receded from their 2000 high points, but the differences are still noticeable.

But if we look below the national numbers to the states’, we see a great variety of arrangements. A number of states, especially in the West, now have significant numbers of mail-in voting. Some Southern states, notably Arkansas, Georgia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Texas, have moved to a regime with high levels of early voting in person and small amounts of mail-in voting. And many others have a mix of methods.

As we go to the polls this November, and debate over election administration swirls around us, it is imperative to recognize how modern voting technology, improved registration systems, and the expansion of new modes of voting have sharpened elections across our nation. There is always room to grow, but continuing to improve our election system begins with recognizing how we have already done so.",https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Screenshot-2025-11-03-at-2.07.40 PM.png,N,,2025-11-03 20:59:58.641532

Experts in energy and energy policy discussed the environmental ramifications during the 2025 Vanderbilt AI Symposium.

In a panel titled AI Energy Appetite: Environmental Impacts and Governance, Ethan Thorpe, BA’24, a fellow at Vanderbilt Law’s Private Climate Governance Lab, moderated a discussion between Vanderbilt Law Professor Michael Vandenberg, Dr. Leslie Abrahams, and Dr. Jonathan Gilligan.

Thorpe kicked off the session by stressing the importance of the subject on a national and international level.

“AI and the infrastructure that it powers have quickly become the inspiration for trillions of dollars in investment,” he said.

Panelists offered an overview of the energy implications of AI. According to Abrahams, AI energy consumption is expected to jump from 4.5% of total U.S. electricity demand in 2023 to as much as 12% by 2028, an increase that represents the current demand of Texas or California.

“It was always the plan [to expand energy infrastructure]… (but) this expansion is happening a lot faster than anyone expected,” Abrahams said. “It’s also happening in a greater scale, so it’s having a regional impact.”

Vandenberg emphasized a few challenges with the expansion of AI-related energy use and demand.

“Electric utilities and others have an incentive to overpredict electricity demand in the future; if we overbuild, then we get a return on our investments,” Vandenberg said. “The challenge is that we are building [the] power supply in a way that provides electricity that we can use to meet our very highest demands. So, one of the interesting things is not how much total energy we are using, it’s when we are using it, what are those characteristics, and how can we shift those a little bit?”

The conversation then shifted to a discussion on what it means to invest in new and evolving energy expansion technology that may not pay off in the future. Gilligan explained how this uncertainty applies to both the quantity of energy needed and the way that the utilities are going to build out their infrastructure. He noted a prevailing statistic offered by OpenAI that a query conducted by a large language model takes 1/10th of a Watt hour.

“Open AI says they serve about a billion queries a day. If that 10th of a Watt hour per query number is right, that comes to about 100 million watt hours per day; divide that by 24 hours, and you need to come to about 5 million watts that it would take to serve the global demands for Open AI — that’s 5% of a typical power plant,” Gilligan said. “We would not be needing to build out power if these energy consumption estimates that people want to give us were even remotely true.”

Gilligan also discussed the type of energy that utilities will rely on for expansion. If they turn to fossil fuels and gas, it could have disastrous consequences for the environment; if they turn to renewable alternatives, the positive impact could be momentous. The direction should be aided by monetary incentives, Gilligan said, since opening fossil fuel and coal plants is more expensive than renewable alternatives in terms of opening and shutting down.

“[The] huge growth of energy needed could potentially be beneficial in improving the nation’s energy infrastructure, which is sadly out of date and vulnerable,” Gillian said. “We could be building our capacity to transmit large amounts of energy from wind turbines and solar panels — and that would be a real benefit.”

Lastly, the conversation shifted to private governance of AI — the idea that private organizations are filling gaps in climate adaptation, mitigation, and other environmental issues that you would typically see governments filling. This is seen in terms of energy and AI structures through company contracting requirements outlining a specific portion of renewable sources or a limit on emissions.

“Because of this contracting phenomenon, we’ve seen that 80% of the largest 10 firms in seven global sectors are already imposing environmental requirements on their supplies,” Vandenberg said. “This will begin to kick in as it relates to AI, if those employers get attributed to the cost of the environmental impact of their employees’ AI use.”",https://cdn.vanderbilt.edu/vu-sub/wp-content/uploads/sites/281/2025/09/04130339/alternate-topper-headers.png,N,,2025-11-03 14:19:30.446989

The economy is a hot topic this year, with concerns about inflation, tariffs, unemployment, and interest rates dominating the news. And banks and other financial institutions are coping with those issues and many more.

What are the concerns? And what is South Carolina doing better than other states.

Integrated Media Publishing hosted a roundtable discussion over Zoom with three leaders in the world of banking on Sept. 16, 2025. We asked those questions and more, and three financial experts shared their insights.

Here are excerpts from that conversation, edited for brevity and clarity.

The participants were:

Richard Bhola, member, Scott and Company

Tom Coker, senior vice president, commercial banker, United Community

Devin Green, chief operating officer, The Capital Corporation

Integrated Media Publishing Editor David Dykes moderated the discussion.

Question: Good morning, everyone. I want to welcome everybody to Integrated Media's Banking and Finance Roundtable, another in our series of monthly discussions on topics of importance to the business community, to the state of South Carolina, and to our regions as a whole. We'd like to thank Scott and Company for sponsoring this roundtable. I want to start off with a general question, just talking about the broader economy. What are your thoughts on where the economy is right now. There’s a big rate consideration this week. Talk about the broader economy and how it impacts the financial industry. Richard, we'll start with you.

Richard Bhola, member, Scott and Company: I think there's a macroeconomic impact in the capital markets and then the impact on banking and financial services. I'll let Tom answer the banking and financial services piece. I do know we see from an audit perspective, as rates change, obviously, that affects everyone. Mortgage rates have gone up, and everyone's in a holding pattern as to what to do next. And so you see a lot of banks trying to figure out what new offerings do they need to make in order to keep up with those changes. I know I saw a lot of higher interest rates on deposits, and a lot of the smaller community banks that I look at are a little bit slow to respond to that, which resulted in some cash constraints, affecting their own growth. I think the interest rate obviously has a big impact on the financial industry and the broader economy. And then I think the way financial institutions and financial industry respond to some of those changes, things like the tariffs have a pretty significant impact in the broader economy, whether it continues to grow or it stays the same or it shrinks.

Question: Tom, what does your crystal ball tell you?

Tom Coker, senior vice president, commercial banker, United Community: I wish I had one. But from our side at the bank, we see that the economy has been plugging along this year. Growth remains positive, but we are seeing it start to slow down a little bit. Unemployment ticking up a little bit last month, and inflation do remain concerns for us as it's managing through tariffs for both businesses and consumers. The good news is, here in the Upstate, we do remain a little bit stronger, probably than the national economy, with a lot of folks moving to the Upstate. I saw a number yesterday that Upstate unemployment was 4.2, which was better than the 4.3 national number. So I think there are a lot of positive things going for us here in the Upstate with business growth and population growth that is going to help support and help drive the economy for us locally in the Upstate and across the Southeast. But nationally, economically, macro level, we see growth as being positive, but starting to slow down a little bit. Within the financial industry, we saw rate cuts last year drove some improving loan demand this year. And we do think from talking to a lot of our clients, both locally and across the bank, that if we do see some rate cuts … then that's going to continue to drive some people breaking ground on projects and expansions in their businesses. So we think rate cuts will be helpful, both to the broader economy and to the banking industry.

Q. What do you think this portends for the M&A market and clients that you're talking to?

Devin Green, chief operating officer, The Capital Corporation: It's interesting. We look for … leading and lagging indicators. And I'm biased because of the lens I look through, but one of the leading indicators we look at is M&A activity. Private equity guys and strategic buyers, they have different hold philosophies and timelines, but direction, not perfection. If you're a private equity buyer, you're looking at making a five-year investment in a business, in an industry, in a market. And we watch that activity pretty closely. If it's a robust activity, than that signals some things for us, and the contrary does. So we are seeing quite a lot of activity. … Private equity buyers, if you stratify the market, obviously, there's sections in the market where they are putting their pencils down. But for the most part, the activity has continued to stay quite strong. We find that quite encouraging. They are making five-year bets. They are not slowing down and making five-year bets. They are moving to certain markets and industries to do that. But there's a lot of smart people out there putting money to work, and the activity continues to be at a very high rate. One other thing, just not to get too technical, but there's something called an overhang. It's a fancy word of saying how much money is private equity raised that hasn't found a home for yet. They haven't allocated it to the companies they've bought. It's somewhere in the $800 billion number in the United States. So they are continuing to raise money to continue to double, triple down in this economy. They're not seeing anything that scares them to suggest otherwise.

Q. So nothing to scare them as far as they tell you, right?

Green: No, nothing to scare them. There's tweaks, there's adjustments. We all adjust in business. So they might press pause on certain industries for now. But generally speaking, they are pouring into more industries than not and continuing to do so. And South Carolina was mentioned. … South Carolina ranks up there on a number of levels on (being) business friendly, as we all know. But to use an example, it was recently ranked the No. 1 state for manufacturers in the entire United States. And so when people are looking in the business community, it's important to watch the headlines nationwide. Obviously, it affects all of us. But when we look at our ecosystem here, we're not insulated from things, but we can take a shock or two based on the preferential position we have in South Carolina on a number of fronts.

Q. Let me just throw this up to the group. Talk about AI. How is it transforming your business and what lies ahead in terms of AI?

Green: One of the things that makes The Capital Corporation a little different is we're an investment bank, but then we're part of a portfolio of companies that is owned by the same owner, Dan Adams. We operate companies, and we help sell companies. So within our portfolio, we are using AI on a number of fronts. AI, by the way, to me, is a pretty agnostic term. It can mean a lot of things to a lot of people. It seems like that continues to evolve. So at the risk of misusing that term, we are using it in call centers. We are using it in digital marketing. We are using it with respect to diligence in mergers and acquisitions. … I do think the applications are starting to become more commercialized, and there's some convergence on how to tie loose ends together with real business decision making and AI. I also think it's got a lot of room to run before it really becomes something that can be rolled out across a lot of the business front. So I think we are dabbling in it. We are an early adopter in it on a couple of levels, both in M&A and owning and operating businesses. But I think there's a little bit more learning to be done on how to really, really unlock the value of it.

Q. Tom, do you agree?

Coker: I do agree. We actually do use a lot of AI and have been using AI in a lot of our processes. How we're using it is evolving over time. Historically, we’ve used it a lot in our IT and our fraud detection area. Our IT folks have used it to write code and in management of large data sets such as fraud detection, when we're looking at millions of transactions, we're using AI, and our vendors are using AI to improve our ability to detect fraud and help keep our customers' money safe from transactions that may not be legitimate transactions. So, using it with data, with large volumes of data, and also from a coding and building processes is helping us create efficiencies and operate efficiently. One thing we're very cognizant of is keeping a human involved with how we're using it. We're using it to help our employees be more efficient, but not necessarily to where it would do a job of an employee. We've used it in the back office and behind the scenes for a lot of years. But as language models have developed and improved, we are using it more in some of our front-line interactions. A great example I got from our head of IT the other day is, we've integrated a chatbot as part of our online banking to answer simple questions that customers may have, such as location, hours, fact-based questions. And that lets our employees in our call center respond to those more in-depth questions from clients. The AI can answer the very simple fact-based things. And then if it goes beyond that basic set of parameters, then the chat kicks over to a live human in our contact center so that they can dig in to maybe a more in-depth question that a customer may need human help to solve. But there's little things and utilizing it for small factual questions and some beginning customer interfaces has helped us find some efficiencies on that side. In our industry, we balance the need for efficiency that AI can help bring. It is very important that we do put some walls around it, especially related to customer privacy and information privacy. As a bank, there are some unique risks in that, in how we adopt and roll out the AI is that is unique to banking is that we've got to be sure that the models are keeping our customer data confidential and within the bank, and that it's not feeding broader information, and no customer information is escaping outside of our four walls that may compromise privacy of our customers. So we are embracing it and finding ways to use it to help people do their jobs more efficiently, and we are using it more and more as time goes on and maybe in more customer-facing applications than we have before, where it was just really back office-focused. But also ensuring that we're keeping oversight over it to ensure we're protecting information privacy, which is really, really important to us. And also keeping the human touch so that when we're looking at data and analyzing data with it, of course, there are bias risks and models, and managing model risk is another back-office piece. … But bottom line is we are embracing it as an opportunity to help our employees be more efficient in their jobs and get back to customers and take care of customers more quickly and efficiently, but also ensuring that we keep the guardrails of a human touch with the AI to validate our models and be sure that the results are making sense.

Q. Richard, let me ask you this, is AI a watershed event or is it just evolving?

Bhola: I think it's continuing to evolve. I think to Devin's point of it being agnostic, it's so embedded in so many different things in so many different ways. And of course, it's continuously learning based on whatever information it's processing. I think what we're seeing is just the beginning of AI being implemented in several different places, and we'll continue to see that. One, because it's a huge advantage to automate certain processes that we may have depended on human beings for, but it's not necessarily to eliminate using human beings within our process, but I think we know that there's a limited labor force available to us. In South Carolina, for example, we have one of the lower labor participation rates. Maybe not in Greenville, but the state as a whole, I think certainly struggles with having adequate labor force. Post-pandemic, we’ve seen a huge increase in cyber fraud. A lot of people get random text messages, they get emails and all kinds of things from fraudsters, and that increase in fraud activity has become impossible for human beings to monitor all of it. Of course, when people lose their money, the first thing they call the bank and they said, Why would you let this transaction go? There's no human being looking at those transactions. I think there's a huge opportunity there, as Tom mentioned, for fraud detection and prevention as you leverage some of that AI. I think that's going to continue to evolve, and it's necessary. I don't think we're going to be able to keep up with maybe some of the evil forces acting on institutions without leveraging AI just because of the number of transactions that we're having to monitor in the process. So I think it'll continue to evolve. No one knows where it's going to end up, but I think there are huge opportunities. There is so little that we know about it. Even in our profession, we're slowly trying to leverage it. There's so many different options out there and just parsing through some of it and making a decision as to which one you go with and which one you don't is a continuous process.

Q. If I understand the three of you correctly, you don't see it as an automatic displacement of your current workers. Is that correct?

Bhola: I think on our end, certainly not the case. We've got a huge deficit in our profession as a whole. As people leave, the number of people coming into the accounting profession is significantly less. So we've got a huge deficit, I think, that runs all the way to 2030. And so we'll hire everybody that's available that's willing to work in our profession. The problem is we don't have enough people, and we have people leaving. So that certainly hasn't been our experience, both on the audit and tax side, even in some of the rural areas and some of the community banks that I audit. There's such a huge lack of human resource that people will take anything they can get. And so I haven't seen it being a major displacement of actual human labor force.

Q. Devin, do you agree?

Green: I agree. It complements our team right now when we use it. It supplements the human capital side. Could it replace some the way we're using it eventually maybe, but we’re not close enough to have a line of sight on making that happen right now.

Q. Tom, your thoughts?

Coker: I agree with you and what everybody said; we see it as a complement or supplement to what folks are doing today to help them do more and be efficient, but with where it stands today, not a replacement for people. So from our side, we see it as small efficiency pickups for everybody today, but that may evolve into greater efficiency over time, but not a substitute today.

Q. Let me switch to the regulatory environment. Where are we in terms of the regulatory environment from your perspective?

Green: In M&A, when there’s a regulatory shift or a legislative shift, oftentimes it can create gaps and pain points for the value chain of people involved. So I think that's the fascinating part on any regulatory change or legislative change is the ripple effect of, how does it disrupt, how things were being done, by whom, who has more pain, who has a greater value prop to solve that pain? … To me, that ripple effect creates opportunities from an investment standpoint and from a merger and acquisition standpoint. And that's something that we watch closely.

Q. The banking industry obviously watches the regulatory environment very closely. Where does it stand for you?

Coker: As you guys know, the banking environment is a highly regulated environment. We're used to operating in that as different administrations may come and go. I would say we feel that the regulatory environment has had a variety of positive developments this year. First off … in the banking world, we see an openness to bank M&A as a very positive thing. We're seeing regulators more open to M&A and speeding approval up of the transactions pretty significantly for where things have been. And so the openness and the speed of M&A is a very positive development in the banking industry. The other development we've seen this year … is a refocus on safety and soundness of banks and getting that in exams to focus on safety and soundness of banks making good loans, getting back to the blocking and tackling of making loans, taking care of deposits, and taking care of customers, and supporting customers with what they need for themselves or for their businesses to grow. And so we've seen that as a positive development that's making it a little bit easier to do business within the banking industry and getting back to some of the basics of banking.

Q. Richard, your thoughts?

Bhola: I think industry regulations work positively in a lot of ways, a lot of it geared towards consumer protection, ensuring market integrity and confidence, and then maybe hopefully fueling some economic growth. My only struggle with it … is when you apply it across the board, it may not be beneficial to everyone. You may have some regulations, for example, within the banking industry that may apply to all banks, but not necessarily affect a small community bank in the same way. And some of those compliance with those regulations, the costs can outweigh the benefits. Some of it obviously works well to protect the consumer, to protect financial institutions. But some of it can become burdensome if it just applies across the board, regardless of size. And we do see some of the struggles with some of the smaller banks trying to keep up with some of those regulatory compliance that is not necessarily significantly affecting their portfolio.

Q. Let me throw this out to all of you. The American consumer, how resilient is it, does it need to be, and will it be?

Coker: With the bank, we've seen that the consumer so far has been very resilient through the year. Americans tend to be a resilient bunch. We've seen personal income and salaries remain strong throughout the year, but we are starting to see spending starting to decline slightly, and you are starting to see, especially in the news, on a macro level, some of the subprime lenders are beginning to see some cracks and some delinquencies rise as unemployment has ticked up a little bit over the course of the year. But we have seen, overall, the consumers stay strong, but beginning to pump the brakes and slowing down on spending a little bit.

Q. Richard, is that what your firm is seeing?

Bhola: I think for the most part, it's been difficult post-pandemic to measure the resilience of the American consumer, because I do think we're really good at sensing big things happening in the economy and restricting our spending or increasing our spending. I know that we're very responsive to interest rate changes and big things like purchasing a home. You saw a lot of people pull back and say, Well, I'm not going to go ahead and purchase a home now just because the rates are so high. I'm going to keep my cash. You did see as well a lot of people being willing to move their deposits from different institutions because they saw increase in rates in some institutions while not necessarily increasing as quickly as others. And so they're very on top of that and knowing where to keep their money and when to spend their money and where to spend their money on big-ticket items. But I also think we've seen a little bit of spending more on post-pandemic, a lot of experiences, things like travel. I'm surprised when I'm at an airport, how busy it is and how full it is. I think overall, I would say the American consumer is pretty resilient. But like I said earlier, I do think it's become a lot easier to spend our funds. And so sometimes that consumer spending can get away from us, which I think is also showing a little bit on the increase in the use of credit cards by consumers. That, I think, has gone up over the last couple of years.

Q. How are businesses and your clients adjusting to the changing economic policies and conditions that we're facing these days?

Green: Tell me more about the changing policies and conditions you're thinking about.

Q. I'm thinking about businesses looking at the uncertainty in the M&A market. Like you said, they're still plowing ahead. But do you detect any changes in the speed with which the M&A market works? Is it slowing down?

Green: What comes to mind is some businesses, just like everything in life, some are affected more, some are affected less. The use case we're seeing a lot of with some of the policies right now and how it's rippling through M&A is for companies that have cross-border supply chains, given the tariff situation, we are seeing a big-time ripple effect there with respect to both ops and M&A. … Companies this year have been looking at the country of origin of where they're sourcing items, and they're looking at the tariff impact, and they're trying to optimize that supply chain. And so a number of our clients who are preparing to sell their business right now, we are looking at how to reallocate their footprint appropriately on where they're sourcing from, amongst other things. And so that is one example, an obvious one on the tariff side, that is rippling through operations for some of these companies, and it's impacting M&A. Some buyers right now, if they are looking at a domestic service provider versus an international manufacturer, they're going towards the domestic service provider because the tariffs, there's not a direct correlation on tariff impact to them. So some people are pressing pause on certain sectors of the market because there's some uncertainty associated with it. And some are forging ahead. But it's thinning out the buyer landscape on some industries where there's uncertainty, if that makes sense. It's still active. It's just thinning out some people because they're pressing pause until they have better certainty.

Q. In terms of the M&A market, you said there's a lot of money to be spent. How much longer before that floodgate opens, or will it just not open for the foreseeable future?

Green: This overhang I keep talking about, it's a good metric. All this money that's been raised that hasn't yet found a company to buy and be allocated towards the $800 billion-plus number. Private equity funds keep raising more money, so as they allocate this money and buy companies, they're raising more and keeping that overhang to where it is today. So that's been a pretty static number the last however many years. It is a seller's market. I'm not trying to sound biased. It just is. Valuations are inflated. The private equity funds, and I’ve got a lot of friends in private equity … there’s so much money that’s been raised. They are trying to find a place to put this money to work because they're getting pressure from their limited partners, the people that invested in private equity fund to put their money to work. And so that is increasing the valuations. And if private equity valuations are going up, guess what's happening to strategic buyers valuations? They're going up. So it has been a seller's market for years. My hope and expectation is it will continue to be unless there's a material shift. And we've been seeing that dynamic to be holding true for the last five, six, seven years. It's been a good run.

Q. What particular sectors are the strongest or the weakest right now?

Green: I think of quants and quals, quantitative and qualitative considerations of businesses. If you have what drives value, and this is not necessarily what you asked, but I think it's relevant. Growth, margin, free cash flow, and certainty of future cash flow. If you can sit there and say, We are growing quickly. We have high line of sight on that future growth, and we're making a lot of money when we do it. And then there's qualitative things, barriers to entry, strength of management team, brand, IP. Sectors that have those elements that are not being affected directly by any policies such as tariffs are highly active right now. But then you've got this dynamic where there's so much money out there. If there are businesses on the margin where they don't necessarily check all the boxes, but they check some of them, they are getting a lot of looks from buyers because buyers are trying to continue to build their portfolio of companies because of the dynamic we discussed. It’s not binary, either you’re in this strike zone or you’re out, there’s a lot of shades of gray, and I am seeing buyers expand their thinking to be a lot more flexible on how to deploy their money because of that fact that the money industry has been overbuilt. There's an excess supply of money.

Q. Let me throw this out. South Carolina's economy – everybody says it's in good shape, but it still is heavily dependent on manufacturing. Do you see a robust future for entrepreneurs, startup companies in South Carolina?

Green: Absolutely. The buyers that we talk to for South Carolina companies love South Carolina … the tax landscape, the cost of living, the accessibility with the infrastructure, all of it. They are targeting the Southeast and South Carolina. And labor was mentioned earlier, Richard, I think you said it, about how it's hard to continue to fill the labor needs. I have a client in Chicago. They went to a movie theater, and they're sitting there in front of the big screen at an AMC movie theater, and there's an ad for Greenville to move to Greenville. So this state is recruiting people to relocate here because the business demand is so high. South Carolina is near or at the top of the list for a lot of buyers, everything else equal to invest in.

Q. Richard, same thing you’re hearing?

Bhola: Yeah, I think that's consistent. I do think that there are a few things for the state of South Carolina to work on, but I do think we continue to be a very attractive place to do business. I think you saw that a little bit with the Scout plant that's under construction in Blythewood. When that's up and running, I think there'll be a huge demand for local labor, and that's going to be a pretty big deal for the Midlands. We do have a little bit of a low labor participation rate. But it doesn't mean that we don't have the capacity, the ability to increase that. I'm part of a few discussions on the Chamber of Commerce side, and I know that there's constant work being done there to address some of that. But I think, if I remember correctly, South Carolina was the No. 1 state last year for people moving into the state across the entire U.S. And in looking at those numbers, they aren't just retirees, because I know we're obviously in an attractive climate, and it's still relatively affordable to live in South Carolina. So I think there are a lot of positive things about the state. I know we're constantly looking at our neighboring states and what they're doing relative to us in terms of small business policies and attractiveness and coming to the state and working pretty hard to make sure that we stay competitive. We've still got some work to do, of course, because we've got North Carolina and Georgia right there, but we're on top of it. I think we certainly have the capacity and the attractiveness. I agree with Devin that people want to be in South Carolina to do business. We're a friendly bunch of people and hard-working, but I think just the lower cost is very attractive as well.

Q. Tom, let me ask you this. Your bank is headquartered in Greenville. Does a lack of corporate headquarters put South Carolina back at all?

Coker: I think it does. I think we're a very business-friendly state, very entrepreneurial friendly. There is a lot of opportunity to attract corporate headquarters and the jobs and the wealth creation that corporate headquarters bring that would benefit the state. So, I do think we've got some work to do. I think the talent pool that Richard has talked about before is something that corporate headquarters look for. Low cost is certainly important. … But the ability to attract new talent to the area and to South Carolina would be something that would be helpful to hopefully grow the number of companies that are headquartered here.

Q. And finally, let me throw out this question. But if you were governor, if you go back and one thing differently for South Carolina, what would that be?

Bhola: I think we could benefit a lot from investing in some public transport. I talk about the labor participation rate. South Carolina is such an interesting state. We've got the big cities of Greenville and Charleston and places like Columbia. I think maybe if we're able to look at the unemployment levels in those smaller places, in those smaller cities in rural South Carolina, we'll realize that there's a lot of opportunity there. But we don't have a very good public transport system. And so it isn't as easy for those people to get to the places where those jobs may be available. I think we have jobs. We don't have an issue with jobs. I think we just don't have the people to fill those roles, and they're just not able to show up for work if they live in some of those rural areas. … I do think maybe we can drive more business in some areas of rural South Carolina. If we're able to do that, I do think the state as a whole I could benefit from that. But public transport would be my top point.

Q. Tom?

Coker: I don't know that I would do it differently, but I would say it's something that frame it in what can we do to enhance things for the future would be a continued and greater investment in education, both K through 12 and in our community college system, technical college system, and in our larger research institutions. I think North Carolina, as an example, has put a lot into that educational ecosystem, and that has paid dividends for the state in terms of attracting knowledge jobs to the economy, and also back to the corporate headquarters question. An educated workforce can be a more productive workforce and can make it a more attractive place to come. I think South Carolina has been doing a good job, but I think we can do more with funding and expanding education. Our technical college system has been an integral part of attracting some great businesses here in the Upstate. I think of Michelin, I think of Ryobi, I think of BMW. Our technical college system here has been a big part of educating a workforce to staff those clients and giving people skills to obtain more jobs with higher salaries and that education broadly would help us attract more business to the state and address some of the people shortage that we've all talked about.

Q. Any other comments you'd like to make in closing?

Green: The lens I look through is small business and specifically mergers and acquisitions, but I think right now we are as busy as we've ever been. It's a seller's market. And for some of the reasons we discussed, South Carolina is a great place to play in this space. I just wanted to reiterate that right now we're optimistic and encouraged by what we're seeing and the activity we're seeing.

Q. Richard, final thoughts?

Bhola: I think we live in a time of probably the greatest uncertainty and more changing things every day. And that’s becoming harder on multiple levels, in terms of how we’re leveraging technology, issues with labor force, issues with different generations in the workforce and being able to work with all of them at the same time. But I do think that we’re in a good place to continue to be resilient. We’re responding a lot faster than we used to as well. So I think that says a lot. I’ve been living in Columbia since 2012, and I’ve certainly seen some significant growth over those years in very different parts of the city itself. And I know that a lot is happening across the state as well. I’m encouraged by it. We benefited a lot from the migration during Covid. … I think we're poised to be ready for all of the changes that's happening.

Q. Thank you. Tom, a final thought?

Coker: I think in the banking industry, we are very optimistic. We're optimistic with where things are going in the industry and with where South Carolina is going. Also seeing a lot of M&A activity, both within the industry and with our customers. And so we've got a very optimistic view of where things are going for the industry and for the state.

Much has changed in the energy systems in the decade since the Paris Agreement was signed in 2015. These systems faced a global pandemic, the first war in Europe since WWII, an energy crisis, a U.S. government that questioned climate change, and backlash against net-zero policies in banking and equity investment.

Some things have remained constant. One is China’s undisputed leadership in clean energy investment and installations, and cheaper domestically-manufactured equipment, allowing the rollout of solar and wind power capacity at much lower costs compared to Europe and the U.S.

The other constant is the EU’s unwavering insistence on decarbonizing to achieve net-zero emissions across its economies by 2050, despite soaring costs and growing political resistance to intermediate targets and warnings from trade partners that the burdensome EU climate directives on emissions and carbon prices could undermine its energy supply. Last week, the United States and Qatar joined forces for a fresh warning to Brussels that its corporate sustainability directive risks LNG imports from two of the world’s biggest exporters at a time when the EU is seeking to ban all Russian gas imports.

All these developments are taking place amid growing uncertainty – both financial and regulatory – for clean energy developers.

U.S. President Donald Trump pulled the United States out of the Paris Agreement – twice, on Day One of each of his terms in office. Coinciding with President Trump’s inauguration in 2025, banks started quitting net-zero alliances and stopped the previously very vocal pledges to cut off financing for fossil fuels, with a U.S. Administration, which is now openly hostile toward clean energy solutions, especially offshore wind, and which drastically scaled back U.S. renewable energy and EV incentives.

Amid geopolitical, financing, cost, and regulatory challenges to clean energy, Brazil is hosting the annual global climate summit COP30 in Belem from November 10 to 21.

Ten years after Paris, COP30 will take place as renewable energy installations soar to record highs, but investment and capacity additions are not yet on track for net zero or for any other intermediate or renewable energy goal.

“Some countries are quietly wavering on their climate commitments on the eve of the meeting while the US very loudly questions the entire concept of global warming,” Ethan Zindler, Countries and Policy Research at BloombergNEF, says.

Despite the record-high investments into clean energy technologies and soaring solar power installations, “the transition to a lower-carbon economy is not moving nearly fast enough to deliver on the ambition for net-zero emissions agreed in Paris a decade ago,” BloombergNEF noted.

In the first half of 2025, China remained the world’s top market for renewable energy investment, accounting for 44% of the global total, BNEF has estimated. The U.S. U-turn in policy, on the other hand, may prompt developers and investors to reallocate capital from the United States to Europe, according to the research provider.

Ahead of COP30, the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the COP30 Brazilian Presidency, and the Global Renewables Alliance (GRA) said in an October report that the world is falling behind on its renewable energy and efficiency goals despite record progress last year.

The global progress report flagged bottlenecks in investment, grids, and supply chains, and urged governments for bolder renewable targets before COP30.

The climate summit in Brazil is not without controversies, as were the previous two editions held in major oil and gas producing countries, the UAE and Azerbaijan.

The host country, Brazil, South America’s top oil producer and exporter, is expected to push for the Belém Commitment for Sustainable Fuels—known as Belém 4x—an initiative aimed at building high-level political support for the global goal of quadrupling the production and use of sustainable fuels by 2035.

But “Brazil faces a fundamental contradiction as it prepares to host COP30: leading the world in sustainable fuels while simultaneously planning an expansion of its upstream sector,” David Brown, Director, Energy Transition Research at Wood Mackenzie, said this week.

“This tension reflects the complex realities facing large energy markets and companies.”

Proposition 8 supports family farms by taking the prospect of ruinous fire sales off the table.
In 2022, Texas farms sold over $32 billion in agricultural products, and today one in seven Texans works in an agriculture-related job.
Labor expenses, which have gone up by a whopping 50% since 2020, only compound the cost pressures facing cash-strapped family farms.
Approving Proposition 8 helps keep family farms intact, gives businesses the confidence to invest, and strengthens the state’s long-term economic growth.","Family farmers and ranchers are the backbone of Texas, tending land that has often been passed down through generations. Family-owned farms make up more than 90% of all farms in the state. Yet, without legislative safeguards, heirs may one day be forced to sell parts of their family farms just to cover tax bills when a loved one passes away.

This November, Texans have the chance to protect family farms and the rural communities they sustain. Proposition 8 would permanently prohibit the state legislature from imposing estate, inheritance, or gift taxes. This ensures families won’t be forced to sell portions of their farms to pay taxes, keeps family property intact, and provides the policy certainty needed for long-term capital investments.

Texas currently has no estate or inheritance tax, so the amendment is preventative, locking in protections for families, farmers, and businesses before any new financial burdens can arise. Importantly, the measure does not affect existing taxes, such as property taxes, motor vehicle gift taxes, or other levies already authorized under state law. By clarifying what is allowed and what is prohibited, Proposition 8 ensures families and businesses have the necessary clarity to start making plans without the fear of sudden or unpredictable new levies.

Many farmers and ranchers run estates that are land-rich but cash-poor, with wealth tied up in property, equipment, and livestock rather than liquid funds. For example, farms across the nation typically have 80% of their assets tied up in real estate. Without legislative protections, heirs could be forced to sell parts of their land just to pay taxes, threatening decades of family investment.

Even highly valuable farms can face a cash crunch if heirs are required to pay estate taxes. For example, in states like New York and New Jersey, families have been forced to sell portions of farmland or valuable equipment to meet tax bills, sometimes breaking up farms in the process. Proposition 8 supports family farms by taking the prospect of ruinous fire sales off the table.

Texas is a national agricultural leader, with nearly 250,000 farms and ranches covering over 125 million acres. Farming contributes billions each year to the state economy and supports thousands of rural jobs. In 2022, Texas farms sold over $32 billion in agricultural products, and today one in seven Texans works in an agriculture-related job. Protecting farms from forced sales is therefore both an economic and social imperative for the Lone Star State.

This support is especially welcome given the recent headwinds for agriculture, including rising input costs, unpredictable weather, and market volatility caused by growing geopolitical tensions. Over the past five years alone, seed expenses increased by 18%, fuel and oil expenses rose 32%, and fertilizer costs increased 37%. Labor expenses, which have gone up by a whopping 50% since 2020, only compound the cost pressures facing cash-strapped family farms. This doesn’t even take into account the prospect of wasteful tit-for-tat tariff battles that could impact the agricultural supply chain.

Texas’ effort to protect family farms from forced sales mirrors the federal government’s recent progress in shielding taxpayers from the ruinous effects of estate taxes. As part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act passed this summer, federal lawmakers increased the estate and gift tax exemption to $15 million per individual and $30 million for married couples. In addition to being codified on a permanent basis, these amounts are also indexed for inflation, ensuring that estates below these thresholds are permanently shielded from federal estate levies.

Ultimately, Proposition 8 is more than a technical tax amendment. It’s a thoughtful decision about the kind of economic environment Texas wants to foster. Approving Proposition 8 helps keep family farms intact, gives businesses the confidence to invest, and strengthens the state’s long-term economic growth. This amendment ensures that families can pass down their land, livelihoods, and hard-earned wealth safely to the next generation.",https://www.ntu.org/library/imglib/2023/10/randy-fath-dDc0vuVH-LU-unsplash.jpg?v=20231017124500,N,,2025-11-03 16:07:10.424120

Europe, along with the rest of the world, has relied on coal and gas as a major source of energy resources on the continent, with Central Europe being a key driver in coal usage. However, the waves of change have swept through the European continent, leading the charge is the most practical and easy-to-use form of renewable energy.

Europe’s energy sector has seen significant change over the past few years

As the renewable energy sector has grown far beyond what anyone could have expected, there is one form of energy generation that has become the darling of the energy sector: solar power.

The world has been consumed by the need to diversify the energy sector. Wind power has come a long way, but it lacks significant investments in infrastructure and a more favorable policy environment. Not to mention the time it takes to build wind turbines and towers.

Nuclear is an alternative, but it also has a negative connotation attached to it due to the Cold War era, placing the fear of God in everyone. The result is that solar power has become the best form of energy generation that does not harm the planet and can be scaled up to meet any potential increases in demand.

Advancements in solar power technology and generation capacity have catapulted the sector to the forefront of our collective consciousness

Following a wave of innovations in the solar power sector and the news that Europe is phasing out any and all forms of Russian energy, the continent has turned to solar power to compensate for the loss of the conventional energy sector’s generation potential. However, change does not happen overnight, and rarely comes with no consequences, regardless of whether the intentions are good or bad.

The rapid expansion of solar in Europe has been unprecedented and embraced by leaders

Central Europe, in particular, has seen its solar power generation skyrocket over the past few years. A record-breaking summer in Europe saw Hungary, which is one of the nations still relying on Russian gas imports, experiencing unprecedented growth in the solar power sector, with over 40% of the nation’s energy supply coming from solar power.

However, the rapid expansion of the solar power sector has had the inevitable effect of straining the European power grid overall as it struggles to accept the reality of life without the need for fossil fuels.

Plug-in solar devices have seen a meteoric rise in several European nations

Plug-in solar devices, known in some parts of the world as Balcony solar, have seen several European nations embracing them as the call for a more climate-friendly way of life has consumed the world.

Batteries go into rechargeable units that store hydro during off-peak hours

NextStar Energy is expanding into the energy storage world — along with making batteries for electric vehicles.

The manufacturer says its Windsor, Ont., factory will begin making energy storage system (ESS) battery cells designed to support commercial and grid-scale energy platforms. This will be through the company’s joint venture partners LG Energy Solution and Stellantis.

The federal government has pledged up to $10 billion in production subsidies to NextStar Energy, the joint venture between Stellantis and LG Energy Solution that’s behind the battery plant. The other $5 billion is coming from the provincial government.

Monday's announcement does not mean the factory will stop producing batteries for EVs, according to a spokesperson for the company, but is prioritizing production for storage systems.

An ESS is a large rechargeable battery unit that stores energy during off-peak hours — and provides backup power during grid outages.

Danies Lee, NextStar’s CEO, says the ESS is rapidly growing and driven, in part, by AI data centres with an increasing need for energy grid stability.

""By adding to our portfolio, we are not only demonstrating our resilience and flexibility as a company, but also our commitment to sustainable innovation, and a lasting footprint here in Windsor.""

NextStar says the new product means new chemistry to its production, focused on lithium iron phosphate — LFP batteries — a technology “suitable” for a “wide range of battery needs.”

In a Monday morning statement, the company said LFP will support its current nickel manganese cobalt chemistry already at the Windsor factory.

“NextStar has been conducting material testing and equipment calibration in preparation for mass production, which is scheduled to begin in the coming weeks,” the company said.

At the time, it was the second to connect to the province's grid and is expected to be one of many across the province as part of an effort to meet growing energy demand.

Ontario's first battery storage facility opened in Haldimand County and is able to store up to 250 megawatts of power, which the company says is enough to power a city the size of Oshawa for an hour.

The chief executive officer of Invest WindsorEssex thinks NextStar's latest move helps shape the future of sustainable energy for the region.

“By diversifying the company’s portfolio and adapting to changing markets, NextStar continues to strengthen its resilience and position itself, and the region, for strong, sustained growth in the years ahead,” said Gordon Orr in a statement.

He calls it an “evolution” to strengthen the potential of the local supply chain.

“As NextStar broadens its operations, we expect to see continued momentum in supply chain development and integration, positioning Windsor-Essex as a key hub for Canada’s battery and energy storage ecosystem.”",https://www.cbc.ca/lite/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-03 14:59:42.072693

In 2021, the JBS Group reported total global greenhouse gas emissions of over 71 million tons, more than the total emissions of many countries.
Attorney General James has secured $1.1 million from JBS USA, which will fund independent, science-based initiatives supporting climate goals across New York.
In addition, Attorney General James is requiring JBS USA to immediately stop making deceptive or unsubstantiated environmental claims and placing JBS USA under OAG monitoring for three years.
Both the Division for Economic Justice and the Division for Social Justice are overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.","NEW YORK – New York Attorney General Letitia James today announced a $1.1 million settlement with JBS USA Food Company and JBS USA Food Company Holdings (JBS USA), the American subsidiary of the JBS Group, the world’s largest producer of beef products, for allegedly misleading the public about its commitment to reducing its carbon footprint. Attorney General James sued JBS USA in 2024, after an Office of the Attorney General (OAG) investigation revealed that it was advertising that the JBS Group would reach “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2040, despite having no plan to actually achieve it. Under the settlement, JBS USA will pay $1.1 million to support climate-smart agriculture programs that help New York farmers adopt best practices to reduce emissions, increase resiliency, and enhance productivity. JBS USA has also agreed to reform its environmental marketing practices and report annually to OAG for three years.

“New Yorkers deserve the truth when it comes to the environmental impact of the products they buy,” said Attorney General James. “JBS USA made sweeping promises about its parent company’s climate impacts despite the company having no real plan to back those promises up. My office will always hold companies accountable when they mislead New Yorkers and harm our planet.”

Beef production emits the most greenhouse gases of any major food commodity, and animal agriculture accounts for at least 14.5 percent of annual global greenhouse gas emissions. In 2021, the JBS Group reported total global greenhouse gas emissions of over 71 million tons, more than the total emissions of many countries.

Attorney General James sued JBS USA in February 2024 for violating New York’s consumer protection laws by falsely advertising that the JBS Group would achieve “net zero” greenhouse gas emissions by 2040. In reality, an OAG investigation showed that the JBS Group had no viable plan or factual basis to reach such a goal and, instead, was making plans to increase production – thereby increasing its carbon footprint. The OAG found that when JBS USA announced its “Net Zero by 2040” commitment, the JBS Group had not yet calculated the company’s total greenhouse gas emissions, nor had it developed a plan to execute the commitment or determined whether it was economically or technologically feasible. Despite this, JBS USA publicly represented that its commitment was achievable and that it had a plan to meet its target.

In her lawsuit, Attorney General James alleged that JBS USA used greenwashing and misleading statements to capitalize on consumers’ increasing desire to make environmentally friendly choices, including:

“Agriculture can be part of the climate solution. Bacon, chicken wings, and steak with net zero emissions. It’s possible.”

“We will cut our own emissions by 30% in 2030 and eliminate Amazon deforestation from our supply chain within five years.”

“JBS will achieve net zero greenhouse gas emissions, reducing its direct and indirect emissions and offsetting all residual emissions.”

JBS USA continued to make these false claims despite receiving a warning from the Better Business Bureau National Programs’ National Advertising Division (NAD), which determined that the company’s evidence did not support the net-zero claims it was making to consumers. The NAD recommended that JBS USA stop making these net-zero claims in its advertising, a recommendation later affirmed by the National Advertising Review Board.

Attorney General James has secured $1.1 million from JBS USA, which will fund independent, science-based initiatives supporting climate goals across New York. The funds will be directed to promoting climate-smart agriculture on New York farms, with the exact recipient to be determined in the coming months. The OAG will work with the funding recipient to prioritize support for New York farms that lost federal funding to supply food to food banks. In addition, Attorney General James is requiring JBS USA to immediately stop making deceptive or unsubstantiated environmental claims and placing JBS USA under OAG monitoring for three years. As part of this monitoring, JBS USA must submit annual compliance reports to OAG, verifying adherence to the agreement.

Agriculture is a significant contributor to climate change. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency estimates that agriculture emits over 660 million metric tons of greenhouse gases annually – or roughly 10 percent of all U.S. emissions. Climate-smart agricultural practices offer tools for farmers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions, make their operations more resilient in the face of increasingly severe climate events, and maintain or increase their productivity in the face of accelerating climate change.

The case was handled by Assistant Attorneys General Rita McDonough and Ashley M. Gregor, Special Assistant Attorney General Libby Dimenstein, and Science Policy Fellow Maggie DeLessio of the Environmental Protection Bureau, and Assistant Attorney General Ben Fishman of the Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau. The Environmental Protection Bureau is led by Bureau Chief Lemuel Srolovic and Deputy Bureau Chief Monica Wagner and is part of the Division for Social Justice, led by Chief Deputy Attorney General Meghan Faux. The Consumer Frauds and Protection Bureau is led by Bureau Chief Jane M. Azia and Deputy Bureau Chief Laura J. Levine and is part of the Division for Economic Justice, led by Chief Deputy Attorney General Chris D’Angelo. Both the Division for Economic Justice and the Division for Social Justice are overseen by First Deputy Attorney General Jennifer Levy.

For this region specifically, Avalo aims to develop seeds that address its water and climate issues.
Despite these drawbacks, dryland cotton offers notable sustainability advantages, including a smaller carbon footprint compared to other cotton varieties.
Avalo chose Clarendon for its test field partly because local farmers rotate cotton with peanuts.
“The biggest challenge that cotton farmers are facing today is actually an economic answer,” said Roger Wade, a fifth-generation farmer and one of Avalo’s farming partners.","No machine or human can yet control the rainfall or temperature of a cotton field, but Avalo is redefining what’s possible, using nature and artificial intelligence to take some of the guesswork out of cotton farming.

Through its Rapid Evolution Platform, the North Carolina-based plant biotechnology startup employs AI-powered genomic analysis to optimize certain traits in crops. Avalo can tailor seeds to region and climate, to grow in harsher conditions and to require less water, fertilizer and pesticide.

By developing crops that can thrive under stress and with fewer inputs, Avalo’s technology not only boosts productivity but also strengthens the resilience of agricultural systems facing climate volatility.

“Our globalized agricultural system has made it so that we have high demand on yield. The Green Revolution has made it so that we can force things to grow very quickly, but we’ve now ran into a situation where all those high intensity farming practices has led to bad sustainability downsides,” explained Nick Schwanz, Avalo’s chief marketing officer. “We have extremely high inputs; we have extremely high soil disturbance. We have very low resilience, because we’ve bred things specifically for yield. And so, the next big frontier in the agricultural world is all about resilience.”

Avalo’s technology is being applied to rice, rubber, sugar and cotton, which Schwanz said quickly rose to the top when its founders Mariano Alvarez and Brendan Collins examined which agricultural industries have not had the same investment or progress as crops like wheat, corn and soy.

“Cotton is one of the most important agricultural products on the planet, but it does not get the same love as some of the massive crops we grow in the United States,” Schwanz said. “It uses, traditionally, a lot more pesticide than any other row crop. It uses a lot of water, and a lot of regions use a lot of fertilizer.”

However, Avalo is on the path to develop low-input, high-quality cotton for these specific conditions.

In Clarendon, Texas, on the northeast side of what is affectionately referred to as the “world’s largest cotton patch”—a region of Texas that that produces 30-50 percent of the U.S.’s cotton—stands one of Avalo’s three R&D plots in the state. Sourcing Journal toured the field last month.

Here, Avalo is creating data for a machine to learn from. “If we’re going to train a machine-learning algorithm to forecast how cotton is going to perform, we need to have high quality training data for it. And we live in the real world, and so this is what real data looks like,” Alvarez, who also serves as the chief science officer, said about the test field.

To prepare the plot, Alvarez said the company “raided” the USDA cotton seed bank in College Station, Texas to capture as much genetic diversity as it could, from wild varieties, cultivated varieties, modern varieties, to historical varieties.

“Having diversity in a crop development program is usually bad. You want to get away from it as quickly as possible. But in the context of machine learning, you need variation and diversity in order to learn something. You can’t learn anything about your crop if you don’t see more options,” he said.

In total, Avalo’s 5-acre field has 500 varieties of cotton. Each row is a different variety and each plant is tagged with identifiers. Alvarez emphasized that for machine learning to be effective, it needs to learn the evolutionary history of cotton in a very short period.

Drones are used to create digital maps and collect data that would otherwise be time consuming for humans. Weekly drone flights provide data on how much a plant has grown (measurable by the physical boundary of the plant from the top down) and much light it’s eating, which will help determine if a plant will put out more cotton bowls.

“By doing that every week, the drone adds to a growth trajectory for each of the plants,” he explained. “When there’s a rain event, for example, we can see if the plants are taking advantage of the rain. Are they eating more light because they’re less thirsty? Are they using the available nitrogen in the ground or are they like ignoring the nitrogen that’s available to them?”

The data Avalo collects is fed into a machine learning algorithm, along with all the environmental data that is coming from the field’s weather station so the model can predict the performance of the plants even when farmers put them out in the field in future years. “In this field, we have as much genetic data as 23andme would grab in about a year’s worth of business,” Alvarez said.

For this region specifically, Avalo aims to develop seeds that address its water and climate issues.

“Cotton can be a thirsty crop, and it takes a lot of water,” said Rebecca White, Avalo chief product officer, adding how the region is on top of the Ogallala Aquifer, which spans from south of Lubbock, Texas all the way into the Dakotas.

“The intensive agriculture that we’ve done over the past couple of centuries, especially the last 150 years, has detrimentally affected that aquifer and wells are drying up,” she said, pointing to a nearby well that stopped drawing enough water to have irrigated cotton.

If farmers in this region want to continue to cultivate cotton, they need cotton seed varieties that are not just drought resistant, meaning that they can tolerate it when there’s less rain than expected, but which are bred specifically to grow in low water environments.

White noted that a lot of the genetics that are available in the cotton industry are for irrigated cotton, or they are for wet area cotton.

Farmers also need varieties that are heat tolerant. Rising temperatures due to climate change is problematic for cotton, especially at night.

“One of the things that cotton needs to mature properly, is a good temperature differential between daytime and nighttime temperatures,” White said. “So, if it’s not cooling off at night, the cotton will drop its blooms. That’s a stress response. It would rather be a bush then put on fruit.”

That response, she added, is basically a defense mechanism that signals to the farmer to try again next year.

Cotton produced in this region comes with some limitations. Much of the cotton grown in Texas—especially under dryland, non-irrigated conditions—lacks the fiber quality required for textile manufacturing and is therefore often used for other purposes. White said this fiber characteristic is closely linked to factors like water availability and nitrogen levels.

Despite these drawbacks, dryland cotton offers notable sustainability advantages, including a smaller carbon footprint compared to other cotton varieties. Avalo chose Clarendon for its test field partly because local farmers rotate cotton with peanuts.

“One of the largest inputs in terms of carbon footprint for cotton is the nitrogen inputs,” White explained. “Peanuts, being a legume, naturally return nitrogen to the soil. So, you can grow peanuts for a year or two and then swap your cotton in, and you don’t have to use nitrogen fertilizer. The combination of being lower input in general and rotating with peanuts means that this cotton in particular has a low carbon footprint.”

Cotton will be the first product that Avalo takes to market. Schwanz said the goal is to use this same approach to regionally adapt cotton varieties to any growing region, so that it can have the attributes needed to both meet the ecological, agricultural and economic demands there.

“Taking data from real fields like this and being able to meld that with really advanced technology—that’s come a long way in the last few years, I think we’re going to really unlock some secrets that we’re not aware of,” said Dakota Keyser, Avalo’s production agronomist.

The technology is also creating new opportunities for farmers managing Avalo’s test fields, helping them boost income during challenging times. “The biggest challenge that cotton farmers are facing today is actually an economic answer,” said Roger Wade, a fifth-generation farmer and one of Avalo’s farming partners. “We’ve got a depressed price and increased input prices, which are things like diesel. As much as we want rechargeable electric tractors, logistically, it’s very hard. The chemicals that we’re using are very expensive, and fertility is very expensive.”

Avalo offers farmers a participation incentive of five cents per pound and contributes toward seed costs, supporting farmers both financially and operationally. In exchange, farmers follow Avalo’s guidelines like a limit on upper fertilizers (no more than 30 lbs. per acre) and collects data for a lifecycle assessment.

At its core, Avalo is focused on addressing challenges across the entire supply chain—creating solutions that benefit both ends and generate meaningful synergies throughout.

Schwanz pointed out how the work goes back to breeding resilience—not just breeding crops that can do more with less or maximizing yield—but true resilience for everyone. “You have to win the ecological and eco economical problem at the same time,” he said.

The lawsuit follows an earlier legal challenge by the same manufacturers. In August, the truck companies filed a suit seeking to invalidate the CTP, which was signed in 2023 and mandated the phasing out of traditional trucks in favor of zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs). The manufacturers argued that federal policy changes under the Trump administration, which rolled back Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) rules permitting states to set their own emissions laws, rendered the agreement null and void. They contended that California’s enforcement of the CTP conflicts with federal law.

Republicans saw President Donald Trump’s return to office in January as giving them a chance to repeal the Biden administration rules.
But the agency actions could be jeopardized by the status of its acting director, Bill Groffy.
The first Trump administration never had a BLM director confirmed by the Senate and the current Trump administration hasn’t nominated one since its first candidate withdrew.
Trump nominated Kathleen Sgamma in February to BLM director.","Congress has delivered some key wins on federal land management for the Trump administration even as the Bureau of Land Management, the agency that manages roughly 10 percent of American lands, lacks a director confirmed by the Senate.

Using the Congressional Review Act, lawmakers have vacated three BLM rules regarding management of federal lands in Alaska, North Dakota and Montana. The nullifications remove resource management plans adopted by the BLM during the Biden administration that prevented mining and drilling on federal lands in the states.

The Senate last Thursday also voted to rescind a 2022 BLM record of decision that would close off 11 million acres of the 23 million acre Strategic Petroleum Reserve-Alaska to oil and gas leasing. Rep. Nick Begich, R-Alaska, has a companion bill in the House.

The congressional actions have more immediate effect than would a time- and manpower-consuming rule reversal by the BLM, an agency that is working under an acting director whose authority is under challenge. They allow the Trump administration to implement policies to increase drilling and mining on public lands.

Congressional Republicans are critics of the BLM plans, saying the Biden administration was increasing energy prices by curtailing production on federal land.

Republicans saw President Donald Trump’s return to office in January as giving them a chance to repeal the Biden administration rules. The Government Accountability Office’s determination in June that the rules for the purposes of the Congressional Review Act gave them more time to act than is typical under the CRA.

Congress has also cleared three joint resolutions for the president’s desk that will vacate BLM resource management plans concerning eastern Montana, North Dakota and the central Yukon in Alaska.

The agency is also moving forward with other reversals of Biden administration actions that aren’t eligible for nullification under the CRA, including the repeal of a rule that considered conservation a “use” for public lands alongside grazing, mining, and oil and gas extraction. The change, which allowed leases for environmental mitigation and restoration, was criticized by Republicans.

But the agency actions could be jeopardized by the status of its acting director, Bill Groffy. The first Trump administration never had a BLM director confirmed by the Senate and the current Trump administration hasn’t nominated one since its first candidate withdrew.

District Judge Brian Morris in U.S. District Court for the District of Montana found during the first Trump administration that William Perry Pendley had served unlawfully as acting director of the BLM for more than a year. Pendley had been nominated by Trump, but the nomination was soon withdrawn after Republican senators expressed reservations.

Public Employees for Environmental Responsibility, which filed a challenge of Pendley’s tenure in 2020, sent a letter Friday to the Interior Department expressing concern that the various BLM acting heads, including Groffy, don’t satisfy the requirements of the law that outlines who can lead agencies without a Senate-confirmed leader.

“Without Senate confirmation, Interior’s leaders are more likely to be ‘fringe’ figures or otherwise unqualified. Further, official actions they take may be found by courts to be invalid,” the letter said.

The Interior Department said in an email it “will respond to non-shutdown related queries once appropriations have been enacted.”

Groffy was appointed the principal deputy director of BLM in June, a position that doesn’t require Senate confirmation, and was simultaneously named acting director. He was previously the senior director of legislative and regulatory affairs at the Colorado Oil and Gas Association, an industry group critical of the Biden administration’s land policies.

Trump nominated Kathleen Sgamma in February to BLM director. As director of the oil and natural gas industry group Western Energy Alliance, she was a vocal advocate for the industry and challenged a number of Biden administration decisions in court.

Her nomination was pulled in April just hours before her confirmation hearing was set to begin. Sgamma has previously criticized Trump’s actions during the Capitol riot on Jan. 6, 2021, writing in a message to WEA members she was “disgusted” by his role in “spreading misinformation.”",https://rollcall.com/app/uploads/2025/11/hegseth_hearing_704_011425.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:38.989160

Robert Santangeli",,,,,https://www.powermag.com/coals-revival-from-maintenance-mode-to-market-necessity/,"Momentarily eased policy pressures have allowed coal plants a second act—one defined not by expansion, but on efficiency, reliability, and return on investment.
CoalTreat additives are applied to the fuel and can alter coal ash characteristics during and after combustion, raising fusion temperatures, decreasing fouling, and recovering lost megawatts.
Changes in ash chemistry can be observed through high-temperature probe (HTP) testing that simulates tube-surface conditions (Figure 1).
For example, at PJM’s June 2025 peak ($1,334/MWh), recovered MWh could yield greater than $5 million in a single event.
In the age of AI and “big data,” coal isn’t finished yet.","For more than a decade, the U.S. coal industry has been in decline — with waning investment, shrinking capacity, and the steady rise of gas and renewables. Yet, in 2025, a different story is emerging. Across the country, coal units once scheduled for quiet retirement are being called back into service in ways few anticipated—driven not by nostalgia, but by a new kind of demand shock: the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), data centers, and industrial reshoring.

Massive, round-the-clock power needs from AI and cloud computing, along with “Made in America” manufacturing growth, have led to a capacity crunch that renewables and gas alone can’t satisfy. Momentarily eased policy pressures have allowed coal plants a second act—one defined not by expansion, but on efficiency, reliability, and return on investment.

From Survival to Selective Modernization

Over the past decade, most coal plants operated in “maintenance-only mode.” With low wholesale prices and high regulatory uncertainty, investment was deferred, units slipped to lower efficiency levels, and chronic slagging and fouling became routine.

Now, utilities are being asked to do more, operate more efficiently, and run cleaner without significant capital upgrades. This has pushed operators to focus on selective modernization, especially in areas that provide immediate, measurable benefits.

Reclaiming Lost Megawatts Through Chemistry

One of the most effective tools transforming coal economics is fuel chemistry optimization—led by Environmental Energy Services (EES) and its CoalTreat additive program. CoalTreat additives are applied to the fuel and can alter coal ash characteristics during and after combustion, raising fusion temperatures, decreasing fouling, and recovering lost megawatts.

In one 750-MW tangential-fired boiler, CoalTreat eliminated reheat-section slagging that had previously caused derates. The unit increased output by 3% and lowered NOx emissions by 0.02 lb/MMBtu.

Another 650-MW plant firing high-slag Illinois Basin and Northern Appalachian blends operated five consecutive days at full load—a feat once impossible—after treatment. Infrared boiler cameras confirmed clean pendant and nose-arch surfaces throughout the run.

The economic benefits are equally significant. Switching from premium Central Appalachian to Illinois Basin fuel saved plants $40 per ton while keeping output and compliance intact. At another location, slagging had lowered furnace exit-gas temperatures by 100F, which improved heat rate by 2.5% and increased net annual revenue by an estimated $2.5 million.

Inside the Process: How Additives Transform Ash

Slag formation begins when minerals in coal, such as silicates, iron, sodium, and potassium, are volatilized and/or react during combustion to create high-strength, low-melting point, sometimes glassy deposits that adhere to tube surfaces.

CoalTreat works by introducing specially formulated chemical additives that alter ash chemistry, promoting the formation of brittle crystals (high-melting crystalline structures like anorthite and hematite) instead of “sticky” amorphous glass. The result:

Fluxing or molten deposits become solid and friable, and are easily removed by sootblowing.

Ash fusion temperatures increase by 150F to 200F.

Accumulated slag or fouling is weaker, as shown in sintering strength data, becoming increasingly friable and more easily removed by existing equipment.

Forced outages and heat transfer losses decrease.

Changes in ash chemistry can be observed through high-temperature probe (HTP) testing that simulates tube-surface conditions (Figure 1). Probe accumulations and associated temperature mapping data consistently show reduced slag adhesion and no or reduced “black glass” formation, validating the chemistry’s effectiveness in actual furnace operating conditions (Figure 2). HTP testing, along with furnace infrared photography/thermography conducted during field trials can be used to verify performance in short demonstration programs.

Field Proven: Restoring Lost Megawatts Through Fuel Chemistry

The shift from maintaining the status quo to a renewed focus on maximizing generating capacity and reliability is borne out daily across the U.S. fleet. Utilities that once viewed additive chemistry as a tool of last resort are now actualizing significant operational and financial returns. The following case study from a U.S. coal-fired generating unit demonstrates how a targeted CoalTreat program restored lost megawatts, improved heat rate, and delivered multimillion-dollar gains—all without capital upgrades.

Case Study: Restoring Lost Capacity Through Chemistry

A Midwestern public utility operates a 500-MW-class generating unit burning a high-moisture, moderate-ash coal blend. The unit had faced persistent derates and forced outages due to severe slagging. Traditional sootblowing, load-shedding, and best practices proved inadequate, resulting in the loss of thousands of megawatt-hours of generation annually—often during high-value peak periods.

Implementing a custom additive treatment increased ash fusion temperatures by approximately 200F and through crystal changes in the slag reduced adhesion and accumulation. During the initial test period, the plant avoided more than 9,000 MWh of derate due to fouling and cut forced outages by about 120 hours. Additionally, the unit improved its average heat rate by nearly 200 Btu/kWh and significantly lowered boiler maintenance and sootblower steam consumption.

The savings from heat-rate improvement contribute approximately $1.0 million annually to the plant’s bottom line. Recovered power sales generated a net income of about $5 million per year (after fuel costs), based on an average power sale price of $100/MWh. Maintenance savings from reduced boiler cleaning and weld repairs eliminated roughly $100,000 in annual maintenance expenses.

Peak power sales in many regions will continue to rise. For example, PJM peak power prices hit $898/MWh on April 8, 2025, and $1,334/MWh on June 23, 2025. Plants that can increase power sales during peak hours can substantially boost their profitability. For example, at PJM’s June 2025 peak ($1,334/MWh), recovered MWh could yield greater than $5 million in a single event.

The primary benefit wasn’t just financial. By stabilizing combustion and extending tube life, the additive program also lowered safety risks related to explosive cleaning. Moreover, CoalTreat does not require installing water cannons or other costly maintenance additions. CoalTreat has demonstrated increased plant reliability and that chemistry-based performance recovery can replace substantial capital investments and prevent power sales losses during long upgrade outages.

Fuel Flexibility: The Competitive Edge

With tailored fuel treatment programs, utilities can confidently burn lower-cost, higher-slagging coals without sacrificing performance. This capability to switch between fuel sources offers a valuable hedge against volatile supply and pricing while providing a strategic advantage as dispatch needs evolve with AI-driven baseload growth. By enabling the use of lower-cost “opportunity” coals without sacrificing performance, plants can realize a significant increase in gross profit and maintain operational flexibility in a shifting energy landscape.

EES’s latest CoalTreat On-Demand Systems (ODS) are portable, intelligent treatment systems available for rapid deployment. Reagent dosages and blends are tailored to varying coal types and are capable of automatic control. ODS systems can be used for continuous applications to control persistent slagging or intermittent applications where particular coal blends/seams or operating conditions cause periodic issues.

As AI and reshoring drive unprecedented electricity demand (the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicts 20 GW to 30 GW of new data center load by 2030—equivalent to more than 50 coal units at 80% capacity factor), the existing coal fleet remains essential for system stability. For utility stakeholders, the message is practical: Invest selectively, measure diligently, and optimize the assets you already have. Every avoided derate, every efficiency improvement, and every ton of fuel flexibility counts in this high-demand environment (Figure 3).

In the age of AI and “big data,” coal isn’t finished yet.

Who're they gonna call? Well, Toyota's latest SEMA 2025 build may be the answer.

Combining its hydrogen fuel cell innovations with proven EV tech, Toyota presents a unique and eco-friendly take on adventure with the Tacoma H2-Overland Concept, built on the latest Toyota Tacoma. This concept will be on display at the 2025 SEMA Show and features specs that will undoubtedly make for a fun time beyond the pavement, while also serving as a sort of rescue/recovery vehicle, thanks to some nifty features. Let's take a look!

The Tacoma H2-Overland Is A 540+ Horsepower, Clean-Driving Off-Road Pickup

The Tacoma H2-Overland Concept showcases Toyota's multi-path approach to a cleaner future, showing that hydrogen fuel cell tech can be as capable as it is clean. Built by the Toyota Racing Development (TRD) engineering teams in California and North Carolina, as well as Toyota Motor North America R&D, the Tacoma H2-Overland Concept features a 547-horsepower dual-motor setup that consists of a 225-kW front motor and a 188-kW rear eAxle powered by a 24.9-kWh lithium-ion battery pack, offering genuine 4WD ability.

The system utilizes a fuel cell stack taken from the second-gen Toyota Mirai with three H2 tanks providing a 6-kg capacity that pairs with the battery pack to deliver the very respectable 547 horsepower mentioned. The system relies on a TRD custom cooling system that was adapted from Tacoma TRD and Lexus RZ parts to ensure thermal stability when pushing the H2-Overland Concept.

The concept features a 15-kW power takeoff that's capable of powering a home off-grid or even charging two EVs simultaneously, thanks to dual NEMA 14–50 outlets. Its charging capability, as well as its powerful off-road ability, make it a noteworthy recovery vehicle. From simply charging your battery to pulling you out of a mud bog and powering your campsite, this build is essentially a St. Bernard with a barrel of whiskey in a blizzard. But wait, there's more! Taking survivability to new heights is the patent-pending TRD exhaust water recovery system, which captures and filters water from the exhaust for camping and outdoor use. While the captured water may not be recommended for drinking, it's distilled and is perfect for showering and washing.

A Proper Off-Roader That Takes The 'Buddy System' Seriously

The concept was designed and built entirely in-house by TRD-USA and features everything you'd expect from such a model, and more. Features include a front limited-slip diff and rear electronic locking diff, a TRD billet long-travel kit with heavy-duty, high-performance Fox 2.5 Performance Elite Series shocks, a brake upgrade, and a set of custom 17x8.5-inch wheels shod in 35x12.5R17 off-road tires. In other words, it's a true four-wheel-drive overlander that can handle pretty much any terrain.

The build is also equipped with a camper fitted with recycled carbon-fiber aero panels, heavy-duty off-road bumpers on the front and rear, integrated recovery points, a winch, and dual swingouts, as well as tiedowns and a recovery board storage system in the bed of the pickup. Of course, an adventure vehicle needs ample lighting, which the team supplied in the form of DOT-compliant front lightbars, fog lights, and camp lights for those late nights in the wild. The TRD team has successfully adapted FCEV and BEV technology onto a platform that was never meant to house such applications, creating a concept that can tackle any terrain, help those stranded, power campsites, and provide usable water, all without damaging the very environment it's built to dominate.",https://static0.topspeedimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/jpegtacoma_h2_overlander_concept_toyota_sema_2025_hi-res_29.jpg?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-03 19:05:17.158357

(P&GJ) — The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has released an environmental assessment (EA) for Transcontinental Gas Pipe Line Company’s (Transco) proposed Southeast Supply Enhancement Project, concluding that the project “would not constitute a major federal action significantly affecting the quality of the human environment.”

Transco’s project aims to expand natural gas transportation capacity by 1.6 Bcf/d (1,596,900 dekatherms per day) to serve growing demand in the southeastern United States. The project would add new pipeline loops and compressor horsepower across Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, and Alabama.

Key project components include:

31.2 miles of 42-inch pipeline in Virginia and North Carolina (Eden Loop)

24.2 miles of 42-inch pipeline in North Carolina (Salem Loop)

Compressor unit additions at stations in Pittsylvania (VA), Davidson (NC), and Iredell (NC) counties

Replacement of three compressor units at Station 145 in Cleveland County, NC

Valve and regulator installations at existing Transco facilities throughout the route

FERC noted that cooperating agencies — including the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service — participated in the review under the Clean Water Act, Rivers and Harbors Act, and Endangered Species Act. The EA analyzed geology, soils, water resources, air quality, and wildlife impacts, finding no significant effects with appropriate mitigation.

The document also outlines land and construction needs, estimating that the project will disturb about 1,452 acres during construction, with 380 acres maintained permanently for operation. Construction is expected to begin in March 2026, with in-service targeted for November 2027, subject to final approvals.

Efforts by politicians to tilt the electoral playing field through redistricting and other manipulations are almost as old as American democracy itself, and indeed, by the late 19th century, both parties had turned redistricting into a blood sport.

Republicans and Democrats alike used every procedural lever available — from mid-decade map rewrites to the strategic admission of new states like the Dakotas, Montana and Wyoming — to lock in House, Senate and Electoral College advantages that would outlast their popular vote share.

What’s unfolding in California is less a break from tradition than a reversion to it — and a reminder that the map wars of the Gilded Age, not the reformist ideals of the late 20th century, might be the true American inheritance.

The history of gerrymandering is nearly as old as the republic itself. The term was coined in 1812, when Massachusetts Governor Elbridge Gerry approved a state senate map so contorted that one district outside Boston resembled a salamander — hence, “Gerry-mander.” But the instinct to manipulate boundaries for advantage long predated the nickname. Early state legislatures routinely redrew maps mid-decade to dilute rival factions, suppress emerging parties or amplify rural interests. By the 1840s and 1850s, as industrial cities grew and immigrant voters swelled the rolls, both Democrats and Whigs were perfecting the art — carving up counties, annexing wards and tinkering with apportionment formulas — in the name of “fair representation.”

Drawing convoluted maps was one matter. But in the late 19th century, as popular vote shares in presidential and House races grew tighter, parties worked feverishly to devise new ways to achieve and preserve power.

Throughout the Gilded Age, state legislatures treated redistricting as a political cudgel. With no “one person, one vote” rule — that wouldn’t become the law of the land until Baker v. Carr in 1962 — little judicial oversight and volatile shifts in partisan control, state politicians wielded mapmaking as an extension of electoral combat. Whenever one party captured the governorship and legislature, it redrew district lines to tilt the playing field and expand its share of congressional seats — sometimes mid-decade, sometimes repeatedly within a few election cycles. As political scientist Erik Engstrom observed in his article, “The Rise and Decline of Party Gerrymandering in the 19th Century U.S. Congress,” “these 19th-century gerrymanders were not symbolic gestures but decisive acts that could swing national power in Washington itself.”

Nowhere was that more apparent than in Ohio, where lawmakers redrew the state’s congressional map an astonishing seven times between 1878 and 1892 as Democrats and Republicans traded control of the legislature and governorship. Each new majority sought to reverse its predecessor’s advantage and pad its own congressional delegation — often with immediate national consequences. One Democratic redraw, urged on by House Speaker Samuel Randall in 1878, flipped nine seats and preserved his party’s tenuous majority in Congress. A decade later, also in the middle of a 10-year census cycle, Republicans returned the favor in Pennsylvania, carving out 21 safe GOP districts out of 28 and seizing back control of the U.S. House — and with it, unified command of the federal government.

Other states followed similar patterns. In Alabama, Democrats redrew the map in the mid-1870s, packing nearly every Black Belt county into a single district to quarantine Republican votes. In Missouri, Democrats undertook a mid-decade 1878 redistricting alongside Ohio’s, flipping seats that helped preserve their narrow House majority. And in Maine, Republicans’ 1884 gerrymander proved so effective that it delivered them all four congressional seats for the next five elections, even though they won only about 54 percent of the statewide vote. Across the map, the pattern was unmistakable: Whenever control of a statehouse shifted, new lines quickly followed.

In the decades after the Civil War, Republicans pursued another, even more durable form of redistricting — one that operated at the national level. By the late 1870s, with the party’s congressional majorities slipping and the reunited Democrats regaining strength in the South, GOP leaders turned to the map of the Union itself. Between 1889 and 1890, Congress admitted six new western states — North Dakota, South Dakota, Montana, Washington, Idaho and Wyoming — most with populations not remotely sufficient to justify statehood. Each brought two reliable Republican senators and at least one new seat in the Electoral College.

The motivation was as ideological as it was partisan. To many Republicans of that generation, allowing Democrats to reclaim full control of the federal government was tantamount to losing the Civil War after the fact — a return to the 1850s, when a coalition of Southern slaveholders and Northern Democrats dominated Washington. The rapid stacking of Republican states in the high plains and Rockies was meant to safeguard the political gains of Union victory, ensuring that the party of Lincoln could not easily be dislodged from national power. In the process, the GOP quite literally redrew the American map in an effort to preserve its governing majority — a reminder that in this period, the boundaries of the nation itself were tools of partisan survival.

Mid-decade redistricting may have slept for a century, but it didn’t die. Beginning in the early 2000s, Republicans revived the practice with remarkable zeal — first in Texas in 2003, when then-U.S. House Majority Leader Tom DeLay engineered a mid-cycle remap that netted the GOP six new congressional seats, and later in Georgia (2005) and North Carolina (2016), where party leaders followed suit. Each case upended the modern norm of once-a-decade redistricting and demonstrated that the old Gilded Age instincts — redraw when you can, because you can — were still alive in American politics.

For Democrats today, the lesson isn’t necessarily that bare-knuckle politics of the variety plied by Gilded Age politicians is good, or just, or sensible. Rather, it’s that history does not offer a particularly compelling case for political purity at the sacrifice of power. The line between principle and self-preservation — or, as was often the case, outright partisan conquest — has always been negotiable in American democracy. Those who refuse to negotiate it often find themselves out of the map room, and out of power.

The same historical argument that can be made for mid-decade redistricting in blue states can also be made for admitting new states to the Union — Puerto Rico and Washington, D.C., to be sure, but why not Guam, American Samoa or the U.S. Virgin Islands? However out of step such moves might seem with recent norms, an expansion of the federal map would be entirely consistent with the country’s political traditions.",https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/resize/1200/quality/90/format/jpg?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F96%2F36%2F73336e904fd2af269e4b72ab6578%2Fhttps-delivery-gettyimages.com%2Fdownloads%2F2242675715,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:55.689510

Bowring said the monitoring group advocates not allowing data centers to connect unless the grid can guarantee continual service and reliability.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment.

In a surprise move that could benefit PJM Interconnection, Gov. Josh Shapiro and three other have submitted a joint proposal formulated with the Data Center Coalition (DCC), an industry group, that favors approving connections to data center firms that will generate and add their own power to the grid.

The proposal would offer a fast track approval process for both the data centers and the power sources they would build. The idea was raised this week during a hearing held by PJM, the nation’s largest electrical grid, as it grapples with soaring demands and seeks federal approval later this year to hasten permit reviews.

Pamela Quinlan, a principal at GQS New Energy Strategies, an energy consulting company that represents the DCC, a leading data center trade group, described the eight-page plan as a “voluntary and heavily incentivized” path for the industry.

Quinlan offered limited details during the hearing at PJM’s office near Philadelphia. The proposal generated interest because the four governors—from Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia—have been critical of PJM’s operations but eager for data center expansion in their states.

The electricity originated by the centers’ power generators would feed into the PJM’s regional grid, bolstering its reliability, according to the proposal. At least one energy researcher who reviewed the proposal said the strategy may also boost reliance by the new data centers on natural gas.

The DCC is an industry trade group for data center operators and cloud providers. Among its members are the biggest tech companies in the world, including Amazon Web Services, Google, Microsoft and Meta, all of which have invested billions of dollars in developing and deploying artificial intelligence and, in the past couple years, proposing new data centers. AI operations require massive amounts of water and power.

Jacob Finkel, an aide to Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro, spoke at the hearing and said he was representing the four states, which are in “strong alignment” with the DCC over the proposal.

PJM’s inability to process grid applications in a timely manner has frustrated many governors across the grid operator’s 13-state service area. The other states reliant on PJM are Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Michigan, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, West Virginia and the District of Columbia. It was not clear during the meeting if the other states were consulted by Finkel.

Data centers require around-the-clock electricity and even brief dips can cost millions of dollars in revenue. The fast-track proposal aims to accommodate lucrative investment from tech and financial firms in some pivotal states.

States oversee the siting, permitting and environmental review for commercial projects that require grid access. The states also assess land-use or rights-of-way and construction approvals related to the construction of electric lines and substations.

The DCC-governors proposal essentially relies on the states to expedite permitting and siting for the data operations. Under the proposal outlined by Quinlan, each state can issue directives to expedite projects that will build energy lines or substations. The data center’s power sources don’t have to be on the data-center site itself. The generators can be elsewhere in the same grid area that is approved by the state.

Under the plan, data centers qualify for the fast lane only if they create power equal to their expected use. For example, a data center site planning to use 50 megawatts must secure or develop 50 megawatts of supply. Those megawatts would be added to PJM’s grid at the time the business is launched.

The proposal includes a measure to combat rising bills for all ratepayers. The proposal would extend or maintain the current capacity charge set by PJM—what customers pay to guarantee power at all times—for another year. In July, PJM issued a capacity charge for service from June 2026 to May 2027 that topped 20 percent, and it agreed then to extend the cap to that charge to 2028. PJM said that would mean an increase of about 1.5 to 5 percent in customers’ bills, depending on their area.

The proposal outlined by the DCC would extend the price cap into the summer of 2029.

“Seeing this proposal to extend the price cap for another year is a very significant win for consumers,” said Abraham Silverman, an energy researcher at Johns Hopkins University’s Ralph O’Connor Sustainable Energy Institute. That would shield customers from price spikes as data centers come online, he said.

The DCC and the governors supplied few details about their proposal beyond an eight-page outline. Some analysts said the DCC and the governors need to provide specifics on how each state will review and decide to fast-track the projects.

Paul Sotkiewicz, the president of energy consulting company E-Cubed Policy Associates and a former chief economist for PJM, said states should be wary of how they “short-circuit” processes that will affect local residents and governments.

“I can imagine it backfiring on politicians if they do that,” Sotkiewicz said. “It all sounds nice on paper, but….I don’t see how it can happen.”

“There are certain processes that they have to follow and procedures that they have to follow to issue permits,” he said. “That’s just the way permitting works.”

Finkel said Pennsylvnia and other states will form a “consortium” to “figure out how they’re going to do this.” Finkel offered Pennsylvania’s months-old Lightning Plan as an example, which aims for a one-stop deadline-driven framework for power projects permits. The plan, announced in January, would create a new oversight board to coordinate and speed siting and approvals. As of this month, the plan remains a blueprint.

Silverman pointed to another concern about the fuel driving the new power sources. States with ambitious climate change goals might have to accept that the data centers that contribute to PJM will be using gas rather than solar or wind power, he said.

“A hyperscale data center…may be a thousand megawatts. That’s a lot of solar,” Silverman said.

Joseph Bowring, the president of Monitoring Analytics, an independent monitoring unit that reports on PJM’s electric power market, said the DCC-governors proposal is missing some notable guarantees.

A central question in the rulemaking discussions over PJM reliability is who should lose power when the grid is stressed, he said. Should data centers lose power first? Should they lose it in sync with everyone? Or should they be the last to lose power?

“The equitable way to formulate it for these guys who are coming onto the system (and) bringing 30,000 megawatts of issues is for them to be interrupted first,” Bowring said. “If interruptions were assigned to data centers first,” he said, it is likely that “data centers would not sign up for that service.”

Bowring said even if PJM assigned interruptions “perfectly,” the fact that there would be interruptions means the grid cannot reliably serve its customer base.

Bowring said the monitoring group advocates not allowing data centers to connect unless the grid can guarantee continual service and reliability.

The plan from DCC and the governors is one of more than a dozen proposals being considered by PJM as it seeks public comment to support a request for a rule change—known as the Critical Issue Fast Path—meant to add suppliers to the grid.

PJM has also heard its own staff proposal: allowing 10 new proposed projects per year to connect to the grid in as little as 10 months through expedited reviews.

Pending and signed hyperscaler deals

Entergy is a vertically-integrated electric utility with five operating companies in four states: Arkansas, Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas. Its weather-adjusted retail sales rose 4.4% compared to last year. Profit increased from $645 million in the third quarter of 2024 to $694 million in the third quarter of 2025. In 2024, commercial and industrial customers made up 69% of Entergy’s sales, which were concentrated in Louisiana.

The company has agreements for several notable large load projects with Google and Meta. In general, it expects substantial load growth from commercial and industrial customers through 2029, though not the breakneck pace utilities like Dominion Energy expect in data center hotspots such as northern Virginia.

In its third-quarter investor update, Entergy said its data center customer pipeline increased 2 GW from the previous quarter to land in the 7 GW to 12 GW range. Also in the quarter, Energy secured 4.5 GW of power generation equipmentto serve new load expected to come online this decade.

In August, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved the generation and transmission resources needed to support Meta’s planned 2-GW campus in northeastern Louisiana. Those include three combined-cycle gas plants with combined nameplate capacity of about 2.2 GW.

As part of the same proceeding, the commission also authorized Entergy to procure up to 1.5 GW of solar resources for the project.

Entergy executives said Wednesday that the Meta agreement and additional expected load growth are reflected in the utility’s five-year capital plan, which lays out $41 billion in estimated spending through 2029.

Entergy has also submitted an application to the Arkansas Public Service Commission for the Cypress Solar project, a 600-MW solar / 350-MW battery energy storage project backed by Google.

The Cypress Solar project would power a 1,000-acre Google data center campus in West Memphis, Arkansas. Google will cover the “full energy costs” of the campus, the Arkansas Economic Development Corporation said on Oct. 2.

Gas continues to dominate Entergy’s energy mix

In December 2024, renewables made up just 3% of Entergy’s 24-GW portfolio of owned and leased generation. Gas-, coal- and oil-fired resources make up more than 75% of its existing generation capacity and around 75% of capacity approved or under consideration by utility commissions across its four-state footprint, according to its third-quarter earnings presentation.

In September, the PUCT approved two gas-fired power projects, the 754-MW Legend combined-cycle power station and the 454-MW Lone Star combustion-turbine plant, but with a $2.4 billion “hard cap” to protect ratepayers due to regulator concerns that the utility did not take steps to ensure the projects were cost effective.

In addition to gas-powered generation, executives said they also see long-term opportunity in clean energy development and electrification.

Including the Cypress Solar project, which is pending regulator approval, Entergy has more than 2 GW of clean energy projects — mostly standalone solar — approved or under consideration. Entergy itself will own about 1.5 GW of that capacity while procuring 570 MW through power purchase agreements.

Marsh said large customers’ sustainability goals could support future carbon capture investments.

“We are building this gas generation, but we have expectations that we will also do carbon capture at some point, and we are working on that actively,” he said, citing requests for proposals for projects in Mississippi and Texas.

Cautious optimism on new nuclear

Marsh said he was “excited” by recent nuclear-related developments nationally and in Entergy territory, such as the creation of the Texas Advanced Nuclear Energy Office. All four Entergy states have a formal, state-led process or body to explore new nuclear generation, he said.

He said Entergy “applauds” the $80 billion deal between Brookfield Asset Management, Cameco, Westinghouse Electric and the U.S. government to deploy multiple gigawatt-scale reactors. The utility will keep close tabs on the partnership as more details come out, Marsh said.

“We’re excited to see someone moving forward,” he said.

Marsh did not announce any new-build nuclear projects on the call, but Entergy has filed for a $69 million, 45-MW capacity uprate of its Waterford 3 nuclear plant in Louisiana. It expects to complete that project by 2029.

Transmission and grid hardening investments

In addition to large load growth, Entergy is planning to grade and expand its transmission and distribution network.

In October, the Public Utilities Commission of Texas approved the company’s 145-mile, 500-kV SETEX transmission project in Entergy’s Southeast Texas territory. Entergy expects the Texas commission to approve its approximately 45-mile, 500-kV Cypress to Legend line later this year.

Separately, the company was awarded a $200 million grant from the Texas Energy Fund that Entergy CEO Drew Marsh said would harden 16 transmission lines and more than 8,000 distribution poles.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/JvhbgH5If-il9tKXst4GxfDj9jBJDsco4LgrVwcMjHU/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9FbnRlcmd5X0NvcnBfTmluZW1pbGVfNl9wb3dlcl9wbGFudF9Mb3Vpc2lhbmFfMjAxOS5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-11-03 14:06:17.376631

The slowdown at the New Carlisle site signals a strategic recalibration for GM as the auto giant navigates a shifting landscape for electric vehicles.

The project’s contractor, Barton Malow, confirmed the workforce reduction. ""We recently had to lay off some of our workforce,"" a company statement read, characterizing the move as ""an unfortunate part of the natural ebb and flow of the construction business."" The statement affirmed a commitment to ""supporting them through this transition."" While steel frames for the massive facility stand in place, the pace of work has visibly decelerated. Local officials attribute the pause to potential design changes, possibly for a different battery type than the originally planned nickel-rich prismatic cells.

This hesitation arrives as GM aggressively slashes EV costs and redirects capital toward its profitable gasoline-powered truck and SUV portfolio. The automaker’s broader retrenchment includes thousands of layoffs at other EV and battery facilities. Shifting federal policies under the Trump administration have further clouded the business case for electric vehicles, dismantling incentives and creating a more challenging environment.

Despite the turbulence, St. Joseph County’s Bill Schalliol projects confidence in the project's ultimate completion. He believes the plant will open by the December 2027 deadline, even if its final product differs from the initial blueprint. ""We're playing the long game,"" Schalliol said, dismissing any notion of a complete abandonment. GM, he quipped, didn’t invest billions ""to convert this into the world's largest pickleball facility."" Yet for nearby residents like Dan Caruso, the slowed construction fuels skepticism.

We’ve had 35 years of bipartisan support, and it has been earmarked in congressional law many times, through multiple George H.W. and George W. Bush administrations.”

2. The world is on track for about 2.8 degrees of warming

The world is on track to warm by an average of 2.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century, the Rhodium Group predicted in its latest forecast. The consultancy said its modeling showed a 67% likelihood that global temperatures will rise between 2.3 degrees and 3.4 degrees thanks to the current trajectory of planet-heating pollution. That’s a significant improvement on the dire predictions issued a decade ago. But if decarbonization doesn’t pick up pace, the probability of limiting warming to 2 degrees — the more modest target set in the Paris Agreement — is below 5%. Still, the findings don’t deviate much from Rhodium’s projections before Trump returned to office. As Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote this morning, “in the long run, Trump might not mean much for the climate’s trajectory.”

Nevertheless, the overshoot beyond 2 degrees is partly why Bill Gates took a more moderate stance on climate change in his latest memo, as Heatmap’s Robinson Meyer wrote last week. It’s also why, as Rob explained in a big story, private companies promising to commercialize technology to geoengineer the world’s temperature are raising large sums of money.

3. Energy Department makes $100 million available to help modernize coal plants

The Department of Energy is stepping up its efforts to keep aging coal plants online. The agency on Friday announced plans to offer up to $100 million to owners of coal-fired power stations that plan to modernize the stations with upgrades that “improve efficiency, plant lifetimes, and performance of coal and natural gas use.” In a press release, Secretary of Energy Chris Wright praised President Donald Trump for having “ended the war on American coal” and “restoring common sense energy policies that put Americans first.”

Despite Trump’s promises to revive American coal production and use, exports fell 11% in the first half of this year due to China buying less of the fuel amid ongoing trade negotiations, according to an analysis published Friday by the Energy Information Administration.

Quarterly coal exports, on the rise on the Biden administration, are now plunging. EIA

4. State Street quits climate group

In the latest sign that Wall Street is heeding Trump’s calls to veer away from investment initiatives that cut out fossil fuels, lending giant State Street’s asset management arm withdrew its U.S. operations from what was once a leading climate action group for the industry. The company said “it had decided that only its units serving UK and European clients would remain part of the Net Zero Asset Managers” group, the Financial Times reported. BlackRock, Vanguard, and JP Morgan Asset Management had already left the group known as NZAM in the U.S. JP Morgan and State Street had already also quit another green investor group, Climate Action 100+, last year.

5. Spain is officially reconsidering the world’s last national nuclear phaseout

Months after Taiwan shut down its final reactors earlier this year, a plurality of voters approved a referendum calling for the last atomic plant to be turned back on. Years after Germany completely exited nuclear power, the new government has reversed Berlin’s position and has now joined France in supporting atomic energy again as it considers ways to restore its fleet. Switzerland and Belgium, meanwhile, reversed plans to shut down nuclear plants, and Italy — the first country in the world to end its nuclear power production years ago — is working on reviving its industry. That leaves only Spain still stubbornly planning to close its nuclear plants starting in 2027.

The tides may be turning. In February, a majority of lawmakers in Spain’s parliament approved a resolution condemning Socialist Prime Minister Pedro Sanchez’s phaseout plans. Now the board of Spain’s Centrales Nucleares Almaraz-Trillo has officially requested a three-year extension on the operating license for units one and two of the Almaraz Nuclear Power Plant. If granted, the extension would allow the reactors to stay online through 2030. The station currently supplies 7% of Spain’s electricity.

THE KICKER

Fusion energy, the joke goes, is the energy source of tomorrow — and always will be. But recent laboratory breakthroughs have unleashed billions of dollars in private financing to commercialize fusion energy for real, with companies promising to open power plants in the next decade. There’s a big bottleneck, however: Many of the materials needed for fusion reactors are scarcely produced right now. New bipartisan legislation aims to change that by extending the 45X tax credit for clean manufacturing — one of the few parts of the Inflation Reduction Act retained in Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act — to producers of vanadium, deuterium, helium-3, and other materials needed for fusion power to take off.

The “Supreme Court” of energy in Georgia

There are only 10 states in the country that hold elections for a Public Service Commission, a small group of regulators who oversee utility companies, and Georgia is one of them. As Charles Hua, the executive director of the nonprofit PowerLines, recently put it, these officials are the “Supreme Court justices” of energy. They preside over what kinds of infrastructure gas and electric utilities will build, where they’ll build it, and how much rates will go up as a result.

The election in Georgia is long overdue after being held up by a lawsuit the last two election cycles. Two of the five current commissioners have served three extra years without being re-elected by voters. During that time, the commission has approved six rate increases for customers of Georgia Power, the largest utility in the state, in part to pay for major cost overruns on new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle. Now Georgia Power is proposing a major expansion of natural gas power — about 10 nuclear reactors’ worth — mostly to meet data center demand.

The two seats are held by Republicans Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. They are being challenged by Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johson, who have vowed to push for Georgia Power to meet demand with clean energy.

Battle for the soul of electricity affordability in New Jersey and Virginia

Energy costs are at the center of the governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia this year, and Democrats and Republicans are making opposite arguments about how to lower them. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill has vowed to freeze utility rates and clear red tape to “open the floodgates on new cheaper and cleaner energy projects,” including solar, battery storage, and nuclear. Her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, thinks the key to lower prices is pulling out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 13-state cap and trade program that incentivizes cleaner power generation and raises money for climate-friendly projects. He also wants to repeal the state’s electrification goals for vehicles and buildings and ban offshore wind development.

A similar fight is playing out in Virginia, although there it’s tied more to the state’s rapidly multiplying data centers. Virginia is already home to 13% of global data center capacity, with more coming online. A recent state legislative report warns that customers are looking at increases of $14 to $37 per month by 2040 as a result.

The Democratic candidate for governor, former U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger, wants to expand solar and wind power and invest in building efficiency. She’s also advocated for data centers to “pay their fair share” of new energy infrastructure, and said she will encourage them to pilot advanced clean technologies like small modular nuclear reactors and hydrogen. She’s running against Winson Earle Sears, the current lieutenant governor of Virginia, who has questioned the reliability of renewable energy, arguing for an all-of-the-above strategy that includes “clean coal.” While “beautiful clean coal,” may be one of Trump’s favorite energy sources, the reality is, it’s still just coal.

The governor’s seat isn’t the only one that’s up for grabs in Virginia. Whoever wins will need the House of Delegates on their side. Democrats currently have a razor thin 51-seat majority, and all 100 seats are on offer. Even a blue wave in the House doesn’t guarantee strong climate action, however, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Climate Cabinet. “Which candidates win will determine whether Virginia expands on” its climate law, the Clean Economy Act, “or backslides,” the group said in a “races to watch” memo.

Public transit for a fast-growing city

Voters in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the whole of Mecklenburg County, will be asked whether to increase their sales tax by 1% to fund new transportation projects. Roughly 60% of the estimated $20 billion raised by the tax will go toward the expansion of rail and bus service. Charlotte is among the fastest-growing cities in the country. During a legislative hearing this summer, State Senator Mujtaba Mohammad said an average of 130 people move to the area each day. “We are experiencing longer commutes, more car accidents, higher car insurance premiums, more pedestrian-related accidents and less revenue to address our crumbling critical infrastructure,” he said.

The Charlotte Area Transit System finalized a new long-range plan this year to foster “transit-oriented communities,” by increasing bus frequency, extending service hours, adding microtransit options to underserved neighborhoods, and adding 43 miles of new rail. But the plan is only possible with funding from the sales tax.

Sales tax increases are a common way to raise money for public transit systems — legislators in California recently voted to put a sales tax increase on next year’s ballot to address a looming fiscal cliff for transit in the Bay Area. Illinois also voted last week to increase the sales tax in the Chicago area by 0.025% to raise money for its ailing transit system, among other measures.

Other fights to watch:

A few smaller elections where climate is also on the ballot this year, according to Climate Cabinet:

The Whatcom County Council, in Washington State, which in 2021, became the first local government in the country to prohibit new oil refineries, coal plants, and fossil fuel shipment facilities. There’s currently a slim 4-3 pro-climate majority on the council, and Climate Cabinet says that if that majority holds, it will “send a signal to other pro-climate county leaders around the country that their courage won’t cost them their seats.”

Jacob Frey, the current mayor of Minneapolis, pissed off climate advocates earlier this year when he vetoed a local carbon fee passed by the city council, arguing it was not legally sound. The council overrode the veto, but the fee was ultimately scaled back from $452 per ton to $5 per ton after a study by city staff found the lower number to be safer from legal challenges. Climate Cabinet is watching for whether candidates for the mayor’s office and city council who support carbon fees will win or be punished, and “whether anti-climate candidates gain more of a foothold in the city.”

A full decade has passed since the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, and in that time the world has avoided the most catastrophic scientific projections. In 2015, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, projected that global average temperatures could increase by as much as 7.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century without significant shifts in policy and advancements in technology. Now, the Rhodium Group estimates that warming is highly unlikely to exceed 3.9 degrees by 2100, and could be limited to 2 degrees.

The numbers themselves are not hopeful. This is a vast range in terms of the potential impacts implied, and even 2 degrees of warming should not be considered “little.” The IPCC estimates that compared with a scenario that limits warming to 1.5 degrees, more than twice as many people would be exposed to severe heat at least once every five years in a world 2 degrees warmer; ice-free summers in the Arctic would occur 10 times more often; the number of plant, animal, and insect species that lose at least half their habitat would be two to three times larger; and crop yields and fisheries would suffer roughly twice the losses.

Putting those dire projections aside, what’s interesting is that this 2- to 3.9-degree range is about the same as what the Rhodium Group forecast when it published its first Climate Outlook report in 2023. Also relatively unchanged: a finding that global power sector emissions will peak within the next decade, and that total emissions will likely remain constant or subtly decline through 2060, but then go up again as Global South countries see more rapid economic development in the latter half of the century.

The reason the numbers haven’t changed much, despite some seemingly dramatic policy changes that have occurred in the interim, has to do with Rhodium’s unique approach to projecting the future.

Many of the reports that come out around this time, such as the UN’s annual Emissions Gap Report, try to assess where the world is headed based on currently enacted policies as well as pledges, such as the “nationally determined contributions” that countries submit to the UN. Those might include promises like, “We’ll build X quantity of renewable energy by 2030,” or “We’ll protect X amount of our forests.” The models assume that these policies and pledges are fixed. They do not contemplate future ramp-ups or potential reversals. They also use fixed assumptions about GDP and population growth, oil prices, technology costs, etc.

A recent report by Wood Mackenzie, for example, estimates that temperatures will climb to 2.6 degrees by 2060, and then models a few other potential discrete scenarios, including one that shows what it would take to limit warming to 2 degrees.

The limitation of this approach is that the trajectory for each variable these models use is deeply uncertain, Hannah Pitt, one of the authors of the Rhodium report, told me. “Even a small change in GDP growth can have really big implications for emissions — likewise for oil prices and renewable costs and all that,” she said. “We try to take into consideration the wide range of uncertainty we have in the future of those core drivers of emissions.” That requires modeling thousands of scenarios with different combinations of how those underlying drivers might evolve.

Then, rather than assuming that policies on the books today remain static, Rhodium uses data on how climate and energy policy has historically responded to economic inputs like oil prices and GDP growth, in different parts of the world to project how policy might change going forward, using a carbon price as a proxy for policy ambition.

This approach takes into account such a wide range of possibilities that the results aren’t likely to change much year to year. Both in 2023 and now, the modeling incorporated the prospect that a Trump administration or something like it could reverse some progress, and that energy demand could soar. “We are looking at the long-term evolution of policy, not the administration fluctuations,” Pitt explained. It would take a true step-change in policy or a major technological breakthrough to produce a noticeable change in the trajectory, she said.

What are those breakthroughs? At this point, they aren’t a mystery. Cheaper clean firm power — like advanced nuclear, fusion, or geothermal — would be a huge help. Solutions for decarbonizing flying and shipping are also on the list. We also need to make it affordable to produce iron, steel, cement, and petrochemicals with far fewer emissions.

On the policy side, bending the curve might mean something like stricter electric vehicle requirements. As mentioned earlier, economic development in the Global South is expected to shift emissions back upward later this century — in part because if policy evolves the way it has historically, and if more and more people around the world are buying cars, the cars may not be 100% electric, and emissions from transport will go up.

None of this is to say that the Trump administration’s actions will have no effect on warming. Recall the report’s expansive range of future warming scenarios of 2 to 3.9 degrees — it’s very possible that policies enacted today will push the world closer to one or the other. A separate recent Rhodium study that dives into the specifics of U.S. policies found that emissions in 2035 could be 0.8 to 1.2 gigatonnes higher than what the group projected in the same report last year, largely due to Trump’s policies.

It should be comforting that one administration can’t veer the world too far off course — although by that same logic, we can’t expect a single administration to shift projections in a positive direction, either. A ""breakthrough"" in something like decarbonized cement will likely happen over years, through a feedback loop of sustained policy support and technological development.

There is no “too late” when it comes to addressing the technology and policy gaps the report highlights, Pitt said “Of course, the sooner the better,” she said. “But the difference between a 2.8-degree future and a 2.5-degree future saves lives. So the effort to drive these technology costs down is worthwhile, even if it doesn’t happen on the timeline that we would hope.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjAwMTc5OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNjYzMzcyMH0.JLSQqq1tXMvX2awV44mALHTDHXLSQUYOuv4pdP-Gh7I/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-03 13:13:17.126363

This scalability approach contrasts sharply with conventional rare earth processing facilities, which typically require complete facility reconstruction to achieve meaningful capacity increases.
Competitive Landscape Analysis The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance operates within a broader competitive landscape encompassing multiple Western rare earth processing initiatives.
Sector-Wide Investment Themes The alliance reinforces multiple investment themes driving capital allocation toward Western rare earth processing capabilities.
This transformation extends beyond individual projects to encompass systematic rebuilding of Western rare earth processing expertise and infrastructure.","Understanding the Strategic Partnership Between Ucore and Vacuumschmelze

The rare earth processing landscape witnessed a transformative development when Ucore Rare Metals Inc. (TSXV: UCU | OTCQX: UURAF) established a strategic alliance with German magnet manufacturer Vacuumschmelze (VAC) and its American subsidiary eVAC Magnetics LLC. This collaboration represents a fundamental pivot toward Western supply chain independence in critical materials processing, targeting the creation of an integrated pathway from refined oxides to finished permanent magnets.

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance centers on bridging two crucial industrial stages within North American manufacturing infrastructure. Ucore contributes its proprietary RapidSX™ separation technology alongside planned production facilities in Louisiana and Ontario, while VAC brings decades of magnet manufacturing expertise through established distribution networks across automotive, defense, and renewable energy sectors.

Core Components of the Partnership Framework

The alliance establishes an integrated supply pathway connecting refined rare earth oxides directly to finished permanent magnet production. This vertical integration approach addresses a critical gap in Western rare earth processing capabilities, where refined materials typically require export to Asian manufacturers for magnet production before returning to Western end-users.

Partnership Component Ucore Contribution VAC/eVAC Contribution Technology Platform RapidSX™ separation process Advanced magnet manufacturing Production Capacity 2,000-7,500 tonnes annually Established global supply chains Government Support $22.4M DoD backing $111.9M federal tax credits Geographic Footprint Louisiana & Ontario facilities South Carolina & European plants

The partnership operates under a nine-month Memorandum of Understanding timeline, requiring both parties to negotiate definitive commercial terms while managing ongoing construction, permitting, and financing activities simultaneously. This compressed timeframe creates both opportunity and execution pressure for finalizing binding agreements.

Key Elements Driving the Partnership

Strategic government support underpins the collaboration through multiple funding mechanisms. eVAC Magnetics secured $111.9 million in federal tax credits for its South Carolina permanent magnet manufacturing facility, while Ucore received $22.4 million in Department of Defense backing for its RapidSX™ technology development and facility construction.

Furthermore, this partnership aligns with critical minerals energy security initiatives that recognise the strategic importance of domestic processing capabilities. The geographic distribution of facilities creates a North American rare earth processing corridor spanning Louisiana, Ontario, and South Carolina. This configuration positions the alliance to serve both U.S. and Canadian defense requirements while supporting clean energy infrastructure development across the continent.

How Does the RapidSX™ Technology Transform Rare Earth Processing?

Revolutionary Separation Methodology

Ucore's RapidSX™ platform employs molecular recognition technology to achieve superior purity levels while significantly reducing processing time compared to conventional solvent extraction methods. This innovative approach enables production of battery-grade and magnet-grade oxides with measurably lower environmental impact than traditional processing techniques.

The technology processes rare earth elements 3-5 times faster than conventional methods while achieving 99.9%+ purity levels for standard magnet applications. Enhanced purity specifications reach 99.95%+ for wind turbine applications and 99.99%+ for defense systems, making the technology suitable for the most demanding high-performance applications.

Commercial Scalability Advantages

The RapidSX™ technology's modular design architecture allows for rapid capacity expansion without proportional increases in capital expenditure. Initial operations targeting 2,000 tonnes per annum can scale systematically to 7,500 tonnes through additional processing modules, creating flexible response capabilities to market demand fluctuations.

This scalability approach contrasts sharply with conventional rare earth processing facilities, which typically require complete facility reconstruction to achieve meaningful capacity increases. Consequently, the modular framework enables Ucore to respond dynamically to market conditions while minimising stranded capital investment risks.

Technology Performance Specifications:

• Processing speed: 3-5 times faster than traditional solvent extraction

• Purity achievement: 99.9%+ for standard applications

• Enhanced purity: 99.95%+ for wind turbine systems

• Defence-grade purity: 99.99%+ for military applications

• Modular capacity scaling: 2,000 to 7,500 tonnes annually

• Environmental impact: Significantly reduced versus conventional processing

The molecular recognition approach represents a departure from decades of solvent extraction dominance in rare earth processing. While conventional methods rely on chemical separation through successive extraction stages, RapidSX™ utilises selective binding mechanisms to isolate specific rare earth elements more efficiently.

What Market Dynamics Are Driving Western Supply Chain Diversification?

Chinese Market Dominance and Strategic Vulnerabilities

Current global rare earth refining capacity remains heavily concentrated in Chinese facilities, controlling approximately 90% of worldwide processing operations. This concentration creates substantial supply security concerns for Western manufacturers, particularly in defence and clean energy applications where material reliability and consistent availability are paramount operational requirements.

The extent of Chinese refining dominance extends beyond simple market share statistics. Most Western rare earth mining operations export unprocessed concentrates to Chinese facilities for separation into individual oxides, creating dependency relationships that persist even when raw materials originate from Western sources.

Government Policy Alignment and Industrial Strategy

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance aligns strategically with multiple Western industrial policy initiatives designed to strengthen supply chain resilience and reduce critical materials dependencies. Moreover, this collaboration reflects broader industry innovation trends that emphasise technological advancement and supply chain localisation.

These policy frameworks provide both financial support and regulatory backing for domestic rare earth processing capabilities.

Key Policy Support Mechanisms:

• Defence Production Act Title III: Direct financial assistance for critical materials production

• Inflation Reduction Act: Tax incentives for domestic clean energy supply chains

• Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy: Supply chain resilience and processing capacity development

• European Raw Materials Act: Strategic autonomy objectives for critical materials

The convergence of these policy initiatives creates unprecedented support for Western rare earth processing ventures. Unlike previous market cycles driven primarily by price volatility, current diversification efforts receive sustained government backing across multiple jurisdictions.

Investment Wave and Competitive Response

Western rare earth processing initiatives have attracted substantial investment flows as governments and private investors recognise the strategic importance of supply chain diversification. Multiple projects across Australia, Europe, and North America are advancing simultaneously, creating a coordinated response to Chinese processing dominance.

This investment wave encompasses both traditional mining operations and advanced processing technologies. For instance, the focus has shifted from simply securing rare earth ore sources to developing complete processing capabilities that can deliver finished materials to end-users without Asian intermediaries.

Which Rare Earth Elements Will the Alliance Target?

Primary Focus on Permanent Magnet Elements

The Ucore-VAC collaboration prioritises six critical oxides essential for high-performance permanent magnet production. These elements form the foundation of neodymium-iron-boron (NdFeB) magnets, which dominate applications in electric vehicles, wind turbines, and defence systems.

Targeted Rare Earth Elements:

Neodymium oxide (Nd₂O₃) – Primary magnetic component providing fundamental magnetic strength

Praseodymium oxide (Pr₆O₁₁) – Magnetic strength enhancement and cost optimisation

Dysprosium oxide (Dy₂O₃) – High-temperature stability and coercivity improvement

Terbium oxide (Tb₄O₇) – Advanced coercivity enhancement for demanding applications

Samarium oxide (Sm₂O₃) – Specialised high-temperature magnet applications

Gadolinium oxide (Gd₂O₃) – Thermal management and specialised magnetic properties

Application-Specific Requirements

Different end-use applications demand varying purity specifications and elemental compositions. Electric vehicle motors typically require neodymium, praseodymium, and dysprosium at 99.9%+ purity levels, balancing performance requirements with cost considerations for mass-market manufacturing.

Wind turbine generators demand higher purity specifications of 99.95%+ for neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium. The enhanced purity requirements reflect the demanding operational environment and extended service life expectations of large-scale wind generation systems.

End-Use Sector Primary Elements Purity Requirements Application Context Electric Vehicles Nd, Pr, Dy 99.9%+ Mass-market motor production Wind Turbines Nd, Pr, Dy, Tb 99.95%+ Large-scale generation systems Defence Systems All six elements 99.99%+ Mission-critical applications Industrial Motors Nd, Pr, Sm 99.9%+ Commercial motor applications

Defence applications require the highest purity specifications of 99.99%+ across all six targeted elements. Military systems demand maximum reliability and consistent performance under extreme operational conditions, necessitating the most stringent material quality standards.

Magnet Performance Characteristics

Each targeted element contributes specific performance characteristics to finished permanent magnets. Neodymium and praseodymium provide fundamental magnetic strength through their electronic structure and magnetic moment properties. These light rare earth elements form the primary magnetic phase in NdFeB magnets.

Heavy rare earth elements, particularly dysprosium and terbium, enhance coercivity and high-temperature stability. While these elements are used in smaller quantities compared to neodymium and praseodymium, their impact on magnet performance is disproportionately significant for demanding applications.

What Are the Timeline and Production Milestones?

Phase-Based Development Strategy

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance operates under an aggressive development timeline designed to establish commercial production capabilities by late 2025. The phased approach allows for systematic capacity scaling while managing construction, commissioning, and operational risks.

Phase 1 (Late 2025): Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex commissioning targeting 2,000 tonnes per annum initial capacity. This phase focuses on demonstrating commercial-scale RapidSX™ technology performance and establishing initial oxide supply agreements with eVAC Magnetics.

Phase 2 (2026): Capacity expansion to 5,000+ tonnes annually with comprehensive commercial supply agreements. This phase emphasises production optimisation, quality consistency, and market penetration across automotive and renewable energy sectors.

Phase 3 (2027): Full-scale operations reaching 7,500 tonnes per annum with multiple product streams serving diverse end-market applications. This phase targets maximum facility utilisation and expanded customer base development.

Revenue Projections and Market Impact

At projected full-scale capacity levels and current rare earth oxide market pricing, the alliance could generate approximately $500 million in annual revenue by 2026. This revenue projection assumes successful commissioning, consistent production quality, and sustained market demand for Western-sourced materials.

The revenue potential reflects the premium pricing available for non-Chinese rare earth oxides, particularly for defence and critical infrastructure applications. Western buyers demonstrate willingness to pay premium pricing for supply security and regulatory compliance advantages.

Production Timeline Milestones:

• Late 2025: Initial Louisiana facility commissioning (2,000 tpa)

• Mid-2026: Commercial production ramp-up (5,000+ tpa)

• 2027: Full-scale operations (7,500 tpa maximum capacity)

• 2026 target: $500 million annual revenue potential

• 9-month MOU timeline: Definitive commercial agreement completion

Critical Timeline Dependencies

The aggressive timeline relies on successful completion of multiple parallel activities. Louisiana facility construction must proceed without significant delays, while Ontario facility commissioning provides backup production capabilities and technology validation.

Permitting approvals, environmental compliance, and workforce development represent potential timeline risks that could impact commissioning schedules. The compressed development timeline leaves limited buffer for addressing unexpected construction or regulatory challenges.

What Execution Risks Could Impact the Alliance's Success?

Technical and Operational Challenges

The partnership confronts substantial technical scaling risks as RapidSX™ technology transitions from demonstration scale to commercial production. While laboratory and pilot-scale results appear promising, large-scale processing operations often reveal unforeseen technical complexities that require extended optimisation periods.

Primary Technical Risk Categories:

• Unproven commercial-scale performance: RapidSX™ technology lacks extended commercial operating history

• Complex feedstock quality management: Rare earth concentrates exhibit significant compositional variations

• Process optimisation requirements: Large-scale operations demand continuous technical refinement

• Equipment reliability concerns: New separation technology faces durability testing under commercial conditions

Financial and Timeline Pressures

Substantial remaining funding requirements create execution pressure for both partners. While government support provides significant backing, additional private investment is necessary to complete facility construction and support initial operating capital requirements.

The nine-month Memorandum of Understanding timeline creates compressed decision-making pressure for finalising binding commercial terms. This timeline requires simultaneous resolution of technical validation, financial arrangements, and legal documentation while managing ongoing construction activities.

Financial Risk Elements:

• Substantial remaining funding requirements for completion

• Aggressive commissioning schedules with limited buffer time

• Market price volatility exposure affecting project economics

• Working capital requirements for initial production ramp-up

Regulatory and Competitive Factors

Regulatory approval processes for rare earth processing facilities involve complex environmental permitting and safety certification requirements. Delays in regulatory approvals could impact commissioning timelines and increase project costs significantly.

Competitive pressure from established Chinese processors presents ongoing market challenges. Chinese facilities benefit from decades of operational optimisation, integrated supply chains, and lower labour costs that create persistent pricing pressure on Western processors.

Critical Risk Assessment: The combination of unproven commercial-scale technology, aggressive timelines, substantial funding requirements, and competitive market dynamics creates significant execution uncertainty for the alliance's success prospects.

How Does This Compare to Other Western Rare Earth Initiatives?

Competitive Landscape Analysis

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance operates within a broader competitive landscape encompassing multiple Western rare earth processing initiatives. However, this partnership benefits from the context established by the Australia critical minerals reserve strategy, which demonstrates international coordination in securing supply chains.

Australian processing expansions target 15,000+ tonnes per annum capacity across several projects, representing substantially larger scale ambitions compared to Ucore's 7,500-tonne maximum capacity.

European refining initiatives benefit from substantial government backing through the European Raw Materials Act and national strategic autonomy programmes. These initiatives focus on establishing complete rare earth processing capabilities independent of Chinese supply chains.

Comparative Western Initiatives:

• Australian processing expansions: 15,000+ tpa aggregate capacity across multiple projects

• European refining initiatives: Government-backed strategic autonomy programmes

• Canadian mining and processing integration: Vertically integrated supply chain development

• Japanese technology partnerships: Advanced separation technology collaborations

Strategic Positioning Advantages

Unlike purely mining-focused initiatives, the Ucore-VAC partnership creates vertical integration from refining through magnet production. This approach potentially captures higher value-added margins while ensuring supply security for critical end-use applications.

The alliance's focus on North American magnet manufacturing differentiates it from competitors targeting global oxide markets. Direct integration with eVAC's South Carolina facility creates captive demand for Ucore's oxide production, reducing market uncertainty compared to merchant processing operations.

Technology Differentiation Factors

RapidSX™ technology's claimed processing speed and purity advantages could provide competitive differentiation if commercial-scale performance meets projections. However, established competitors utilise proven solvent extraction technologies with decades of operational optimisation.

The modular scalability approach offers potential advantages for capital efficiency and market responsiveness. Traditional rare earth processing facilities require substantial upfront capital investment for full-scale operations, while Ucore's modular approach enables incremental capacity additions based on market demand.

What Investment Implications Emerge from This Alliance?

Market Valuation Considerations

The partnership provides Ucore with credible downstream demand validation, potentially supporting higher equity valuations as production milestones are achieved successfully. However, substantial execution risks maintain investor caution until commercial operations demonstrate sustained performance and profitability.

The non-binding nature of the current Memorandum of Understanding limits immediate valuation impact. Investors typically require binding commercial agreements and demonstrated production capabilities before applying significant valuation premiums to development-stage rare earth processors.

Sector-Wide Investment Themes

The alliance reinforces multiple investment themes driving capital allocation toward Western rare earth processing capabilities. Supply chain localisation premiums reflect growing investor recognition of geopolitical supply risks and government policy support for domestic processing capabilities.

Key Investment Theme Categories:

• Supply chain localisation premiums: Western processors command valuation premiums over Chinese competitors

• Technology differentiation value: Advanced processing capabilities justify higher multiples

• Government partnership benefits: Policy support reduces regulatory and financial risks

• ESG alignment advantages: Sustainability and security objectives attract dedicated investment flows

Risk-Adjusted Return Considerations

Investment returns from the Ucore-VAC alliance depend heavily on successful execution of aggressive development timelines and unproven commercial-scale technology. The high-reward potential reflects substantial market opportunity, while execution risks create corresponding potential for significant losses.

Professional investors typically apply substantial risk discounts to development-stage rare earth projects due to historical execution challenges across the sector. Successful commercial production achievement could generate substantial returns, while technical or financial failures could result in total investment losses.

Furthermore, the sector's integration with renewable energy transformations creates additional complexity in evaluating long-term demand scenarios and pricing dynamics.

Investment Risk Warning: Rare earth processing investments involve substantial technical, operational, and market risks. Past performance of similar ventures has been highly variable, and investors should carefully evaluate execution capabilities before making investment decisions.

Frequently Asked Questions About the Ucore-VAC Alliance

Is the partnership legally binding?

The current agreement operates under a non-binding Memorandum of Understanding framework with a nine-month timeline established for negotiating definitive commercial terms. Final binding agreements remain subject to successful completion of technical validation, financial arrangements, and legal documentation processes.

Both parties retain the right to withdraw from negotiations without penalty during the MOU period. However, the substantial government support and strategic importance suggest strong incentives for successful completion of binding agreements within the specified timeline.

When will commercial production begin?

Ucore targets late 2025 for initial Louisiana Strategic Metals Complex commissioning, with commercial-scale production ramping through 2026. These timelines depend on successful construction completion, environmental permitting approvals, and financing arrangements.

The phased development approach allows for initial production at 2,000 tonnes annually, expanding to 5,000+ tonnes by 2026 and reaching maximum 7,500-tonne capacity by 2027. However, these aggressive timelines carry substantial execution risks that could result in delays.

How does this impact rare earth prices?

Additional Western supply capacity could moderate long-term price premiums for non-Chinese rare earth materials. However, initial production volumes represent a relatively small percentage of global demand, limiting near-term price impacts across broader rare earth markets.

The alliance targets high-purity, specialty applications that typically command premium pricing compared to standard commercial grades. Defence and renewable energy applications demonstrate willingness to pay premium pricing for supply security and quality assurance advantages.

What government support backs the alliance?

The partnership benefits from substantial government financial support across multiple jurisdictions. eVAC Magnetics received $111.9 million in federal tax credits for its South Carolina magnet manufacturing facility, while Ucore secured $22.4 million in Department of Defense backing for technology development.

Additional policy support includes Defence Production Act Title III authority, Inflation Reduction Act incentives, and Canadian Critical Minerals Strategy backing. This multi-jurisdictional government support reflects the strategic importance assigned to Western rare earth processing capabilities.

Long-Term Strategic Implications for Global Rare Earth Markets

Supply Chain Transformation Trajectory

The Ucore-VAC rare-earth alliance exemplifies a fundamental transformation from China-centric supply chains toward diversified, regionally-integrated processing networks. Successful execution could catalyse additional Western partnerships and accelerate investment flows toward domestic rare earth processing capabilities.

This transformation extends beyond individual projects to encompass systematic rebuilding of Western rare earth processing expertise and infrastructure. In addition, the alliance represents one component of broader strategic initiatives spanning multiple countries and technologies.

Technology Leadership Implications

Successful commercialisation of RapidSX™ technology could position North America as a global leader in advanced rare earth processing methodologies. This technological leadership could attract additional international partnerships, technology transfer opportunities, and investment capital toward Western processing capabilities.

The molecular recognition approach represents potential paradigm shift from conventional solvent extraction dominance. If commercial-scale performance meets projections, other Western processors may adopt similar technologies, creating competitive advantages over traditional Chinese processing methods.

Market Structure Evolution

Long-term success of the alliance could contribute to fundamental changes in global rare earth market structure. Current Chinese processing dominance reflects historical investment patterns and technological expertise rather than inherent competitive advantages.

Western processing capabilities supported by government policy and advanced technologies could gradually reduce Chinese market share over the next decade. This evolution would create more balanced global supply chains and reduce geopolitical supply risks for critical materials.

The broader global mining landscape continues to evolve as countries develop domestic processing capabilities and reduce dependence on Chinese facilities.

Strategic Market Impact Assessment:

• Supply diversification: Reduced dependence on Chinese processing capabilities

• Technology advancement: Next-generation separation technologies challenging conventional methods

• Policy integration: Government support creating sustainable competitive advantages

• Investment attraction: Successful execution encouraging additional Western rare earth investments

This strategic MOU development demonstrates the industry's commitment to building complete Western supply chains that reduce geopolitical risk and enhance supply security.

Long-Term Market Outlook: The Ucore-VAC alliance represents both significant opportunity and substantial execution risk, serving as a critical test case for Western rare earth supply chain independence ambitions and a potential catalyst for broader market transformation.

The alliance's ultimate success will depend on technical execution, market development, and sustained government support across multiple election cycles and policy administrations. While the strategic rationale appears compelling, practical implementation challenges remain substantial and require careful monitoring by industry observers and investors.

It seemed obvious at the time that EV sales weren’t going to increase at some geometric rate, even though many still acted as if that was the case. I feel safe in saying that the rest of the decade is going to go to the hybrid.

The limited sales data we get from some automakers in October is out, confirming the massive negative swing in electric car sales due to the expiration of the EV tax credit. At the same time, hybrid sales are exploding and are likely to continue for the foreseeable future.

Do you want some great news? The chip shortage I wrote about on Friday may have a political solution, although I wouldn’t count my wafers until they’ve been fabricated. Also, Škoda is having a great year. That’s something to celebrate.

S&P Projects A Huge Share For ‘Electrified’ Cars

If I’m being 100% real, I did initially want to call this the “Decade of the EREV” given what’s coming from various automakers. America loves big trucks, and big trucks either require massive batteries or some other tradeoff in order to do big truck things. An obvious solution is to pair a generator engine with a battery pack that isn’t the equivalent of four Nissan Leafs.

I still think EREVs and, to a smaller extent, PHEVs will be a part of the picture. It’s just that full hybrids (FHEV) and mild hybrids (MHEV) solve so many problems at so low a relative cost that it seems like a no-brainer for almost every car out there. S&P Global Mobility is out with a fancy new chart showing the potential future mix, broken down by region:

S&P Global does great infographics.

As you can see, this is how much of the total share of various markets will be electrified in some sort of way. This ranges from 48v MHEVs all the way up to full BEVs. I can’t think of a single vehicle for sale that couldn’t be at least an MHEV, so it’s interesting to see that this isn’t the biggest area of projected growth. It’s hybrids.

There are a few reasons for this. Mostly, it’s just the cheapest way to solve the following problem: Electric cars are way more efficient than gasoline-powered cars, but gasoline has a way higher energy density than current batteries, which are not cheap.

My current CR-V Hybrid is floating around its 37 MPG combined average, and I never have to think about it. When it’s puttering around town, it’s mostly using stored energy. When I get going on the highway, it turns the motor on when necessary.

The other reason for hybrids coming in strong, as S&P Global Mobility notes, is that the regulatory environment in the United States is too unpredictable. We have a system wherein the Executive branch can dramatically change the universe in which carmakers exist. Flexibility is key, and while you can make a vehicle that can accept EV and ICE powertrains (this is what’s interesting about the BMW iX3), it does create some compromises:

Overall, manufacturers are shifting their focus toward flexible powertrain system strategies that can accommodate regulatory uncertainty and changing consumer preferences. The US market is likely to witness increased experimentation with transitional technologies such as REEVs and hybrids, as the industry navigates the complex interplay of incentives, policy, and consumer demand.

It’s all about flexibility going forward, although most companies will likely still create EV-only platforms to address the growing market for EVs. Looking ahead to 2030, if this projection is correct, then an increase in BEVs will be dwarfed by EREVs (they call them REEVs), MHEVs, PHEVs, and just plain old hybrids. That sounds right to me. [Ed Note: I think this study is underestimating EREVs/REEVs, but we’ll see. -DT].

October Sales Back Up The Trend

It was always clear that this month was going to see a massive reduction in EV sales as buyers stocked up on EVs while the $7,500 discount was still in play. So far, Hyundai, Kia, and Ford are out with October sales data, and this seems to support the “Decade of the Hybrid” thesis.

Let’s talk Hyundai, which saw its ongoing year-over-year sales streak finally come to an end as year-over-year sales dropped by a nominal 2%.

“Hybrid vehicles led the way in October with a 41% increase, and electrified sales were up 8%,” said Randy Parker, president and CEO, Hyundai Motor North America. “We saw strong EV demand leading up to the expiration of federal tax credits, and while that shift has temporarily disrupted the market, we’re confident it will reset. Hyundai’s momentum remains strong, and we’re on pace for record retail and total sales for the year. Solid fundamentals, smart inventory strategy, and an exceptional team and dealer network power us.”

I’m not a math genius, but if hybrid sales were up 41% and “electrified sales” were only up 8%, that means EV sales had to drop. Yup! The Ioniq 5 was down 63% year-over-year, and the Ioniq 6 dropped 52%. The cheap Venue was the biggest winner, up 49%, but the most important number for Hyundai was the 15% increase in Tucson sales.

Kia managed to keep its sales streak going by selling an extra 94 cars! That’s tight. The cheap Niro saw a huge 75% year-over-year increase, but the real winner in my heart is the now-hybrid Kia Carnival, up 35% over the same period. Ford’s total sales were up by about 2% in October, with electric vehicles down 25% and hybrids down 4%.

What’s up with hybrids? Ford is winding down sales of the Escape, which had a hybrid model, and hasn’t yet replaced it with a Bronco Sport Hybrid. Maverick sales were still up year-over-year, though I’m not sure of the breakdown of hybrids v. ICE for that or the F-150.

The Chip Shortage That Maybe Just Went Away

Full disclosure time: Our co-founder, Beau, has a few other businesses in addition to being a part of this one. Remarkably, there has been little to no editorial pressure or conflict of interest. There was some over the weekend, and I just feel the need to call it out when it happens, for the sake of journalist integrity. On Friday, I wrote about the Nexperia chip shortage that threatened to derail the auto industry. I made a joke about the film Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo, noting that the film “was neither very good nor popular.”

Beau let me know via a stern text that not only did he think the film wasn’t so bad, but that he actually saw it in the theater. The only time I’d seen the film was projected on the wall of a house party in college, and was therefore not fully paying attention.

Taking any critique of my work seriously, I watched more of the film this weekend and looked up contemporaneous reviews. Roger Ebert actually gave it three stars, and made it clear he liked it better than Annie, which he didn’t like:

Remember all the self-importance of “Annie“? That’s why a modest, cheerful little movie like “Breakin’ 2: Electric Boogaloo” is so refreshing. Here is a movie that wants nothing more than to allow some high-spirited kids to sing and dance their way through a silly plot just long enough to make us grin.

Perhaps I was being too glib. I regret the error, but I also want you to know that we take editorial independence seriously here and that the Morning Dump will not be caving to pressure (from a certain North Carolinian taillight enthusiast) regarding my belief that “Son in Law” is the best Pauly Shore movie.

Oh, right, chips. Yeah, that whole thing with the politically-charged chip shortages seems to have resolved itself, according to this Bloomberg report:

Following the trade truce agreed by presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping at their summit last week, the US said on Saturday that Beijing will take steps to allow the Chinese facilities of Nexperia to resume shipments. This move, which confirms an earlier Bloomberg report, will likely ease worries about chip shipments that had threatened auto production as a trade fight between China and the US escalated.

The Dutch and Chinese arms of the same company are still beefing, but it sounds like they’ll keep doing their respective jobs and not disrupt a whole industry while they work out their issues.

Škoda Stays Singularly Superlative

My favorite modern Czech automaker (suck it Kaipan!) is the one arm of Volkswagen that doesn’t seem to be sweating it all that much. It doesn’t sell cars in North America, it never earned a huge stake in China that it’s suddenly losing, and it makes the kind of nice and cheap cars that consumers want.

According to a company sales release, through Q3 the company’s sales are up 14.1% year-over-year, and its balanced portfolio of ICE, EV, and hybrid vehicles is leading the company to big sales in Europe. Only Cupra is doing better, but that’s a relatively new automaker with less than half the volume.

It’s also expanding in markets like Vietnam and India, which are so far not as impacted by the global trade war:

Klaus Zellmer, CEO of Škoda Auto, commented: “Škoda’s strong nine-month results prove that our strategy is working: We are growing profitably, electrifying faster, and expanding globally. Holding firm as Europe’s No. 3 car brand while doubling deliveries in India shows the power of our team, our partners, and our customer’s trust. We’re driving forward with confidence, efficiency, and the courage to shape the future of mobility.”

Superb!

What I’m Listening To While Writing TMD

My wife put on “November Rain” by Guns N’Roses to celebrate the dawning of a new month, and I remembered that she wasn’t an MTV kid and had therefore not seen the extravagant video. If there’s a better way to start this month than Stephanie Seymour taking a luxurious pull of a cigarette, I’d like to know it.

The Big Question

Decade of hybrids, PHEVs, MHEVs, BEVs? What do you got?

“I think it would sort of put the ball back in Congress’ court.
A few Republicans have expressed misgivings about the tariffs and emergency powers and voted to overturn them.
Reynolds said a decision in favor of the Trump administration would also undermine the political case to overturn the emergency declarations.
Even if a Republican-led Congress passed a measure to reclaim power over tariffs, Trump would have the power to veto it and keep that control for the executive branch.","The Supreme Court will hear oral arguments Wednesday over whether a law allows President Donald Trump to implement a worldwide tariff regime, in a case experts and lawmakers said ultimately could undermine Congress’ foundational power over taxation.

The Trump administration is set to urge the justices to find that those tariffs are within the powers that Congress gave to the presidency in an emergency economic powers law in 1977, with huge issues in the balance, including billions of dollars in federal tariff revenue and trillions of dollars in international trade.

The legal questions hinge on the wording in the law around regulating trade and declaring emergencies, how specific Congress must be when delegating large powers to the executive branch and whether Congress can turn over its constitutionally assigned role to establish tariffs.

But a larger question lurks over eroding the congressional power over the purse, at a time when Trump has pushed the boundaries of long-standing ideas on what presidents have the authority to do.

A decision in favor of the Trump administration would undermine the constitutional order on how federal funds are collected and spent, said Josh Chafetz, a Georgetown Law professor who specializes in the powers of Congress.

“It’s going to be a huge blow to Congress if Trump essentially can try to raise as much money as he wants by levying tariffs. That is creating a huge slush fund,” Chafetz said. “That is so deeply antithetical to the text of the Constitution and the struggle that birthed it.”

Chafetz said actions by the Trump administration to freeze funds, spend funds during the shutdown and raise revenue through tariffs are undermining the “three pillars” of Congress’ main power over federal spending.

“This administration has been not just chipping away but taking a sledgehammer to some of Congress’ core powers,” Chafetz said.

At the same time, a decision against the Trump administration would put pressure back on the Republican-controlled Congress to pass laws addressing a signature piece of Trump’s domestic and foreign policy, said Molly Reynolds, the interim vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution.

The country has experienced “several decades of increasing presidential power in lots of ways at the expense of congressional power,” with numerous decisions by members of Congress and the Supreme Court that effectively granted more power to the presidency, Reynolds said.

“I think it would sort of put the ball back in Congress’ court. Congress would have to decide if it wants to legislate and decide whether it wants to codify what Trump has asked for,” Reynolds said.

Legal case

This year Trump declared a swath of national emergencies under the National Emergencies Act, including problems tied to fentanyl smuggling, trade imbalances and the prosecution of former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro in his home country.

The administration then used those declarations to justify tariffs under a law called the International Emergency Economic Powers Act, or IEEPA. That includes specific tariffs against Canada, Mexico and China, the worldwide “Liberation Day” tariffs and others against countries such as Brazil.

The Trump administration has argued that Congress in IEEPA gave the president broad power to “regulate” trade in an emergency, which could include embargoing trade with another country entirely. Tariffs, the administration argued, are less extreme than that.

Earlier this year, the Court of International Trade and U.S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit both found that the tariff regime violated federal law. They agreed with the challenges from the businesses and states that the law at issue did not mention tariffs or give specific rules for how they could be put in place.

Michael McConnell, a retired judge from the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit who represents one of the challengers to Trump’s tariffs, told reporters last week that allowing a president to impose tariffs without congressional approval would make it “very tempting” for an executive to end-run the legislative process to raise revenue.

“He has no power to authorize tariffs on American citizens without the authorization of Congress,” McConnell said.

In one bipartisan brief at the Supreme Court, more than 200 House and Senate members, including Alaska Republican Sen. Lisa Murkowski, argued that Trump’s tariffs “usurped” congressional authority over tariffs and taxes.

“The Administration’s interpretation of IEEPA would effectively nullify the guardrails set forth in every statute in which Congress expressly granted the President limited tariff authority — a result Congress did not intend,” the brief said.

“IEEPA does not grant the President the power to impose tariffs on American citizens importing goods to generate leverage in trade talks,” the brief said.

The brief argued that Congress has been specific in the past when it gave the president the power to collect tariffs and mostly limited those powers to tariffs on a single product or country.

A few Republicans have expressed misgivings about the tariffs and emergency powers and voted to overturn them.

Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., who has criticized some of the Trump tariff decisions and voted to overturn the emergency declaration for Brazil last week, said he’s concerned about what the case could mean for the power of Congress.

“I worry less about what President Trump is doing now and more about what President Harris would do with that same sort of authority,” Tillis said, referring to Trump’s 2024 opponent, Kamala Harris.

Congressional action

A Supreme Court decision to uphold Trump’s tariffs could make it even harder for Congress to potentially undo those tariffs and other presidential actions, experts said.

They noted that the Supreme Court already defanged a major congressional tool to rein in the president’s emergency powers directly in a 1983 decision in an immigration case known as INS v. Chadha. The court invalidated the so-called legislative veto, which experts said extended to the same framework under the National Emergencies Act, the law Trump used to underpin the tariffs.

Congress passed the National Emergencies Act, along with IEEPA and other post-Watergate reforms, as a means of clearly defining the president’s emergency powers, Michael Thorning, associate director of governance at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said.

That 1983 decision leaves the legislative veto “essentially inoperative at the moment, until Congress acts to change it,” Thorning said.

“The authority granted to the president has not changed in scope or magnitude, but Congress’ ability to undo actions taken by the White House has changed,” Thorning said. “Congress is at a bit of a disadvantage because it essentially created an escape hatch for itself where it could vote to overturn an emergency and now can’t anymore.”

That means that instead of Congress being able to override emergency declarations on its own, they have to face a presidential veto, experts said.

That played out in the first Trump administration, when both chambers of Congress voted to override a national emergency declaration at the U.S. border with Mexico in 2019, only for Trump to veto the provision.

Sen. Tim Kaine, D-Va., a lead sponsor of Senate efforts to overturn the national emergency declarations in the current Congress, said he would continue to push for votes to override them, even if the Supreme Court determines that the tariffs are legal.

“If the court were to uphold that, they would sort of be solving that legal challenge, but again, from a policy matter, we still need to challenge emergencies that are bogus,” Kaine said.

Reynolds said a decision in favor of the Trump administration would also undermine the political case to overturn the emergency declarations.

“I expect that many Republicans in particular would point to that and say, ‘Look, the Supreme Court has said it is OK, and we are just going to go along with it,’” Reynolds said.

Tillis also said that a decision in favor of the Trump administration would “pretty much end the discussion” around overturning the emergency declarations underpinning the tariffs. It also wouldn’t bode well for broader legislation regarding the president’s emergency powers.

Even if a Republican-led Congress passed a measure to reclaim power over tariffs, Trump would have the power to veto it and keep that control for the executive branch.

“You’d have to take veto-proof congressional action to fix it if you wanted to claw back power. And that never happens,” Tillis said. “It hasn’t happened for the 80 years that we’ve conveyed too much power to the Article II branch, because we always make the mistake of living in the moment and not thinking about the long-term consequences.”

Stellantis, the Euro-American auto conglomerate behind Jeep, RAM, Dodge, and Chrysler, is injecting $13 billion into what amounts to a corporate rescue mission. Despite generating more than half of its total profits from the U.S., the company’s American operations have turned into a financial sinkhole. Formed in 2021 through the merger of Fiat Chrysler Automobiles and France’s PSA Group, Stellantis enjoyed a golden start. Each year brought record earnings, fat margins, and massive dividends for investors. Yet beneath the glossy financials, its U.S. brands were quietly bleeding market share. Consumers, once fiercely loyal to names like Jeep and Dodge, began shifting to electric rivals or newer, more refined gas-powered competitors. The $13 billion plan, confirmed by CEO Carlos Tavares in recent investor briefings, aims to overhaul everything from product design to factory operations. Stellantis will revamp aging lineups, expand electric vehicle production, and modernize its U.S. manufacturing plants to stay competitive with Ford, GM, and Tesla.

Jeep and RAM: The Once-Mighty Now Stumbling

Jeep, once the company’s global profit engine, has lost ground in the SUV race. The Wrangler and Grand Cherokee still sell, but volumes have slipped as Toyota, Hyundai, and Rivian lure buyers with fresher designs and better tech. RAM, meanwhile, has been outgunned by Ford’s F-150 and GM’s Silverado in both sales and innovation. In 2024, Stellantis announced layoffs at several U.S. plants amid slumping demand and rising labor costs tied to the United Auto Workers’ new contract. Analysts estimate that profit margins in North America, once among the best in the business, have fallen by more than 30 percent in the past two years. Tavares has been blunt about the stakes. “We are losing share in our most profitable market. That cannot continue,” he told investors earlier this year.

Betting Big on EVs but Playing Catch-Up

A large chunk of the $13 billion will go toward electrification. Stellantis plans to launch more than 25 new electric models in North America by 2030, including an all-electric Dodge Charger and a RAM 1500 REV pickup designed to compete with the Ford F-150 Lightning and Tesla Cybertruck. The company is also investing heavily in battery plants, including a $3.2 billion facility in Kokomo, Indiana, and a joint venture with Samsung SDI to secure supply chains. But Stellantis faces a steep uphill climb: its EV offerings remain limited in the U.S., where consumers are increasingly expecting long-range, high-tech electric vehicles backed by strong charging networks.

The Chrysler Question

Then there’s Chrysler, the brand that’s become an industry punchline. Once a cornerstone of American automotive identity, Chrysler now has just two models on sale: the Pacifica minivan and the aging 300 sedan. As part of its turnaround plan, Stellantis says it will reinvent Chrysler as a “tech-forward electric brand,” with the first new EV slated for 2026. Whether the nameplate can be revived remains an open question.

Tavares’s Tightrope

Carlos Tavares is known for slashing costs and squeezing efficiency out of struggling automakers. But the U.S. comeback requires more than trimming fat; it demands rebuilding trust with customers and dealers, and taking creative risks in a fiercely competitive market. He faces a delicate balance: satisfying European regulators pushing for rapid electrification while keeping American truck and SUV buyers happy. And with UAW labor costs climbing and consumer demand shifting unpredictably, Stellantis’s U.S. recovery could determine whether the company thrives or unravels over the next decade.

The Road Ahead

For Stellantis, this $13 billion gamble is a make-or-break moment. The company cannot afford another year of shrinking U.S. sales while rivals roll out stronger electric portfolios. The challenge now is proving it can evolve fast enough to win back drivers who have already moved on. If the bet pays off, Stellantis could once again become a dominant force in the American auto market. If not, the company’s most lucrative region could become its greatest liability.",https://sfl.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/auto-draft-screenshot-2025-11-03-at-10.40.55-am.png,N,,2025-11-03 13:13:49.191972

By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it.","HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) — Jacqueline Chapman is a retired school aide who relies on a $630 monthly Social Security check to get by. She was navigating the loss of her federal food aid benefits when she learned the assistance she receives for heating her Philadelphia apartment may also be at risk.

“I feel like I’m living in scary times. It’s not easy to rest when you know you have things to do with limited accounts, limited funds. There isn’t too much you can do,” said Chapman, 74.

Chapman relies on the $4.1 billion Low-Income Home Energy Assistance Program, which helps millions of low-income households pay to heat and cool their homes.

With temperatures beginning to drop in areas across the United States, some states are warning that funding for the program is being delayed because of the federal government shutdown, now in its fifth week.

The anticipated delay comes as a majority of the 5.9 million households served by the federally funded heating and cooling assistance program are grappling with the sudden postponement of benefits through the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which helps about 1 in 8 Americans buy groceries. Money is running out for other safety net programs as well and energy prices are soaring.

“The impact, even if it’s temporary, on many of the nation’s poor families is going to be profound if we don’t solve this problem,” said Mark Wolfe, executive director of the National Energy Assistance Directors Association, which represents state directors of the program. Commonly called LIHEAP, it serves all 50 states, the District of Columbia, U.S. territories and federally recognized tribes.

“These are important income supports that are all potentially heading toward a cliff at the same time,” Wolfe said. “And I can’t point to a similar time in recent history where we’ve had this.”

States are warning applicants about a funding delay

LIHEAP, created in 1981, assists families in covering utility bills or the cost of paying for fuels delivered to homes, such as home heating oil. It has received bipartisan congressional support for decades.

States manage the program. They receive an allotment of federal money each year based on a formula that largely takes into account state weather patterns, energy costs and low-income population data.

While President Donald Trump proposed zero funding for the program in his budget, it was anticipated that Congress would fund LIHEAP for the budget year that began Oct. 1. But since Congress has not yet passed a full 2026 spending bill, states have not gotten their new allocations yet.

Some states, including Kansas, Pennsylvania, New York and Minnesota, have announced their LIHEAP programs are being delayed by the government shutdown.

In Pennsylvania, Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s administration said it cannot front the $200 million-plus in federal LIHEAP aid it had expected to help pay heating bills for some 300,000 low-income households. It is predicting payments will not go out until at least December, instead of November, as is customary.

Minnesota’s energy assistance program is processing applications but the state’s Department of Commerce said federal LIHEAP dollars will likely be delayed by a month. The agency does not plan to pay recipients’ heating bills until the shutdown ends.

“As temperatures begin to drop, this delay could have serious impacts,” the agency said. The program services 120,000 households, both homeowners and renters, that include many older adults, young children and people with disabilities.

Connecticut has enough money to set aside to pay heating bills through at least the end of November or December, according to the group that helps administer LIHEAP. But the program faces uncertainty if the shutdown persists. Connecticut lawmakers are considering covering the cost temporarily with state budget reserves.

“The situation will get much more perilous for folks who do need those resources as we move later into the heating season,” said Rhonda Evans, executive director of the Connecticut Association for Community Action. More than 100,000 households were served last year.

A spokesperson for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees the assistance program, blamed the federal shutdown and the delay in LIHEAP payments on congressional Democrats and said the Trump administration is committed to reopening the government.

“Once the government reopens, ACF will work swiftly to administer annual awards,” the spokesperson said, referring to the Administration for Children and Families, an agency within HHS. The spokesperson did not directly answer whether the timing could be affected by the administration’s earlier decision to fire workers who run the LIHEAP program.

Wolfe, from the group that represents state program directors, predicts there could be delays into January. He noted there are questions over who will approve states’ program plans and how the money will be released when it becomes available.

“Once you’ve fired the staff, things just slow down,” he said.

Low-income families face mounting obstacles

Chapman, the retired school aide, may be eligible for a program through her gas utility to prevent being shut off this winter. But the roughly 9% of LIHEAP recipients who rely on deliverable fuels such as heating oil, kerosene, propane and wood pellets, typically do not have such protections.

Electric and natural gas companies are usually regulated by the state and can be told not to shut people off while the state waits to receive its share of the LIHEAP money, Wolfe said. But it is different when it involves a small oil or propane company, fuels more common in the Northeast.

“If you’re a heating oil dealer, we can’t tell that dealer, ‘Look, continue to provide heating oil to your low-income customers on the possibility you’ll get your money back,’” Wolfe said.

Mark Bain, 67, who lives in Bloomfield, Connecticut, with his son, a student at the University of Connecticut, started receiving financial assistance for his home heating oil needs three years ago.

“I remember the first winter before I knew about this program. I was desperate. I was on fumes,” said Bains, who is retired and relies on income from Social Security and a small annuity. “I was calling around to my social services people to find out what I could do.”

He has been approved this year for $500 in assistance but he has a half tank of oil left and cannot call for more until it is nearly empty. By that point, he is hoping there will be enough federal money left to fill it. He typically needs three deliveries to get through a winter.

Bains said he can “get by” if he does not receive the help this year.

“I would turn the heat down to like 62 (degrees) and throw on another blanket, you know, just to get through,” he said.

One bill, House Bill 3758 (HB3758), would have set a 15GW target and was first read into the record in March.
E2, a nationwide collection of businesses and investors advocating for policies benefitting the economy and environment, welcomed the “major milestone in clean energy”.
E2 recently published a report which highlighted Illinois’ position as a clean energy leader among states in the US Midwest.
“In light of federal rollbacks of clean energy tax credits and environmental protections, it is more important than ever that Illinois remains steadfast in its commitment to creating a clean energy economy,” E2 state advocacy director Micaela Preskill said.","Alongside this are measures to solidify funding for solar PV and wind, give utilities and state agencies new energy planning tools, expand energy efficiency programmes and introduce new programmes and incentives for consumer-sided distributed energy resources (DERs) such as rooftop solar and home battery storage.

Pritzker publicly backed the bill previously and last week after its passing that Illinois is responding to rate hikes from utility companies and actions from the Trump Administration that the governor said are “blocking the ability to bring lower-cost energy options online.”

A frequent media sparring partner for the US president, Pritzker said the passing of the CRGA is “an important step that will help lower utility bills and make our electrical grid stronger.”

“This legislation takes two routes toward affordability,” Pritzker said.

“First, it will accelerate clean energy projects with new grid-scale batteries and other clean energy technology to increase the available electricity supply. Second, it will require utility companies to help their consumers to lower their utility bills and access energy-efficient resources. This bill will build upon the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act, positioning Illinois to keep growing our clean energy economy and creating good-paying jobs in communities across the state.”

The bill’s passing is the result of ongoing efforts by Illinois politicians to introduce a coherent energy storage strategy that includes a target. One bill, House Bill 3758 (HB3758), would have set a 15GW target and was first read into the record in March.

‘Solid foundation to address rising electricity demand and power price volatility’

Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) CEO Abigail Ross Hopper​ said the Act “is a blueprint for how to meet growing electricity demand while keeping costs down and building a stronger, more resilient grid.”

“By investing in solar, storage, and a forward-looking virtual power plant programme, this bill will create good jobs and empower Illinois families and businesses,” Ross Hopper, who recently announced she is stepping down from leading SEIA after almost nine years, said.

E2, a nationwide collection of businesses and investors advocating for policies benefitting the economy and environment, welcomed the “major milestone in clean energy”. E2 recently published a report which highlighted Illinois’ position as a clean energy leader among states in the US Midwest.

“In light of federal rollbacks of clean energy tax credits and environmental protections, it is more important than ever that Illinois remains steadfast in its commitment to creating a clean energy economy,” E2 state advocacy director Micaela Preskill said.

The Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) noted that the legislation comes amid not just Trump’s attacks on clean energy but also spikes in electricity bills that are caused in part by increased demand from data centres.

A UCS factsheet about the CRGA published earlier in the year pointed out that a supply crunch and unprecedented increase in electricity demand from data centres was leading to jumps in electricity costs for customers of Ameren and ComEdison, two of the state’s main utilities.

UCS applauded the passing of earlier climate legislation—the Climate and Equitable Jobs Act (CEJA)—that put in place a 2050 net zero target for Illinois, but said obstacles such as the lengthy wait for interconnection in the PJM regional transmission organisation (RTO) were holding back its implementation, arguing that CRGA builds upon the CEJA’s goals and sets out a path toward achieving them.

“The legislation bolsters tools and programs the state needs to achieve its clean energy goals and rebukes recent federal efforts to undermine abundant, cost-effective wind and solar power,” Midwest policy director at the UCS Climate and Energy Program, James Gignac, said.

“Lawmakers have built a solid foundation to address rising electricity demand and power price volatility fostered by data centres. Today, policymakers chose to make smart, responsible investments and safeguard a clean energy future while protecting Illinoisans from prospective cost spikes, and that’s something to celebrate.”

‘Big Tech, data centres must join the solution’

Other groups applauding the state legislature’s actions and endorsing the bill included the Illinois Citizens Utility Board (CUB), the Clean Grid Alliance and the Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition.

CUB executive director Sarah Moskowitz said escalating energy bills in Illinois “require solutions at the state, regional, and federal levels, so passing the CRGA Act is a significant and urgently needed step to protect consumers from future electricity market volatility.”

Jeff Danielson, VP of advocacy at the Clean Grid Alliance said the bill invests “in proven solutions that promote the stability and reliability of our grid while also lowering costs for homeowners and businesses.”

Illinois Clean Jobs Coalition was filled with similar praise, but added that the victory the bill’s passing represents “must be followed by legislative action in the spring 2026 session to ensure that Big Tech and data centres, the primary driver of rising utility bills, joins the solution instead of continuing to be the problem.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/JB-Pritzker_wikimedia-gage-skidmore.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:12.073902

On October 8, Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey joined Energy Policy Institute participants to share her insights on the path being charted in Massachusetts to ensure reliable and affordable energy. Governor Healey emphasized her all-of-the-above strategy to bring more energy into Massachusetts and meet rising demand. Following Governor Healey’s remarks, attendees heard from Massachusetts Secretary of the Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs Rebecca Tepper. Secretary Tepper elaborated further on the strategies that Massachusetts is employing to make energy more affordable to consumers and increase energy production.

Highlights From the Energy Policy Institute

Keynote Remarks by FERC Commissioner Judy W. Chang

The program launched with expert remarks from Federal Energy Regulatory Commissioner (FERC) Judy W. Chang. Commissioner Chang emphasized the importance of clear, informed state engagement in shaping energy markets and transmission policy. The Commissioner also shared her appreciation for state perspectives, noting that the more context FERC has about state interests and motivations, the better positioned the commission is to weigh them alongside legal precedent and broader regulatory considerations. Her remarks demonstrated a collaborative perspective on how federal and state entities can work together in energy governance.

State of the Market: 2025 Energy Trends

The U.S. is facing its highest power demand growth since the 1940s-1950s, driven in part by a large surge in data center development. To set the stage on how the U.S. is approaching this demand growth, Kate Hardin, Executive Director of Energy, Resources, and Industrials Research at Deloitte, gave a presentation on the major energy, economic, market and technology trends. One trend includes the increase in data center driven natural gas demand through 2030 which could range from 3 to 12 billion cubic feet per day, driven by a growing number of planned gas power plants. Nuclear energy is also re-emerging as a longer-term solution and could address at least 10% of the increased electricity demand being seen.

A convergence of energy demand, fuels, and technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) for energy, grid-enhancing technologies (GETs), and automation are reshaping the power sector. The uncertainty in projected load growth, due to cloud and AI demand, is raising risks and costs, making demand management and load flexibility important to future planning.

Energy as an Economic Driver for AI, Manufacturing, and More

As artificial intelligence (AI), advanced manufacturing and data-driven technologies surge, so does the demand for reliable, scalable energy infrastructure. This panel of experts, which included both state and industry perspectives, dove into how states and territories can position energy as a driver for economic development, meeting the rising load from data centers and AI while fostering industrial growth. Attendees heard from Mark Silberg, Energy Policy Advisor with the Office of Colorado Governor Jared Polis; Mike Fradette, Principle of Energy Strategy at Amazon Web Services; and Jennie Nevin, Associate Partner of Public Sector, Energy, and Infrastructure Practices at McKinsey. The speakers underscored the importance of treating energy as a central pillar of economic competitiveness in an AI-driven future. Governors can foster early coordination between energy planning and economic development to inform investments and ensure economies maintain robust growth while mitigating impacts to grid reliability and rates.

Nuclear Energy: State Actions and Initiatives

As states explore how to meet significant load growth, new nuclear energy is emerging as a potential solution. This year, NGA hosted a slate of nuclear in-state retreats for seven state teams aimed to advance Governors’ nuclear energy policy. Attendees heard from Kurt Schaefer, Director of the Missouri Department of Natural Resources; Jon Ford, Executive Director of the Indiana Office of Energy Development; Stephen Swiber, Deputy Secretary of the Louisiana Department of Energy and Natural Resources; and Jeff Semancik, Division Director of the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, on behalf of the New England cohort team. The four speakers shared the outcomes of their retreats, lessons learned, and where their state is headed now regarding nuclear energy. Each state has a different focus for their project with NGA, including how to align the economic development and energy sector to advance nuclear projects, how to incentivize financing of large nuclear projects, how to communicate the advantages of nuclear and what the role is for state government in bolstering the nuclear energy sector. This session provided insight to attendees on how other states are exploring and talking about the use of new nuclear energy.

State Energy Security Briefing

As threats to the security of the energy system are multiplying and growing more sophisticated, Governors and their staff play a critical role in securing the system through both their own actions and through partnerships with private sector operators. To highlight the emerging energy security threats to systems, Brian Harrell, VP and Chief Security Officer of Avangrid, and Kimberly Denbow, Vice President of Security and Operations at the American Gas Association (AGA) provided an unclassified threat briefing to attendees. This briefing included detailed discussions of cyber and physical incidents that are impacting the energy sector.

State Leadership to Meet Emerging Energy Security Threats

Building off the energy security threat briefing, Paul Holloway, Senior Energy Security and Resilience Lead at the Massachusetts Department of Energy Resources, and Travis Kellerman, Senior Climate Policy Advisor with the Office of New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham, explored state policies and actions to address two emerging threats: cybersecurity and wildfires.

Holloway emphasized that as the grid becomes more automated and interconnected, it also becomes more vulnerable cyberattacks – particularly targeting generation, transmission, and distribution assets. Massachusetts has developed a robust cybersecurity resilience network, including regular coordination with the public utilities commission (PUC), industry partners and the state’s fusion center for secure information sharing. Holloway also emphasized the lessons learned from exercises like GridEx-VIII and the development of the State Energy Security Plan (SESP), which highlighted the importance of knowing who to contact and how to respond in a crisis.

Kellerman highlighted how New Mexico views wildfires as a systemic energy risk and is taking proactive steps through legislation like the Wildfire Prepared Act. This legislation includes funding for home hardening, protecting critical infrastructure and collaborating with tribal nations using traditional ecological knowledge. He stressed the importance of prevention over response, noting innovative mitigation strategies like cloud seeding and maintaining irrigation networks. A key message was shared that investment in wildfire mitigation not only reduces systemic risk but also creates long-term economic and social benefits.

Meeting Growth Through Demand-Side and Behind-the-Meter Resources

Demand-side and behind-the-meter resources are increasingly becoming strategic assets within modern energy systems. To discuss this development, attendees heard from a panel of experts including Jenifer French, Chair of the Ohio Public Utilities Commission; Rachel Wilson, Southeast Energy Market Lead at Google; Michael Wheeler, Vice President of Government Affairs and Intersect Power; and Jeannie Salo, Chief Public Policy Officer at Schneider Electric.

As electricity load increases, states are looking for near-term solutions to meet this growth while they continue exploring more systematic investments in generation and transmission. These speakers discussed two potential near-term solutions for data centers and manufacturers: demand response to enable peak shaving and power generation co-located with new large loads. While automation and smart infrastructure can enable flexible load and resilience, scaling these capabilities will require significant policy support and investment. The speakers discussed examples of public-private collaboration to meet the dual challenge of rising electricity demand and the race for AI-driven infrastructure.

Investments in Energy Infrastructure in a Dynamic Power Market

As the energy landscape continues to evolve, state leaders are facing mounting pressure to ensure reliable and affordable power. Rapid shifts in technology, regulatory frameworks, market structures and consumer demand are fundamentally reshaping the economics of electricity generation. To contextualize how states and territories can enable strategic investments, participants heard from Dan Pugliese, Investment Director at Meridiam, and Will Sauer, Vice President of Federal Regulatory Affairs at Exelon.

Dan Pugliese highlighted Meridiam’s global investment approach – building, owning and operating infrastructure – with a focus on community benefit and long-term value. Will Sauer, representing the largest utility in the U.S. by customer count, emphasized the critical need of regulatory frameworks that ensure both supply reliability and cost effectiveness. Both speakers stressed that even in the absence of recent load growth, significant infrastructure gaps exist. Current conditions have created opportunities for private-public partnerships, and clear, consistent state policies, supportive legislation for P3s and internal advocates within government to champion major projects are crucial.

Regional Gubernatorial Collaboration for Energy Planning

In a session on regional gubernatorial collaboration for energy planning, state leaders from Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, and Virginia emphasized the growing importance of cross-state collaboration to address regional energy challenges and transmission needs. Weezie Naura, Deputy Secretary for Federal and Regional Energy Affairs at the MA Executive Office of Energy and Environmental Affairs, and Daniel Phelan, Regional Policy Director at the New Hampshire Department of Energy, discussed the partnership convened through the New England States Committee on Electricity (NESCOE).

Through NESCOE, the states have achieved significant progress, such as a multi-state request for proposals to unlock 1,200 MW of onshore wind in northern Maine. Jacob Finkel, Deputy Secretary of Policy with the Office of Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro, and Glenn Davis, Director of the Virginia Department of Energy, shared their experiences as states within the PJM Interconnection (PJM) region. They emphasized the point that Governors’ office engagement is crucial to improving PJM processes and structures, citing outdated governance structures as a challenge. A key takeaway from this session was that sustained regional collaboration, even when state policies do not necessarily align, is crucial to addressing shared energy needs.

Ford Motor , Kia and Hyundai Motor reported massive declines in EV sales as many buyers pulled ahead purchases before the credits ended under changes by the Trump administration.

Ford, which ranked third in U.S. EV sales through the third quarter, reported a 25% drop in its year-over-year all-electric October sales. That included a 12% decline for its Mustang Mach-E crossover and a 17% fall for the F-150 Lightning.

Kia and Hyundai reported their top EV models dropped between 52% and 71% from a year earlier. The declines are notably greater when looking month to month, as September marked the end of a record quarter for EV sales in the U.S. ahead of the credits ending.

Some models, such as Hyundai's Ioniq 5 and Ioniq 9 EVs, fell by 80% and 71% from September to October, respectively, according to its reported sales. It was a similar story for comparable vehicles at Kia, which is owned by Hyundai Motor but largely operates separately in the U.S.

""We saw strong EV demand leading up to the expiration of federal tax credits, and while that shift has temporarily disrupted the market, we're confident it will reset,"" Hyundai Motor North America CEO Randy Parker said in a release.

Meanwhile, sales of hybrid vehicles for carmakers are expected to continue to rise. Sales of such models for each of the automakers were bright spots in October, the companies said.

Only a limited number of automakers report monthly sales, rather than quarterly, but the results are an early indication of the expected fall in EV sales following the end of the federal incentives.

""With the credit now off the table, the market appears to be settling into a more natural rhythm,"" Jessica Caldwell, head of insights for CarMax's Edmunds, said in a Monday blog. ""October marks the start of a reset period: one defined less by incentive-driven urgency and more by buyers motivated by genuine interest in EV ownership.""

Ahead of the EV incentives ending, several automotive executives such as Parker and Ford CEO Jim Farley predicted a massive drop off in EV sales.

Farley late last month said he ""wouldn't be surprised"" if sales of EVs fell from a market share of around 5% after the end of the incentives from a level of 10% to 12% in September.

“Completing the pipeline installation is a major step forward in delivering safe, reliable drinking water to Dimock residents,” said Tony Nokovich, vice president of engineering at Pennsylvania American Water. “With this phase complete, we’re now ready to begin construction of the advanced treatment facility.”

Installation of new water service lines to connect homes to the newly installed pipeline is planned for spring 2026, with customer connections anticipated in the summer. As part of this process, all existing plumbing will be disconnected from individual wells to prevent cross-contamination.

Construction of a new groundwater treatment facility is scheduled to begin this week. The facility will feature a robust four-stage treatment process, resulting in finished water that meets U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and Pennsylvania Department of Environmental Protection safe drinking water standards. The treatment facility is expected to be operational by summer 2026, with all construction activities anticipated to be completed by fall.

This project stems from a 2022 agreement negotiated between the Office of then-Attorney General Josh Shapiro and Coterra Energy, through which Pennsylvania American Water was selected to design, permit and construct a new public water system for Dimock. The system is designed to provide residents with reliable, clean and safe drinking water, who have long relied on private wells.

Importantly, the cost of the new water system is being fully underwritten by Coterra Energy, which helps provide a sustainable solution to the area's long-standing water quality concerns while ensuring that financial responsibility does not fall on the affected community or existing Pennsylvania American Water customers.

According to the study, Pathways to 2035: Expanding Non-Federal Climate Leadership in the United States, which was conducted alongside the Center for Global Sustainability at the University of Maryland, non-federal efforts could lead to a 56% reduction in greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, compared to 2005 levels, if ambitious measures are pursued at state and local level.

‘Continuing to push forward’

“If our current federal government refuses to track and submit US progress toward meeting our climate goals, America Is All In will,” commented Gina McCarthy, America Is All In managing co-chair, and a former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).

“Governors, mayors, the private sector, and more continue to push forward, driving our transition to clean energy. There are so many opportunities at the state and local levels to grow jobs and protect our health and well-being, and we’re going to deliver this brighter future for our kids.”

Recent changes to federal legislation, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, have reduced clean energy investment and production capacity in the US, as well as repealing regulations linked to transport and energy emissions.

Despite these rollbacks, the report suggests that local leadership, combined with the prospect of renewed federal engagement after 2028 – i.e. once Trump leaves office – can keep the US on track to slash emissions by the mid part of the next decade.

“As international partners look to US cities, states, and businesses to fill the gap created by current US federal policy rollbacks, this study underscores the importance of non-federal actions in driving US climate ambition in the near term,” added Nate Hultman, director at the Center for Global Sustainability. “A critical component of this report is the need to identify and implement opportunities to raise climate ambition within jurisdictions that currently have moderate or low ambition in order to have the greatest impact on overall US emissions reductions.

“Our findings show that innovative local policies and market-driven clean technology investments can keep the US on a path toward significant emissions reductions, even in challenging times.”

From the US Conference of Catholic Bishops:

As world leaders head to COP30 [in Brazil] to advance climate action, the US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is proposing to effectively end its ability to track US climate warming emissions, data needed to reduce climate impacts, meet our international climate commitments and protect children’s health and futures.

The Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program (GHGRP), established in 2009, requires industries to report large GHG emissions sources such as oil and gas facilities. The EPA proposal would remove reporting obligations on most sources or suspend them until 2034. This, combined with the EPA’s proposed rollback of the “endangerment finding” that gives EPA authority to regulate greenhouse gases, will make it difficult for the US to reduce GHG emissions and climate impacts.

Extreme weather disasters, exacerbated by climate change, fall hardest on the poor and communities on the margins in the United States and around the world with the least resources to respond. As Pope Leo XIV said, “When the Earth suffers, the poor suffer even more.”

The GHGRP data helps local governments, companies, and communities to keep track of emissions, promote accountability, and create innovative and resilient solutions to sustain life on our common home.

Pope Leo said at the October Raising Hope global gathering, “Everyone in society must put pressure on governments to develop and implement more rigorous regulations, procedures and controls. Citizens need to take an active role in political decision-making at national, regional and local levels. Only then will it be possible to mitigate the damage done to the environment.”

“Our first priority is funding research by early-stage companies who are ready for professional funding,” says Stephen Loy, FUEL’s director of technology commercialization.
“There are also two energy companies I’m looking at investing in,” Ellison says.
“We work together to make these companies succeed.” Most of the successful energy industry startups in Louisiana have gone through similar accelerator programs, where they’re often connected with mentors and investors.
Increasingly, they’re approached by energy companies needing solutions to specific problems.","Academics and private industry invest millions of dollars each year in energy research, but only a handful of ideas advance from theory to application.

Nevertheless, investors say there’s usually a secret sauce behind those who do succeed.

Bill Ellison, CEO of Baton Rouge-based Innovation Catalyst Inc., a nonprofit venture development organization, says marketable research often provides a scalable and affordable solution to an industry-wide “real world” problem.

“The innovation originates from someone who is an expert, has the necessary domain expertise and is able to pair their solution with a really big problem,” he says. “Better yet, it solves a problem for a huge market, and they already have a potential customer.”

Ellison accelerates the growth of early-stage businesses into venture-ready companies by providing capital, connections and coaching. In recent months, he has collaborated frequently with researchers funded by grants through the FUEL, or Future Use of Energy in Louisiana, initiative.

Supported by a National Science Foundation grant, FUEL is a partnership between LSU and more than 50 universities, technical colleges, state agencies and private industry partners.

FUEL and other accelerator programs serve a critical role, as they connect fledgling startups with mentors and investors.

“Our first priority is funding research by early-stage companies who are ready for professional funding,” says Stephen Loy, FUEL’s director of technology commercialization. “They’re at a point where they need a little bit more ‘oomph’ to get over that hump so that they can create a proof-of-concept and bring this to professional funders.”

FUEL funded five companies in its first year, with another five expected this fall.

Initially, we issued a call for applications and received about 80,” Loy says. “That blew me away. Until then, we weren’t sure of the landscape for startups and energy.”

In his role, Loy works with the selected companies to ensure they’re getting the resources they need and that they’re in a position to receive investor funding. Many times, the passion and enthusiasm of the researcher are significant factors in determining whether Ellison chooses to invest.

“You want to invest in the jockey, not the horse,” he says. “It starts with the team. If you don’t have someone who you think is going to be a rock star, who has integrity and is going to work hard, pretty much the evaluation stops there.”

Ellison is the sole investor in Codegig, one of the initial FUEL grant recipients. Codegig designs and deploys computer systems to help clients optimize workflow and make better decisions. “There are also two energy companies I’m looking at investing in,” Ellison says. “We work together to make these companies succeed.”

Most of the successful energy industry startups in Louisiana have gone through similar accelerator programs, where they’re often connected with mentors and investors. Ellison is also CEO of the Red Stick Angel Network, a group of “angel” investors who identify, vet, fund and grow companies.

“There are a lot of individuals who look for deals themselves and they’re harder to find,” he says. “I think they’re missing out on a lot of good deals by not joining angel groups because these groups see a lot of deals. We want to see some traction and we’re throwing fuel on the fire.”

Shell invests in FUEL-funded companies through its GameChanger program. Led by program manager Veronica Simmonds, GameChanger works with startups and businesses on unproven early-stage ideas that have the potential to impact the future of energy.

Shell asserts that its technological capacity, customer mindset, operational experience and market knowledge place it at the forefront of innovative and collaborative approaches to help build a sustainable energy future.

The program has been actively assisting Louisiana companies for years. In May, New Orleans-based The Idea Village partnered with Shell to launch “Coastal Innovation Challenge 2025,” an initiative designed to support innovative, early-stage startups tackling coastal climate challenges.

The program offers up to $150,000 in non-dilutive funding from Shell GameChanger, along with mentorship, technical support and accelerator programming led by The Idea Village.

To date, Shell GameChanger has supported more than 150 breakthrough ideas globally, transforming unproven concepts into scalable technologies across energy, sustainability and digital transformation.

The collaboration with The Idea Village brings the program’s global vision to the Gulf South’s most pressing environmental issues.

Evaluating the value of a concept

Determining which ideas have the ability to take root in the “real world” is a tricky—but necessary—proposition. “FUEL’s not in the business of doing research for research’s sake,” Loy says.

“We’re in the business of funding research so that we can commercialize it on the other end.”

FUEL uses a complex rubric for evaluating its applications, and depends heavily upon its Technology Commercialization Subcommittee, comprised of a diverse mix of professional funders, business leaders, entrepreneurial support organizations and university academics.

“Everyone reviews each application and issues a score,” he adds. “I could evaluate something from a business standpoint, but I’m not a chemist. I need someone to tell me a little bit about what’s behind the science of it, so we need people to tell us.”

As they’re going through the process, committee members examine the science and practicality of the investment, Loy says, “as well as how implementable it is and how it benefits the industry at large. “We’re also looking at the scalability of it—the research might be cute in a lab, but how can you scale that to meet the needs of the energy industry?”

For applicants who make the cut, FUEL doles out grants in four allotments. The payments are treated as investments, whereby FUEL requires frequent updates and quarterly reports on their performance.

“Whether you’re talking about an energy company or a food product company, it really comes down to the investor and the entrepreneur,” Loy says. “Can people get behind this person? Because at the end of the day, you’re putting your money into this.

“The science and the product are important, but being able to move the product forward, both from a marketing and a funding angle, is a whole different side of it.”

The company’s strategic plan and profitability are equally important. “For a startup with a $1 million to $2 million valuation, we hope that in a year or so that valuation will be $10 million and then move up to $20 million,” he adds. “That’s the metric that we have in the back of our brain when we’re looking at these companies.”

FUEL’s six core pillars encompass everything from water to carbon sequestration, “but our north star is the ‘waste to wealth’ concept,” Loy says. In that vein, they seek to develop new industries from local waste streams, such as biomass from agriculture, which can be converted into renewable fuels.

Louisiana Green Fuels, a company partnered with FUEL, converts sustainable forestry waste into renewable transportation fuel, while other initiatives explore using sugarcane by-products for valuable products.

UNO entrepreneurs take to ‘The Beach’

Shafin Kahn, vice president of innovation and technology commercialization at the University of New Orleans, says the university’s 30-acre research and technology park, “The Beach,” has taken on an energy focus of its own in recent months.

The Beach fosters collaborations between academia, industry and entrepreneurial endeavors, as well as provides office and lab space for various technology-focused companies.

Increasingly, they’re approached by energy companies needing solutions to specific problems. Case in point—Gulf Wind Technology in Avondale asked for help in designing wind turbine blades.

“We connected Gulf Wind to one of our mechanical engineering faculty, and that collaboration continues today,” Kahn says.

A UNO electrical engineering professor is also assisting a local energy provider with modeling the impacts of hurricanes on the power grid, utilizing intermittent energy sources such as wind and solar to improve resilience.

“They’re seeking to determine what impacts that would have in terms of the stability and resilience of the grid,” Kahn says. “How do we get to the point where we can very quickly get back online after a storm or reduce the number of outages?”

Additionally, the university operates a large wave tank that researchers use to test how certain structures react to waves and other conditions in the ocean. The data is then used to design new ship hulls, oil structures and floating wind structures.

More recently, the university has taken a more active role in coordinating the commercialization of its research, a responsibility given to Kahn’s office. UNO faculty can help create marketing and business plans for the companies, and an innovation management class provides additional support.

“We’re basically taking over the patent management and folding that into our other entrepreneurial activities, such as StartUp UNO,” Kahn says, referring to a business pitch competition for undergraduate and graduate students.

“In turn, we’re helping turn ideas into business plans and creating an ecosystem for new technology development out of the university.”",https://www.1012industryreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Bill-Ellison-scaled.jpg.webp,N,,2025-11-03 15:20:59.892094

MCCALLA, Ala.—Mary Rosenboom is fed up.

Like 1.5 million other Alabamians, Rosenboom is forced to pay ever-increasing electricity prices set by Alabama Power and approved by the state’s Public Service Commission. Each month, Rosenboom forks over hundreds of dollars to the utility—and a massive hyperscale data center proposed near her home, she fears, will make the situation even worse.

Her electricity costs are already a huge financial burden. Rosenboom, who works as a sales professional, said she chooses not to run her air conditioner during much of the day to prevent an untenable power bill. Even that isn’t enough. Often, Rosenboom said she must turn to high-interest credit cards to keep the lights on.

“I’m robbing Peter to pay Paul,” she told Inside Climate News. “It makes me sick.”

Rosenboom’s plight isn’t unique.

Inside Climate News examined the 2024 federal filings of 100 of the largest electric utilities in the country.

None reported higher total residential electric bills, on average, than Alabama Power.

Because Alabama is one of the poorest states in the nation, that hits especially hard. Electricity customers here are among the most financially burdened in the nation, the U.S. Department of Energy found. And an analysis by think tank RMI showed that among households with extremely low incomes, Alabamians pay nearly a quarter of their earnings for electricity—the highest percentage in the country.

So why are power bills so high?

Experts point to lax regulation by the Alabama Public Service Commission, which is charged with regulating Alabama Power and overseeing any large spending or rate increases proposed by the utility.

Robert Blanton, chair of the Department of Political Science and Public Administration at the University of Alabama at Birmingham, has been digging into the mechanisms that allow Alabama Power to earn record profits in such an impoverished state.

Ultimately, he said, there’s strong evidence that Alabama Power has effectively “captured” its regulator, the PSC. Academics use the concept of regulatory capture to describe a situation in which regulators are more beholden to the entities they are charged with regulating than the public they represent.

The commission conducts much of its regulation of Alabama Power behind closed doors, with little to no access for the public or outside interest groups. It has consistently granted Alabama Power unusually high profit margins. The company’s return on equity was 11 percent in 2023, according to a utility analysis by financial firm S&P Global.

That’s down slightly from the company’s historical average of around 13 percent, but still among the highest of any utility in the country. Nationwide, the average rate of return approved for electric utilities in 2024 rate cases was 9.74 percent, according to S&P.

“I don’t think there’s a single utility in the country that would be upset with an 11 percent earned ROE,” said Kent Chandler, former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, now a senior fellow in energy and environmental policy for the R Street Institute. “I mean, that’s like double what I know some utilities are actually earning.”

Meanwhile, Alabama Power and its parent, Southern Co., have boasted about their record profits. “Every quarter for 78 consecutive years, Southern Company has paid a dividend to its shareholders that is equal to or greater than the previous quarter,” the company said in a July press release.

In a statement, representatives for Alabama Power said the company’s rates were fair and its reliability was among the best in the nation. The company pointed to high per capita electricity usage in the state, the seventh-highest in the country, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, and the third-highest residential usage. The company said that its residential rate, not the total bill, is a more appropriate way to evaluate the company’s affordability.

“On those price-based measures—paired with our industry-leading reliability—Alabama Power’s residential service is fairly priced under PSC oversight,” the company said.

Alabama Power’s average residential rate last year was 16.77 cents per kilowatt-hour, higher than the national average of 16.48 cents and 35th highest out of 100 utilities examined by Inside Climate News.

But the national average includes places like Hawaii, Connecticut and Southern California, which are all among the top 10 states for median household income. Shipping fuel oil to Hawaii and wildfire prevention in California are also huge costs that don’t apply in Alabama.

Alabama Power’s combination of above-average rates with top-five usage yielded the highest total residential bills in the nation last year. Other states with similar or greater usage feature lower rates. One reason Alabama’s usage is so high: nearly 70 percent of Alabamians use electric heat, as opposed to natural gas, thanks in part to incentives offered by Alabama Power.

Louisiana, which has the highest per capita residential electricity use in the nation, has electric rates that averaged 11.64 cents/kWh in 2024, about 30 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rate. The average Alabama Power residential customer used 1,129 kWh of electricity per month last year, at a cost of about $189. A customer using the same amount of electricity in Louisiana would have paid $58 less every month. Those figures do not include state or local taxes, so the actual bills are even higher.

Average residential rates in the states bordering Alabama—Mississippi, Tennessee, Georgia and Florida—are 15 to 25 percent lower than Alabama Power’s rates.

Alabama Power’s rates are also well above those of other providers in the state—46 percent higher than the average rate last year charged by Huntsville Utilities, which serves almost 200,000 residential customers in north Alabama.

The R Street Institute, the think tank where Chandler now works, gave Alabama an “F” in its ranking of electricity competition—how much choice consumers have about where their power comes from. No other state received such a bad grade.

The group only considered investor-owned utility companies in its rankings, and Alabama Power is the only such company in Alabama.

Alabama Power also charges about 16 percent more than Mississippi Power and about 8 percent more than Georgia Power, the other two utilities owned by its parent company, Southern Co.

The difference, at least in part, is that Alabama Power’s rates are driven up by the company’s ever-increasing profits.

The company reported a $1.4 billion profit in 2024, almost double the $712 million it earned in 2013, the year the PSC changed its formula for measuring Alabama Power’s profits. The company’s book value—its assets minus debt—more than doubled over that span, going from $5.5 billion to $13 billion.

Alabama Power said the increase in equity is driven by investments made to improve the system. “Growth in book equity primarily mirrors system investment—storm hardening, cyber and physical security, as well as transmission and distribution upgrades, along with other investments driven by reliability and compliance,” the company said.

Almost No Public Participation

In virtually all states with regulated utilities, rate cases force the company to justify its proposed increases in a public forum, providing sworn, expert testimony and allowing outside groups to challenge the projections and assertions made by the power company. Not in Alabama.

The PSC hasn’t conducted a formal rate case related to Alabama Power since 1982, more than four decades ago.

“There are no courtroom-style hearings on Alabama Power’s long-term energy planning or how those plans impact customers’ bills,” said Christina Tidwell, a senior attorney in the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Alabama office. “These types of proceedings are routine in other states. When the public can participate, we believe they’re better informed about how this process impacts their lives.”

Chandler, the former chairman of the Kentucky Public Service Commission, said that while rate cases can be tedious, they are valuable to the public.

“One of the benefits of having rate cases is that you get a holistic look at a utility’s revenues and a utility’s costs,” Chandler said. “In my experience in Kentucky, consumers benefit from having periodic reviews by an objective regulator.”

And since regulated utilities earn profits on all their approved spending, the more they spend, the more they earn, he said.

“They have an incentive to over-invest,” Chandler said. “And if you never check things after the fact, then you’re just writing them a blank check.”

Wall Street has taken notice. A 2024 report by S&P Global put Alabama in a tier of its own atop the rankings in its State Regulatory Evaluations, examining the likelihood that state regulators might decrease or limit a utility’s profits. The report found no other state where a utility’s profits were as safe as in Alabama.

The last PSC commissioner to advocate for formal rate hearings for Alabama Power—Terry Dunn in 2013—was promptly voted out of office in the next election. Dunn, a self-described conservative Republican, faced a curious and largely anonymous campaign linking him to environmental groups.

Twinkle Andress Cavanaugh, the former PSC president, described Dunn’s efforts to initiate formal reviews of Alabama Power as a “full frontal assault” by “extremist groups” and their “fancy San Francisco environmental lawyers.”

Dunn, who died last year, called the efforts “a smear campaign orchestrated against a Republican by fellow Republicans,” in a letter to the state party in 2013.

Later that year, about 10 people staged what many believe to be a faked environmental protest on the front steps of the PSC building. The protesters, wearing blue surgical masks and other items obscuring their identities, bore signs with slogans such as “Environmentalists [heart] Dunn,” and “Save the Warrior,” likely a reference to the Black Warrior River, which runs through Tuscaloosa. Representatives of environmental groups who were there to attend a meeting said they had no idea who the people were.

Ultimately, Dunn was defeated in the 2014 Republican primary by Chris “Chip” Beeker Jr., a cattle and catfish farm operator and former county commissioner in rural Greene County—a county whose largest employer was an Alabama Power plant. Beeker had help. Former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour, whose lobbying firm represented Alabama Power’s parent company, organized a fundraiser for Beeker in 2013.

Beeker stepped down from the commission partway through his term last year, citing health issues. His son, Chris Beeker III, filled his seat after being appointed by Gov. Kay Ivey.

The PSC’s new president, Cynthia Lee Almond, has said transparency will be one of her priorities. But PSC staff would not make her or other commissioners available for an interview to discuss the absence of rate hearings or the public’s limited role in PSC affairs. Instead, the PSC’s press office provided written responses to questions.

When reporters reach out to the agency seeking information, the answers come with this warning:

“All verbal and/or written responses provided by the staff of the Alabama Public Service Commission (“APSC”) are for informational purposes only and may not be the subject of quotation(s) attributed to staff in any public medium without the express permission of the APSC.”

A Profitable Change

A turning point for Alabama Power’s profits came in 2013. That’s the year Alabama state regulators changed the way they measure Alabama Power’s returns, switching from the industry standard return on equity metric to a formula they created, called weighted retail return on common equity.

The weighted return rate rewards Alabama Power for having higher ratios of equity to debt. The idea was that by incentivizing company officials to carry a greater percentage of equity as opposed to debt, they would secure higher credit ratings and be able to borrow money under better terms, decreasing overall costs.

At the time, commissioners and the company said they expected electric rates to go down as a result.

“I will tell you as you see adjustments over the next few years, you are going to see a decrease,” then-PSC President Cavanaugh said.

That didn’t happen.

Instead, the company benefited from the change far more than its customers did.

Alabama Power’s electric rates have risen 45 percent across all customer groups since the novel rate formula went into effect. That’s far more than the national average, which increased 29 percent over the same span.

Meanwhile, the company’s profit nearly doubled, despite producing less electricity today than it did in 2013.

Since Alabama Power earns a return on all of its equity, having more power plants and infrastructure in place increases its profitability. The company also earns bonuses under the rate structure for maintaining positive credit ratings by financial agencies and for having a greater than 50 percent ratio of equity to debt.

The PSC, in a written statement, denied that its switch to weighted common equity was driving Alabama Power’s increased profitability.

“With regard to your analysis of public documents, which reflect the financial position of Alabama Power, please be advised there is no correlation between Alabama Power’s current financial position and the implementation of the weighted retail return on average common equality mechanism in 2013,” a commission representative told Inside Climate News.

Instead, the PSC said the increased net income was the result of Alabama Power’s “significant capital investments to modernize its systems,” which were approved by the PSC.

“If That’s Not Regulatory Capture…”

Blanton, the political science professor at UAB, sees the absence of rate-making cases, the nation’s highest electricity rates and Alabama’s record profits as unmistakable signs that Alabama’s PSC has been captured by the company it regulates.

He points to three ways regulatory capture manifests itself in Alabama.

“One is campaign finance, the ability of the regulated industry to financially contribute towards the campaigns of regulatory bodies,” he said.

A 2024 analysis by Floodlight, a nonprofit newsroom, showed that of the states that elect the members of their utility regulator, Alabama tops the list of those receiving the most campaign finance cash from fossil fuel-linked interests.

Fifty-five percent of political donations to Alabama public service commissioners above $250 from 2013 to 2023 came from fossil-fuel interests, the analysis concluded.

“You don’t have to have a conspiratorial mindset to figure out that gives these donors leverage—if they’re the ones that are financing the campaigns of the people they’re supposed to be regulating,” Blanton said of such contributions.

Part of the problem, Blanton said, is that Alabama is one of 10 states that directly elects its utility commissioners. PSC commissioners say they don’t accept money directly from the utilities they regulate, but lax campaign finance laws provide ample opportunity for influencing regulators, Blanton said.

An examination of “information flows” in the state also points toward capture, he said. There’s a general opacity and complexity around the information involved and a relative dominance of the industry as the primary source for information for the regulators, according to Blanton.

The third aspect of regulatory capture is “cultural capture,” Blanton said, a concept that alludes to the extent to which industry and regulators share similar worldviews or perspectives.

“The key is whether or not regulators are likely to unquestioningly accept evidence and opinions put forth by the industry, and the extent to which regulators accept information from outside sources,” Blanton said.

Looking at these three lines of evidence, Blanton said there are some clear takeaways about where Alabama finds itself—captured.

“There’s no objective reason why Alabama should be an outlier. We’re not hotter than Texas. We don’t have worse conditions than Louisiana,” he said. “There’s just nothing that makes sense. … Any reasonable person, looking through the data, looking through the evidence, will say, ‘We have a situation that’s, if that’s not regulatory capture, I don’t know what is.’”

Data Center Angst

Inside Climate News interviewed more than a dozen Alabama Power customers for this story, and each shared the concerns voiced by Mary Rosenboom, the customer who lives near the proposed hyperscale data center—rising energy costs, a lack of transparency and fear about what the future may hold.

Rosenboom and others worry that construction and operation of power-hungry data centers will drive their electricity costs even higher.

“I know that’s what’s coming,” Rosenboom said. “And it’ll be us that foot the bill. It’s not good for the citizens. It’s good for Alabama Power’s pocketbook.”

Alabama Power and the PSC both insist that data center costs will not be passed on to other customers. But they also declined to say whether those agreements with data centers will be made public, making it impossible to verify those claims.

In a statement, a representative for the company said that it takes a “disciplined approach” to engaging with potential data center customers.

“We understand that budgets are tight, and affordability is central to our mission. That is why we work hard to connect customers with offerings like Budget Billing, payment plans, efficiency tools, and assistance programs,” the company’s response said.

Data centers will “pay the full, fair cost to serve their needs,” the company said. “We work with the Alabama Public Service Commission to approve large-load customer contracts and any needed operational investments, ensuring a thorough process that validates needs and protects customers.”

Alabama Power declined to provide a list of planned data center projects and their anticipated electricity demand.

“Long-term capacity planning is reviewed with the PSC,” the company responded. “We don’t publish speculative load projections for individual customer classes or projects. Any major resource additions follow established processes to ensure reliability and fairness for all customers.”

Regulatory interactions involving Alabama Power and the PSC are often similarly opaque.

During depositions involving Alabama Power’s request to purchase a natural gas plant earlier this year, lawyers for environmental groups questioned company management about data centers and their anticipated loads.

The company’s representatives were often vague in their answers, though they did admit that data centers are the “primary driver” of increased load projections. When company lawyers did provide substantive information about specific load figures, their answers were redacted in PSC transcripts.

“I’ll say that some projects fall off of this list and some projects are added to this list and the net change is [redacted] megawatts,” Alabama Power forecasting manager Maria Burke said in a deposition. “They have a mixed answer because in the previous forecast I would say we only had [redacted] megawatts to data centers and in this forecast we have [redacted]. So the delta is [redacted].”

If built to capacity, a proposed data center campus in Bessemer, just southwest of Birmingham near Rosenboom’s home in McCalla, is expected to consume as much as 1,200 megawatts of electricity, running every hour, 24 hours a day, according to estimates provided to residents. That amount of energy is about 10 times the usage of all residences in nearby Birmingham or around 90 times the usage of all residences in Bessemer.

In one fell swoop, it could increase Alabama Power’s total demand across the state by around 10 percent.

“My power bill’s already not affordable,” said Brenda Small, who lives in a trailer park adjacent to the site of the proposed data center. “I had one bill that was $495. No one can afford that.”

Reliant on Fossil Fuels

Alabama Power’s electricity is not only expensive, it’s dirty and comes with a heavy environmental footprint.

The PSC has approved costly upgrades to old coal-fired power plants, allowing Alabama Power to spend hundreds of millions of dollars to delay their retirements by only a few years. The PSC greenlit massive natural gas additions in 2020, 2022 and 2025, making Alabama Power increasingly reliant on fossil fuels for decades to come and its customers vulnerable to price spikes in natural gas and supply shortages in times of heavy energy use.

Its coal-fired power plant near Birmingham, the James H. Miller Jr. Electric Generating Plant, has been the nation’s largest single source of greenhouse gases for nine years running. The company charges hefty fees to customers who install solar panels, smothering the small-scale renewable market. Alabama ranks second to last among states in energy efficiency efforts in a recent scorecard, and upgrades to its old and expensive coal plants seem destined to continue as electricity demand rises due to large data centers.

The company has also stuck to its guns on plans to leave nearly 77 million cubic yards of toxic coal ash in unlined ponds along Alabama’s rivers, leaching contaminants into the groundwater indefinitely, even as other utilities in the South have agreed to dig out some or all of their ash ponds.

And this environmental record, UAB’s Blanton said, has come under the watch of state regulators, who have minimized the effects of climate change and Alabama Power’s pollution.

A New Profit Formula Review—With No Public Input

When adopting the 2013 profit formula, called Rate Stabilization and Equalization, or RSE, the commission agreed to review its performance every six years. The first review was conducted in 2019, with no changes made to the rate structure.

In its responses to Inside Climate News, the commission said the second review has already begun—with no public input—through a series of closed-door meetings with Alabama Power and the state attorney general’s office.

Whether outside experts or concerned members of the public will be provided an opportunity to weigh in on the review will only be decided after the commission’s staff has made its findings, the PSC statement said.

Tidwell, the Southern Environmental Law Center attorney, said public participation should be essential in utility regulation.

“Alabama Power customers who are impacted by the PSC’s decisions deserve to have a say in the process,” Tidwell said. “The Public Service Commission is tasked with ensuring that rates are just and reasonable not just for Alabama Power, but also for the public. … How can you protect customers’ best interests when there are almost no avenues for them to participate in the process?”

Access to EV chargers should never be the constraint.” A ZIP code analysis by city officials found that downtown and some northern suburban neighborhoods have significantly more EV owners than San Ysidro and neighborhoods in southeastern San Diego.
Sales have been strong in California and San Diego with the tax credits in place.
She said the rate is 50 cents per kilowatt hour at the existing city chargers that recently got upgraded.
A new city survey about EV chargers is available at sandiego.gov/general-services/energy/zev/evcharging.","San Diego is launching construction of a long-awaited citywide network of electric vehicle charging stations in public parking lots at beaches, library branches and recreation centers.

The goal is a reliable network of chargers so San Diego residents can buy or lease an EV with confidence they can conveniently charge it — even if they don’t have a garage or another way to charge at home.

Another goal is to fight the socioeconomic and geographic trends showing most of the EVs in the city are registered to residents of wealthier neighborhoods like Carmel Valley, La Jolla, Rancho Bernardo and downtown.

The network will span every neighborhood in the city and target areas with high concentrations of apartments and condominiums, because residents there are the EV owners and potential owners most likely to need public charging.

“We needed to think about the transition to clean transportation through the lens of what the city can and can’t do,” said Anna Lowe, a city program manager focused on EVs. “We can’t help with the cost of buying an EV, but we can help with charging an EV. Access to EV chargers should never be the constraint.”

A ZIP code analysis by city officials found that downtown and some northern suburban neighborhoods have significantly more EV owners than San Ysidro and neighborhoods in southeastern San Diego.

“San Diego has a lot of EVs, but they’re not equitably distributed throughout the city,” Lowe said. “The city wants to be part of the solution to reduce that inequity.”

City officials are completing permitting and working out logistical details with San Diego Gas & Electric to install between 750 and 800 charging portals at 59 locations — 20 library branches and 39 pools or recreation centers.

Officials estimate ground could be broken on the first wave of chargers early next year. Work on them follows recently completed updates and repairs to 58 existing charging ports at 12 city locations.

The city had first announced plans for a network of chargers in spring 2023, but that process was delayed partly by complex negotiations with the company that will install them.

Progress on the charging network comes with future sales of EVs becoming more uncertain, thanks to the federal government’s elimination of long-standing tax credits at the end of last month.

Sales have been strong in California and San Diego with the tax credits in place. EV registrations within the city climbed from 67,674 in 2022 to 95,155 in 2023 and 119,251 in 2024. And statewide, EV sales soared last month, as buyers rushed to beat the end of the tax credits.

The more widespread adoption of EVs plays a key role in helping meet multiple city goals.

San Diego’s climate action plan commits the city to having 16% of all miles driven be by zero-emission vehicles by 2030 and to having a quarter be zero-emission by 2035.

The plan also calls for the city to transition to an all-electric fleet for light-duty vehicles by 2035, with 75% of its heavy-duty vehicles electric by that time. The city owns about 5,000 vehicles; only a small number are now EVs.

The chargers are being planned and installed by Everged, which agreed to a controversial 10-year deal with the city last year.

Some City Council members had raised concerns that the city could owe Everged as much as $60 million for charging infrastructure at the end of the deal.

While that is technically true, the city’s independent budget analyst said that amount is based on a highly unlikely worst-case scenario where demand for electric charging stations plummets to nearly zero.

Everged faces penalties if broken chargers aren’t promptly repaired. Broken chargers can be reported on the city’s Get It Done! tipster app.

The new chargers will be split roughly half and half between those compatible with Tesla cars and those with different plug shapes and other features. A number of car manufacturers are adopting Tesla-style chargers in upcoming models.

The system will be malleable, officials said. The charging cables and ports can be changed out if the mix of vehicles changes and there is greater demand for one type of port or another, officials said.

Heather Werner, a deputy director in the city’s General Services Department, said the charging fees at the city portals are “comparable” to other public charging stations not on city property.

She said the rate is 50 cents per kilowatt hour at the existing city chargers that recently got upgraded. Everged sets the rates, but the city has the right to object if it doesn’t find them reasonable.

At each project site where new chargers are planned, crews will post public notices and then conduct two to three weeks of preparation work that may include clearing debris and flattening areas for the chargers.

They will then spend two to three weeks installing the new chargers and another week or two testing them.

Once all the chargers have been installed at libraries and rec centers, Everged is scheduled to move on to police stations, fire stations and city office buildings.

A new city survey about EV chargers is available at sandiego.gov/general-services/energy/zev/evcharging.

City officials are planning a webinar for EV drivers some time this fall. Officials said it will focus on charger types, locations and related details.",https://www.sandiegouniontribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/SUT-L-ev-chargers-001.jpg?w=1024&h=710,N,,2025-11-03 12:10:58.570473

Clean energy technologies rely heavily on lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements.","Global data and analytics firm Wood Mackenzie’s Energy Transition Outlook 2025-2026 report further outlines how geopolitical tensions across the world are further hindering nations’ pledge to decarbonise.

The analysis shows that achieving a 2°C warming limit would require US$4.3trillion (£3.3trilliion) in annual investment between 2025-2060 and that net zero emissions by around to be reached around 2060. With this, global energy sector investment must grow from 2.5% of global GDP today to 3.35% within the next decade.

With current rates of energy demand rise and the climate warming, the report offers a bleak outlook where few countries across the whole world, and no G7 countries, are on track to meet 2030 emissions goals.

Wood Mackenzie’s report outlines how the current rate of renewables powering grids around the world is currently at 20%. With its modelling, it outlines how by 2050, at current rates, this will only rise to 68%, restricting most nations’ pledges to decarbonise their grids due to grid stability and storage limitations.

Specifically, the report points out how China is continuing to surge ahead with its decarbonisation plans using “coordinated industrial policy and rapid clean-tech expansion”.

“It dominates solar, wind, battery and critical mineral supply chains, using scale and cost advantages to expand exports, set standards and strengthen its geopolitical leverage,” the report says.

The US, in contrast, has shifted into energy isolationism under the Trump administration with much of the Inflation Reduction Act being dismantled, tax credits being scaled back and clean-energy funding being paused. Wood Mackenzie points out how certain states and cities remain active but the national stance has turned inward and fossil friendly.

Where Europe is concerned, the report details a struggle to maintain its early leadership, which is being hindered by high energy prices, slow permitting and a hollowed-out industrial base “eroding competitiveness, while public fatigue and political fragmentation are weakening climate consensus”.

“Ambition remains high, but execution is faltering,” it says.

According to Wood Mackenzie’s Lens Energy Transition Scenarios (ETS), the US faces the steepest investment challenge among major economies where it must increase annual climate transition spending by 76% to reach net zero.

China must see a 29% increase and Europe a 36% increase in climate spending to reach the 2050 net zero target.

Power surge

Wood Mackenzie has stated the boom in energy usage around the world is being propelled by the proliferation of data centres and artificial intelligence (AI).

According to its modelling, data centres are consuming 700TWh of electricity across the world this year which could potentially double by 2030.

“This surge threatens electricity crises and higher tariffs while derailing 2030 clean power commitments,” the report says.

“However, AI itself may accelerate breakthrough technologies and optimise energy systems, as advanced simulations, optimise materials performance, and enable efficient design configurations at unprecedented speed.”

Rare materials

A further element that is restricting renewable energy growing to help decarbonise is the lack of materials needed to build the industry in line with the growth in energy usage.

Clean energy technologies rely heavily on lithium, nickel, cobalt, copper and rare earth elements.

Wood Mackenzie points out how supply chains are “highly concentrated, with China dominating lithium and rare earth refining, creating new geopolitical dependencies”.

Last week, the government released its Carbon Budget and Growth Delivery Plan as it aims to redirect its climate action to be more in line with the framework of the Climate Change Act 2008.

This new plan brings together the government’s actions and intent to meet carbon budgets 4-6, from 2023-2037. These budgets constitute greenhouse gas emission reductions and have caps of 1,950Mt of CO2 (Carbon Budget 4), 1,725Mt of CO2 (Carbon Budget 5) and 965Mt of CO2 (Carbon Budget 6). The cap for Carbon Budget 6 constitutes a 77% reduction in emissions compared with 1990.

Wood Mackenzie vice president head of scenarios and technologies Prakash Sharma said: “The energy system is becoming more complex, interconnected, and, volatile,”

“As power demand surges due to the expansion of technologies such as AI and electrification, what was once a mostly aspirational shift towards decarbonization is now facing the hard trade-offs of scale, system integration, capital allocation and geopolitics.

“The share of solar and wind in global power supply has grown from 5% to 20% over the past decade and the surge is expected to continue. But accelerating from deployment to a deeply decarbonized, resilient energy system is proving far more complex than simply adding megawatts.”

“A new climate leadership is emerging,” said Sharma. “As the US doubles down on fossil fuels, pushing allies to buy its LNG, China is seizing the low-carbon mantle through EV and solar dominance, plus aggressive renewables deployment. Europe maintains the strongest net zero ambitions, viewing clean technologies as essential for economic and energy security.

“While a faster transition appears more expensive in the near-term due to compressed investment timelines, delaying it carries the risk of significantly higher costs longer term towards climate adaptation. The decade ahead presents critical climate checkpoints that will determine whether meaningful decarbonisation remains achievable with significant investment increases.”

“Viewing the energy system as interconnected is more critical than ever because electrification, flexibility and decarbonisation link markets that once stood apart,” said Sharma. “Oil, gas, coal and power can no longer operate in silos: EV adoption shifts electricity demand, gas shortages ripple into power and heating, and investment in shared infrastructure like transmission lines, pipelines and storage affects multiple sectors at once.

“Geopolitical shocks or resource constraints in one fuel cascade across others, while technologies such as hydrogen, CCUS and biofuels rely on cheap renewables and common infrastructure. Treating energy carriers as separate markets risks missing the synergies and vulnerabilities that define the transition.​”",https://cdn.ca.emap.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2022/02/shutterstock_1904019460-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 16:07:05.673526

In its third-quarter earnings presentation Thursday, First Solar listed a half-dozen “headwinds” for solar panel components manufactured abroad and shipped into the United States. Those include the possibility of new Section 232 tariffs on imported polysilicon components, potential retroactive duties on certain imports between June 2022 and June 2024 following an August trade court ruling, and pending Treasury Department guidance on domestic content in clean energy equipment.

In a statement Thursday, First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said his company’s domestic supply chain positions it to benefit from trade friction.

“While trade and policy developments have introduced new challenges for many in our industry, we continue to differentiate ourselves by offering pricing and delivery certainty,” he said.

He added more color to that statement on First Solar’s Thursday afternoon investor call.

“We believe this enhances the value proposition of our vertically integrated facilities … and of expanding our U.S. manufacturing and production [while] reshoring supply chains,” Widmar said.

Manufacturing update

First Solar produced 3.6 GW of solar equipment in the third quarter, 2.5 GW of which came from U.S. factories. Its newest production facility came online in Louisiana in August, and the company plans to commission new finishing lines with 3.7 GW annual capacity at a location to be announced soon, First Solar said Thursday.

On Thursday, Widmar signaled more U.S. investment could follow as First Solar shifts production out of heavily tariffed markets in Southeast Asia.

“We are very excited about getting the first two lines up and running here next year … as we continue to evaluate market opportunities and demand, more decisions will be made,” he said.

BP Lightsource contract dispute

First Solar continues to enforce its contractual rights against Lightsource BP, Widmar and First Solar Chief Financial Officer Alexander Bradley said on Thursday.

The European renewables developer, a subsidiary of BP, terminated a 6.6-GW supply agreement with First Solar last year amid what Widmar said was a broader retreat from renewable energy development by oil-and-gas multinationals.

First Solar booked $61 million in revenue from the contract but seeks an additional $324 million in damages, Bradley said. He did not say when First Solar expects the case to be resolved.

Solid bookings, pipeline churn

First Solar has 54.5 GW of net bookings out to 2030, the company said Thursday. Bradley characterized the pipeline as healthy, driven by continued strong demand in the United States. The Lightsource BP termination accounted for the bulk of recently canceled volumes, and at least one large customer re-booked an order in 2025 after canceling in 2024, Bradley added.

These financial realities are reshaping investment decisions and technology choices across the energy storage industry.","Thomas Sisto is co-founder and CEO of XL Batteries.

Explosive growth in electricity demand is poised to consume any surplus that once was wasted. We all know what is coming: Forecasts expect data centers alone to increase their power consumption by 165% in 2030. At that point, 50 GW of the 100 GW of predicted new U.S. peak demand will come from data centers. Combined with broader “electrification of everything” policies and increasingly complex grid dynamics, this growth is triggering a seismic economic shift. Wasting power will soon become an unaffordable luxury of the past.

This shift demands a hard look at long-duration energy storage, or LDES, which will be critical for grid reliability and affordability as we integrate more renewables. The U.S. Department of Energy found that up to 460 GW of LDES capacity may be necessary by 2050.

Not all LDES technologies are created equal, however. Round-trip efficiency, or RTE, will be a key determinant of which technologies can deliver at the scale and cost we need and which ones will perpetuate the pattern of waste.

A dangerous misconception persists that renewable energy is sometimes wasted or is so cheap that RTE doesn’t matter. This assumption ignores the true economics, which the data reveal. The industry must prioritize high-efficiency LDES technologies now to achieve both our climate goals and economic viability.

Scale redefines the efficiency equation

Here’s what the efficiency skeptics miss: Scale changes everything. Losing 50% of the energy stored in a home battery system is inconvenient but manageable; a 50% loss of stored energy at the grid scale — amounting to gigawatt-hours of stored energy — is catastrophic. Consider the difference between a leaking glass of water and a leaking Hoover Dam: The sheer volume of the dam’s water amplifies the loss.

This becomes even more critical given that the U.S. power system already wastes more than 60% of primary energy during the conversion of fuel to electricity. Many emerging LDES technologies struggle to exceed 60% RTE, creating compounding energy losses just as we need maximum efficiency.

The numbers make it clear that LDES must scale up capacity by 2040 to meet decarbonization goals. At this magnitude, every percentage point of efficiency loss translates to massive infrastructure costs and environmental impact. This reality is reshaping which LDES technologies will be able to provide value.

DOE analysis finds that existing LDES technologies need significant RTE improvements by 2030 to attract sustained investment. To accelerate this shift, utilities and developers must make efficiency a primary evaluation criterion for procurement decisions and regulators need to incorporate RTE requirements into grid planning and resource adequacy standards. Early demonstration projects that showcase superior efficiency will create the performance benchmarks necessary to drive industrywide adoption.

For cost-effective grid decarbonization, DOE estimates that LDES must achieve a levelized cost of storage below $0.05/kWh. Given these economics, 70% RTE is emerging as the target for grid-scale LDES. Earlier studies suggesting 50% RTE would suffice now look dangerously inaccurate.

Low RTE creates two compounding problems: lost revenue from wasted energy and the cost of overbuilding renewable infrastructure to compensate. As LDES assets become ubiquitous, competition for charging will intensify, eliminating “free” energy.

The financial case for high-efficiency LDES

Transitioning the power grid by 2035 could cost as much as $740 billion in additional power system costs. Every inefficiency will force us to build more panels, more transmission lines and more materials, each carrying environmental and economic costs.

Overbuilding is not a sustainable solution. Overbuilding renewable generation to compensate for inefficient storage is economically and environmentally untenable. The costs of infrastructure, land acquisition, permitting, and maintenance compound when more generation is needed to offset storage losses.

In Texas, recent studies show the stark difference efficiency makes for project returns. A 5-MW, 12-hour battery with 75% RTE produces an internal rate of return of 68.7% with a 1.5-year payback period, while a 40% RTE system drops to a 36.7% internal rate of return.

Recent modeling by E3 demonstrates the potential scale of this impact. For both 12-hour and 24-hour duration batteries, deployment of high (75%) RTE LDES technology could save California power producers $11 billion in renewable generation overbuild compared with low (46%) RTE technologies.

These financial realities are reshaping investment decisions and technology choices across the energy storage industry. When project returns vary this dramatically, RTE becomes the deciding factor.

As extreme weather events become more frequent, massive data centers come online, and electrification progresses, we cannot afford to waste power. The days of tolerating and investing in low-efficiency grid storage are over.

LDES technologies combining safety, scalability, and high RTE will dominate the future, and those who recognize this shift early will be positioned to lead the next phase of the energy transition.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/3-j41PCC0Ehet9Y5-BPL2AWZAnAfWnELuvvRE1s6fVM/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xOTI2MjI3OTQ4LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-03 12:11:23.060685

According to a new report from the Korea Economic Daily, Tesla has reached a substantial agreement with Samsung SDI. The deal is said to be worth over 3 trillion won (approximately $2.1 billion) and will see the South Korean battery giant supply cells to Tesla over a three-year period.

But here’s the key part: This supply is reportedly for Tesla’s Energy Storage System (ESS) business.

That means these cells are destined for Megapack and possibly Powerwall products, not for Tesla’s electric vehicles.

The report, which cites an unnamed battery industry source, marks the first large-scale supply agreement between Samsung SDI and Tesla. For years, the two companies have been in talks, with most speculation centered on Samsung building 4680 cells, a cell format Tesla pioneered. While Samsung is indeed ramping up its own 46-series cell production, this new deal appears to be focused entirely on LFP cells for stationary energy storage.

When reached for comment, Samsung SDI officially stated that “nothing has been finalized yet,” which is a common response to such reports before a deal is formally announced. Tesla has not commented.

This new deal with Samsung SDI follows another massive ESS battery agreement Tesla signed with a different South Korean supplier, LG Energy Solution, for lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries. Currently, Tesla exclusively uses cells from CATL and BYD for its energy storage products, but the company recently noted a bed to diversify supply due to the tariffs put in place on Chinese products.

Tesla has also been working on deploying its own LFP battery cell manufacturing in the US to partially offset Chinese supply.

Electrek’s Take

The company’s energy storage division has been a silver lining amid two years of decline in its EV division.

The growth has been impressive despite increased competition.

It’s the only segment where Tesla is truly production constrained, and more specifically battery supply constrained rather than demand constrained.",https://electrek.co/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/03/electrek.png?w=32,N,,2025-11-03 11:08:55.378993

Ottawa, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - November 3, 2025) - Focus Graphite Inc. (TSXV: FMS) (OTCQB: FCSMF) (FSE: FKC0) (""Focus"" or the ""Company""), a leading developer of high-grade flake graphite deposits and innovator of next-generation lithium-ion battery technology, is pleased to announce that it has been selected by Natural Resources Canada (""NRCan"") under the Global Partnerships Initiative (""GPI"") for conditional approval of a non-repayable contribution of up to $14,062,500 pending final due diligence. The funding will support Focus Graphite's project, ""Transformation of Canadian Flake Graphite into Ultra-High Purity Battery & Advanced Materials Using Electrothermal Fluidized Bed Technology"" (the ""Project""). The Project unites Canadians, Ukrainian, and American partners to produce ultra-high purity graphite for global battery, aerospace, defence, and advanced material markets.

Highlights:

Up to $14.1 Million Non-Repayable Federal Contribution Funding: Announced by the Honourable Tim Hodgson, Minister of Energy and Natural Resources, at the G7 Energy and Environment Minister's Meeting in Toronto under NRCan's Global Partnerships Initiative (GPI), to support the establishment of Canada's first commercial, scalable electrothermal fluidized bed purification demonstration facility, advancing domestic critical mineral processing capacity and creating skilled Canadian jobs.

Environmentally Friendly Technology: This continuous process produces ultra-high purity graphite with zero liquid waste, lower emissions, and an ESG-aligned pathway to supply advanced battery, defence, aerospace, and clean technology markets.

International Collaboration: Engineering led by Ukraine's Thermal & Material Engineering Center, using Canadian graphite feedstock and U.S.-based American Energy Technologies Company's expertise in electrothermal purification, with final assembly in Canada.

BEACONS Battery Prototyping Partnership: Focus has partnered with the University of Texas at Dallas, representing the BEACONS Battery Prototyping Facility, a U.S. Department of War-supported research and development center dedicated to strengthening North American energy and materials security.

Path to Commercialization: This initiative establishes the foundation for large-scale production of Quebec-sourced graphite from Lac Knife and Tetepisca, supporting Canada's goal of secure, allied, and sustainable critical-mineral supply chains.

This represents the largest federal award in the Company's history, supporting the development of Canada's first chemical-free continual fluidized electrothermal purification demonstration facility for natural flake graphite. The Project will use Quebec-sourced feedstock from Focus's Lac Knife and Lac Tetepisca deposits, two of North America's highest-grade natural graphite resources, to produce ultra-high-purity (>99.95% C) graphite, suitable for battery, aerospace, defence, nuclear and a host of advanced-material applications, including graphene. The Company may access the contribution funding up until March 2028.

The continuous electrothermal fluidized bed technology initiative will be carried out through collaboration with Ukraine's Thermal & Material Engineering Center (""TMEC""). TMEC will lead full project management for the demonstration unit, overseeing engineering design, construction, fabrication, system integration, and training. The company brings extensive experience in the design, engineering, and management of advanced high-temperature reactor systems and continuous fluidized bed technology development. American Energy Technologies Company (""AETC""), a recognized specialist in carbon materials, electrothermal purification, and fluidized bed furnace technologies, will continue providing processing and thermal purification services to support near-term customer sampling and product qualification.

Over the past several years, the Company has invested substantial time and capital to de-risk the purification pathway, working with U.S.-based AETC to validate the process on Lac Knife graphite feedstock. Detailed characterization confirmed that impurities in Focus's natural flake graphite occur predominantly along the flake boundaries rather than within the crystalline lattice, a feature that makes the material particularly responsive to high-temperature electrothermal purification. Using AETC's proprietary electrothermal fluidized-bed furnace, Focus successfully achieved over 99.999%+ C (five-nine purity or nuclear grade) without any chemical reagents. These results validated the scalability and environmental integrity of the process, laying the foundation for today's GPI-funded demonstration facility and its potential extension into rare earth element (REE) purification applications. As construction of the Canadian demonstration facility proceeds, Focus expects to continue working closely with AETC to purify additional material through its commercial-scale furnace, supporting near-term customer sampling, product qualification, and market off-take engagement. This parallel commercialization strategy ensures uninterrupted material availability while advancing the Company toward domestic electrothermal processing capacity.

This initiative will also strengthen several ongoing partnerships, including Focus Graphite's upcoming work with the University of Texas at Dallas's BEACONS (""BEACONS"") Battery Prototyping Facility, a U.S. DoW-supported research and development center dedicated to strengthening North American energy and materials security battery prototyping facility, which will accelerate the development, validation, and commercialization of this green purification technology. BEACONS will independently evaluate and qualify Focus's purified graphite and siliconized anode materials for defence and dual-use battery applications.

Collectively, these collaborations represent the first of several anticipated global partnerships, combining Ukrainian engineering innovation, Canadian critical-mineral resources, and U.S. defence-focused validation, as Focus Graphite advances its strategy to ship purified material worldwide for testing, validation, and qualification across commercial, aerospace, and defence markets.

""We are grateful to NRCan for its support and vision in assisting Focus Graphite and companies like ours in achieving our shared goal of securing North American supply chains for Canada and its G7 partners,"" said Dean Hanisch, CEO of Focus Graphite.

BEACONS Collaboration: North American Validation for Advanced Battery and Defence Applications

In parallel to its engineering partnership with TMEC, Focus has entered a non-binding Letter of Intent (""LOI"") on October 20, 2025 with The University of Texas at Dallas, representing the BEACONS Battery Prototyping Facility, a U.S. DoW supported research and development center dedicated to strengthening North American energy and materials security.

The project overview outlines a multi-phase validation program designed to demonstrate the performance of Focus's purified anode materials in U.S. DoW standard battery systems.

Phase I: DoW-Standard 18650 Cell Prototyping: BEACONS will fabricate and test 18650-format lithium-ion battery cells using Focus Graphite's purified natural flake graphite as the anode material. The program aims to generate statistically significant performance data including cycle life, energy density, and charge-retention metrics to establish a validated, North American source of graphite anode material suitable for integration into U.S. and Canadian defence and energy platforms

Phase II: Siliconized Graphite Development: BEACONS intends to collaborate further with Focus Graphite to develop a next-generation siliconized graphite anode, utilizing Focus's patent pending process and a North American-sourced, non-silane silicon feedstock. This program will prototype Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS)-standard pouch cells, with the goal of creating a commercially viable, high-energy-density anode that advances energy storage capabilities for both the U.S. DoW and Canada's Department of National Defence (""DND"").

Network-Wide Integration: Upon successful validation, the purified graphite will be made available through BEACONS' network of users which includes cell manufacturers, equipment developers, and academic researchers-for further testing with complementary cathode and electrolyte systems, reinforcing cross-border supply-chain interoperability.

This collaboration positions the Company at the center of North American anode-material validation, linking Canadian upstream resources to U.S. defence-grade testing and commercialization pipelines. Beyond these initial efforts, both parties recognize the potential to expand into testing and validation of additional advanced materials within BEACONS' network, creating a foundation for ongoing joint research and product development across the allied energy and defence ecosystem.

""We identified BEACONS as the ideal collaborator for this vertical given its DoW supported mandate to validate next-generation energy materials under real-world defence and flight-system testing standards,"" said Jason Latkowcer, VP Corporate Development. ""For investors and allied industries, this collaboration represents a gateway for Focus Graphite into North American and NATO supply chains, helping reduce dependency on adversarial sources and ensuring that critical defence and aerospace equipment are never reliant on foreign-controlled materials.""

""The G7's focus on critical minerals highlights the urgency of strengthening domestic energy infrastructure. This collaboration positions UT Dallas's BEACONS as a hub where innovative materials meet rigorous testing and validation, translating promising technologies into deployable solutions for the North American market,"" said Dr. Joseph Pancrazio, VP for Research and Innovation at UT Dallas.

Advancing Canada's Strategic and Environmental Independence in Critical Minerals

The GPI funding will help Canada strengthen secure and low-carbon critical mineral supply chains while reducing dependence on purification infrastructure currently dominated by other countries. Using electrothermal fluidized-bed technology, Focus will demonstrate a clean and scalable purification process.

This project aligns with the goals of Canada's Critical Minerals Strategy by establishing a domestic purification capability for Canadian-sourced graphite. It will create skilled jobs, support regional economic development, and enable Canadian-controlled production of battery-grade materials. By building this homegrown purification capacity, Focus is helping Canada and its allies process and qualify critical materials within North America, advancing environmental responsibility, energy security, and manufacturing resilience.

Expanding Allied Market Access and Global Qualification Pathways

Through this GPI-funded initiative, Focus will produce and distribute qualification samples to G7 and NATO-aligned partners. The project will also establish Canada's first commercial-scale graphite purification hub, offering mines, research institutions, and manufacturers a sustainable alternative to imported materials. This initiative directly addresses Canada's upstream bottleneck in establishing domestic large-scale purification capacity, and complements Ottawa's Critical Minerals Strategy. Focus looks forward to updating local First Nations communities as the Project advances, to explore opportunities for participation, collaboration, and shared economic benefits in the spirit of respect and partnership.

Focus's electrothermal platform is designed for clean, high-temperature purification of graphite and, over the longer term, may be adaptable to rare earth element (REE) purification. Current REE processing already uses thermal and pyrometallurgical techniques such as vacuum distillation, molten-salt electrolysis, and fluidized-bed calcination to achieve ultra-high purities. As the demonstration advances, Focus plans to collaborate with Canadian research institutions (e.g. the National Research Council of Canada) to explore how its electrothermal technology could apply to selective impurity removal and de-oxidation in REE flowsheets, potentially opening new avenues for clean, domestic processing of strategic materials.

A slow Western response In contrast, Western automakers — particularly in the U.S. — are slowing their EV plans.
Europe’s manufacturers, meanwhile, are warning of “industrial disaster” if Chinese EV imports continue unchecked.
In doing so, they’ve made the traditional strengths of Western automakers — decades of engine experience and dealership networks — largely irrelevant.
Using its controversial tariffs policy to keep Chinese cars out, the U.S. can delay the Chinese onslaught for a short while.","For more than a century, the global car industry has been defined by Western dominance — from Detroit’s muscle to Stuttgart’s precision to Tokyo’s reliability and efficiency. But in 2025, the center of gravity is shifting east once again. This time, it’s not Japan or Korea leading the charge. It’s China. And its automakers, led by BYD, Chery, Geely, GWM, and NIO — are executing a global electric vehicle offensive that has the potential to reshape the industry as profoundly as Toyota did in the 1970s.

A new wave of disruption

Across Europe, Southeast Asia, and Australia, Chinese EVs are arriving in droves — sleek, affordable, and technologically sophisticated. At last count, for example, at least 23 Chinese car brands were either on sale in Australia or due to go on sale within the next six months. Meanwhile, restrictive import policies—namely extremely high tariffs—by the US administration mean that not one Chinese brand has landed in American showrooms yet.

BYD, the world’s largest EV maker, has already overtaken Tesla in global EV sales. In markets like Australia and Thailand, its compact electric Dolphin and Atto 3 models are undercutting competitors by as much as 30 percent while offering longer ranges and higher-quality interiors. Meanwhile, Zeekr — a premium arm of Geely, which also owns Volvo and Polestar — is launching design-forward EVs in Europe that rival BMW and Mercedes-Benz on style and software. NIO, once dismissed as a Tesla clone, is expanding its network of battery-swap stations across Europe, offering five-minute “refuels,” or super quick battery swaps, that leapfrog Western charging infrastructure.

Chinese automakers are no longer playing catch-up. They’re outpacing Western brands on cost, speed, and innovation — and they’re doing so with a confidence that recalls the early days of Japan’s automotive rise.

The cost advantage that’s rewriting the rules

At the heart of this revolution is vertical integration. BYD, short for “Build Your Dreams,” controls nearly every stage of its supply chain, from raw lithium extraction to battery cell production to chip design. This structure, rare among established automakers, gives BYD a massive cost advantage. Analysts estimate BYD can produce an EV battery pack for less than $60 per kWh, compared to roughly $100 per kWh for Western competitors.

That gap translates directly into lower sticker prices — and higher profits. While Ford and GM struggle to make a margin on their electric lineups like the F-150 Lightning, Mustang Mach-E, Chevrolet Equinox EV and Blazer EV, BYD’s profits per vehicle surged over 80% in 2024. The company’s Blade Battery, a long-lasting and fire-resistant lithium iron phosphate (LFP) design, is both cheaper and safer than most Western alternatives.

This cost efficiency, combined with scale, is what’s enabling BYD to flood export markets while others hesitate.

A slow Western response

In contrast, Western automakers — particularly in the U.S. — are slowing their EV plans. Ford and GM have delayed billions in electric car investments amid slowing demand and high battery costs. Tesla, once the defining disruptor, now faces price pressure from both ends: Chinese EVs undercut it on affordability, and luxury newcomers challenge it on quality.

Europe’s manufacturers, meanwhile, are warning of “industrial disaster” if Chinese EV imports continue unchecked. The European Commission has even launched an investigation into Chinese subsidies, fearing that Beijing’s state-backed automakers are dumping cars below cost to capture market share — much like Japan’s strategy in the 1970s.

But protectionism may not be enough. Even if tariffs rise, the technological and cost gulf between Chinese and Western automakers could widen.

Echoes of Japan’s 1970s takeover

The parallels are striking. In the 1970s, U.S. carmakers dismissed Japanese imports as cheap and underpowered — until Toyota, Honda, and Nissan redefined quality, reliability and efficiency. Today, Chinese EVs are following the same playbook: entering with budget models, refining quality, and moving rapidly upmarket.

Already, BYD’s Yangwang U8, a 1,200-horsepower plug-in hybrid SUV with its revolutionary 360-degree tank-turn capability—allowing it to turn a full circle on itself, shows China’s engineering ambitions aren’t limited to economy cars. And brands like Zeekr and NIO are being heralded in European media including Britain’s Autocar and Top Gear and Germany’s Auto Bild for their handling and ride quality, design sophistication and software refinement — once considered unthinkable for Chinese cars.

The new global order

If the 20th century belonged to Detroit, Stuttgart, and Tokyo, the 21st century may belong to Shenzhen and Hangzhou. China’s EV makers have leapfrogged the combustion era entirely, focusing on software-driven design, solid-state battery R&D, and over-the-air performance updates. In doing so, they’ve made the traditional strengths of Western automakers — decades of engine experience and dealership networks — largely irrelevant.

The disruption isn’t just industrial; it’s geopolitical. Electric vehicles are the backbone of tomorrow’s energy and trade policies, linking lithium mines in Africa, battery plants in Asia, and charging grids in Europe. As China seizes control of the EV supply chain, Western economies risk losing not just market share but strategic influence. And what of America? Using its controversial tariffs policy to keep Chinese cars out, the U.S. can delay the Chinese onslaught for a short while. But just like America was forced to enter WWII by the Japanese in late 1941, after maintaining an isolationist policy, the day will come soon when the U.S. will be forced to open the floodgates to Chinese cars.

Western carmakers are now where Detroit was in 1978 — slow, complacent, and vulnerable to a faster, leaner rival. The Chinese EV invasion has begun, and unless the West accelerates innovation and cuts costs dramatically, it may soon find itself fighting for relevance in an industry it once owned.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6908b9b95c59d1cbb22e569a/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-03 12:13:02.907567

We’ll take a look at the week ahead and look back on what you may have missed last week.

THOUSANDS OF JOBS LOST — POLITICO’s Mona Zhang: New York has lost more than 6,500 clean energy jobs and $2.5 billion in investments as a result of federal energy policies, Gov. Kathy Hochul told reporters Friday.

Nearly 159,000 jobs and $52 billion in investment have been lost or delayed, impacting more than 300 energy projects across 34 states, according to a new report from the advocacy group Climate Power. Meanwhile, household energy prices have risen 11 percent on average since President Donald Trump took office.

“There’s no such thing as a Democratic job or Republican job,” said Brent Booker, president of the Laborers’ International Union of North America. “To hear this White House, this president … talking about, ‘We’re going to cancel Democratic jobs’ — that’s un-American.”

Booker said some of LIUNA’s members voted for Trump, but did not vote for losing their jobs.

“The chaos that’s coming out of Washington … is no strategy for energy independence. It’s no strategy for energy dominance,” Booker said.

A White House spokesperson pushed back against the report, stating that Trump is restoring jobs in coal, natural gas and nuclear.

“The president has also brought in trillions in investments through historic trade and peace deals, which have a significant focus on energy partnerships,” the spokesperson said. “By unleashing American energy, President Trump is lowering costs and securing investments that don’t need to be subsidized by taxpayer dollars.”

However, the coal, natural gas and nuclear sectors have benefited from government subsidies and tax breaks for decades. Between 1950 and 2016, coal received $112 billion and natural gas received $140 billion in federal incentives, according to a 2017 Nuclear Energy Institute report.

ATLANTIC OFF THE DRILLING TABLE — POLITICO’s Ben Lefebvre: The Interior Department has removed the federal waters off the Atlantic coast from President Donald Trump’s upcoming offshore drilling plan after Republicans in the region pressed to keep oil and natural gas rigs away from their shores, three people familiar with the latest moves told POLITICO.

The five-year leasing plan, aimed at reopening areas long closed to drilling, will still seek to allow rigs off the California coast, said the people, who were granted anonymity to discuss private deliberations. That could create a conflict with Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom, who is trying to raise his national political profile in a state that opposes offshore drilling but also has some of the highest gasoline prices in the country.

The plan’s latest iteration will also include a portion of the eastern Gulf of Mexico but provide a buffer around Florida, a Republican stronghold where politicians from both parties have long opposed drilling, these people said. It’s unclear whether the buffer would be large enough to avoid fierce objections from Floridians, who have battled against similar proposals in past decades because of fears that an oil spill would devastate their tourism economy.

What you may have missed

ON TO COURT: Nonprofits, homeowners and conservationist groups banded together to sue the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission for reissuing a certificate FERC had granted in 2019 for the Northeast Supply Enhancement gas pipeline, Transco’s vacated project that spans across New York, Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

This comes after plaintiffs filed a rehearing request in September urging FERC to reconsider the certification and for Transco to submit a new application that takes into account the current environmental impacts the pipeline would pose.

The groups argue in the suit that “there is no legal basis” for Transco to request the certificate’s reissuance because FERC had previously vacated the certificate in 2024, deeming the project “legally ‘dead.’” And since Transco’s application is now outdated, the request is not consistent with FERC standards, the National Environmental Policy Act and the Natural Gas Act.

Moneen Nasmith, Earthjustice’s director of national climate and fossil fuel infrastructure, called the certificate’s reissuance “a bunch of sorcery.”

“FERC doesn’t have the power to reanimate a zombie gas pipeline that the company abandoned years ago,” she added. “It can’t make up for its lack of statutory authority by pretending like nothing has changed in the more than six years since FERC last reviewed the project.” — Isa Dominguez

ADK BALLOT QUESTION AT RISK — POLITICO’s Bill Mahoney: The lone statewide ballot question this year will ask New York voters if they want to allow skiing and trail facilities on a 1,039-acre section of the Adirondack Park in exchange for 2,500 acres of new forest land. There’s no significant opposition to the amendment — but it’s not guaranteed to pass.

FUNDING PARKS: New York City allocates 1.2 percent of its total budget, or $1.4 billion, for parks in its fiscal year 2026 budget, according to a new report from the Citizen’s Budget Commission. That totals 1.6 percent of the city-funded budget (excluding certain state and federal funds).

But only 0.6 percent of the budget goes to the Department of Parks and Recreation for operations and maintenance, not including things like Parks employees fringe benefits, pension contributions and debt service.

While the share of city budget spending has held relatively steady for decades, the share of spending on supporting parks’ daily operations have declined three-fold from 2004 to 2024, according to the report.

The push for 1 percent: For decades, a coalition of advocates, including New Yorkers for Parks, New York League of Conservation Voters and District Council 37, have pushed a “1 percent for Parks” campaign in an effort to increase funding for parks.

Other major U.S. cities like Los Angeles, San Francisco and Chicago dedicate 1.5 percent to 4 percent of their budgets, according to a report from New Yorkers for Parks.

“The CBC research confirms that the city only spends 0.6 percent of the budget on our parks operations and maintenance,” said Adam Ganser, executive director of New Yorkers for Parks. “[It] really calls attention to the fact that that budget hasn’t grown as a percentage in decades, despite the fact that we have many more residents living in New York City.”

The CBC thinks that things like pensions should be included in estimates of the city’s parks budget.

“The full cost … for the parks and recreational facilities that New Yorkers enjoy includes fringe benefits, includes pensions, and it includes debt service,” said Ana Champeny, CBC’s vice president for research. “We’re also trying to give folks a more complete picture of the resources.” — Mona Zhang

CLIMATE CONUNDRUM: Gov. Kathy Hochul plans to appeal a judge’s order to issue emissions regulations — and she again wants lawmakers to consider changes to New York’s landmark 2019 climate law.

“We’ll sit down with the Legislature. We have time to work it out,” Hochul said at a press conference.

An Albany County judge ruled that Hochul’s administration violated New York’s climate law by failing to issue regulations to cut emissions by January 2024. Environmental advocates sued earlier this year to force the state to take action.

Several environmental groups hailed the ruling, calling for Hochul to release regulations she halted this year that would put a declining limit on emissions and charge for pollution. Some of the money raised would be directed to rebates for lower-income New Yorkers

“The ruling is incredibly promising,” said Justin Balik, states vice president with Evergreen Action. “If implemented properly, this is a program that can lower costs for New Yorkers.”

Democratic state Sen. Liz Krueger, chair of the Senate Finance Committee, preemptively rejected Hochul’s overture on the climate law. The Legislature also rebuffed Hochul’s effort to change the climate law in 2023.

“I just can’t see that there will be any appetite in the Senate to kneecap [the law] this session,” Krueger said. “But there is definitely an appetite to implement critical affordability policies and investments to bring down New Yorkers’ utility costs while at the same time meeting our reality-based climate targets.”

The state has 30 days to file an appeal. That could buy the Hochul administration more time — the judge ordered regulations by Feb. 6.

Hochul said the judge didn’t understand how different circumstances are now compared to when the law was passed. She said private companies the state is relying on to build renewables aren’t as interested after the elimination of federal tax credits.

“There’s been less interest than there was perhaps in 2019 when this was enacted, not by us, but by the industries that make it happen,” said the governor. — Marie J. French

ENERGY MOVES: Natural Allies for a Clean Energy Future, a pro-gas group that previously organized a panel at the Rev. Al Sharpton’s annual conference that got some pushback, is gearing up to get more involved in New York. Former Lt. Gov. Bob Duffy, who currently heads up the Greater Rochester Chamber of Commerce, and former Bronx Borough President Ruben Diaz, Jr., are joining the group’s leadership council. Diaz is also co-chair of Actum, a political consulting firm employed by Natural Allies. The pro-gas group has ties to Williams Co., which is seeking approval for two pipelines in New York.

RELIABILITY WORRIES MEET COST CONCERNS: The state’s independent grid operator is advancing a reliability report set to trigger changes to planning aimed at shoring up New York’s electric system. A key New York Independent System Operator committee on Wednesday advanced the Comprehensive Reliability Plan that raises concerns about the ability of the grid to meet growing demand over the next decade. The report doesn’t find a reliability need that will require near-term action — which NYISO officials and some other market participants view as a potential problem. (A shorter-term reliability assessment has triggered a solicitation for anticipated shortfalls downstate as some peaker power plants filed to retire due to state environmental regulations.)

The report recommends the grid operator change its process for next year’s Reliability Needs Assessment. The potential changes — which would be worked out over the coming months and are subject to more debate — make it more likely that assessment will spur action to get additional generation online or take other steps to address potential supply shortfalls. NYISO officials want to be able to consider a range of “plausible scenarios” — like more large data centers coming online quickly or more of the state’s aging fossil fuel plants retiring — in their planning.

“We must implement a more proactive and expanded framework,” said Ross Altman, senior manager for reliability planning at NYISO, during Wednesday’s meeting. “Given the amount of risk that we’re finding with, again, all the assumptions we make on transmission, demand and resources, both existing and new, we find that really we shouldn’t be just having that one set of base case assumptions.” NYISO officials are also worried about relying too heavily on emergency operating procedures to maintain reliability, raising concerns that this might not be effective in the long term given other system constraints.

Gov. Kathy Hochul’s administration shares the NYISO’s reliability concerns and has advanced policies open to gas plant repowerings to meet electricity demand as part of the draft state energy plan. NYSERDA supported adoption of the reliability report on Wednesday.

Not everyone is happy about the proposed changes. The Natural Resources Defense Council voted against the report. Some parties abstained, including Earthjustice, New York City, a group representing large energy users and the New York Utility Intervention Unit, which advocates for consumers. NRDC’s Chris Casey said NYISO was focusing too heavily on “worst-case scenarios” that are unlikely to materialize. Earthjustice’s Michael Lenoff also raised concerns about the push to act quickly on NYISO’s reliability concerns given the potential costs. “Maybe don’t go down this road,” Lenoff said. Or ensure it’s done in a “careful and cautious manner so that you’re not imposing exorbitant costs on New Yorkers to unnecessarily plan for worst-case scenarios,” he said.

Potomac Economics, the NYISO’s independent external market monitor, also raised some concerns — including about potential costs for consumers — in comments on the reliability report. Potomac’s Pallas LeeVanSchaick said the gap between what resources NYISO’s markets incentivizes and its planning processes find are needed will grow with the proposed changes. The adoption of “plausible scenarios” could result in retaining more generation capacity than is needed to supply demand either through market changes or out-of-market contracts, he said. “There are obviously ways to do that, but that would be very costly to consumers,” the market monitor said. He suggested that the NYISO should reconsider some assumptions about demand growth and generator retirements since those would be responsive to rising costs.

LeeVanSchaick also said NYISO should account for the likelihood that state policymakers will be sensitive to potential cost concerns and could slow electrification policies due to reliability concerns, easing pressure on the system. Hochul’s administration has already moved in this direction by giving school districts more time to comply with electric school bus mandates, delaying enforcement of clean car sales rules and consideration of a delay of electric building requirements.

The market monitor also said there’s concern about NYISO’s desire to reduce reliance on emergency procedures in its planning. “To just pretend that they don’t exist, or arbitrarily disregard their impact, is going to ultimately cause you to gold plate the system. It’s going to result in a lot of excess costs,” he said. NYISO should provide a clear rationale for why the grid operator wants to avoid emergency procedures, LeeVanSchaick added.

The NYISO’s board of directors is expected to finalize the Comprehensive Reliability Plan next month, kicking off more discussion of how to implement changes to the grid operator’s planning process. There are also plans to consider other changes to the markets to better align them with these reliability concerns, which several generator representative and others raised during the discussion. — Marie J.

SUPPORT FOR GAS: Most New Jersey voters support building new natural gas power plants, according to a new poll from Fairleigh Dickinson University and the Commerce and Industry Association of New Jersey. The poll found that 64 percent of voters support new natural gas plants, while 22 percent think that the state should wait for other options.

Support, however, fell along partisan lines: Nearly 90 percent of Republicans support new natural gas plants, while only 46 percent of Democrats support them. Still, they outnumbered the 33 percent of Democrats who said that they oppose building new natural gas plants. — Mona Zhang",https://static.politico.com/3d/ee/f4d549cf4e548af6712990ce5b9e/politico-cms-shared-graphic-1120x629.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 11:09:08.938901

“Does Regulation Distort Exit Decisions?” Energy Institute Blog, November 3, 2025, https://energyathaas.wordpress.com/2025/11/03/does-regulation-distort-exit-decisions/ —","New study shows regulated coal and gas units were 45% less likely to exit between 2011 and 2023.

(Today’s post is co-authored by Paige Weber.)

Hundreds of power plants have closed in the United States since 2010, including 130+ gigawatts of coal and 50+ gigawatts of natural gas. These exit decisions have important implications for electricity markets, grid reliability, and the environment.

A new Energy Institute working paper highlights the potential for regulation to distort this type of exit decision. Energy Institute Faculty Affiliate Paige Weber and I analyze 14 years of generator-level data to see whether exit behavior differs between investor-owned utilities, publicly-owned utilities, and independent power producers.

—

Ownership Mix

We include in the analysis all U.S. coal and gas units that were operating in 2010. As the figure below illustrates, this capacity was owned by a rich mix of investor-owned utilities (IOU), publicly-owned utilities (POU), and independent power producers (IPP).

—

Early Retirement for IPPs?

The table below shows the average age at retirement for regulated and unregulated units. For this table we define “regulated” as including both IOUs and POUs.

For the hundreds of regulated coal units that retired between 2011 and 2023, the average age at retirement was 55. For unregulated coal units, the average age was only 49. So unregulated coal units retired 6 years earlier on average .

The pattern goes in the same direction for natural gas. Regulated gas units retired at an average age of 47, compared to only 39 for unregulated gas units. So unregulated gas units retired 8 years earlier on average.

—

Controlling for Other Factors

The paper then turns to a hazard model that allows us to compare exit rates for regulated versus unregulated units, while controlling for other factors that affect exit behavior. Hazard models are useful for studying how different factors impact the time to an event, in this case, the time from entry to retirement. In our full specification, we control for unit capacity (e.g., 200MW), technology (e.g., combined cycle), vintage (e.g., built in the 1980s), and regional economic trends (NERC region).

You have to go to the paper if you want all the details, but here are the main takeaways:

Results are similar with and without controls.

Regulated units were 45% less likely to exit than unregulated units.

This pattern is similar for coal and gas.

The pattern is similar for IOUs and POUs. Both IOUs and POUs were much less likely to exit than IPPs.

The figure below shows the results visually. The black and blue lines show the cumulative probability of retirement for unregulated versus regulated units. For example, 60 years after opening, 39% of regulated units have exited, compared to 64% of unregulated units. This is a big difference, implying a difference in age at retirement of 8.4 years.

—

Mechanisms and Implications

Why is this happening? We interpret the results in the paper by pointing out that regulated and unregulated companies have very different incentives. Unregulated companies, i.e., IPPs, make exit decisions based on wholesale electricity prices, ongoing capital costs, and other standard market-based economic factors. In contrast, regulated companies are largely insulated from these factors and instead subject to the preferences and priorities of local regulators.

For IOUs, there is also a guaranteed rate-of-return, which creates in some cases a strong incentive to make and maintain capital-intensive equipment. Studies by economists have shown that IOUs tend to prefer capital-intensive technologies (e.g. here, here, and here). But whereas previous studies have mostly focused on new investments, our paper emphasizes that this same regulatory distortion also affects exit decisions.

We also tested whether regulated units were less likely to exit in states that are major producers of coal or natural gas. Our hypothesis was that in states like Wyoming, West Virginia, and Kentucky with significant coal production, you would expect to have coal producers exerting political pressure on state politicians and regulators to keep coal plants open. We do not find any evidence of this type of “regulatory capture”, but we would be very interested if readers have other ideas for how to test for the role of local priorities and preferences.

—

From Surplus to Shortage

Since 2024, the fortunes for U.S. power companies have changed dramatically. The increased demand for electricity from data centers has shifted the market overnight from surplus to shortage and left companies scrambling to add new capacity. One of the implications of this dramatic reversal is that units that did not exit in 2011-2023 are now more likely to remain open for the foreseeable future.

Moving forward, we are likely to also see a reversal of exit behavior, with unregulated units being less likely to exit than regulated units. There will also be pressure to keep regulated units operating, but it remains to be seen whether this pressure will be as strong as the profit motive for unregulated units. The broader point is that the effect of regulation on exit decisions can be either positive or negative, but that we should expect regulated companies to be at least partially insulated from whatever current economic conditions may be.

→ First-ever survey reveals urgent need for coordinated action: only 5 percent of state health officials feel “very prepared”, 61 percent relied on federal funds now in flux.

PROVIDENCE, R.I. — November 3, 2025 — A new report from the STAT Network reveals that extreme weather events are jeopardizing the health, safety and economic prospects of Americans. Published today in partnership with the Federation of American Scientists and supported by The Rockefeller Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the report reveals first-of-its-kind data from state public health officials in 45 states and territories on the urgent need for state-led coordination. The report also spotlights innovations that are being adopted and scaled through the STAT Network despite drastic cuts in federal funding to public health.

“States are navigating a new normal of extreme weather crises—heat waves following floods, wildfires overlapping with hurricanes—while the federal support and data tools they’ve relied on are eroding. No state should be left to shoulder this alone. Through our Extreme Weather & Health group and this report, we elevate what’s working on the ground as states are leading the response and offer a practical roadmap for acting at the speed and complexity of today’s hazards” said Stefanie Friedhoff, Professor of the Practice and STAT Network Lead, Brown University School of Public Health.

The STAT Network, which supports state public health officials across a range of pressing public health issues, started a dedicated extreme weather and health group in August 2024, serving as an essential connection point for collective problem solving in a shifting landscape. Of 136 state respondents who participated in the STAT Extreme Weather & Health survey shared with states in summer 2025:

→ only 5% feel “very prepared” to handle the escalating public health impacts of extreme weather

→ 61% prepared for extreme weather using federal funds that are now in flux

→ 39% cited federal partnerships as historically one of the most effective mechanisms to address impacts

→ 94% are concerned that socioeconomic disparities moderately (27%) or significantly (67%) contribute to unequal outcomes during extreme weather events in their state.

The new report, Protecting the Health of Americans in the Face of Extreme Weather: A Roadmap for Coordinated Action was developed to support these leaders at this moment of evolving challenges, needs and opportunities. The report details how states are pivoting their preparedness playbooks, showcases replicable new models, and identifies pressing gaps that funders, policymakers and thought leaders must still fill.

That same level of coordination is just as critical today as we face growing threats to health, safety, and economic opportunity” said Derek Kilmer, Senior Vice President for U.S. Program and Policy, The Rockefeller Foundation.

“One in three Americans report being personally affected by extreme weather in just the past two years – illustrating that extreme weather has become extremely common. The good news is that the negative health impacts of extreme weather are largely preventable. FAS is excited to partner with the STAT Network to help states step up as the federal government steps back, putting in place the innovative, evidence-based strategies we need to protect people and communities across the country,” said Dr. Hannah Safford Associate Director of Climate and Environment, Federation of American Scientists.

A changed landscape

Protecting the Health of Americans describes how extreme weather events have become more frequent, severe and widespread. From wildfires that quickly spiraled out of control in Maui and Los Angeles, to illness from extreme heat overloading emergency rooms across the Southwest, to sudden flash flooding from Hurricane Helene catching entire regions off-guard across Appalachia, it is clear that existing playbooks are no longer sufficient to respond to rapidly evolving threats. At the same time, cuts in 2025 at the Centers for Disease Control, the Environmental Protection Agency, the National Weather Service and other federal agencies have removed the backbone of funding, data and technical assistance many states relied on.

States lead the way

Summarizing ongoing preparedness and response efforts across states, Protecting the Health of Americans offers three pillars for action and shares concrete, replicable examples that emerge from the STAT Extreme Weather & Health Network:

Collaboration. States like Minnesota and California are embedding public health voices in climate and infrastructure decisions, while North Carolina and Texas have demonstrated that shared frameworks like FEMA’s Community Lifelines can unite health, energy and emergency systems under one coordinated response. Partnerships break down silos and accelerate action.

Data. In North Carolina, advanced modeling now informs heat alerts based on real-time health and climate data; Illinois is developing predictive tools that warn hospitals before storms hit; and Alaska’s Local Environment Observer Network turns community observations into early-warning intelligence. States are making data more interoperable, localized and actionable.

Communication. Massachusetts amplified risk messaging on Triple E and West Nile via medical providers, community groups and local media. California is co-developing an interactive curriculum with community health workers on responding to poor air quality events. Kansas convenes a cross-sector Extreme Weather Events Work Group with community-based organizations to co-create practical toolkits. States are modernizing their communications capacity, building trusted messenger networks and moving past an over-focus on social media outreach.

The new report also includes case examples from states such as Oregon, Arizona and Texas that illustrate how housing insecurity, energy burden, medical dependence on electricity, and lack of access to timely, trusted information add additional burden for low-income, elderly and rural populations—and how systems-level interventions focused on energy resilience, targeted mitigation and partnerships with community-based organizations can save lives.

Insights from this report can serve as a pathway to building community resilience and protecting health from the impacts of extreme weather. Looking ahead, the STAT Network, the Federation of American Scientists and other collaborators look forward to working with state leaders and their partners to translate this roadmap into sustained progress.

The announcement comes ahead of the STAT Network’s participation in The Rockefeller Foundation and Heartland Forward’s “Big Bets for America” convening in Oklahoma City, where leaders across the public, private, and non-profit sectors will discuss opportunities to help communities flourish.

On Dec. 31, 2025, federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire. American Home Shield breaks down what is changing and how homeowners can ensure they lock in savings before the end of the year.

What was the Inflation Reduction Act?

The IRA of 2022 was a landmark act designed to address climate change by investing in clean energy and manufacturing through tax incentives, grants, and loan programs.

Tax credits authorized by the IRA have helped everyday American households and businesses afford energy-efficient upgrades, including HVAC systems and other big-ticket items.

According to Energy Star, homeowners can claim 30% of project costs up to $2,000 for qualifying energy efficiency home improvements like heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves, or up to $1,200 for qualifying water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and central AC units.

What has changed?

The IRA's federal tax incentives for energy-efficient installations and upgrades were originally supposed to last until 2032, but the federal government is ending them early. The program will now expire on Dec. 31.

There is now only a limited time left for homeowners to take advantage of these tax credits.

Why is it important to act now?

Qualifying HVAC systems must be purchased and installed by Dec. 31. Documentation is key - homeowners should keep invoices or receipts with dates, contractor plans and permits. They should be able to clearly show when the work was completed and when the service was turned on so that if audited, they can prove it was finished by the end of 2025.

What are some signs an HVAC needs to be replaced?

Even the highest quality HVACs will need to be replaced at some point, making the expiring federal tax credits even more valuable to act on now.

""AC units typically last 10 to 15 years. If homeowners know their unit is getting close to that timeframe, or there are signs of decline, they should start researching replacements,"" said Micah Sherman, a virtual HVAC expert with American Home Shield.

""A few signs to look out for include strange sounds coming from the unit, hot or cold spots in the house, or refrigerant leaks. Sometimes the cost of repairing these problems warrants considering a new system altogether,"" said Sherman.

The end of the federal tax credits program is a change consumers need to be aware of, but if they act quickly, there is still time to capture savings before it expires.

First-ever survey reveals urgent need for coordinated action: only 5 percent of state health officials feel “very prepared,” 61 percent relied on federal funds now in flux

PROVIDENCE, R.I. | November 3, 2025 — A new report from the STAT Network reveals that extreme weather events are jeopardizing the health, safety and economic prospects of Americans. Published today in partnership with the Federation of American Scientists and supported by The Rockefeller Foundation and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, the report reveals first-of-its-kind data from state public health officials in 45 states and territories on the urgent need for state-led coordination. The report also spotlights innovations that are being adopted and scaled through the STAT Network despite drastic cuts in federal funding to public health.

“States are navigating a new normal of extreme weather crises — heat waves following floods, wildfires overlapping with hurricanes — while the federal support and data tools they’ve relied on are eroding,” said Stefanie Friedhoff, professor of the practice at Brown University School of Public Health and leader of the STAT Network, a national network of over 600 state-level public health officials from all 50 states and several territories. “No state should be left to shoulder this alone. Through our Extreme Weather & Health group and this report, we elevate what’s working on the ground as states are leading the response and offer a practical roadmap for acting at the speed and complexity of today’s hazards.”

The STAT Network, which supports state public health officials across a range of pressing public health issues, started a dedicated extreme weather and health group in August 2024, serving as an essential connection point for collective problem solving in a shifting landscape.

Of 136 state respondents who participated in the STAT Extreme Weather & Health survey shared with states in summer 2025:

only 5% feel “very prepared” to handle the escalating public health impacts of extreme weather

61% prepared for extreme weather using federal funds that are now in flux

39% cited federal partnerships as historically one of the most effective mechanism to address impacts

94% are concerned that socioeconomic disparities moderately (27%) or significantly (67%) contribute to unequal outcomes during extreme weather events in their state.

The new report, Protecting Americans’ Health in the Face of Extreme Weather: A Roadmap for Coordinated Action was developed to support these leaders at this moment of evolving challenges, needs and opportunities. The report details how states are pivoting their preparedness playbooks, showcases replicable new models, and identifies pressing gaps that funders, policymakers and thought leaders must still fill.

“Extreme weather events are no longer just natural disasters — they’re public health emergencies. From heat waves that overwhelm hospitals to floods that cut off access to care, Americans are feeling the strain in their communities,” said Derek Kilmer, Senior Vice President for U.S. Program and Policy at The Rockefeller Foundation. “That’s why The Rockefeller Foundation launched the STAT Network at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic — to strengthen public health infrastructure through interstate collaboration and cross-sector partnerships.

“Reallocating every exempted gallon is not just the right thing to do, or the smartest thing to do for the market — it’s also what the law clearly requires,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “EPA and this Administration made a promise to rural America to get the RFS back on track — reallocating any less than 100% of all the 2023-2025 SREs EPA has granted would break that promise, and farmers and rural communities would suffer because of it. We urge EPA to commit to full reallocation, and we look forward to continuing our work with the agency to increase American energy dominance through the increased use of homegrown biofuels.”

Background

Under the RFS, EPA sets the number of gallons of renewable fuels (such as biofuels) that must be blended into the nation’s total fuel supply each year. Those obligations apply to fuel producers (petroleum refiners) and importers. The law also allows EPA to grant SREs in rare circumstances when a refiner demonstrates “disproportionate economic hardship” in its efforts to comply with the RFS.

On August 22, 2025, the EPA released its decision on 175 pending SRE petitions, covering compliance years 2016-2024. In all, EPA approved a total of 140 petitions: 63 full exemptions and 77 partial (50%) exemptions.

EPA also announced that it would release a supplemental proposal to its proposed Set 2 RVO to reallocate exempt SRE gallons from 2023-2025 compliance years to the 2026 and 2027 compliance years covered by Set 2. Under this approach, refiners will be required to make up for lost gallons from those years, ensuring that SREs don’t compromise renewable fuel demand.",,N,,2025-11-03 11:09:45.209692

Career education in the skilled trades | KUNC,"Rae Solomon, www.kunc.org, rae-solomon",,,,,https://www.kunc.org/news/2025-11-03/the-latest-climate-solution-for-rural-colorado-career-education-in-the-skilled-trades,"This is the first story in a three-part series, ‘Greener Pastures,’ which explores climate workforce development in rural Colorado.
It’s part of a massive push by Colorado Mountain College to establish a local skilled trades workforce training system.
“What we hope to build with (Colorado Mountain College) is a resource here up in the mountains that (students) can still go home every night.
“We know that our rural communities are experiencing the impacts of climate change at an accelerated rate,” said Elizabeth Harbaugh, vice president of Lyra Colorado, a Northwest Colorado nonprofit in the education and climate space.
According to Harbaugh, that's why it’s important for these communities to be engaged in climate solutions, like training the emerging climate workforce.","This is the first story in a three-part series, ‘Greener Pastures,’ which explores climate workforce development in rural Colorado.

Coloradans take pride in knowing our mountain towns are little slices of paradise. But apparently, even heaven needs its industrial zones. In the town of Eagle, that's where you'll find the headquarters for R & H Mechanical, a building systems contractor serving the High Country, in a metal-sided building tucked in next to I-70.

On the upper level, service manager and instructor Josh McCarrel stood at the front of a long, narrow room that read like a cross between a classroom and a maintenance closet. Boilers, furnaces and exposed piping crowded the whiteboards and desks. But the odd design of the space suited his purpose well as a training facility for emerging HVAC technicians.

In this Level 1 HVAC course, McCarrel was lecturing about the basics of electricity.

“So, ‘AC’ stands for…. Anybody?” McCarrel prompted his class.

“Alternating current,” several students droned.

“Alternating current. Yes,” McCarrel confirmed. “’DC’ stands for…?”

“Direct Current,” the students responded.

In this simple way, McCarrel was laying the groundwork for his students to understand the complex world of heating and cooling technology. In a few months, they will turn their attention to working with heat pumps—super energy-efficient heating and cooling systems powered by electricity instead of natural gas.

Andrea Anderson, who works as a quotes administrator for R & H, was taking the class to improve her skills on the job. She planned to continue her studies through the end of the 4-unit course and expected a nice pay bump after mastering the material.

“When I started, I really knew nothing about heating and air conditioning,” Anderson said. “Over the years I’ve learned a lot. But now I just want to learn some more.”

Anderson and her classmates aren't just earning credentials and building their careers. According to Megan Christensen, the climate workforce development manager at the Colorado Energy Office, they are also becoming part of the state's big picture plan to combat climate change.

“Colorado is committed to achieving net-zero greenhouse gas emissions in the state by 2050,” Christensen told KUNC. “The state has a concrete multi-sector climate action plan to achieve this goal, which includes climate workforce development.”

In fact, Christensen said, getting more skilled tradespeople trained up is one of the top climate workforce priorities for the state of Colorado.

“In almost every single energy and climate action that our state has, the skilled trades are super essential to making sure that work gets done,” she said.

Talent in the high country

The skilled tradespeople needed for that essential climate workforce are in particularly short supply in Colorado’s High Country, and McCarrel’s HVAC Tech class is among the first major efforts to change that. It’s part of a massive push by Colorado Mountain College to establish a local skilled trades workforce training system.

“Up here in the mountains, the choice (has been) either to go to Denver or Grand Junction for a trade school,” McCarrel said. “What we hope to build with (Colorado Mountain College) is a resource here up in the mountains that (students) can still go home every night. They can maybe keep their job and get some formal training in a trade that is in high demand.”

It’s an important goal for Tim Braun, the vice president of operations at R & H Mechanical.

“Here in the mountains, it's been challenging to find new talent,” Braun said. “So, we have to grow our own.”

The company was so eager to grow their own talent that they partnered with the college to build the HVAC Tech course series McCarrel has been teaching, which provides graduates with nationally recognized credentials. Braun said he’s eager to hire technicians who have the advanced skills being taught in the classroom, like replacing gas-burning heating and cooling systems with heat pumps.

“There's been a big gap in our workforce development that we need to pick up,” Braun said. “More talent to be able to help with that transition in the future.”

Jim Jones, program director for skilled crafts and trades at Colorado Mountain College, is the force behind the school’s new, robust skilled trades program, which also includes pathways in automotive, welding, carpentry and ski area operations.

“Over the last several years, the institution has essentially grown its trades department 700%,” he told KUNC.

The trades courses have become so popular that there are now waitlists to enroll, and Jones has big plans to more than double capacity.

“We're broadening our reach for trades across the Central Rockies,” Jones said. “That's the call right now of the mountain communities. We're all looking for more tradesmen and women to take care of our mountain communities.”

The program wouldn’t just supply mountain towns with the climate workforce they desperately need. It would also supply more graduates with career paths that are lucrative and sustainable in notoriously expensive areas like Eagle Valley.

“You name the trade and there's people hiring and the pay is good,” Jones said. “From HVAC to automotive, to carpentry, to welding, all wages have gone up tremendously, just due to the fact that there's a severe shortage of workforce.”

Climate change as a rural issue

Developing a robust climate workforce is essential in Colorado’s rural areas because of the region’s high exposure to the effects of a warming climate.

“We know that our rural communities are experiencing the impacts of climate change at an accelerated rate,” said Elizabeth Harbaugh, vice president of Lyra Colorado, a Northwest Colorado nonprofit in the education and climate space. “It’s an issue that is impacting all parts of life and their economies.”

After all, Harbaugh pointed out, the state’s rural communities revolve around agriculture and outdoor recreation.

“We work with ranchers up in Northwest Colorado who can speak very openly about the lack of water and how that's changed their outputs over the past 10 years,” Harbaugh said. “Then when you talk about recreation, snowpack is a huge issue.”

The natural resources threatened by drought, excessive heat and wildfires don't just power rural economies, they define the region's culture and identity. According to Harbaugh, that's why it’s important for these communities to be engaged in climate solutions, like training the emerging climate workforce.

“Living and working in those communities means understanding the impacts that climate change is having,” she said. “Green jobs and green skills are that next frontier of understanding what it's going to take for all jobs to adapt in the face of a changing climate.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/05cd45c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3684x1934+0+342/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F59%2Fdc%2F540532744cdfab8c989e619bd1b3%2Fimg-2433-edit.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:24.157047

It is one of the cleanest and least variable forms of renewable energy available and helps people rely less on fossil fuels. Solar panels perform conversion of sunlight directly to direct current (DC) electricity. Then the direct current's conversion happens to alternating current (AC) electricity for use in homes, industry and commercial buildings. This technology has become popular due to the increasing efficiency of the panel, decreasing installation costs, and increasing government policies for clean energy.

The solar power market is witnessing strong growth due to rising global emphasis on renewable energy, climate change mitigation, and energy independence. Government initiatives such as subsidies, tax incentives, and net metering policies are encouraging solar adoption worldwide. Continuous technological advancements, including higher-efficiency solar panels and energy storage solutions, are further reducing costs and improving system performance. Additionally, corporate sustainability goals and the declining cost of solar modules are making solar energy increasingly competitive with traditional power sources. The shift toward decentralized power generation and electrification of rural areas also contributes to the rapid expansion of the global solar power market.

On Dec. 31, 2025, federal tax credits established under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are set to expire. American Home Shield breaks down what is changing and how homeowners can ensure they lock in savings before the end of the year.

What was the Inflation Reduction Act?

The IRA of 2022 was a landmark act designed to address climate change by investing in clean energy and manufacturing through tax incentives, grants, and loan programs.

Tax credits authorized by the IRA have helped everyday American households and businesses afford energy-efficient upgrades, including HVAC systems and other big-ticket items.

According to Energy Star, homeowners can claim 30% of project costs up to $2,000 for qualifying energy efficiency home improvements like heat pumps, heat pump water heaters and biomass stoves, or up to $1,200 for qualifying water heaters, furnaces, boilers, and central AC units.

What has changed?

The IRA's federal tax incentives for energy-efficient installations and upgrades were originally supposed to last until 2032, but the federal government is ending them early. The program will now expire on Dec. 31.

There is now only a limited time left for homeowners to take advantage of these tax credits.

Why is it important to act now?

Qualifying HVAC systems must be purchased and installed by Dec. 31. Documentation is key - homeowners should keep invoices or receipts with dates, contractor plans and permits. They should be able to clearly show when the work was completed and when the service was turned on so that if audited, they can prove it was finished by the end of 2025.

What are some signs an HVAC needs to be replaced?

Even the highest quality HVACs will need to be replaced at some point, making the expiring federal tax credits even more valuable to act on now.

""AC units typically last 10 to 15 years. If homeowners know their unit is getting close to that timeframe, or there are signs of decline, they should start researching replacements,"" said Micah Sherman, a virtual HVAC expert with American Home Shield.

""A few signs to look out for include strange sounds coming from the unit, hot or cold spots in the house, or refrigerant leaks. Sometimes the cost of repairing these problems warrants considering a new system altogether,"" said Sherman.

The end of the federal tax credits program is a change consumers need to be aware of, but if they act quickly, there is still time to capture savings before it expires.

The global energy sector has seen a diverse mixture of renewable energy projects commissioned over the past few years, and hydrogen has emerged as the most practical and viable form of energy that promotes the global energy transition away from fossil fuels.

Spain’s HVR is set to receive millions to integrate hydrogen into the nation’s mobility sector

As Europe embraces the renewable energy sector through a variety of projects that strengthen the energy security and independence of the region, the Official Credit Institute (ICO) of Spain has announced that it is set to allocate €7 million to Hidrógeno Verde Renovable SL (HVR) to construct a myriad of hydrogen filling stations around Spain.

This allocation falls under the framework of the European CEF-AFIF program (Connecting Europe Facility – Alternative Fuels Infrastructure Facility), which is managed by the European Commission through CINEA (European Climate, Infrastructure and Environment Executive Agency).

HVR has stated that the funds allocated by the ICO will specifically go to the ACTIVA project, which aims to strengthen the hydrogen infrastructure in Spain and promote initiatives that increase the reputation and practical usage of hydrogen in the nation.

The Trans-European Transport Network (TEN-T) aims to boost hydrogen usage in Spain and further afield.

The TEN-T aims to develop new initiatives for hydrogen in Spain and Europe. Crucially, HVR is set to construct 20 hydrogen filling facilities on existing fuel stations across the nation. This would be a cost-effective manner of integrating hydrogen into Spain’s existing mobility infrastructure. The new hydrogen filling stations will operate on an all-inclusive rental basis for specialized companies aiming to jump into the hydrogen pool.

HVR has become the cornerstone of the Spanish adoption of hydrogen in mobility

The company was formed with a singular purpose: to promote sustainable mobility through a strategically integrated hydrogen fuel system in Spain. In 2023, HVR began its long walk to hydrogen freedom when it launched its first-ever green hydrogen generation, storage, and supply plant in Madrid. This innovative project demonstrates HVR’s technical expertise and commitment to transitioning Spain’s energy sector towards hydrogen.

On top of the €7 million from the ICO, HVR has also received an additional €4.2 million from Europe to boost its plans for a hydrogen fueling system in Spain. Through the allocation of funds, the ICO has exemplified its commitment to shifting the energy sector in Spain towards the renewable energy market through pragmatic projects that align with global decarbonization goals.

Spain has big plans for the integration of hydrogen as a major energy resource

Spain is a member of the new and innovative H2Med project that aims to construct a hydrogen pipeline to foster cross-border transportation of the world’s most exciting energy resource. Enagas has reported that the H2med project is on track and making significant progress to be completed by the end of the decade.

The organization points out that the proposed regulation would consolidate the massive use of these substances instead of reducing it.

Furthermore, if approved, it would undermine the judicial precedents that established a security distance of 1000 meters.

The controversial agrochemical bill being analyzed by Congress and denounced by Greenpeace

The project currently under review by Congress was developed by the Network of Good Agricultural Practices (RedBPA), which includes more than 80 institutions from the agricultural sector.

Titled “Minimum Standards Law for the Application of Phytosanitary Products”, it is supported by UCR and Civic Coalition deputies, with backing from the agricultural sector.

According to the project’s proponents, it seeks to “harmonize criteria” and create a uniform regulatory framework for the application of agrochemicals, which Argentina currently lacks.

Despite the “good press” maintained by the agricultural sector and legislators, Greenpeace specifically denounces articles 7 and 9 of the project.

These establish exclusion zones of just 10 meters for ground and drone applications of agrochemicals, and 45 meters for aerial applications.

These values drastically contrast with the 1000 meters set by provincial courts based on official expert reports.

Thus, it would facilitate the use of substances with a proven toxic effect on organisms and ecosystems.

Greenpeace also criticizes that the proposal “does not reduce the use of agrochemicals nor plan their substitution, but rather consolidates their continuity and lowers existing protection levels“.

Additionally, the legislative project deliberately avoids the term “agrochemicals” and replaces it with “phytosanitary products”, a change Greenpeace considers political.

According to the organization, this modification attenuates the perception of risk to facilitate social approval.

Agrochemicals in Argentina: risks and judicial precedents

Greenpeace supports its denunciation with concrete data: studies detected glyphosate and atrazine in rain, air, and watercourses in Argentina.

Furthermore, research using biomarkers demonstrated genetic damage and respiratory impairment in the exposed population.

On the judicial front, municipal ordinances such as that of the Campana Municipality in Buenos Aires and rulings in Sastre and Piamonte in Santa Fe also established 1000 meters as a precautionary threshold.

If the new regulation is approved, these precedents would be undermined and jurisdictions would lose the ability to apply the precautionary principle.

Since 2011, Greenpeace has maintained its criticism of the Argentine agricultural model and the use of agrochemicals.

Its report “Glyphosate: a toxic strategy” indicates that the massive use of these products generates environmental pollution.

Additionally, it consolidates agriculture dependent on chemical inputs and transgenic seeds.

In turn, the expansion of monoculture in recent decades also has other consequences:

Loss of biodiversity;

soil degradation;

water pollution, and;

displacement of rural communities.

A worrying context: more freedom for agrochemicals

The legislative context coincides with governmental decisions that concern the organization.

For example, the Government recently freed up agrochemical imports.

It also reduced tariffs for their entry, lowering the cost of imported chemicals without introducing compensatory health or environmental criteria.

Greenpeace also questions the official discourse of “productivity” and “food security”.

According to the organization, Argentina does not use agrochemicals to produce food and supply its population, but to sustain the profits of exporting companies.

In this vein, the NGO recalls that the legislative process occurs while Atanor —one of the main local manufacturers of glyphosate— accumulates complaints for illegal discharges and environmental non-compliance.

In 2024, the company even suffered an explosion at its San Nicolás plant, highlighting failures in the national regulatory system.

Greenpeace’s proposal against agrochemicals

The organization demands the initiation of a process of progressive reduction and phase-out of the massive use of agrochemicals.

It proposes moving towards agroecological systems that prioritize health, biodiversity, and food sovereignty.

“The challenge is not to strengthen the legal framework of the agrochemical business, but to ensure the protection of people, water, and the environment“, concludes the Greenpeace document.",https://storage.googleapis.com/media-cloud-na/2025/02/aplicaciones-aereas-de-agroquimicos.webp,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:45.594347

These developments reflect that big climate mandates are costly, and it is challenging to reach international climate mitigation agreements in the existing fragmented geopolitical landscape – let alone implement them.

The next few years are likely to see more incremental and piecemeal climate policies and targets at the national and sub-national levels instead of big and ambitious climate regulations.

Introduction

The world is seeing a shift away from ambitious climate mandates and goals. The Paris Agreement’s implementation is losing momentum, the United Nation’s (UN) global shipping carbon tax has stalled, major economies are softening their electric vehicle mandates, and some of the world’s leading climate philanthropists are changing strategies.

These developments reflect that big climate mandates are costly, and it is challenging to reach an international climate mitigation agreement in the existing fragmented geopolitical landscape – let alone implement them.

The next few years are likely to see more incremental and piecemeal climate policies and targets at the national and sub-national levels instead of big and ambitious climate regulations.

This insight provides an overview of the significant recent developments in international climate policy and what they likely portend for such policies in the near future.

Recent Major Developments in Climate Policy

The Paris Agreement has lost momentum

A new UN report shows countries have made very limited progress toward the climate goals in the Paris Agreement—an international treaty adopted in 2015 by 195 jurisdictions aimed to limit global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels by the end of the century.

Under the agreement, countries are expected to submit their updated climate action plans every five years—the idea is to have more ambitious plans over time. Yet a decade after the adoption of the agreement, only 64 countries, about one third of the total countries, submitted their climate plans. The UN report acknowledges that the report itself is “limited in scope” and that “it is not possible to draw wide-ranging global-level conclusions or inferences from this limited data set.”

The report projects that if the 64 countries implement their plans successfully, their emissions would decline by 17 percent by 2035 compared to the 2019 level, which is significantly short of the 37 percent required to meet the goals in the Paris Agreement. Notably, the 64 new climate plans include one submitted by the Biden Administration but that will not be implemented by the Trump Administration.

Global shipping carbon tax stalled

Last month, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) failed to officially adopt the global carbon tax on shipping emissions which was agreed upon in a meeting in April this year. Instead, IMO decided to delay the decision on whether to adopt the policy by a year.

American Action Forum’s (AAF) previous analysis provided a detailed overview of the policy—a fuel standard and a two-tiered carbon tax, as well as awarded and transferable tax credits that can be carried forward.

This setback in the global shipping carbon tax was not a surprise, as the Trump Administration doubled down its opposition to the policy by releasing a statement through the Department of State the week before the October IMO meeting, threatening to retaliate against countries that support the policy with a variety of actions including imposing port fees, sanctions on officials, and investigating into potential anti-competitive practices.

Major economies soften targets on EVs

In the United States, the 2025 One Big Beautiful Bill Act repealed all the electric vehicles (EV)-related tax credits established in the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). As of the end of September 2025, all EV tax credits included in the IRA have expired. AAF’s previous analysis concludes that this is an improvement to the IRA’s energy provisions as the EV tax credits are complex, inefficient, and costly.

Other major economies have followed the United States’ lead in rolling back policy support for EVs. Canada recently paused its 2026 EV sales mandate, which would have required 20 percent of new car sales to be EVs. The United Kingdom has maintained its 2030 Zero Emissions Vehicle mandate but has updated it to allow car manufacturers more flexibility to comply with the mandate. The European Union is under tremendous pressure to revise its 2035 EV mandate, with Germany and Italy recently jointly calling for easing the mandate.

Climate philanthropists change strategies

Bill Gates, a major advocate and donor for addressing climate change, recently published a letter calling for a new strategy to tackle climate issues. In the letter, Gates criticized the “doomsday view” of climate change—he believes that climate change will not lead to the end of civilization as some climate advocates have claimed. While emphasizing that climate change is a serious problem, Gates argues that it is imperative not to over-allocate resources to climate issues at the expense of funding for economic development and public health. For context, Gates has spent billions of dollars on climate-related projects including public policy, technology innovation, and climate adaptation. In March 2025, Breakthrough Energy, an organization funded by Gates to address climate issues, made significant budget cuts mostly driven by the Trump Administration’s shift away from decarbonization goals and policies.

Gates is not the only philanthropist that has cut back funding for climate issues. The Children’s Investment Fund Foundation, a London-based foundation, has decided to pause providing funding to U.S. non-profit organizations for climate issues due to the uncertainties in the Trump Administration’s treatment of the tax-exempt status of non-profit organizations.

What Are the Takeaways?

Massive mandates distort the market significantly and make it costly for both businesses and consumers to decarbonize. Arbitrary command-and-control emissions regulations such as the EV mandates are inefficient because they do not allow businesses to reduce emissions at the lowest cost compared to alternative policies such as a carbon tax. Additionally, regulators do not have all the information on the latest technological development, which makes it difficult to update the mandates to respond to technological changes.

Adopting an international agreement on climate mitigation in the existing fragmented geopolitical landscape is difficult. IMO’s decision to delay its vote on whether to officially adopt a global shipping carbon tax indicates how challenging it is. Individual countries’ considerations of domestic economic and political priorities affect their calculations on whether to join the international agreement. The timing of the IMO vote makes it especially tough, given the uncertainties from the Trump Administration’s sweeping tariffs on the rest of the world and concerns of retaliation from the United States.

Conclusion

It is difficult enough for a large number of countries to commit to a uniform climate target. But even if an agreement is reached, there is still much work to be done on design, implementation, and enforcement—as is clearly evidenced by the limited progress on the Paris Agreement a decade after its adoption.

The OPEC Fund has already contributed nearly US$300 million in financing to those projects, helping governments diversify energy supply and increase reliability while cutting costs and emissions.

The new framework allows both organizations to scale investment through co-financing structures and innovative funding mechanisms. By leveraging concessional finance from the OPEC Fund alongside ACWA Power’s project development expertise, the partnership is expected to unlock greater private-sector participation in countries facing constrained access to climate finance.

For developing economies under rising fiscal and climate pressures, such blended models are increasingly seen as key to bridging infrastructure financing gaps and achieving the UN Sustainable Development Goals.

Integrating Energy and Water Strategies

The agreement aligns with the OPEC Fund’s Green–Blue Connect initiative, which promotes cross-sectoral investment linking renewable energy and water security. By combining clean power with desalination and hydrogen production, both institutions aim to address interconnected challenges — energy demand, resource scarcity, and climate adaptation — within a single development framework.

ACWA Power, one of the Middle East’s leading energy developers, operates in more than a dozen countries and is targeting a tripling of its renewable energy capacity by 2030. It is also expanding its desalination and green hydrogen portfolio, including large-scale projects in Saudi Arabia’s NEOM region and Central Asia.

For the OPEC Fund, headquartered in Vienna with 12 member countries, the partnership supports its strategy to channel capital into climate-aligned infrastructure and strengthen the resilience of low- and middle-income nations.

Global and Regional Implications

The renewed collaboration comes as multilateral lenders and private developers face growing pressure to accelerate the clean energy transition in developing regions. Access to affordable capital remains a critical barrier, particularly for projects involving emerging technologies such as green hydrogen.

By formalizing a long-term framework, the OPEC Fund and ACWA Power are positioning themselves to drive a pipeline of projects that can attract further institutional investment. For policymakers, the model reinforces the importance of aligning public and private finance within credible transition pathways that balance energy security, affordability, and decarbonization.

As both entities expand their reach, the partnership reflects a broader strategic shift: using regional alliances to mobilize climate finance and build local capacity. In an era when energy and water challenges increasingly define economic resilience, such collaborations are set to play an outsized role in shaping the sustainable growth trajectories of emerging markets.",https://esgnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/OPEC-Fund-ACWA-Power-Sign-450M-Agreement-to-Accelerate-Clean-Energy-and-Water-Transition.jpeg,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:07.028923
,North Carolina Environment,2025-11-03 14:13:40+00:00,News From The States,Forest Service restarts effort to change decades-old Pacific Northwest forest policy,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/forest-service-restarts-effort-change-decades-old-pacific-northwest-forest-policy,"The Forest Service has been working on a Northwest Forest Plan amendment for a few years, holding dozens of outreach meetings with tribes, an advisory committee and the general public.
The agency published its proposed changes in a draft environmental impact statement in November 2024 and received over 3,400 public comments.
They’ve been calling on President Donald Trump for a complete overhaul of the Northwest Forest Plan.
“The Northwest Forest Plan is failing our communities and our environment,” said Matt Hill, executive director of the Douglas Timber Operators, in a March press release.
Initial efforts to amend the Northwest Forest Plan focused on getting input from tribes on how the federal government should manage their ancestral lands.","A yearslong endeavor to change logging and environmental policies for millions of acres of Pacific Northwest forests is getting a restart.

The U.S. Forest Service is going back to the drawing board with an update to the Northwest Forest Plan, a set of policies that broadly dictates where logging can occur on 25 million acres of forests in Oregon, Washington and northwest California. It came out of the timber wars of the 1980s and ‘90s.

Environmental groups worry new changes that could be made to this plan under the Trump administration will increase logging in mature and old-growth forests, potentially harming wildlife species that are already on the brink of extinction, including the spotted owl.

The Forest Service has been working on a Northwest Forest Plan amendment for a few years, holding dozens of outreach meetings with tribes, an advisory committee and the general public. The agency published its proposed changes in a draft environmental impact statement in November 2024 and received over 3,400 public comments.

Now the Forest Service under the Trump administration wants to issue a new draft.

Timber industry groups largely welcome restarting this Biden-era initiative. They’ve been calling on President Donald Trump for a complete overhaul of the Northwest Forest Plan.

“The Northwest Forest Plan is failing our communities and our environment,” said Matt Hill, executive director of the Douglas Timber Operators, in a March press release. “It’s time for a bold revision that prioritizes dynamic forest management and sustainable timber production.”

Agency officials say they are working on a “revised draft environmental impact statement.” No such term exists in national environmental policy.

In an emailed statement to OPB, an unnamed Forest Service spokesperson said the agency will publish a new draft amendment next fall, and that the Forest Service will allow people to review the draft and weigh in during a 90-day public comment period.

The spokesperson provided few details about what could be in the new draft. They said it will “consider additional or refined definitions of forest types to reflect ecological diversity, clarify commercial timber opportunities, analyze potential refinements to Survey and Manage, and make other updates based on the comments we’ve received.”

“Survey and manage” is a set of standards outlined in the current Northwest Forest Plan. It requires land managers to survey forest areas ahead of projects that could harm the environment, like logging or prescribed fires, in search of rare or vulnerable species. It’s a time-consuming process that often slows logging and prescribed fire projects.

Under the Biden administration, the Forest Service had proposed limiting the survey and manage program near residential areas to facilitate prescribed burns. Environmental groups worry a new draft out of the Trump administration could limit survey and manage efforts in mature and old-growth forests, harming vulnerable species.

“By targeting programs like Survey and Manage — which safeguard rare species before logging occurs— and emphasizing ‘commercial timber opportunities,’ the administration is advancing the timber industry’s agenda to expand logging — including clearcutting — on public lands,” Oregon Wild conservation director Steve Pedery said in an emailed statement.

Initial efforts to amend the Northwest Forest Plan focused on getting input from tribes on how the federal government should manage their ancestral lands. Forest Service officials created an advisory committee made up of multiple tribal representatives, as well as people representing environmental and timber interests, to guide its policies. They also held forums with tribes to gather input ahead of drafting proposed changes.

“It was a tribal-centric effort,” said Ryan Reed, a former advisory committee representative and a member of the Hoopa Valley Tribe in Northern California. “That was the headliner of our work. It’s disheartening that they felt that wasn’t enough.”

Another former committee member who represents timber interests said he remains optimistic about this new process.

“We look forward to working with the Forest Service to improve the way we steward our federal forests in the Northwest to improve forest health, help reduce the impacts of catastrophic wildfires, protect communities, improve public access and recreation, and help sustain our world class forest products infrastructure,” said Travis Joseph, president of the American Forest Resource Council, a timber industry association.

In an emailed statement, U.S. Sen. Ron Wyden, a Democrat from Oregon, said he is working on legislation that would create environmental protections for old growth in the Pacific Northwest.

“The best way to address the needs of special places in the Pacific Northwest is to build coalitions of people who are for smart resource management in — and with — the communities directly affected, not from 3,000 miles away in Washington DC,” Wyden said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/heathermeadows1762178693.jpeg?h=4bf1c8f5&itok=0PNK9kG0,N,,2025-11-03 11:11:39.159633

If the definition of a “sound” business decision is challenged in a judicial context, this legislation allows more complex litigation to be tried in the Texas business courts system.
How has the tariff climate in 2025 affected the state’s business climate?
What are some business climate challenges you plan to address going forward?
The recognition of Texas’ business climate is not something that happens in a vacuum.","The eighth-largest economy in the world has the best business climate in the U.S. Texas has once again emerged as the state most likely to succeed when it comes to attracting capital investment from the private sector. That’s because from the governor’s office in Austin to economic development offices in communities large and small across the Lone Star State, those charged with marketing Texas know they have an easy sell — no corporate tax, sensible business regulations, business-dedicated courts, unbeatable logistics infrastructure and a huge labor force, among other factors. Their challenge is to keep it that way.

North Carolina finishes in second place by a mere single point, followed by Georgia. Virginia and Florida complete the top five states.

Rounding out the top five most important criteria for business executives from a list of options are ease of permitting and regulatory procedures, transportation infrastructure, workforce skills and quality of life. Survey respondents were asked to provide comments about what’s most on their minds as they consider state business climates they’re familiar with. Following are sample responses:

“Ease of process; expertise of state and local representatives in supporting economic development projects; location quality; workforce; thriving economy with growth sectors; port, transportation and incentives.”

“Customer demand, power availability and a potential workforce that can be leveraged.”

“Tax structure: The most significant advantage is its tax policy. Texas has no corporate income tax and no personal income tax. This provides a direct and substantial financial benefit, allowing companies to reinvest more of their earnings into their operations and expansion.”

“Large and growing workforce: The state boasts a large, diverse, and rapidly growing labor pool. This continuous influx of talent provides companies with the human capital they need to scale their operations effectively.”

“Business-friendly regulatory environment: Texas has a well-established reputation for having a predictable and streamlined regulatory framework. This reduces bureaucratic hurdles and makes it easier for businesses to operate and expand without unnecessary delays or costs.”

“Workforce, site readiness and availability of energy, infrastructure assets, pro-business tax and regulatory policies.”

“Pro-business climate, reasonable tax policies, speed to market, variety of ready sites.”

A recent addition to the Business Climate Ranking methodology is where the Inc. 5000 companies — the fastest-growing private companies in America — are located. Fast-growing companies can’t grow quickly where they will be burdened by over-reaching regulations, uncooperative state and local agencies or taxation schemes that stymie growth. The methodology recognizes states for total Inc. 5000 companies resident and the number located in-state per capita. See the charts on the following pages.

Since becoming the 48th governor of Texas in 2015, Greg Abbott has worked tirelessly to make his state companies’ first choice when considering locations for new or expanding facilities. It’s working. Having won Site Selection’s Governor’s Cup for total capital investment projects for the 13th consecutive year earlier in 2025, the governor and his economic development team, and economic development professionals throughout the state, once again can remind investors that Texas has the best business climate in the nation.

In the following interview, Gov. Abbott explains how Texas continues to outshine the rest of the country in keeping the state front and center on the radars of corporate site selectors.

In September, you named a director of the new Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office. What are the areas this office is charged with addressing?

Gov. Greg Abbott: Here in Texas, we operate at the speed of business, and the new Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office (TREO) will ensure we continue to foster economic opportunity and protect individual liberty. Earlier this year, I signed Senate Bill 14 into law establishing TREO, which is charged with reducing regulatory burdens, eliminating unnecessary rules and promoting economic growth by making Texas even more business friendly. By cutting red tape and rooting out unnecessary regulations, we will make ​state government more responsive and more efficient to serve the people and job creators of Texas.

What are some specific outcomes you are looking for it to achieve?

Abbott: TREO will work to increase transparency for Texas taxpayers and ensure that Texas remains the best place to start and run a business in the country. TREO will follow the work started by my Small Business Freedom Council that I launched in 2024 to review government efficiency for Texas businesses.

The office will review state agency rules and procedures and coordinate with an advisory panel of experts and stakeholders to solicit input from Texans and members of the community. TREO will help state agencies identify and cut unnecessary or ineffective rules, determine the regulatory costs placed on Texans, and issue best-practice guidelines for how state agencies adopt new rules and perform required analyses such as cost and employment impact statements.

Senate Bill 29 addresses business climate head on. It provides business decision-makers the certainty that sound business judgments made in the best interest of shareholders will not be second-guessed by courts. Is this an issue potential capital investors raised with you or the Office of Economic Development?

Abbott: Here in Texas, we have experienced unprecedented economic development success over the past decade, but we cannot become complacent. To remain the economic envy of America, we must continue to improve our leading business climate. That’s why I signed Senate Bill 29 into law to provide business decision-makers the certainty that sound business judgments made in the best interest of shareholders will not be second-guessed by courts.

Business decisions are to be made by the elected officers and shareholders, not by unelected judges. The new law codifies the business judgment rule and reforms derivative claims processes. It also creates a mechanism to pre-assess corporate director independence. This will help attract even more corporate registrations and relocations to our state while solidifying Texas as a premier global business destination.

Are there likely to be challenges about how “sound” is defined?

Abbott: This year, I also signed House Bill 40 into law to expand the jurisdiction of Texas business courts and the types of cases they can hear. After years serving as a Texas Supreme Court Justice and Attorney General of Texas, this new law will allow for the Texas judicial system to move more efficiently for businesses. If the definition of a “sound” business decision is challenged in a judicial context, this legislation allows more complex litigation to be tried in the Texas business courts system.

At the Waco State of the State luncheon in early September, you mentioned the 89th Legislative Session cut red tape and fortified Texas’ electric grid. What are some examples of red tape that was cut?

Abbott: In addition to signing the Texas Regulatory Efficiency Office into law, we also streamlined regulations and expanded opportunities for small businesses in Texas.

In June, I signed numerous laws to support Texas’ small business owners and workers and accelerate the process for starting a business by cutting unnecessary government regulations. These laws build upon the progress of my Small Business Freedom Council, which I launched in 2024, to review government efficiency for Texas businesses. I also directed state agencies to provide recommendations to cut unnecessary government regulations that hamper small business formation, operation or growth.

In terms of the electric grid, much is being made lately of rapidly increasing demand for electricity driven by so many new data centers and energy-intensive industrial products (semiconductors and EV plants) coming online. What should readers know about how Texas is addressing this?

Abbott: Texas is the energy capital of the world. We produce more energy and more electricity than any other state in the nation. As more people choose to raise their families and build their businesses in Texas, we continue to add more dispatchable power to our state power grid and make strategic investments in critical infrastructure. In fact, Texas voters approved $5 billion for the Texas Energy Fund for low-interest loans to support the construction of new dispatchable generation.

Earlier this year I signed into law Senate Bill 6 to help make transmission planning and approval even more efficient in Texas. The Public Utility Commission of Texas recently approved the state’s first 765-kilovolt transmission lines in West Texas, supporting the growing electricity needs of the region and the state.

Additionally, the weatherization requirements for critical grid and natural gas infrastructure that I signed into law have proven effective. Working together with innovators in tech and energy, we continue to add more reliable power to the grid to ensure every Texas home and every Texas business has the power needed to thrive.

How has the tariff climate in 2025 affected the state’s business climate?

Abbott: Texas stands ready to help companies navigate this global trade transition. We are working to help identify any opportunities to ensure that companies doing business here succeed globally.

As the number one exporter in the nation for the last 23 years in a row, Texas is strategically positioned to lead. Thanks to our central geographic location and state-of-the-art infrastructure, we are the gateway to global trade for the entire nation.

Our business-friendly climate is steadfast, and we are here as long-term partners for success to help companies revaluate and pivot during this new era of global trade. Texas is an economic development powerhouse, and we welcome new jobs and manufacturing from global businesses looking to expand or relocate their operations.

Dallas is quickly becoming a financial services hub, particularly where securities exchanges are concerned. Why has this sector seen so much activity lately?

Abbott: Home to the new “Y’all Street,” Texas is now the financial capital of America. In fact, Texas has the largest financial services workforce in the nation, even surpassing New York.

With the historic announcement of the Texas Stock Exchange in 2024 and the selection of Texas as the location for Nasdaq’s new regional headquarters in 2025, our state also recently celebrated the launch of NYSE Texas, a fully electronic equities exchange headquartered in Dallas.

With plenty of room to grow, many financial services companies are choosing to invest in Texas. Finance and insurance firms announced more than $137 million in new capital investment in Texas last year alone.

In 2021, Fortune 500 firm Charles Schwab relocated its headquarters from California to the North Texas city of Westlake to take advantage of lower costs and a business-friendly environment. Additionally, JPMorgan Chase has more employees in Texas than in New York.

Recently, Scotiabank, one of the largest banks in North America, announced a new major office in Dallas, creating more than 1,020 new jobs and more than $60 million in capital investment. Texas’ strength in financial services will only continue to grow as we expand our leadership in financial technology, data centers, AI, cybersecurity and more.

What are some business climate challenges you plan to address going forward?

Abbott: Here in Texas, we partner with our businesses. Because when businesses succeed, all Texans succeed.

With the eighth-largest economy in the world at more than $2.7 trillion, Texas is a beacon of freedom and opportunity that draws people and businesses from all over the world to our great state. We will continue to make strategic investments and partner with businesses to ensure that Texas remains the Best State for Business in the nation — a title we have held for the last 21 years in a row.

The recognition of Texas’ business climate is not something that happens in a vacuum. It takes the work of our state leadership and elected officials to ensure regulations continue to support the business-friendly climate that we are so proud of.",https://siteselection.com/media/Favicon-100x100.png,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:54.055203

ACTON, Mass., Nov. 3, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Distributed Energy Infrastructure (DEI), a leading EPC provider for utility-scale solar and storage projects, announces the completion of a new 7.1 MW solar + 4 MW battery storage project located in Acton, Massachusetts. Formerly occupied by a chemical manufacturing facility, the project site was previously designated an EPC Superfund site due to significantly contaminated soil, including asbestos.

The innovative approach used by DEI and its project partners, owner Syncarpha Capital and racking provider Terrasmart, led Solar Builder to name this project a finalist in the publication's competitive Project of the Year 2025 Award for 1-10 MW projects. To construct safely on the site, DEI implemented strict environmental and health safeguards:

Crews trained in Hazwoper hazardous materials handling followed specialized health and safety protocols.

Excavation was minimized, with electrical infrastructure designed primarily aboveground to avoid disturbing contaminated soils.

The system was designed around existing structures, including old concrete slabs, to reduce site disturbance.

DEI coordinated with six regulatory agencies and established contingency plans to address any hazardous material discoveries.

When asbestos was discovered, certified specialists were brought in to analyze, document, and remove all hazardous material under regulatory oversight.

""Projects like Acton show what it takes to responsibly bring clean energy to communities while addressing the challenges of building on historically contaminated land,"" said Sean Harrington, President and CEO of Distributed Energy Infrastructure. ""By transforming a brownfield into a productive solar and storage site, we're expanding access to renewable energy, strengthening the local grid, and putting otherwise unusable land back to work.""

As a brownfield project located on formerly unusable land, the Acton project delivers significant community and environmental benefits. It repurposes a contaminated Superfund site for productive use, preserves farmland and open space, and created nearly 40 local jobs during construction. The project provides clean energy through a community solar model paired with battery storage, boosting local grid resilience. It also expands the town's tax base through new revenue and supports Massachusetts' SMART and Clean Peak Standard goals, since it reduces strain on the grid during peak seasonal demand times.

""Brownfield redevelopment is a powerful way to expand clean energy access while addressing the legacy of industrial contamination,"" said Graeme Dutkowsky of Syncarpha Capital. ""This project demonstrates how DEI's thoughtful, safety-first approach to building brownfield solar projects can turn an underutilized site into a long-term source of reliable power and local economic value.""

Canada Nickel Company Inc. (""Canada Nickel"" or the ""Company"") (TSXV: CNC) (OTCQB: CNIKF) is pleased to announce an in-situ carbon sequestration pilot study at its flagship Crawford Nickel Project (""Crawford""), near Timmins, Ontario. The pilot is being conducted in collaboration with the U.S. DOE ARPA-E team, led by the University of Texas at Austin.

The pilot program follows bench-scale studies conducted by the ARPA team under the direction of Dr. Estibalitz Ukar, Research Associate Professor at the University of Texas at Austin.

Mark Selby, CEO of Canada Nickel said, ""We have been very pleased to work with Dr. Ukar and her team at the University of Texas at Austin as they developed a novel carbon sequestration approach to store large volumes of CO2 and create the potential, by pre-carbonating material before it is mined, to both reduce the costs and to improve the value from processing the material. We look forward to the results from this next stage of testing in a real-world field trial.""

Dr. Ukar, said, ""Canada Nickel has been an exceptional partner in this work, providing site access, geological data, and active collaboration. Their support of this pilot exemplifies their commitment to responsible mineral development, scientific innovation, and climate action. By advancing novel methods for permanent CO2 storage and supporting technologies that can scale globally, Canada Nickel is helping chart a sustainable path forward for the mining sector.""

Bench-scale studies of the Crawford ultramafic rocks have demonstrated that the magnesium-rich mineral brucite captures CO2 by transforming into secondary minerals such as magnesite and nesquehonite. Building on these findings, the month-long pilot will inject carbon-enriched water sourced from the Crawford site into a 400 metre-deep well within the ultramafic body to evaluate large-scale carbon capture under natural conditions.

The CO2-to-rock mineralizing process is anticipated to begin within hours of the injection, with most of the CO2 turning into solid rock within six months. The pilot will use various monitoring techniques, including groundwater sampling, seismic sensors, gas detectors, and satellite-based surface tracking.

This initiative is independent of Canada Nickel's In-Process Tailings (IPT) Carbonation Program and represents a key step in expanding the Company's carbon capture and storage capabilities.

Soybean and wheat futures were higher in overnight trading after the White House released details of the U.S.-China trade agreement struck last week.

China has agreed to remove all retaliatory non-tariff countermeasures taken against the U.S. since March 4, the White House said in a statement released on Saturday.

The Asian nation will purchase at least 12 million metric tons of U.S. soybeans in the last two months of 2025 and at least 25 million tons of beans in each of the following three years, the statement said.

Beijing will also suspend implementation of export controls on rare-earth materials, issue licenses for exports of rare earths and other materials to the benefit of the U.S., and take measures to stem the flow of fentanyl, the White House said.

The U.S. will lower tariffs imposed to stem the flow of fentanyl to 10% from 20%, extend the expiration of certain tariff inclusions by a year to Nov. 10, 2026, and suspend for a year investigations into the Asian country for attempting to dominate the shipbuilding industry.

China is looking to purchase wheat from the U.S. for the first time in more than a year, according to a Bloomberg report.

Soybean futures for November delivery rose 3¾¢ to $11.19 a bushel overnight on the Chicago Board of Trade. Soy meal was down $1.30 to $320.30 a short ton and soybean oil futures lost 0.13¢ to 48.55¢ a pound.

Corn futures for December delivery were at $4.28¼ a bushel.

2. EPA Need to Reallocate Refinery Waivers, NCGA Says

The Environmental Protection Agency should reallocate all of its small-refiner waivers via a supplemental rule-making process, the National Corn Growers Association said in a statement.

Doing so would ensure ""a strong, transparent, and balanced"" Renewable Fuels Standard, the association said.

EPA sets the blending volume for the RFS annually and has the authority to issue exemptions for small refineries that are able to show ""disproportionate economic harm"" from meeting the blending volumes.

""NCGA has long argued that a dependable Renewable Fuel Standard is critical to unlocking America's domestic energy potential, promoting ethanol growth, and driving corn demand,"" the group said in its statement.

Corn growers said in a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin that they appreciate EPA's proposal to require 15 billion gallons to be blended into fuels in 2026 and 2027, but actions by the agency show how complicated it is to balance refiners' needs with the integrity of the RFS.

""NCGA urges the agency to finalize the implied conventional renewable fuel requirement at 15 billion gallons for both 2026 and 2027, as proposed, and to manage SREs (small-refinery exemptions) in a way that upholds the market integrity and promotes growth for this essential market,"" the association said in its letter.

3. Dry Weather Forecast for Minnesota, Wisconsin

Dry weather is expected in parts of Minnesota and Wisconsin this afternoon that could increase the risk of wildfires, according to the National Weather Service.

Winds from central Minnesota into western Wisconsin will be sustained from 10–15 mph and gust up to 30 mph, the agency said.

Relative humidity will fall to 25%.

""The combination of breeze winds and dry conditions will create elevated fire weather conditions today,"" NWS said. ""These conditions will work together to support elevated potential for rapid fire spread.""

The update was related by industry sources and initially reported by South Korean news outlets.

ESS batteries to be built at Samsung’s Indiana plant

As noted in a report from Korea JoongAng Daily, the demand for energy storage systems has been growing rapidly in North America, thanks in no small part to the surge in AI investments across numerous companies. With this in mind, Tesla has reportedly approached Samsung SDI about a potential battery supply deal.

The deal is reportedly worth over 3 trillion Korean won (approximately $2.11 billion) and will span three years, according to The Korea Global Economic Daily. A battery supply deal with Samsung SDI could make sense for Tesla as the company already has a grid-scale battery, the Megapack, which is perfect for industrial use. Samsung SDI could simply supply cells for the EV maker.

Production of the batteries would reportedly take place at Samsung SDI’s joint venture factory with Stellantis in Indiana, which is currently under construction. Samsung SDI recently announced plans to use part of that plant’s EV lines to produce cells for ESS, with a targeted capacity of 30 GWh by the end of next year.

Tesla and Samsung’s partnership

At present, only a handful of manufacturers, including Korea’s LG Energy Solution, Samsung SDI, SK On, and Japan’s Panasonic, are capable of producing energy storage-scale batteries domestically in the United States. A Samsung SDI official issued a comment about the matter, stating, “Nothing has been finalized regarding cooperation with Tesla.”

The possible energy storage system deal adds another layer to Tesla’s growing collaboration with Samsung, which is already in line as a partner in the upcoming production of Tesla’s AI5 and AI6 chips. Early sample manufacturing of the AI6 is expected to begin in South Korea, with mass production slated for Samsung’s Texas-based Taylor foundry when it starts operations.

The AI6 chip will power Tesla’s next wave of high-volume projects, including the Optimus humanoid robot and the autonomous Cybercab service. Musk has called the partnership with Samsung a “real collaboration,” adding that he personally plans to “walk the line” at the Taylor facility to speed up progress.

Tesla’s long-awaited and way underrated Solar Roof may finally be getting its moment. During the company’s Q3 2025 earnings call, Vice President of Energy Engineering Michael Snyder revealed that production of a new residential solar panel has started at Tesla’s Buffalo, New York facility, with shipments to customers beginning in the first quarter of 2026.

The comments hint at possible renewed life for the Solar Roof program, which has seen years of slow growth since its 2016 unveiling.

Tesla Energy’s strong demand

Responding to an investor question about Tesla’s energy backlog, Snyder said demand for Megapack and Powerwall continues to be “really strong” into next year. He also noted positive customer feedback for the company’s new Megablock product, which is expected to start shipping from Houston in 2026.

“We’re seeing remarkable growth in the demand for AI and data center applications as hyperscalers and utilities have seen the versatility of the Megapack product. It increases reliability and relieves grid constraints,” he said.

Snyder also highlighted a “surge in residential solar demand in the US,” attributing the spike to recent policy changes that incentivize home installations. Tesla expects this trend to continue into 2026, helped by the rollout of a new solar lease product that makes adoption more affordable for homeowners.

Possible Solar Roof revival?

Perhaps the most intriguing part of Snyder’s remarks, however, was Tesla’s move to begin production of its “residential solar panel” in Buffalo, New York. He described the new panels as having “industry-leading aesthetics” and shape performance, language Tesla has used to market its Solar Roof tiles in the past.

“We also began production of our Tesla residential solar panel in our Buffalo factory, and we will be shipping that to customers starting Q1. The panel has industry-leading aesthetics and shape performance and demonstrates our continued commitment to US manufacturing,” Snyder said during the Q3 2025 earnings call.

Snyder did not explicitly name the product, though his reference to aesthetics has fueled speculation that Tesla may finally be preparing a large-scale and serious rollout of its Solar Roof line.

Originally unveiled in 2016, the Solar Roof was intended to transform rooftops into clean energy generators without compromising on design. However, despite early enthusiasm, production and installation volumes have remained limited for years. In 2023, a report from Wood Mackenzie claimed that there were only 3,000 operational Solar Roof installations across the United States at the time, far below forecasts. In response, the official Tesla Energy account on X stated that the report was “incorrect by a large margin.”

Reports from China have indicated that the Tesla Shanghai Megafactory has become a notable player in China’s booming battery export market.

Located in the Lingang New Area of the Shanghai Free Trade Zone, the Tesla Megafactory has been running at full throttle since opening in February. It produces Tesla Megapack batteries for domestic and international use.

Tesla Shanghai Megafactory

As noted in a report from Sina Finance, the Tesla Shanghai Megafactory’s output of Megapack batteries helped drive a notable rise in lithium battery shipments from the city in the first three quarters of 2025. This is quite impressive as the Megafactory is a rather young facility, though it has been steadily increasing its production capacity.

“The establishment of this benchmark factory has not only driven the rapid development of Shanghai’s energy storage industry but also become a new growth engine for foreign trade exports. Driven by the Tesla energy storage factory’s opening, Shanghai’s lithium battery exports reached 32.15 billion yuan ($4.5 billion) in the first three quarters, a 20.7% increase,” the publication wrote.

Ultimately, the Shanghai Megafactory has proved helpful to the city’s “new three” industries, which are comprised of new energy vehicles, lithium batteries, and photovoltaic systems. Exports of the “new three” products reached 112.17 billion yuan ($15.7 billion), a 6.3% year-over-year increase during the same period. The city’s total trade volume grew 5.4% year-over-year as well, with exports up 11.3%, driven largely by the clean energy sector’s performance.

Energy storage is helping Shanghai

Since opening in February, the Shanghai Megafactory has been firing on all cylinders. In late July, Tesla Energy announced that the new battery factory has successfully produced its 1,000th Megapack unit. That’s quite impressive for a facility that, at the time, had only been operational for less than six months.

Speed has always been a trademark of the Shanghai Megafactory. Similar to Tesla’s other key facilities in China, the Megafactory was constructed quickly. The facility started its construction on May 23, 2024. Less than a year later, the site officially started producing Megapack batteries. By late March 2025, Tesla China noted that it had shipped the first batch of Megapack batteries from the Shanghai plant to foreign markets.

Tesla will recall Powerwall 2 units in Australia after a handful of property owners reported fires that caused “minor property damage.” The fires were attributed to cells used by Tesla in the Powerwall 2.

Tesla Powerwall is a battery storage unit that retains energy from solar panels and is used by homeowners and businesses to maintain power in the event of an outage. It also helps alleviate the need to rely on the grid, which can help stabilize power locally.

Powerwall owners can also enroll in the Virtual Power Plant (VPP) program, which allows them to sell energy back to the grid, helping to reduce energy bills. Tesla revealed last year that over 100,000 Powerwalls were participating in the program.

Tesla announces 100k Powerwalls are participating in Virtual Power Plants

The Australia Competition and Consumer Commission said in a filing that it received several reports from owners of fires that led to minor damage. The Australian government agency did not disclose the number of units impacted by the recall.

The issue is related to the cells, which Tesla sources from a third-party company.

Anyone whose Powerwall 2 unit is impacted by the recall will be notified through the Tesla app, the company said.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/08/tesla-megapack-texas-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 10:05:26.799286

CTR's planned U.S. listing is aligned with the company's strategy to advance renewable energy and critical minerals production in the U.S.

IMPERIAL COUNTY, CA, UNITED STATES, November 3, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Controlled Thermal Resources Holdings Inc. (CTR) today announced that its Board of Directors has approved the formation and planned U.S. public listing of CTR’s subsidiary, American Critical Resources (ACR), which is expected to be publicly traded on either NASDAQ or NYSE in mid-2026.

The planned public listing marks a major milestone in CTR’s long-term strategy to advance renewable baseload energy and critical minerals supply essential to U.S. industry, technology, and national security.

ACR will include Stage 1 assets of CTR’s Hell’s Kitchen Project in Imperial County, California, and three additional lithium production facilities, providing a total output of 50 megawatts of renewable electricity and approximately 100,000 metric tons annually of lithium carbonate.

As independently validated by Idaho National Laboratory, the Hell’s Kitchen resource contains measurable concentrations of U.S.-designated critical minerals and rare earth elements. Beyond lithium, engineering is underway to unlock additional critical minerals, such as zinc, manganese, rubidium, and potash, further enhancing the project’s strategic importance and potential future revenue diversity.

The Hell’s Kitchen Project has secured California state permits, and federal permits are proceeding under the FAST-41 program, positioning it as one of the few near-term U.S. developments established to deliver renewable baseload power and strategic critical minerals at commercial scale.

CTR’s decision to advance the ACR listing aligns with U.S. policy, market momentum, and national security priorities.

The U.S. federal administration has issued multiple executive orders to reduce exposure to foreign critical minerals supply chains, and the recent U.S.–Australia Critical Minerals Framework also highlights an accelerating effort among allied nations to secure strategic resources. These measures, together with the private sector’s response, led by JPMorgan Chase’s $1.5 trillion Security and Resiliency Initiative, and Orion’s $1.8 billion Critical Mineral Consortium, demonstrate the alignment of Washington and Wall Street in rebuilding domestic capacity across energy, technology, and critical minerals.

“After a decade of engineering, validation, and partnerships, CTR is positioned to help secure America’s energy and minerals future,” said Rod Colwell, CTR Chairman and CEO. “The planned listing of American Critical Resources will allow access to U.S. public market capital and accelerate development of a project that supports national priorities in energy security, manufacturing, and defense.”

ACR has appointed Hall Chadwick as its corporate advisor to lead its U.S. market entry, working in partnership with Cohen & Company Capital Markets on institutional financing and IPO execution.

“As one of Australia’s most established professional-services firms with a 138-year history, Hall Chadwick is proud to help bridge the Australian and U.S. critical minerals ecosystems,” Richard Albarran, Managing Partner at Hall Chadwick, said. “Australia’s new national reserve strategy and ACR’s Hell’s Kitchen Project share a common purpose - securing the materials that underpin energy independence, national security, and a diversified global supply chain.”

As part of the planned listing process, ACR will pursue additional capital raising in the private markets to strengthen its balance sheet and position the company for execution and U.S. public market readiness.

Loom Solar also revealed plans to set up a 1.2 GW Giga Factory in Uttar Pradesh dedicated to advanced Heterojunction (HJT) solar cell technology. The facility will enhance domestic manufacturing capacity and contribute to India’s Make in India initiative. The plant is expected to support high-efficiency solar production and serve as a foundation for the company’s next phase of growth.

Amod Anand, Co-founder and Director of Loom Solar, said, “Loom Solar has always believed in building technologies that empower energy self-reliance. As India transitions to cleaner energy, our focus remains on creating advanced solar, inverter, and storage solutions that make power accessible, reliable, and future-ready. Our upcoming 1.2 Giga Watt Factory, along with our commitment to BESS and inverter manufacturing, represents not just an expansion of scale but a roadmap toward India’s clean energy independence.”

The company also announced its plans to expand its presence in the developer and government segments. In the developer segment, the company aims to supply solar modules, inverters, and energy storage systems for large-scale projects under the PM-KUSUM Scheme, targeting installations from 1 MW and above. In the government segment, Loom Solar intends to collaborate with public sector organisations including Railways, Telecom, and DISCOMs, which are leading solar adoption across the country.

The company also outlined its strategy to expand domestic manufacturing of lithium-based Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) to address challenges such as grid stability, peak load management, and renewable energy integration.

Peskoe told me to pay close attention to the regulatory fillings utilities make for their data center projects, not just what they tell the press or investors.","The “Supreme Court” of energy in Georgia

There are only 10 states in the country that hold elections for a Public Service Commission, a small group of regulators who oversee utility companies, and Georgia is one of them. As Charles Hua, the executive director of the nonprofit PowerLines, recently put it, these officials are the “Supreme Court justices” of energy. They preside over what kinds of infrastructure gas and electric utilities will build, where they’ll build it, and how much rates will go up as a result.

The election in Georgia is long overdue after being held up by a lawsuit the last two election cycles. Two of the five current commissioners have served three extra years without being re-elected by voters. During that time, the commission has approved six rate increases for customers of Georgia Power, the largest utility in the state, in part to pay for major cost overruns on new nuclear reactors at Plant Vogtle. Now Georgia Power is proposing a major expansion of natural gas power — about 10 nuclear reactors’ worth — mostly to meet data center demand.

The two seats are held by Republicans Fitz Johnson and Tim Echols. They are being challenged by Democrats Peter Hubbard and Alicia Johson, who have vowed to push for Georgia Power to meet demand with clean energy.

Battle for the soul of electricity affordability in New Jersey and Virginia

Energy costs are at the center of the governors’ races in New Jersey and Virginia this year, and Democrats and Republicans are making opposite arguments about how to lower them. In New Jersey, Democrat Mikie Sherrill has vowed to freeze utility rates and clear red tape to “open the floodgates on new cheaper and cleaner energy projects,” including solar, battery storage, and nuclear. Her opponent, Jack Ciattarelli, thinks the key to lower prices is pulling out of the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, a 13-state cap and trade program that incentivizes cleaner power generation and raises money for climate-friendly projects. He also wants to repeal the state’s electrification goals for vehicles and buildings and ban offshore wind development.

A similar fight is playing out in Virginia, although there it’s tied more to the state’s rapidly multiplying data centers. Virginia is already home to 13% of global data center capacity, with more coming online. A recent state legislative report warns that customers are looking at increases of $14 to $37 per month by 2040 as a result.

The Democratic candidate for governor, former U.S. Representative Abigail Spanberger, wants to expand solar and wind power and invest in building efficiency. She’s also advocated for data centers to “pay their fair share” of new energy infrastructure, and said she will encourage them to pilot advanced clean technologies like small modular nuclear reactors and hydrogen. She’s running against Winson Earle Sears, the current lieutenant governor of Virginia, who has questioned the reliability of renewable energy, arguing for an all-of-the-above strategy that includes “clean coal.” While “beautiful clean coal,” it may be one of Trump’s favorite energy sources, the reality is, it’s still just coal.

The governor’s seat isn’t the only one that’s up for grabs in Virginia. Whoever wins will need the House of Delegates on their side. Democrats currently have a razor thin 51-seat majority, and all 100 seats are on offer. Even a blue wave in the House doesn’t guarantee strong climate action, however, according to the nonprofit advocacy group Climate Cabinet. “Which candidates win will determine whether Virginia expands on” its climate law, the Clean Economy Act, “or backslides,” the group said in a “races to watch” memo.

Public transit for a fast-growing city

Voters in Charlotte, North Carolina, and the whole of Mecklenburg County, will be asked whether to increase their sales tax by 1% to fund new transportation projects. Roughly 60% of the estimated $20 billion raised by the tax will go toward the expansion of rail and bus service. Charlotte is among the fastest-growing cities in the country. During a legislative hearing this summer, State Senator Mujtaba Mohammad said an average of 130 people move to the area each day. “We are experiencing longer commutes, more car accidents, higher car insurance premiums, more pedestrian-related accidents and less revenue to address our crumbling critical infrastructure,"" he said.

The Charlotte Area Transit System finalized a new long-range plan this year to foster “transit-oriented communities,” by increasing bus frequency, extending service hours, adding microtransit options to underserved neighborhoods, and adding 43 miles of new rail. But the plan is only possible with funding from the sales tax.

Sales tax increases are a common way to raise money for public transit systems — legislators in California recently voted to put a sales tax increase on next year’s ballot to address a looming fiscal cliff for transit in the Bay Area. Illinois also voted last week to increase the sales tax in the Chicago area by 0.025% to raise money for its ailing transit system, among other measures.

Other fights to watch:

A few smaller elections where climate is also on the ballot this year, according to Climate Cabinet:

The Whatcom County Council, in Washington State, which in 2021, became the first local government in the country to prohibit new oil refineries, coal plants, and fossil fuel shipment facilities. There’s currently a slim 4-3 pro-climate majority on the council, and Climate Cabinet warns that if that majority holds, it will “send a signal to other pro-climate county leaders around the country that their courage won’t cost them their seats.”

Jacob Frey, the current mayor of Minneapolis, pissed off climate advocates earlier this year when he vetoed a local carbon fee passed by the city council, arguing it was not legally sound. The council overrode the veto, but the fee was ultimately scaled back from $452 per ton to $5 per ton after a study by city staff found the lower number to be safer from legal challenges. Climate Cabinet is watching for whether candidates for the mayor’s office and city council who support carbon fees will win or be punished, and “whether anti-climate candidates gain more of a foothold in the city.”

A full decade has passed since the landmark Paris Agreement on climate change, and in that time the world has avoided the most catastrophic scientific projections. In 2015, the UN’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC, projected that global average temperatures could increase by as much as 7.8 degrees Celsius by the end of the century without significant shifts in policy and advancements in technology. Now, the Rhodium Group estimates that warming is highly unlikely to exceed 3.9 degrees by 2100, and could be limited to 2 degrees.

The numbers themselves are not hopeful. This is a vast range in terms of the potential impacts implied, and even 2 degrees of warming should not be considered “little.” The IPCC estimates that compared with a scenario that limits warming to 1.5 degrees, more than twice as many people would be exposed to severe heat at least once every five years in a world 2 degrees warmer; ice-free summers in the Arctic would occur 10 times more often; the number of plant, animal, and insect species that lose at least half their habitat would be two to three times larger; and crop yields and fisheries would suffer roughly twice the losses.

Putting those dire projections aside, what’s interesting is that this 2- to 3.9-degree range is about the same as what the Rhodium Group forecast when it published its first Climate Outlook report in 2023. Also relatively unchanged: a finding that global power sector emissions will peak within the next decade, and that total emissions will likely remain constant or subtly decline through 2060, but then go up again as Global South countries see more rapid economic development in the latter half of the century.

The reason the numbers haven’t changed much, despite some seemingly dramatic policy changes that have occurred in the interim, has to do with Rhodium’s unique approach to projecting the future.

Many of the reports that come out around this time, such as the UN’s annual Emissions Gap Report, try to assess where the world is headed based on currently enacted policies as well as pledges, such as the “nationally determined contributions” that countries submit to the UN. Those might include promises like, “We’ll build X quantity of renewable energy by 2030,” or “We’ll protect X amount of our forests.” The models assume that these policies and pledges are fixed. They do not contemplate future ramp-ups or potential reversals. They also use fixed assumptions about GDP and population growth, oil prices, technology costs, etc.

A recent report by Wood Mackenzie, for example, estimates that temperatures will climb to 2.6 degrees by 2060, and then models a few other potential discrete scenarios, including one that shows what it would take to limit warming to 2 degrees.

The limitation of this approach is that the trajectory for each variable these models use is deeply uncertain, Hannah Pitt, one of the authors of the Rhodium report, told me. “Even a small change in GDP growth can have really big implications for emissions — likewise for oil prices and renewable costs and all that,” she said. “We try to take into consideration the wide range of uncertainty we have in the future of those core drivers of emissions.” That requires modeling thousands of scenarios with different combinations of how those underlying drivers might evolve.

Then, rather than assuming that policies on the books today remain static, Rhodium uses data on how climate and energy policy has historically responded to economic inputs like oil prices and GDP growth, in different parts of the world to project how policy might change going forward, using a carbon price as a proxy for policy ambition.

This approach takes into account such a wide range of possibilities that the results aren’t likely to change much year to year. Both in 2023 and now, the modeling incorporated the prospect that a Trump administration or something like it could reverse some progress, and that energy demand could soar. “We are looking at the long-term evolution of policy, not the administration fluctuations,” Pitt explained. It would take a true step-change in policy or a major technological breakthrough to produce a noticeable change in the trajectory, she said.

What are those breakthroughs? At this point, they aren’t a mystery. Cheaper clean firm power — like advanced nuclear, fusion, or geothermal — would be a huge help. Solutions for decarbonizing flying and shipping are also on the list. We also need to make it affordable to produce iron, steel, cement, and petrochemicals with far fewer emissions.

On the policy side, bending the curve might mean something like stricter electric vehicle requirements. As mentioned earlier, economic development in the Global South is expected to shift emissions back upward later this century — in part because if policy evolves the way it has historically, and if more and more people around the world are buying cars, the cars may not be 100% electric, and emissions from transport will go up.

None of this is to say that the Trump administration’s actions will have no effect on warming. Recall the report’s expansive range of future warming scenarios of 2 to 3.9 degrees — it’s very possible that policies enacted today will push the world closer to one or the other. A separate recent Rhodium study that dives into the specifics of U.S. policies found that emissions in 2035 could be 0.8 to 1.2 gigatonnes higher than what the group projected in the same report last year, largely due to Trump’s policies.

It should be comforting that one administration can’t veer the world too far off course — although by that same logic, we can’t expect a single administration to shift projections in a positive direction, either. A ""breakthrough"" in something like decarbonized cement will likely happen over years, through a feedback loop of sustained policy support and technological development.

There is no “too late” when it comes to addressing the technology and policy gaps the report highlights, Pitt said “Of course, the sooner the better,” she said. “But the difference between a 2.8-degree future and a 2.5-degree future saves lives. So the effort to drive these technology costs down is worthwhile, even if it doesn’t happen on the timeline that we would hope.”

The project was announced Thursday by Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, who focused heavily on the projected economic benefits of the projects while attempting to head off criticism that it would lead to higher costs. In the first sentence of her press release, she said that the project will “create more than 2,500 union construction jobs, more than 450 jobs on site and 1,500 more across the county.” Also, it “will be one of the most advanced AI infrastructure facilities in the U.S., especially when it comes to its efficient use of land, water, and power.” Oh, and it “will not require any additional power generation to operate.”

The utility set to power the project, DTE Energy, released its quarterly earnings Thursday, as well, which described a 1.4-gigawatt project it had already executed. In a presentation for analysts and investors, DTE said that the new data center would pay for “required storage through a 15-year energy storage contract,” and that it would “support affordability for existing customers as excess capacity is sold.”

On a call with analysts, DTE Energy chief executive Joi Harris further asserted that the project has “meaningful affordability benefits to our existing customers.” As the data center ramps up, she explained, it can use existing excess capacity on the grid. By the time it reaches full strength, it will enjoy the benefits of “nearly $2 billion of incremental energy storage investments and additional tolling agreements to support this data center load.”

Who will pay for energy storage and tolling agreements? A DTE spokesperson, Jill Wilmot, clarified in an email that “DTE will meet the 1.4 gigawatts of demand from the data center with existing capacity,” and that “new energy storage will be built — and paid for by the customer” — that is, Stargate — “to help augment times of peak demand, ensuring continued reliability for all customers.”

Data centers help spread out the fixed costs of the grid more widely, Wilmot went on. “Data center development in DTE’s electric service territory will not increase customer rates,” she said, adding that “DTE is ensuring the data center will absorb all new costs required to serve them — in this case, battery storage. Our customers will not pay.”

That said, Wilmot did not answer a question about whether there would be any network or transmission upgrades necessary. She told me that she expected DTE would make a filing for the project with Michigan regulators later Friday.

Consumer advocates were skeptical of the utility’s claims. “When you are talking about new demand as massive as what would be created by this data center, we can’t afford to just take DTE at its word that other customers won’t be affected,” Amy Bandyk, the executive director of the Citizens Utility Board of Michigan, told me in an email. She called for Michigan regulators “to require DTE and the data center customer to agree on a tariff specific to that customer that includes robust protections against cost-shifting and provisions that any incremental costs will be solely covered by this new customer.”

More utilities and data center developers are trying to explicitly head off claims that data centers are driving up electricity rates. In another recent data center announcement for a multi-billion-dollar project in West Memphis, Arkansas, Google and the Arkansas Economic Development Commission said that “Google will be covering the full energy costs for the West Memphis facility and will be ramping up new solar energy and battery storage resources for the facility.”

Drew Marsh, the chief executive of Entergy, the utility serving the project, confirmed on an earnings call earlier this week that Google “will protect energy affordability for existing customers by covering the full cost of powering the data center in West Memphis.” He also said that in Mississippi, where Amazon has announced a $16 billion project, “customer rates would be 16% lower than they otherwise would have been due to these large customers.”

So why are utilities — which, after all, get paid by ratepayers for the investments they make in their systems — telling their investors about all the money they’re not charging ratepayers?

In short, utilities and developers know they’re on political thin ice, and they don’t want to kill the golden goose of data center development by stoking a populist backlash to rising electricity prices that could result in either government-mandated slashing of their investment plans, caps on the rates they can charge, or both.

“Looking ahead, we anticipate the central issue will be how utilities protect residential customers from costs associated with large-load customers, or else face potential consequences from regulators,” Mizuho analyst Anthony Crowdell said in a note to clients earlier this week. “Data centers, and their associated load, have the potential” to “cause political push-back.”

This is already happening across the country. The frontrunner in the New Jersey gubernatorial race, Democrat Mikie Sherrill, for example, has promised to freeze electricity rates, which have seen a sharp runup in recent years. Indiana Governor Mike Braun, a Republican, said in a recent statement that “we can’t take it anymore,” in reference to rate hikes. Indiana has also rejected a number of proposed data centers, as I covered earlier this year.

This means that utilities will have to think carefully about how and to whom they allocate costs arising from data center development and operation.

“Allocation of cost will be pivotal as the current ’pocketbook issues driving a lot of the U.S. political debate could create some challenging regulatory outcomes should data centers put pressure on customer bills,” Crowdell wrote.

But what’s said in an announcement to the media or to investors may not always reflect the reality of utility cost allocation, Harvard Law School professor Ari Peskoe told me.

“Don’t trust a utility press release or comment from a CEO of a monopoly that says Hey, these rates are good for you,” he told me.

Peskoe told me to pay close attention to the regulatory fillings utilities make for their data center projects, not just what they tell the press or investors. “Are the utilities themselves actually making these claims as strongly as their CEOs are making them in investor calls? And then once we do have a regulatory process about it, are they being transparent in that regulatory process? Are they hiding a lot of details behind the confidentiality claims so that only the participants in that proceeding actually get to see the details?”

Peskoe also pointed to other costs that might be incurred in the course of data center development that get socialized across the rate base but aren’t necessarily directly tied to any one development, like the transmission and network upgrades, that have contributed to large price increases in the PJM Interconnection territory.

“What you’re looking for is a firm contract that ensures the data center is going to be paying for every penny that the utility is incurring to provide service, so that it’s paying for all the new infrastructure that’s serving it,” Peskoe said. Without that, all you have is a press release.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjAzNDI0MC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgxODQwNzc4OH0.XbJ25MPq8ery7SGqxNCPmBzNCchrvZUoTKKwApK4fnk/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-03 10:04:49.623786

Historical insights feature the legacy of the U.S. inception of the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) in the 1970s that started to estimate the economic impetus of every environmental policy. Europe has a long-standing tradition to consider environmental aspects in economic productivity calculus—for instance—if one considers projects like the wider ‘Green Wave’ endeavors that tact economic flows in harmony with environmental conditions. Under the Joseph Biden administration the U.S. started the Green New Deal (GND). The European pendant is the European Green Deal (EGD) that incorporates green policies in every aspect of the governance of economic growth. In particular, the Next Generation European Union Sustainable Finance Taxonomy is measuring the economic impact of all major productivity sectors of the economy. The New European Bauhaus integrates sustainable and inclusive living in every aspect of human lives. The U.S. President Joseph Biden administration has launched a large-scale plan to bring nature into economics and assess changes in environmental and ecosystem services in cost–benefit analyses. The U.S. initiative to create environmental-economic statistics targets at measuring natural resources as economic assets. Modern satellite imagery empowering the Geographic Information System (GIS) advancements and geo-engineering are additional scientific advancements to cartograph and change natural conditions for economic outcomes. While the Donald Trump administration is pushing for efficiency in governmental endeavors, the corporate and finance world is taking over environmental concerns. In the finance and governance worlds, Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) investment strategies have leveraged into a worldwide trend in most recent decades. In addition, the International Monetary Fund’s research unit investigates regional climate change economic impacts. Scientific advancements, like the Columbia University-housed Mapping Climate Justice project, calculates the expected economic changes due to climate change. On the global level, the World Bank’s Changing Wealth of Nations Report integrates natural resources and greenhouse gas emissions into international accounting. The Global Green New Deal (GGND) integrates many different sustainability aspects in industrial economic action and human living. The ambitious United Nations Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) round up the overarching environmental economics endeavors on the global stage. In their entirety, all these initiatives and efforts echo an appreciation of environmental protection in harmony with economic activity. In a climate of geopolitical tensions, it is to note that future wealth of nations can be based on the conservation of natural resources. Climate flexibility and environmental stability are key comparative advantages that countries can ground their economic prosperity on.

Reverse auctions for carbon capture contracts are coming up in Denmark with awards scheduled for next April.
Nordic LPs are very familiar with this approach and many are, for example, invested in companies currently building carbon capture plants.

Carbon credits from carbon capture projects provide a secure revenue stream, which means that these businesses are becoming more contracted in nature.","This article is sponsored by Infranode

The strong Nordic focus on green energy has made the region a technological frontrunner with a high degree of green power in the mix. Municipalities are increasingly looking for private investors to help improve installations, particularly in fibre and district heating and cooling, creating opportunities for agile and local GPs.

The region is also ahead on carbon capture and storage, providing investors with exposure to a technology which may become a significant future asset class. Ultimately, the key to success in the Nordics is about keeping an ear close to the ground, says Erik Botnevik, Infranode partner and the GP’s country manager in

Norway.

Which Nordic assets face the most pressing need for external finance?

The average Nordic distribution system operator (DSO) has a regulated asset base, which will probably double in the next five years. The question is whether this need for finance will be met by current owners, which would typically be the municipalities or the counties, or if they might need to look to private markets. We’re slowly seeing more acceptance for the latter, and hence more opportunities to invest in the electricity grid sector.

In general, this is a fragmented and publicly owned market with a handful of large companies regionally and private capital to date predominantly in Sweden and Finland. Some might merge with a neighbour to improve earnings and credit but will still require external financing because the investment requirements are significant. Electrical grids are essential and sensitive, so the preferred investor tends to be local pension capital. But there are pockets of private ownership.

Waste incineration plants and bioenergy plants need investments to reach net-zero targets, basically by capturing the CO2 emissions and storing them, alternatively converting production to heat pumps. That requires significant investment and provides an opportunity for infrastructure funds and local institutions to invest.

Fibre is a different story. The fibre networks in Denmark, Sweden and Norway are very mature. These networks have been built since the early 2000s by local utilities who are now more open to monetise. This provides investible opportunities, especially for those willing to enter into co-ownership structures. In Finland, there’s a lower degree of fibre penetration, so the focus is more on build-out.

With all the Nordic countries now members of NATO, there’s also the new 5 percent target for annual defence spending. The vast chunk of accompanying investments will be defence-related and come out of national budgets.

However, there will still be a need to build infrastructure capacity. At the centre of this theme is the effect on the more usual core infra sectors such as digital, energy and transport, as well as what additional investment requirements we see – for example, in social infrastructure.

In terms of new sectors, there will be a need to provide garrisons, garages and depots as well as defence-related education. Denmark has been quite vocal about its intention to partner with long-term institutional capital for the capacity build-up, and similar considerations are emerging in the other Nordic countries.

How can infrastructure managers access public-private partnership deals in the Nordics?

Nordic governments are generally well-financed on a country level. The story is a little bit different at the municipal and county level where the vast majority of partnerships actually take place. When the municipal sector faces greater budgetary constraints and is required to ensure a higher level of resiliency during higher-interest-rate environments, it’s harder to get projects financed. They also need financing not only to meet the new requirements, but also to make up for a legacy of insufficient investment in maintenance.

To access these deals, first and foremost, you need to be present locally. Though you can access large assets from the outside, on the municipal level, you need to take the time to engage with municipalities. Bear in mind that Norway alone has more than 400 municipalities; Finland and Sweden have around 300; Denmark nearly 100; and Iceland 62.

Additionally, you’re dealing with a fragmented market as the Nordics comprise five countries with a population of 28 million in a region larger than the UK, Germany, Belgium and France combined. This region has 100 DSOs and each country will have maybe 50-100 heating companies and 3,000-4,000 schools. This makes the region a small-to-mid-cap market and investors need to be out there talking and building relationships with local energy and utility companies as well as municipalities.

Everything we do is done in collaboration with local authorities and regulators. When municipalities want to execute on extending the heating network or ensure that everyone has access to fibre, or if the goal is to reduce CO2 emissions from waste incineration plants, they tend to be quite pragmatic when looking for solutions. If that means teaming up with an infrastructure fund, they’ll do that.

One important asset class here is heating, which includes waste-to-heat and heat pumps, often in tandem. Key triggers for changing ownership and requirements, as well as seeking new and external capital, are usually the need for upgrades and improvements to an asset. Some want to include cooling solutions, which require investments, and many heating companies with incinerators or biofuel plants are working hard on their net-zero agendas. This creates good conditions for carbon capture projects which need financing.

From this comes an interest from the public side in seeking partnerships and alternative structures. We’ve seen this happen more and more over the past couple of years, and this will accelerate as more assets seek to remove or reduce their CO2 emissions and footprint, both from a regulatory and a commercial perspective.

What is the current market for Nordic carbon capture and storage?

It’s developing. For example, Infranode has already invested in the Hafslund Oslo Celsio district heating and cooling company, which has a waste-to-energy plant with carbon capture facility under construction. FID was taken earlier this year, and by 2029, CO2 will be captured from the plant and stored under the North Sea.

Further, three biomass plants with carbon capture technology (BECCS) are under construction: two in Denmark, Asnæsværket and Avedøreværket – both owned by Ørsted – and Stockholm Exergi.

Reverse auctions for carbon capture contracts are coming up in Denmark with awards scheduled for next April. Sweden had its first reverse auction earlier this year, which means that there’s likely to be another couple of very large carbon capture projects in the pipeline. And that’s likely to take FID over the next year or so.

The expectation is that more mid-sized projects will follow as the carbon capture value chain matures and there’s a clear facilitation of transport and storage of CO2. We expect to see many carbon capture-related projects annually in every Nordic market within a few years.

In common with other emerging green technologies, subsidies will be needed for the immediate future. However, waste incineration plants typically account for 15-20 percent of total emissions in a Nordic city. Therefore, it makes a lot of sense to curb this source of carbon emissions.

As for the investment models, some utilities will want to invite investors in as partners, and some will want joint ventures for the carbon capture facility in isolation. This was, for example, what happened in Denmark.

Increasingly, the business case for investments in carbon capture and storage relating to district heating is about future-proofing the production cost of a heating company that utilises and owns a waste-to-heat incinerator. In Hafslund Celsio, this was made possible by a combination of government grants and selling carbon credits. This also reduced the risk for the owners of the incineration plant.

How do LPs rate the strong Nordic focus on sustainability?

Nordic LPs are very familiar with this approach and many are, for example, invested in companies currently building carbon capture plants.

Non-Nordic LPs also get the benefit of having exposure to the region. They get to learn directly from assets which are at the global forefront of the net-zero journey, such as carbon capture projects. They also get exposure to markets with some of the highest levels of electrification and digitalisation in the world, as well as see the impact on grids and power prices from that electrification. I truly believe this is widely appreciated and of particular interest to LPs.

How important is the presence of carbon credits for the waste-to-heat or biofuel-to-heat business case?

They are very important. Carbon credits from carbon capture projects provide a secure revenue stream, which means that these businesses are becoming more contracted in nature. At the moment, you can enter into very long-term contracts that are eight to 10 years in length. This term fits the risk profile of the overall business, and the contracts are also now of sufficient size to make a real difference.

In Hafslund Celsio, we’ve signed long-term agreements with the two leading buyers of carbon credits globally, which are Microsoft and the Frontier Consortium. The carbon credit market is currently voluntary and rather dominated by those two institutions. Nordic industrials have only invested in carbon credits to a limited extent so far, but this will happen.

We also believe there will be new projects as the development of the carbon credit market is combined with the lower construction costs as a consequence of scale, experience and more modular construction.",https://media.infrastructureinvestor.com/uploads/2025/10/T5_CO2.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:11:47.642046

Earlier this year, the EPA said in a news release that cuts across the agency had already saved $748.8 million.
Reductions to federal-level environmental research make it more difficult to systematically collect and analyze national data on pollution, climate-warming gases, and air and water quality.
Taking after their model, we could form an internationally funded climate initiative that brings together NGOs, research institutes, governments, and foundations to preserve environmental research.
Whether through state-led coalitions or partnerships with nonprofit organizations, we can ensure that critical environmental research continues.","Like many communities along the East Coast, the town of Crisfield, Maryland, has a flooding problem. As the climate changes, storms are growing more intense, and rising ocean waters are increasingly pushing into low-lying areas, causing chronic flooding.

Residents have been working on plans to address the problem, and starting in 2022, they received a boost from researchers at the Environmental Protection Agency’s Office of Research and Development, E&E News reported (paywall).

“EPA’s research project in Crisfield identified marshes and other natural buffers that would help reduce storm surge and flood damages,” the outlet reported. “The work was critical, city officials said, as the city government has no engineer on staff and a limited budget.”

But the Trump administration halted EPA support for Crisfield and many other communities when it began eliminating the Office of Research and Development, or ORD, this summer, and launching a new environmental research arm in the Office of the Administrator. The reorganization was completed last month, an EPA spokeswoman told E&E News (paywall).

In its previous form, ORD employed more than 1,000 people and ran 10 national laboratories across the country that researched air pollution and other environmental threats. During the reorganization, many ORD scientists accepted early retirement, while others were reassigned to positions elsewhere across the agency.

Earlier this year, the EPA said in a news release that cuts across the agency had already saved $748.8 million.

However, these short-term savings come at far greater long-term costs, both financially and in terms of human health, infrastructure, and national security. Reductions to federal-level environmental research make it more difficult to systematically collect and analyze national data on pollution, climate-warming gases, and air and water quality. With fewer researchers, it becomes harder to justify or enforce regulations on major polluters. And without a robust scientific workforce, the U.S. will struggle to respond quickly and effectively to emergencies like wildfires, chemical spills, or extreme weather, putting more lives at risk.

“This is total victory for the polluters right now,” Thomas Burke, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University and former EPA science adviser, told ScienceInsider.

Solution: Establish an independent environmental science institute

One solution would be for a coalition of states, universities, and philanthropies to establish a nonpartisan scientific institution. Such a body could conduct independent climate and environmental research better insulated from political swings, and ensure that critical data and analysis remain available to protect public health and the environment.

This model is not unique. Canada’s experience shows how regional governments and independent institutions can step up when federal leadership falters. In 2012, Prime Minister Stephen Harper cut funding for the Experimental Lakes Area, a globally recognized freshwater research site. Rather than let the facility close, the provinces of Ontario and Manitoba partnered with the International Institute for Sustainable Development to take over funding and operations, keeping vital research on water pollution, climate change, and ecosystem health alive.

We may also take inspiration from an organization that was formed in response to an immunization crisis. When they realized that nearly 30 million children lacked proper vaccination in developing countries, a group of people (among them Bill Gates) decided to found the Global Alliance for Vaccines and Immunization, an internationally funded organization that researches vaccines and improves access to immunization around the world. In the past 25 years, they have helped vaccinate 1.1 billion children. Taking after their model, we could form an internationally funded climate initiative that brings together NGOs, research institutes, governments, and foundations to preserve environmental research.

Without the EPA’s research arm, we will be flying blind as we face threats from toxic hazards to rising seas. Whether through state-led coalitions or partnerships with nonprofit organizations, we can ensure that critical environmental research continues. In an era of proliferating climate threats, we have a moral obligation to preserve this scientific capacity.",https://i0.wp.com/yaleclimateconnections.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/1125_flood_1600.png?fit=1600%2C900&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-03 11:11:43.360522

Torus systems combine high-speed mechanical flywheels with advanced batteries, delivering instantaneous frequency and voltage stability, and sustained energy support.
While Comeau’s initial focus will be on utility collaboration, Torus systems are also deployed for data centers and commercial and industrial customers that require highly reliable, non-combustion power solutions.
This combination of utility and customer applications gives Torus a unique position in strengthening grid stability across both sides of the meter.
“I’ve seen firsthand how Torus technology strengthens the grid,” said Bill Comeau, Chief Utility Officer at Torus.","SALT LAKE CITY--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Torus today announced the appointment of William (Bill) Comeau as Chief Utility Officer, to advance utility partnerships and grid integration as the company builds America’s next generation of energy systems.

Comeau joins Torus after more than 25 years in the electric utility industry, including senior leadership roles at PacifiCorp, a Berkshire Hathaway Energy subsidiary and one of the largest regulated utilities in the Western United States, serving more than 2.1 million customers across six states.

Most recently, he served as Vice President of Customer Experience and Innovation at PacifiCorp, leading several of the company's successful programs, including pioneering energy storage and grid flexibility initiatives. Under his direction, these programs helped customers save millions of dollars, reduced system load, and were recognized by the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) as a leading example of the nation’s top virtual power plant — or VPP — program.

As a pioneer and thought leader in virtual power plants, Comeau led groundbreaking demand response programs that strengthened grid reliability during peak hours and advanced some of the country’s earliest large-scale VPP projects. This work gave him a unique perspective on how utilities and customers can modernize the grid together. Earlier in his career, he held positions at Commonwealth Edison in Chicago and has served on multiple industry and community boards, including the Salt Lake Chamber Board of Governors and Junior Achievement of Utah.

“Bill brings a proven playbook to our utility customer base that combines VPP best practices and a modern approach that enables utility operators to move quickly and install Torus systems on the grid economically,"" said Nate Walkingshaw, CEO and Co-founder of Torus. “He knows what utilities need to deliver reliable, affordable power while navigating the grid’s transformation. His track record of deploying grid-scale innovation and making it work for millions of customers makes him the ideal person to lead our utility strategy as we scale nationwide.”

In this role, Comeau will lead utility strategy and partnerships, working directly with utilities across the country to integrate Torus’ hybrid inertial-based battery systems into utility operations, grid planning, and grid-scale deployments. Torus systems combine high-speed mechanical flywheels with advanced batteries, delivering instantaneous frequency and voltage stability, and sustained energy support. His arrival comes as utilities nationwide face unprecedented pressure to add new capacity while maintaining grid stability — a challenge Torus technology is designed and engineered to address.

While Comeau’s initial focus will be on utility collaboration, Torus systems are also deployed for data centers and commercial and industrial customers that require highly reliable, non-combustion power solutions. This combination of utility and customer applications gives Torus a unique position in strengthening grid stability across both sides of the meter.

“I’ve seen firsthand how Torus technology strengthens the grid,” said Bill Comeau, Chief Utility Officer at Torus. “Utilities are looking for stable capacity they can deploy at scale and cost-effectively. Torus delivers that, and I’m excited to help utilities across the country deliver low-cost energy storage solutions.”

The announcement follows Torus’ expansion into GigaOne, its new 540,000-square-foot manufacturing facility, designed to enable large-scale production and delivery of its systems nationwide. Located in Salt Lake City near I-80, I-15, and major rail transport lines, the facility underscores Torus’ commitment to U.S. manufacturing and a secure domestic supply chain for critical energy infrastructure.

Public incentives, including subsidies, remain one of the most powerful tools to accelerate the transition to clean energy, while delivering energy security, job growth, improved livelihoods and greater global competitiveness.

Renewable energy is the cheapest power source in most of the world, driving growth, jobs and innovation. Combined with electrification, it has the potential to displace 75% of today’s fossil fuel demand. Despite this, global incentives remain misaligned: Fossil fuels received over $1.1 trillion in subsidies in 2023.

Outdated incentives hold back prosperity. With realigned incentives, governments not only bring the benefits of the clean energy economy to their countries but also address market distortions, provide predictable and aligned global policy and give businesses clarity and confidence to invest in clean technologies.

Given the sheer scale of these subsidies, even modest reforms could create considerable new space in constrained public budgets.

Then a grant was ripped away,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/tribe-nevada-finally-had-funding-climate-resilience-then-grant-was-ripped-away,"Joseph Frank was one of the first firefighters to respond to a massive wildfire that broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June last year.
Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe are surrounded on all sides by reminders of their vulnerability to a changing climate.
It all came together last December when the Walker River Paiute Tribe was awarded $20 million in funding from the EPA’s Community Change Grant.
The Walker River Reservation spans 325,000 square acres across three Nevada counties – Mineral, Churchill, and Lyon – but nearly every home is built along the flood-prone river.
The median household income for the Walker River Paiute Tribe is around $40,000 – about 53% lower than the median household income for Nevada.","Joseph Frank was one of the first firefighters to respond to a massive wildfire that broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June last year.

Temperatures that month were well above average, according to the National Weather Service. It was 90 degrees in Schurz, Nevada that day – 5 degrees hotter than normal for the area – when a lead-acid battery from a Bureau of Indian Affairs building overheated and “kind of blew up,” said Frank.

Fueled by vegetation cooked by record heat and drought in the months prior, the fire quickly spread across 65 acres. It took two days to fully contain, cutting off a portion of the U.S. Route 95 and causing the evacuation of all the tribe’s administrative offices.

“We ended up calling out all the municipalities to help us, just because of how intense it was,” Frank said of the June 20 fire.

Wildfire risk in Schurz is higher than 60% of communities in the U.S., according to data from the U.S. Forest Service. But the Walker River Paiute Tribe’s current water system, built in the 1960s, wasn’t designed to provide the water pressure needed to combat the large wildfires the tribe sees now.

It’s one of the major infrastructure problems that could be solved with a $20 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded to the tribe last winter. But the funding would never come.

Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe are surrounded on all sides by reminders of their vulnerability to a changing climate.

They see it in the river banks eroded by record floods and the fire scorched landscape. They see it in the wilting pinon trees and waning pine nut harvest. They see it in the infrastructure that can’t keep up and rising power bills they can’t afford.

Those observations have also turned into plans, and those plans into grant applications for projects that would prepare the tribe and residents of Schurz for a more extreme climate.

It all came together last December when the Walker River Paiute Tribe was awarded $20 million in funding from the EPA’s Community Change Grant. The grant was one of hundreds awarded under the Environmental and Climate Justice Program – a $2.8 billion financial assistance program created by the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden.

With the funds, the tribe could execute a multi-year climate resiliency plan to deliver water, energy, and food infrastructure to about 1,200 tribal members who live on the Walker River Reservation.

In total, 150 homes would be weatherized and upgraded for energy efficiency and climate resiliency – about 30% of all existing homes on the reservation.

Swamp coolers that aren’t designed to work in 100 degree temperatures would be swapped out for central air conditioning. Insulation and windows that fail to keep out rising heat would be replaced. Rooftops would be repaired and covered in solar panels and battery storage that could keep medication and food refrigerated during summer blackouts.

No one would be left out. The funding would also cover the remaining cost of a planned Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub – a fully electric and solar powered building with battery storage to shelter the town’s most vulnerable residents during weather emergencies, like floods and extreme heat waves, while increasing food and medication security.

The grant would also fund the last leg of a water infrastructure project that would support dozens of new fire hydrants on the reservation and secure reliable clean water for 425 existing homes and over 100 future homes.

But the January inauguration of President Donald Trump brought new priorities, and a White House crusade against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs funded by his predecessor’s 2022 climate law.

Within five months, on May 1, the $20 million Community Change Grant was officially terminated by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, along with more than 780 other environmental justice grants as part of Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI across the government.

The tribe only used about $70,000 from the grant before losing access to funding that would have helped the rural community adapt to a rapidly changing climate.

Multiple nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the EPA, challenging the legality of abruptly terminating congressionally approved funds, but as the case moves through the court system it’s unclear when – if ever – the funds will be restored.

Fires and floods

Melenie McFalls, the newly elected chair of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, was a month into the job when the EPA first cut off the tribe’s access to the Community Change Grant on Jan. 29. It was one of several grants the tribe would lose in the wake of Trump’s efforts to slash spending and remake the federal government.

Hundreds of emails piled up as McFalls contacted every state and congressional leader she could think of to restore the tribe’s funding.

“I was focused solely on funding cuts, everything else was left on the table because we rely on grant funding. We had to fight for that,” McFalls said in her office, the one she had to evacuate during the wildfire last year with the rest of the tribe’s council.

“We were wondering ‘what else is going to get cut? What’s going to be next? What’s going to happen?’ We had no idea,” McFalls said.

Thirteen years ago, the last time McFalls was chair of the tribe, they didn’t have a climate adaptation plan or an emergency plan for major floods and wildfires. Since then she’s seen the impacts of climate change piling up on the reservation.

The year before the fire, on May 17, 2023, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) found that flooding on the Walker River caused by record-breaking rain and snowmelt created enough structural damage to the Weber Dam seven miles northwest of Schurz that it “could have potentially progressed into a life-threatening event” for the tribe.

The Walker River flooded for 48 consecutive days between May and June that year, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources. It was partially caused by a sudden mid-to-late May warm up that quickly melted record-breaking snowpack in the Walker Basin. By July, stream flows into the Weber Reservoir were seven times the average for the time of year.

About a month after finding the damage in the dam, the BIA told the tribe during a community meeting that if the dam’s spillway failed they would have to prepare for more than three olympic sized pools worth of flooding a minute until the reservoir leveled out. The whole town of Schurz would need to be evacuated within 24 hours.

“It just wiped out our riverbanks. Took most of the land around it. Water was going up to some peoples porches. It was kind of scary to see that happen,” McFalls said.

The Walker River Reservation spans 325,000 square acres across three Nevada counties – Mineral, Churchill, and Lyon – but nearly every home is built along the flood-prone river. That’s because the reservation’s water system uses a gravity-fed storage tank located at the top of a hill that can only move water down to the lowest point in the valley where the river runs.

Before it was terminated, nearly $2 million from the Community Change Grant was reserved for a planned water infrastructure project that would improve water pressure and allow more than hundred homes to be built at higher elevations further from the river.

“If we could build higher up and we’re out of the flood zone, that’s one less thing for us to worry about,” said Frank, the firefighter, who also serves as the tribe’s project manager.

Heat and energy

By the next year, the precipitation that flooded Walker River in 2023 was gone. Mineral, Lyon, and Churchill counties only received about a quarter of the rain and snow they typically do from April to June, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

The drought was accelerated by record-breaking heat in 2024, the hottest year on record. But record-breaking heat is becoming the norm. The past decade has been the hottest in two centuries of record-keeping, NOAA reports.

Heat waves are also becoming the norm. Researchers at NASA found that summer heat waves in the U.S. have roughly doubled in number since 1980, increasing from an average of two to four per month.

Rising temperatures have helped Nevada claim two of the fastest warming cities in the nation – Reno and Las Vegas – but rural areas haven’t escaped the heat.When the fire broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June the nearest weather tower (about 25 miles away) recorded average monthly temperatures 5 degrees above normal.

Since 1950, average temperatures on the Walker River Reservation have increased by three degrees, according to Native Climate, a U.S. Department of Agriculture funded research project to support climate adaptation efforts in Native American communities.

Days over 100 degrees have also tripled on the reservation from an average of five days in 1950, to 20 days in 2025. If emissions continue on their current trajectory, there could be about 40 days over 100 degrees on the Walker River Reservation by the end of the century.

“You can see a huge increase in the number of degree days over 100 degrees,” said Maureen McCarthy, a research professor at Desert Research Institute, who led the Native Climate project.

“The extremes are becoming more extreme, in addition to the average temperatures changing,” McCarthy said. “That’s a big impact. We’re not designed to function at 100 degrees.”

The Walker River Housing Department reports that about 44% of homes on the reservation rely on swamp coolers, but evaporative-cooling appliances become less effective at 100 degrees and above. The cost of replacing one with central cooling is also a barrier for low-income households.

Ageing infrastructure only makes adapting to rising temperatures and extreme weather more difficult. The Walker River Housing Department reports that two-thirds of homes on the reservation built before 2000 have older, deteriorating roofs and windows that must be replaced to improve climate resilience.

Households on the reservation are already burdened with energy costs that are 24% higher than the state average, according to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Low-Income Energy Affordability Data tool. They also spend twice as much of their income on energy costs compared to the state average.

Replacing inefficient appliances that increase energy costs can also be difficult for lower-income households, including many on the reservation. The median household income for the Walker River Paiute Tribe is around $40,000 – about 53% lower than the median household income for Nevada. Unemployment is about twice as high, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.

Funding from the Community Change Grant would have covered the purchase of energy efficient heat pumps, water heaters, induction cooktops, electric ovens, and new dryers and refrigerators for 120 homes on the reservation.

“We were devastated when we started hearing all of our funding getting cut because we thought we were going to have these programs,” said Genia Williams, the housing director for the Walker River Paiute Tribe. “There was a lot of work put into it from my grant writers, past chairman, past administrators that worked hard to get this.”

The Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank created by state legislation — also worked with the Walker River Paiute Tribe to secure the Community Change Grant.

Since becoming the housing director a decade ago, Williams said persistent blackouts have also been a challenge for the rural reservation. The reservation sits at the end of an energy grid, and as demands for electricity rise with more intense summer heat blackouts rise too.

A joint survey by the bank and tribe found that 50% of households surveyed reported experiencing blackouts four to nine times per year, while a third reported experiencing blackouts more than 12 times per year. Two-thirds of households reported that power outages generally last between four and eight hours.

Unreliable power is especially hard on elders who have difficulty operating back-up generators, and medically vulnerable residents who rely on ventilators or need to keep medication refrigerated. The Community Change Grant would have allowed the tribe to install solar power and battery storage in 100 of the most vulnerable households.

“We’re just going to have to weather the storm and see what we can come up with and keep moving forward on these things,” Williams said.

Saving graces

The years of planning are not lost, and some of the tribe’s climate resiliency plans are moving forward, but on a smaller scale.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the tribe partial funding in 2022 to build a food distribution center that supports the tribe’s long-term food security and sovereignty plan.

Without the Community Change Grant it likely won’t be at the scale of the Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub the tribe envisioned. The solar panels, battery storage, walk-in refrigerators and freezers the grant would have funded won’t be included in the building, but it’ll take the tribe a step closer to their goal.

“We’ve come through a lot of storms. The one thing about our tribe and our community is that we’ve been able to overcome,” Williams said.

In September, the tribe also broke ground on a water infrastructure project that will add a second water storage tank and nearly 1,600 feet of water lines to the Walker River Reservation. The new “water loop” system will make it possible for about 30 new houses to be built on the reservation, allowing many of the 75 tribal members currently on the housing waitlist to live on their ancestral land and in their community.

Frank, the firefighter, took on the role of project manager for the tribe a year ago. When the EPA revoked the Community Change Grant he said it was “sickening feeling.”

When the EPA revoked the Community Change Grant the tribe had already completed engineering, procurement, and planning for the project. About three- fourths of the total $15.8 million needed for the project was secured from a combination of federal and state funds.

The EPA grant was the last piece of the puzzle. Without it, the tribe would have to dip into their limited reserves. If they didn’t, their remaining funds for the project would be lost.

“We had a deadline to meet the needs of certain funding requirements, and if this was not met, we would have lost the entire project,” said Frank.

The project couldn’t wait. The existing water systems were built like a tree with branches leading off to nowhere; water lines were not connecting to facilities, which led to some situations where hydrants failed to provide water during an emergency.

Frank, the volunteer firefighter, recalls how one of the fire hydrants on the reservation didn’t work during the 2024 fire that burned 65-acres of the reservation.

“These improvements are not just numbers on the page. They represent safer homes, stronger emergency readiness and peace of mind for every community member who depends on the system every day,” Frank said.

In 2019, the Indian Health Service also determined that low water pressure and stagnant water on the Walker River Reservation posed a public health threat in the form of cross contamination, bacterial diseases that breed in stagnant water from the ageing infrastructure.

The Walker River Paiute Tribe is deeply affected by persistent drought conditions and has lacked reliable access to domestic water supplies for generations. But the water loop project would allow the community to build long-term resilience to drought by increasing water reserves and improving the distribution system.

A 2022 report by the U.S. Geological Survey showed that drought has caused evaporation of the surface water levels of Walker River down to Walker Lake, limiting the recharge of groundwater levels. Groundwater in the area supplies at least half of the drinking water for the tribe, according to the EPA.

Generations of tribal members have left to pursue education with the goal of coming back and building up their community, but the infrastructure wasn’t there, said Williams.

“This is home for a lot of people. It’s where they grew up, or where their families grew up. Now they can come back,” Williams said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-90/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/dsc07901-1024x6831762188615.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=uBs_WXxS,N,,2025-11-03 14:06:46.954529

The data comes from Cloud Theory’s Q3 2025 automotive industry report, “On the Horizon,” released on Oct. 28. The EV sales drop marks one of the sharpest short-term declines in the market’s recent history.

During the week of Sept. 22–28, dealers sold 22,997 EVs. Just one week later, between October 6–12, sales plummeted to 5,929 units.

Inventories Mirror Steep EV Sales Drop

EV inventories have also fallen significantly, shrinking from 196,255 units in June to 104,050 units by October 12—a 47% reduction. General Motors currently holds the largest EV inventory at 39,164 units, followed by Ford with 21,432 and Hyundai with 14,725.

Japanese automakers maintain far smaller EV stock levels, with Nissan holding 419 units, Toyota 435, and Honda 2,138.

“In the short term, domestic automakers are still sitting on sizable EV inventory levels, a result of aggressive investment and production ramp-ups that defined their prior philosophies,” said Rick Wainschel, vice president of data science and analytics for Cloud Theory. “Meanwhile, many foreign OEMs have taken a more cautious approach and have pulled back EV allocations to the U.S. amid policy uncertainty and margin/tariff pressures.”

Broader Market Trends Impact Sales

Cloud Theory’s report also reveals an overall reduction in total vehicle inventory, which dropped to 2.86 million units from a 12-month high of 3.3 million in December 2024. Monthly vehicle sales declined to 1.12 million units in Q3 2025, compared to 1.18 million in Q2 2025.

Despite the downturn, the average marketed price for new vehicles slightly decreased to $49,537 in Q3 2025, down from $49,887 in Q2 2024, according to Cloud Theory. Manufacturers have so far avoided steep price hikes despite tariff pressures.

“Despite a drop in supply over the past six months, Vehicle Movement has remained remarkably steady, leading to higher Turn Rates,” Wainschel said. “Dramatic price increases related to tariffs have not materialized. That has helped the automotive market stay resilient despite dynamics that have been volatile for much of the past year.”",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/stock-sales-low-1400.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 11:13:23.564892

Joseph Frank was one of the first firefighters to respond to a massive wildfire that broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June last year.

Temperatures that month were well above average, according to the National Weather Service. It was 90 degrees in Schurz, Nevada that day – 5 degrees hotter than normal for the area – when a lead-acid battery from a Bureau of Indian Affairs building overheated and “kind of blew up,” said Frank.

Fueled by vegetation cooked by record heat and drought in the months prior, the fire quickly spread across 65 acres. It took two days to fully contain, cutting off a portion of the U.S. Route 95 and causing the evacuation of all the tribe’s administrative offices.

“We ended up calling out all the municipalities to help us, just because of how intense it was,” Frank said of the June 20 fire.

Wildfire risk in Schurz is higher than 60% of communities in the U.S., according to data from the U.S. Forest Service. But the Walker River Paiute Tribe’s current water system, built in the 1960s, wasn’t designed to provide the water pressure needed to combat the large wildfires the tribe sees now.

It’s one of the major infrastructure problems that could be solved with a $20 million grant from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) awarded to the tribe last winter. But the funding would never come.

Members of the Walker River Paiute Tribe are surrounded on all sides by reminders of their vulnerability to a changing climate.

They see it in the river banks eroded by record floods and the fire scorched landscape. They see it in the wilting pinon trees and waning pine nut harvest. They see it in the infrastructure that can’t keep up and rising power bills they can’t afford.

Those observations have also turned into plans, and those plans into grant applications for projects that would prepare the tribe and residents of Schurz for a more extreme climate.

It all came together last December when the Walker River Paiute Tribe was awarded $20 million in funding from the EPA’s Community Change Grant. The grant was one of hundreds awarded under the Environmental and Climate Justice Program – a $2.8 billion financial assistance program created by the Inflation Reduction Act under former President Joe Biden.

With the funds, the tribe could execute a multi-year climate resiliency plan to deliver water, energy, and food infrastructure to about 1,200 tribal members who live on the Walker River Reservation.

In total, 150 homes would be weatherized and upgraded for energy efficiency and climate resiliency – about 30% of all existing homes on the reservation.

Swamp coolers that aren’t designed to work in 100 degree temperatures would be swapped out for central air conditioning. Insulation and windows that fail to keep out rising heat would be replaced. Rooftops would be repaired and covered in solar panels and battery storage that could keep medication and food refrigerated during summer blackouts.

No one would be left out. The funding would also cover the remaining cost of a planned Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub – a fully electric and solar powered building with battery storage to shelter the town’s most vulnerable residents during weather emergencies, like floods and extreme heat waves, while increasing food and medication security.

The grant would also fund the last leg of a water infrastructure project that would support dozens of new fire hydrants on the reservation and secure reliable clean water for 425 existing homes and over 100 future homes.

But the January inauguration of President Donald Trump brought new priorities, and a White House crusade against diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) programs funded by his predecessor’s 2022 climate law.

Within five months, on May 1, the $20 million Community Change Grant was officially terminated by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, along with more than 780 other environmental justice grants as part of Trump’s executive order to eliminate DEI across the government.

The tribe only used about $70,000 from the grant before losing access to funding that would have helped the rural community adapt to a rapidly changing climate.

Multiple nonprofits, tribes, and local governments sued the EPA, challenging the legality of abruptly terminating congressionally approved funds, but as the case moves through the court system it’s unclear when – if ever – the funds will be restored.

Fires and floods

Melenie McFalls, the newly elected chair of the Walker River Paiute Tribe, was a month into the job when the EPA first cut off the tribe’s access to the Community Change Grant on Jan. 29. It was one of several grants the tribe would lose in the wake of Trump’s efforts to slash spending and remake the federal government.

Hundreds of emails piled up as McFalls contacted every state and congressional leader she could think of to restore the tribe’s funding.

“I was focused solely on funding cuts, everything else was left on the table because we rely on grant funding. We had to fight for that,” McFalls said in her office, the one she had to evacuate during the wildfire last year with the rest of the tribe’s council.

“We were wondering ‘what else is going to get cut? What’s going to be next? What’s going to happen?’ We had no idea,” McFalls said.

Thirteen years ago, the last time McFalls was chair of the tribe, they didn’t have a climate adaptation plan or an emergency plan for major floods and wildfires. Since then she’s seen the impacts of climate change piling up on the reservation.

The year before the fire, on May 17, 2023, the Bureau of Indian Affairs (BIA) found that flooding on the Walker River caused by record-breaking rain and snowmelt created enough structural damage to the Weber Dam seven miles northwest of Schurz that it “could have potentially progressed into a life-threatening event” for the tribe.

The Walker River flooded for 48 consecutive days between May and June that year, according to the Nevada Division of Water Resources. It was partially caused by a sudden mid-to-late May warm up that quickly melted record-breaking snowpack in the Walker Basin. By July, stream flows into the Weber Reservoir were seven times the average for the time of year.

About a month after finding the damage in the dam, the BIA told the tribe during a community meeting that if the dam’s spillway failed they would have to prepare for more than three olympic sized pools worth of flooding a minute until the reservoir leveled out. The whole town of Schurz would need to be evacuated within 24 hours.

“It just wiped out our riverbanks. Took most of the land around it. Water was going up to some peoples porches. It was kind of scary to see that happen,” McFalls said.

The Walker River Reservation spans 325,000 square acres across three Nevada counties – Mineral, Churchill, and Lyon – but nearly every home is built along the flood-prone river. That’s because the reservation’s water system depends on a gravity-fed storage tank located at the top of a hill that moves water down to the lowest point in the valley where the river runs.

Before it was terminated, a portion of the Community Change Grant was reserved for a planned water infrastructure project that would allow the tribe to build more than hundred homes at higher elevations further from the river.

Heat and energy

The precipitation that flooded Walker River in 2023 was gone by the next year. Most of Mineral, Lyon, and Churchill counties only received about a quarter of the rain and snow they typically do from April to June, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

It was also the hottest year on record in 2024. When the fire broke out on the Walker River Reservation in June the nearest weather tower (about 25 miles away) recorded average monthly temperatures 5 degrees above normal.

Those conditions are becoming the norm. The past decade has been the hottest in two centuries of record-keeping, NOAA reports. Researchers at NASA recently found that summer heat waves in the U.S. have roughly doubled in number since 1980, increasing from an average of two to four per month.

Rising temperatures have helped Nevada claim two of the fastest warming cities in the nation – Reno and Las Vegas – but rural areas haven’t escaped the heat.

Since 1950, average temperatures on the Walker River Reservation have increased by three degrees, according to Native Climate, a U.S. Department of Agriculture funded research project to support climate adaptation efforts in Native American communities.

Days over 100 degrees have tripled on the reservation from an average of five days in 1950, to 20 days in 2025. Native Climate researchers projected even more extreme heat days using data from NASA climate models.

Under the worst-case scenario “by the end of the century you’re looking at somewhere close to maybe 70 days over 100 degrees on the Walker River Reservation,” said Maureen McCarthy, a research professor at Desert Research Institute, who led the Native Climate project.

“The extremes are becoming more extreme, in addition to the average temperatures changing,” McCarthy said. “That’s a big impact. We’re not designed to function at 100 degrees.”

Ageing infrastructure on the reservation makes adapting to rising temperatures and extreme weather more difficult. The Walker River Housing Department reports that two-thirds of homes on the reservation built before 2000 have older, deteriorating roofs and windows due to harsh weather conditions. About 44% of homes on the reservation also rely on swamp coolers, but temperatures during heat waves are rising beyond what the evaporative-cooling appliance can manage.

Those factors have increased energy costs for households on the reservation. According to the U.S. Department of Energy’s Low-Income Energy Affordability Data tool, household energy costs are 24% higher on the reservation than the state average. Households on the reservation also spend twice as much of their income on energy costs compared to the state average.

Replacing inefficient appliances that increase energy costs can also be difficult for lower-income households, including many on the reservation. The median household income for the Walker River Paiute Tribe is around $40,000 – about 53% lower than the median household income for Nevada. Unemployment is about twice as high, according to the latest data from the U.S. Census Bureau’s American Community Survey 5-Year Estimates.

Funding from the Community Change Grant would have covered the purchase of heat pumps, water heaters, induction cooktops, electric ovens, and new dryers and refrigerators for 120 homes on the reservation.

“We were devastated when we started hearing all of our funding getting cut because we thought we were going to have these programs,” said Genia Williams, the housing director for the Walker River Paiute Tribe. “There was a lot of work put into it from my grant writers, past chairman, past administrators that worked hard to get this.”

The Nevada Clean Energy Fund — a nonprofit bank created by state legislation — also worked with the Walker River Paiute Tribe to secure the Community Change Grant.

Since becoming the housing director a decade ago, Williams said persistent blackouts have also been a challenge for the rural reservation. The reservation sits at the end of an energy grid, and as demands for electricity rise with more intense summer heat blackouts rise too.

A joint survey by the bank and tribe found that 50% of households surveyed reported experiencing blackouts four to nine times per year, while a third reported experiencing blackouts more than 12 times per year. Two-thirds of households reported that power outages generally last between four and eight hours.

Unreliable power is especially hard on elders who have difficulty operating back-up generators, and medically vulnerable residents who rely on ventilators or need to keep medication refrigerated. The Community Change Grant would have allowed the tribe to install solar power and battery storage in 100 of the most vulnerable households.

“We’re just going to have to weather the storm and see what we can come up with and keep moving forward on these things,” Williams said.

Saving graces

The years of planning are not lost, and some of the tribe’s climate resiliency plans are moving forward, but on a smaller scale.

The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development awarded the tribe partial funding in 2022 to build a food distribution center that supports the tribe’s long-term food security and sovereignty plan.

Without the Community Change Grant it likely won’t be at the scale of the Community Resilience and Food Storage Hub the tribe envisioned. The solar panels, battery storage, walk-in refrigerators and freezers the grant would have funded won’t be included in the building, but it’ll take the tribe a step closer to their goal.

The global lithium supply chain is experiencing unprecedented transformation as North American companies establish new pathways to reduce dependence on foreign processing capacity. The 18-year Stardust lithium offtake deal between Mandrake Resources (ASX:MAN) and Nasdaq-listed Stardust Power represents a groundbreaking commitment that extends far beyond typical industry agreements.

What Makes This Deal Structure Unique?

Most lithium offtake agreements in today's market span 5-10 years, making the Mandrake-Stardust partnership exceptionally rare with its potential 18-year duration. The agreement includes a firm 12-year base term with extension options through 2042, providing unprecedented security for both upstream producers and downstream processors.

The deal's structure reflects the massive capital investments required for lithium processing infrastructure:

• Annual supply volumes: Up to 7,500 metric tons of lithium chloride feedstock

• Base agreement term: Minimum 12 years with extension capability

• Total potential duration: 18 years extending to 2042

• Facility investment: Up to US$257 million in state incentives and funding

This extended timeline provides crucial financing security for Stardust Power's Muskogee facility development while guaranteeing Mandrake Resources long-term revenue streams from their Utah operations.

The Strategic Importance of Domestic Supply Chains

Current global lithium processing capacity remains heavily concentrated in Asian markets, creating supply chain vulnerabilities for Western manufacturers. This concentration has prompted governments and companies to prioritise domestic and allied-nation sourcing strategies.

Managing Director James Allchurch of Mandrake Resources highlighted the geopolitical drivers behind the agreement, stating that the United States is moving rapidly to eliminate geopolitical risks associated with sourcing critical minerals from potentially unfriendly international jurisdictions. The domestic location of Mandrake's Utah operations provided significant strategic advantages in securing this partnership.

The 18-year Stardust lithium offtake deal exemplifies how companies are restructuring supply chains to ensure security and reduce exposure to international trade disruptions. Furthermore, these developments align with broader Australian lithium innovations and international critical minerals energy transition initiatives.

How Does the Stardust Power Processing Model Work?

The Muskogee, Oklahoma facility represents an innovative approach to lithium processing infrastructure in North America, strategically positioned within the Port of Muskogee Free Trade Zone to maximise logistical and regulatory advantages.

From Feedstock to Battery-Grade Material

Stardust Power's processing model transforms lithium chloride brine from Mandrake's Utah operations into battery-grade lithium carbonate through a two-phase development approach:

Phase 1 Development Specifications:

• Target capacity: 25,000 metric tons per year

• Input material: Lithium chloride brine feedstock

• Output product: Battery-grade lithium carbonate

• Location advantage: Muskogee Free Trade Zone benefits

• Construction status: Ground-breaking completed January 2025

Phase 2 Expansion Framework:

• Ultimate capacity: 50,000 metric tons annually

• Implementation timeline: Subject to market demand and financing completion

• Total investment backing: Up to US$257 million through state incentives and funding programmes

• Job creation: Hundreds of positions across operations and support functions

The Economics of Lithium Processing

The transformation from raw lithium chloride to battery-grade lithium carbonate involves significant value addition at each processing stage:

Processing Stage Input Material Output Product Value Enhancement Brine Concentration Raw lithium brine Lithium chloride 200-300% increase Chemical Processing Lithium chloride Technical grade LiCO₃ 150-200% increase Battery Grade Refinement Technical grade LiCO₃ Battery grade LiCO₃ 50-75% increase

The Mandrake supply commitment of 7,500 metric tons annually represents approximately 15% of Phase 2 ultimate capacity, indicating Stardust Power's strategy to diversify feedstock sources across multiple partnerships. This processing approach mirrors developments in battery-grade lithium refinery projects globally.

What Are the Geopolitical Implications of North American Lithium Processing?

The 18-year Stardust lithium offtake deal reflects broader strategic initiatives to establish domestic critical mineral processing capabilities, reducing dependence on foreign supply chains and enhancing national security considerations.

Reducing Critical Mineral Dependencies

Current global lithium processing capacity concentration creates strategic vulnerabilities that governments and companies are actively addressing through domestic facility development:

Supply Security Advantages:

• Tariff elimination: Domestic processing avoids import duties on processed materials

• Transportation optimisation: Reduced costs and lead times for North American manufacturers

• Trade protection: Insulation from export restrictions or international disputes

• Quality assurance: Enhanced supply chain visibility and control standards

Policy Drivers Behind the Shift

Recent legislative frameworks have accelerated investment in domestic critical mineral processing infrastructure:

Key Policy Initiatives:

• Inflation Reduction Act: Provides comprehensive incentives for domestic battery supply chains

• Defence Production Act: Authorises federal support for critical mineral projects

• CHIPS and Science Act: Funds semiconductor-grade lithium applications development

• Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act: Supports processing facility construction and modernisation

These policies create favourable conditions for agreements like the Mandrake-Stardust partnership, providing financial incentives and regulatory support for domestic processing development. Additionally, international markets are developing their own approaches, as evidenced by lithium brine market insights from Argentina.

Which Companies Benefit from Extended Offtake Agreements?

The 18-year Stardust lithium offtake deal demonstrates how extended agreements create mutual benefits for both upstream producers and downstream processors, enabling long-term planning and risk mitigation strategies.

Upstream Producers and Their Advantages

For mining companies like Mandrake Resources, long-term offtake agreements provide crucial business stability:

Producer Benefits:

• Revenue certainty: Guaranteed cash flows for project financing and operational planning

• Market risk mitigation: Protection against commodity price volatility over extended periods

• Capital access: Enhanced ability to secure development funding from lenders and investors

• Operational planning: Long-term production scheduling with defined volume commitments

Mandrake Resources, with a market capitalisation of A$14.42 million, gains significant strategic value through this 18-year commitment, providing stability for their Utah lithium operations.

Downstream Processors and Market Position

Processing companies like Stardust Power benefit from secured feedstock supplies that enable facility planning and customer commitments. In addition, Stardust Power has recently announced strategic North American feedstock partnerships to strengthen its supply chain position:

Processor Advantages:

• Feedstock security: Guaranteed raw material supply for capacity utilisation planning

• Cost predictability: Protection against raw material price spikes through long-term agreements

• Customer confidence: Ability to offer battery manufacturers reliable supply guarantees

• Project financing: Enhanced credibility with lenders through demonstrated offtake commitments

Extended offtake agreements have become essential tools for de-risking lithium projects, with financial institutions increasingly requiring such contracts before approving development financing for major processing facilities.

How Do Market Dynamics Affect Long-Term Lithium Contracts?

The structure of long-term lithium agreements must accommodate significant market volatility while providing security for both parties. The 18-year Stardust lithium offtake deal incorporates flexible mechanisms to address changing market conditions over its extended duration.

Price Mechanisms and Risk Management

Long-term lithium contracts typically incorporate sophisticated pricing approaches to balance market exposure with price certainty:

Common Pricing Structures:

• Market-linked pricing: Formulas tied to lithium carbonate spot prices with floor and ceiling provisions

• Fixed-price components: Base volume commitments at predetermined rates

• Escalation clauses: Adjustments for inflation, production costs, or regulatory changes

• Quality premiums: Additional pricing for battery-grade specifications and purity standards

Supply Chain Resilience Considerations

Risk Mitigation Strategies:

• Geographic diversification: Multiple supply sources across different jurisdictions

• Partner diversification: Balanced offtake agreements with various processing facilities

• Flexible delivery terms: Accommodating market demand fluctuations and operational changes

• Force majeure provisions: Protection against operational disruptions, regulatory changes, or geopolitical events

The extended timeline of the Mandrake-Stardust agreement requires particularly robust risk management frameworks to address potential market evolution over nearly two decades. Furthermore, innovative approaches like geothermal lithium extraction are emerging as potential alternative supply sources.

What Does This Mean for the Global Lithium Market?

The establishment of integrated North American lithium supply chains through agreements like the 18-year Stardust lithium offtake deal represents a fundamental shift in global market dynamics and competitive positioning.

North American Market Development Trends

The emergence of regional processing hubs is reshaping global lithium supply chain geography:

Strategic Supply Chain Centres:

• Western Canada: Developing brine and hard rock lithium resources with processing capabilities

• Nevada/Utah corridor: Established brine operations and expanding exploration activities

• North Carolina region: Spodumene processing facilities and battery manufacturing integration

• Texas/Oklahoma zone: Strategic processing centres and transportation logistics hubs

The Stardust facility in Muskogee represents a crucial link in this emerging supply chain network, processing feedstock from Mandrake's Utah operations for North American battery manufacturers. This development has attracted significant attention, with comprehensive coverage of the lithium supply agreement highlighting its strategic importance.

Investment Implications for the Lithium Sector

Capital Allocation Evolution:

• Processing focus: Increased investment in refining capacity rather than mining expansion alone

• Offtake premiums: Enhanced valuations for companies with secured long-term agreements

• Vertical integration: Growing preference for companies controlling multiple supply chain stages

The pressure on lawmakers is mounting, with many federal workers, farmers, business groups and service members pleading for Democrats to pass Republicans’ funding patch to reopen the government.

But serious obstacles continue to stand in the way, and the likelihood of a breakthrough in the coming days remains low. Democrats are still demanding a negotiation on health care, with premiums for millions of Americans set to increase this week.

“Republicans have brought the American people to the brink; Republicans have refused to do anything,” Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer quipped Thursday.

President Donald Trump on Friday called Democrats “Crazed Lunatics that have lost all sense of WISDOM and REALITY.” He said on social media that Democrats’ demands on health care “will hurt American citizens, and Republicans will not let it happen.”

Still, the extended shutdown is forcing more Senate Republicans and Democrats to the table.

Leadership-level negotiations still are not happening in earnest, and Trump has not been involved at all, but rank-and-file senators are having conversations about the path forward and eyeing multiple options for getting out of the shutdown.

Those options include passing fiscal 2026 appropriations bills to reestablish some semblance of trust among lawmakers and get agencies back open one by one.

However, Democrats recently blocked one spending bill on the floor, and House Speaker Mike Johnson has so far rejected the possibility of bringing the House back into session for anything other than reopening the whole government.

Appropriators say they are continuing to work on full-year appropriations bills, but they have not made any discernible progress in weeks.

Trump last week called for Senate Republicans to scrap the filibuster in order to allow the GOP majority to pass its funding bill without needing Democratic support. But Republican leaders quickly shot down that possibility because of the precedent it would set.

Meanwhile, Republicans’ current funding proposal would reopen the government only through Nov. 21, leaving little time for Congress to process a longer-term funding plan.

In search of ‘critical mass’

Conversations between Senate Republicans and Democrats are ramping up, and senators said those conversations continued through the weekend, though there did not appear to be a meaningful compromise in sight.

Senate Majority Leader John Thune said last week that discussions had not yet reached a “critical mass.”

The South Dakota Republican also reiterated that Trump would be open to meeting with Democratic leaders on health care this week — but only if Democrats vote to open the government first, which has been a nonstarter for Schumer and his party.

“The government’s been open all year, up until the last few weeks, and they refused to work with us on [health care], so how are we supposed to believe that?” said Senate Appropriations Vice Chair Patty Murray (D-Wash.).

Trump remains the biggest X-factor for ending the shutdown. Democrats insist that the president must become involved in the discussions and give congressional Republicans the green light to negotiate on health care to create an off-ramp.

“I don’t think the Congress can reach agreement at this point without him, I just don’t,” said Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D-Ohio), a senior appropriator who attended one of Johnson’s daily press conferences last week, watching from the back of the room.

“This should be his first order of business, to call these leaders and get them to agree,” Kaptur said of Trump. “He’s a dealmaker. Make a deal.”

Thune has downplayed the possibility of serious talks with Democratic leaders, given their apparent intransigence, but he indicated that talks with rank-and-file Democrats could “be fruitful.”

Sen. Lisa Murkowski (R-Alaska), another senior appropriator, has called for senators to stay in Washington until they work out a deal.

Pressure points

The shutdown’s worsening impacts on Americans could get more Democrats to break from their party leaders and vote for Republicans’ continuing resolution, but the Democratic caucus has not shown many signs of cracking yet.

Johnson and House Republican leaders have been using their daily press conferences to highlight the funding lapse’s impacts on national parks, farmers, air traffic controllers and other groups, while blaming Democrats for those repercussions.

Airlines and a major union representing thousands of federal workers have called on Congress to pass Republicans’ continuing resolution.

“Just vote for the CR, and people will stop getting hurt,” House Majority Whip Tom Emmer said Friday on CNBC.

Senators have proposed various bills to fund specific programs, such as nutrition assistance and to pay air traffic controllers as flight delays pile up.

However, Thune, Johnson and the White House have all dismissed those so-called rifle-shot bills. They say that strategy represents a patchwork approach that leaves most needs unaddressed while relieving pressure on lawmakers to end the shutdown entirely.

“They’re not going to get on the floor,” said Sen. John Kennedy (R-La.) of those bills. “The Democrats get right up to it and then they pull back. … Thune says he’s tired of playing the games; he’s not going to put them on the floor.”

Some observers also believe off-cycle elections this week in New Jersey and Virginia could provide an off-ramp for some Democrats to get behind the GOP funding bill, but Democrats have not taken any of the other off-ramps Republicans have eyed as potential dealmakers.

Progress on fiscal 2026 bills

Appropriators say they are continuing to work behind the scenes on finalizing full-year spending bills in hopes of Congress making some progress on fiscal 2026 spending.

“Every day the government remains shut, the risk to full-year appropriations grows,” House Appropriations Chair Tom Cole (R-Okla.) said in a statement. “We are losing daylight fast.”

A three-bill package containing the Agriculture, Legislative Branch and Military Construction-Veterans Affairs bills has already been informally negotiated. But Republican leaders are still looking for unanimous consent to send it to a bipartisan conference negotiation with the House.

“It’s really [about] working out something with the [Democrats],” said Sen. John Hoeven (R-N.D.), chair of the Agriculture Appropriations Subcommittee. “I think that’ll be part of it as we go to approps and to Defense approps, which is good. That’s what we should do.”

Democrats last week were gauging interest in various other potential spending bill packages, according to Punchbowl News, including one containing the Defense, Labor-HHS-Education, Transportation-HUD and Commerce-Justice-Science bills.

The Energy-Water bill is unlikely to be formally finalized or marked up anytime soon. Kennedy, the chair of that subcommittee, said last week that his understanding was the bill had been finalized.

However, Murray, the top Democrat on the Energy-Water Subcommittee, said Wednesday that she and Kennedy did not yet have a final agreement.

A spokesperson for Senate Appropriations Chair Susan Collins (R-Maine) also said last week that the Energy-Water Subcommittee was continuing to work on the bill.

Eliminating the filibuster

The fastest way to end the shutdown would be for Senate Republicans to get rid of the filibuster, which prevents the majority from passing spending legislation without some buy-in from the minority.

But the idea has little support among Senate Republicans and faces stiff resistance from leadership to the rank-and-file — even with Trump calling for that approach.

“It is now time for the Republicans to play their ‘TRUMP CARD,’ and go for what is called the Nuclear Option — Get rid of the Filibuster, and get rid of it, NOW!” Trump wrote on Truth Social last week.

Sen. John Curtis (R-Utah) wrote on X that the filibuster “forces us to find common ground in the Senate.” He said, “Power changes hands, but principles shouldn’t. I’m a firm no on eliminating it.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/ba/a5/5cee1a024cee82d3ba0bada1c4bc/u-s-congress-40555.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 07:58:35.552978

S&P Global Mobility estimates that about 64,000 new electric vehicles were sold in October — less than half of the nearly 150,000 EVs sold in September, as buyers rushed to take advantage of the final days of the federal incentive. Plug-in hybrids suffered as well, dropping from 2.2% of sales in September to just 1% in October.

A Post-Tax-Credit Reality Check

“The automotive industry is experiencing a significant recalibration,” said Tyson Jominy, senior vice president at J.D. Power. With federal incentives gone, EVs are now competing on price and performance alone, and that’s proving to be a tough sell for many consumers.

The sudden decline, however, isn’t just about higher prices. Analysts say the market is also dealing with what S&P Global calls an “EV hangover” — a pull-forward effect caused by the summer buying surge. With so many customers rushing to buy EVs before the tax credit expired, the following months were bound to see a sharp dip.

Still, it could have been worse. “Manufacturer actions to reduce EV prices and increase discounts are helping maintain affordability,” noted Thomas King, president of J.D. Power’s data and analytics division.

Automakers Scramble To Keep EVs Moving

To keep inventory moving, automakers are now offering aggressive incentives. Hyundai cut prices for the 2026 Ioniq 5 by up to $9,800. BMW offered $7,500 lease credits through October. Other brands, including Ford, Nissan, and Volkswagen, have rolled out similar deals to offset the lost tax credit.

Even so, the broader EV landscape looks uncertain. The Trump administration’s rollback of emissions rules and the suspension of California’s EV sales mandate mean automakers no longer face penalties for delaying electrification. As a result, many are shifting focus back to their gas-powered best-sellers.

A Widening Pullback Across the Industry

Several automakers have already hit the brakes on their EV plans:

Acura axed its ZDX SUV after just one model year.

Ford paused production of the F-150 Lightning through year-end.

General Motors will build the 2027 Chevrolet Bolt on one shift instead of two, laying off 1,750 workers.

Kia delayed its EV4 sedan “until further notice.”

This wave of production slowdowns reflects broader anxiety about EV demand and profitability. S&P Global Mobility now expects “continued volatility” in EV sales and “a significant drop in adoption” through the end of 2025.

Short-Term Pain, Long-Term Potential

Most experts still believe the U.S. EV market will recover and expand over the next few years, though at a slower pace than during the Biden era. Technological progress, falling battery costs, and improved infrastructure will help, but in the near term, the road ahead looks rough.

For now, the EV boom has hit a speed bump — one that could reshape how automakers, policymakers, and consumers approach the electric future.",http://evdances.com/cdn/shop/articles/2026_Kia_EV4_First_Look.jpg?v=1762162987,N,,2025-11-03 13:12:07.018346

“Reallocating every exempted gallon is not just the right thing to do, or the smartest thing to do for the market — it’s also what the law clearly requires,” said Growth Energy CEO Emily Skor. “EPA and this Administration made a promise to rural America to get the RFS back on track — reallocating any less than 100% of all the 2023-2025 SREs EPA has granted would break that promise, and farmers and rural communities would suffer because of it. We urge EPA to commit to full reallocation, and we look forward to continuing our work with the agency to increase American energy dominance through the increased use of homegrown biofuels.”

Comments from groups like Growth Energy and the National Corn Growers Association, encouraged EPA to finalize the supplemental proposal it released in September. This would ensure that the agency accounts for every lost biofuel gallon exempted by EPA’s August 2025 decision to grant several SREs for the 2023-2025 Renewable Volume Obligation (RVO) compliance years. The comments also highlight the legal obligation EPA has to fully reallocate these gallons and the negative impacts to the industry and the rural economy if EPA decides to not reallocate, or to reallocate only a portion of the exempted volumes.

“A strong, transparent, and balanced RFS remains a cornerstone of America’s agricultural and energy success,” said National Corn Growers Association CEO Neil Caskey.

Mike Braun’s post-election fundraising committees continue to draw major support from Indiana’s business community less than a year into his first term as governor, according to new Federal Election Commission filings.

While the latest reports show limited activity in one as it transitions into a political action committee, another has served as a major fundraising hub, routing hundreds of thousands of dollars to accounts linked to Braun and the Indiana Republican Party.

Team Braun — a joint fundraising committee for Braun’s state and federal campaign activities — reported $432,500 in total contributions so far raised this year, ending September with $77,943 cash on hand and no debt, according to FEC data.

The political action committee, or PAC, acts as a conduit for fundraising events that benefit multiple accounts, including the Freedom and Opportunity Fund, Mike Braun for Indiana and the Indiana Republican State Committee.

Story continues below.

Separately, Braun’s former campaign committee, Mike Braun for Indiana, officially renamed itself the Freedom and Opportunity Fund earlier this year and reported limited activity in the most recent reports. The move allows the governor to continue raising and distributing federal campaign funds in support of other candidates and political efforts now that he’s not running for federal office.

The account reported $18,207 in total receipts — meaning new money that came into the committee — between Jan. 1 and June 30, according to filings covering the first half of 2025. But there were no individual or committee contributions during that period.

Story continues below.

202509089789854351

Instead, the committee reported $3,991 in candidate refunds and $12,316 in spending, primarily bank interest and reimbursements from vendors for prior campaign-related expenses.

From June through September, the PAC reported $354,556 in total disbursements, including roughly $350,000 in transfers to affiliated committees, such as Team Braun. Operating expenditures — mainly administrative costs — totaled about $3,457. No independent expenditures, loans or contribution refunds were reported.

The Freedom and Opportunity Fund ended the quarter with $77,943 in cash on hand, and no debts owed to or by the committee.

Joint committee handled most fundraising and transfers

Most of Team Braun’s reported financial activity involved distributing money to its partner committees rather than spending it directly.

The latest FEC report shows the joint committee raised $70,000 in new contributions during September, bringing its year-to-date total to $432,500 — all from individual donors.

Federal filings detail $351,099 in total transfers, including:

$206,675 to Mike Braun for Indiana

$67,232 to the Freedom and Opportunity Fund

$62,252 to the Indiana Republican State Committee’s federal account

$4,980 to the state-level Indiana Republican State Committee

$9,960 to the Hoosiers for Opportunity, Prosperity and Enterprise Victory Fund, a separate joint fundraising vehicle

Other expenditures were small and technical — about $2,000 in fees to CMDI and Anedot Inc. for credit-card and software services, plus bank fees.

The filings also identify a wave of large donors in recent months, most giving $5,000 or more through Team Braun. Among them:

Viswanath Atluri of Carmel, president of VTSI – $12,500

Amar Venkata Bukkasagaram of Fishers, director at Alithya – $12,500

Jordan Caldwell of Shelbyville, executive at Caldwell’s Inc. – $10,000

Mark Elwood of Columbus, executive at Elwood Staffing – $7,500

John Engelbrecht of Evansville, CEO of South Central Inc. – $5,000

Robert Kersey of Muncie, executive at American Lawn Mower – $10,000

Gary Roberts of New Castle, owner of Roberts Pipeline Inc. – $5,000

Michael Merritt of Bloomington, co-founder and retired executive at Investcorp – $5,000

Herbert Likens of Anderson, partner at Likens Farms, now retired – $2,500

Earlier in the summer, the committee attracted several other high-profile donors, including:

James Cornelius, retired chairman and CEO of Bristol-Myers Squibb – $50,000

Jeffrey Schwartz, retired executive of Simon Property Group – $20,000

Paul Thrift, president of Thompson Thrift Development – $20,000

Michael Coyle, owner of Coyle Automotive in Jeffersonville – $20,000

Christopher Reid, CEO of CRG Residential – $15,000

Janet Coyle, of Jeffersonville – $20,000

Daniel Fitzpatrick, CEO of Quality Dining in Mishawaka – $10,000

Braun’s growing political network

Neither of Braun’s federal committees reported any loans or outstanding debts, and both listed “$0” in obligations owed to or by the committees.

The Team Braun filings also show the committee as a clearinghouse for joint fundraising events — gatherings where donors can write a single check that’s divided among multiple Republican committees.

Each of the large transfers was described in filings as a “transfer of joint fundraising proceeds.”

The structure mirrors how other sitting governors with federal campaign histories have kept their donor networks active through PACs and joint committees. It also positions Braun to remain a player in Indiana Republican fundraising circles ahead of the 2026 and 2028 election cycles.

Both committees are next due to file quarterly reports with the FEC in January 2026, which will provide a fuller picture of Braun’s post-campaign fundraising and political activity.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/01292025_SOTS_01-2048x1367.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 12:13:24.767305

Environmental and social costs: the overlooked risks While the green energy transition demands critical minerals, it can also present a sustainability paradox.","Africa's mineral riches are vital to the global energy transition – but historic exploitation could repeat itself if they do not benefit local economies.

A new World Bank study outlines the potential environmental and social costs if this wealth departs elsewhere.

The study offers six pathways to ensuring these resources generate the millions of jobs needed by young Africans over the next decade.

For decades, Africa’s mineral riches have fuelled a paradox: Vast underground wealth paired with poverty above. Now the energy transition places the continent at the heart of global decarbonization. Africa holds 75% of global cobalt, 68% of manganese, and 59% of graphite reserves. Yet without deliberate action, these resources risk repeating history: Extraction that bypasses local economies and deepens inequality.

The stakes are generational. Over 360 million young Africans will enter the workforce in the next decade. Without bold action, more than half risk being shut out of productive work – despite sitting atop the very minerals needed to power clean energy technologies that are supposed to be at the vanguard of 21st-century industry.

A new era for resource power

This isn’t a commodity boom that will bust. Demand for energy transition minerals will triple by 2030 and quadruple by 2040, fuelled by the structural shift to decarbonization and mounting climate pressures.

A new World Bank study across Eastern and Southern Africa, with deep dives into Burundi, Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), Malawi, South Africa and Zambia, makes the stakes clear: Without deliberate action, this transition risks becoming just another wave of extraction without transformation, deepening exclusion and igniting new fault-lines. The research charts both pathways forward and pressure points to avoid:

Six pathways to convert minerals into jobs in Africa

The study offers concrete strategies to ensure mineral wealth generates the 211 million jobs over the next decade that young Africans need:

1. Community voice in decision-making

Enforceable legal frameworks giving affected communities substantive roles in mining decisions, including employment commitments, training programmes and benefit-sharing arrangements; and accessible grievance mechanisms. Civil society support should enable communities to advocate effectively for local hiring and economic participation.

2. Strategic infrastructure investments

Investment in renewable energy, transport corridors (like the Lobito Atlantic Railway) and industrial zones that serve both mining operations and surrounding communities.

3. Inclusive workforce development

Technical training programmes co-designed with industry to match actual job requirements. Successful programmes combine classroom instruction with on-the-job experience and placement services. Such initiatives must intentionally address structural barriers preventing women, youth and minorities from accessing opportunities. Inclusion frameworks need teeth, including monitoring systems and leadership accountability.

4. Formalizing artisanal mining to preserve livelihoods

Rather than criminalizing artisanal operators, creating realistic pathways to formalization through affordable licensing, designated mining zones, access to formal markets, and technical and financial support. Gender-responsive strategies should ensure women’s participation.

5. Governance capacity that matches ambition

Building technical capability of regulatory bodies through sustained support, including tools, training and resources for independent monitoring. Transparency mechanisms, including public disclosure of mineral contracts, revenues and beneficial ownership.

6. Local content policies that work

Targeted procurement strategies incentivizing companies to source from domestic suppliers, particularly SMEs. Supplier development programmes, access to finance, capacity-building on industry standards. But these must be intentionally inclusive, as women-owned businesses and marginalized entrepreneurs remain locked out without deliberate targeting.

Critical pressure points that could derail progress on energy transition

Without deliberate action on these pathways, the study identifies critical pressure points where growing demand intersects with entrenched exclusion:

1. Environmental and social costs: the overlooked risks

While the green energy transition demands critical minerals, it can also present a sustainability paradox. Mining for these transition minerals can intensify environmental degradation, including land disruption, water scarcity, pollution and biodiversity loss – threatening ecosystems and communities alike. The social costs are equally significant: displacement of local populations, disruption of livelihoods, and human rights impacts often go overlooked amid the urgency for clean energy.

2. The employment squeeze: large-scale vs. artisanal mining

Across the region, artisanal and small-scale mining (ASM) sustains millions of livelihoods and produces substantial mineral output. Yet governments and international buyers increasingly favour large-scale operations, viewing them as better aligned with ESG standards, even though they typically create fewer jobs per tonne of mineral extracted. The result? Growing tensions, confrontations and missed employment opportunities.

3. The value-addition gap

Raw ore leaves African ports. Finished batteries return as imports. This pattern persists because moving up the value chain, from extraction to processing to manufacturing, requires simultaneous advances in energy infrastructure, technical skills and policy coordination that most African nations have struggled to develop. Zambia and DRC are developing battery precursor facilities. South Africa’s manufacturing base positions it for component production. But the window is closing. Governments across Africa are now negotiating long-term mining contracts with multinational companies. The terms they accept, whether requiring local processing, technology transfer, joint ventures, or allowing simple extraction and export, will determine whether countries capture processing jobs or remain locked in pure extraction for another generation.

4. Skills mismatch and training gaps

Even when mining operations expand, jobs remain unfilled because workers lack required skills. Technical and vocational training programmes rarely align with industry needs. Without deliberate investment in education, technical training tailored to sector needs, and programmes that intentionally target women and marginalized groups, mineral development will create jobs that locals cannot fill; instead, they use imported expertise where local employment was promised.

5. Systematic exclusion

Women and marginalized groups face persistent barriers. In South Africa, women make up just 12-13% of the formal mining workforce and earn 40% less than men. In the DRC, it’s only 4%. Similar exclusions affect Indigenous communities, migrants and persons with disabilities, many of whom face legal and institutional barriers to formal participation. For example, in Malawi and Zambia, ASM licenses are restricted to citizens, barring migrant inclusion.

6. Communities without voice

Mining consultations do not systematically include the people most affected. In South Africa’s platinum belt, company consultations have largely excluded women, youth and farm dwellers, yet these groups bear direct impacts. In Zambia, where some

traditional leaders negotiate deals without broader community input, the result is

benefit-sharing agreements that don’t reflect local employment needs.

The choice ahead

Companies and governments now recognize that the fastest path to secure supply chains involves genuine partnerships with local communities that deliver measurable outcomes: local hiring, skills training, supplier development and quality jobs. Between 2021-2023, protests disrupted 334 mining sites across copper, cobalt, lithium and nickel projects, demonstrating that a social license to operate can now serve as veto power.

It’s a clash months in the making, and one that could frustrate a range of major initiatives that affect hundreds of millions of Americans.

The Trump administration has been tearing down Biden-era energy programs and aiming to quickly deliver a dramatic overhaul to the U.S. electricity grid. It wants to jump-start a fleet of artificial intelligence data centers, keep fossil fuels on the electricity grid, boost next-generation nuclear reactors and stabilize electricity prices.

Electric utilities, meanwhile, are slow-moving machines that operate on the five- to 10-year planning cycles that are necessary to make sure there’s enough electricity for U.S. households and businesses.

“Utilities are trying to make investments in 60-year assets. If one administration does a 180 from the previous administration, it’s nearly impossible for utilities to make any such investments,” said Rob Gramlich, founder of the Grid Strategies consultancy.

The universe of utilities, which run the power lines and grid infrastructure that turn the lights on for Americans, is large and diverse. Some companies are private; others are publicly owned. They represent different geographies and different resource portfolios.

But according to interviews with 10 energy insiders, some of whom were granted anonymity to speak freely about private interactions with the White House, many utilities are concerned with the Trump administration’s push for hyperscalers to secure off-grid power and its use of emergency orders to keep fossil fuel plants running.

While utilities applaud the administration’s push for more electricity and permitting reform, some executives bristle at the administration’s anti-renewables policies, which include cuts to hundreds of millions of dollars in utilities grants from the 2021 bipartisan infrastructure law and early expiration of tax credits in the Inflation Reduction Act.

All of that comes as utility bills skyrocket across the U.S. Utilities have requested or received approval for roughly $34 billion in rate hikes through September, according to a new report from the nonprofit PowerLines. Nearly 200 million Americans face higher utility bills, the study said.

In a message on Truth Social in October, President Donald Trump said electricity prices are on the ballot in gubernatorial polls Tuesday in New Jersey and Virginia.

“If you vote Republican, your Energy Costs are going to go down, tremendously!” Trump said. “If you vote Democrat, your Energy Costs are going to go ‘through the roof,’ making Energy virtually unaffordable for you and your family to pay.”

Democrats are also embracing electricity prices as a campaign issue.

Meanwhile, the U.S. faces an electricity demand surge unseen in a generation. Some analysis suggests demand could spike 50 percent by midcentury.

“For 30 or 40 years, electricity issues seemed rather dull. Many utilities had no real load growth,” said Theresa Pugh, a veteran energy industry consultant. “Now, there’s this perfect storm of ‘how fast can we build new manufacturing, semiconductor plants and data centers — all at the same time.’ I never in my lifetime expected electricity demand to increase the way it’s expected to.”

Spiking electricity demand

Much of the projected demand increases are driven by artificial intelligence data center projects. The Trump administration routinely says the U.S. must win the AI race with China; Energy Secretary Chris Wright has called AI the “Manhattan Project of our time.”

“Every megawatt of electricity is necessary to power the AI arms race, especially after Joe Biden’s Green New Scam forced power plants into retirement before the end of their useful life,” White House spokesperson Taylor Rogers said in a statement.

But that demand is likely to spike bills, according to a range of analyses. To placate concerns about the impact of AI demand on consumer electricity bills, Trump, speaking at the White House recently, said data center developers are “building their own electricity,” a situation sometimes referred to as power co-location.

“They’ve become a utility, in a sense,” Trump said. “We’re letting them build their own electricity so we don’t have to worry about the grid.”

DOE is asking industry for advice to address the projected increase in demand — and the Edison Electric Institute, an influential lobbying group representing for-profit utilities, says it’s collaborating with the White House.

“We’re working regularly with officials across the Administration and share the same goals of making the grid more reliable and energy more affordable,” EEI President Drew Maloney, who served at the Treasury Department in Trump’s first term, said in a statement.

Still, many electricity experts say relying on off-grid power at data centers is impractical. Redundancy is needed in case of a disruption at a plant. And the grid helps to modulate electricity to help data centers run smoothly.

Some utility experts view the White House grid plans as a financial threat.

“For some utilities, co-location presents some concerns to the business model,” said a lobbyist who represents companies that oppose emissions regulations and was granted anonymity to speak freely. “The challenge is that the utility sector is on a five- to seven-year buildout schedule for any significant amount of generation, and the AI sector is in an 18-month demand cycle.”

The Trump administration, staffed heavily by oil and gas industry leaders, is short on utility veterans. Wright, for example, led hydraulic fracturing services company Liberty Energy before his confirmation to the Cabinet. A lobbyist with close ties to the administration said fossil fuel companies want to sidestep utilities to power data centers.

“The biggest conflict that’s emerging is the friction between the utility model and the oil and gas business model for these larger companies that want to get into the merchant power business of supporting data centers,” the lobbyist said. “The oil and gas folks say these guys are trying to stop us from innovating and keep us out of their market because they see us as an existential threat to their business model. And the White House is very sympathetic to that.”

For now, the industry is looking to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, an independent agency, to nail down rules for data center co-location. Wright is calling on FERC to also craft rules on data center interconnections to the grid. He floated measures that include prioritizing projects that commit to curtailing consumption during peak demand.

Capstone, a consultancy, said recently that Wright’s directive to FERC is “largely negative for investor-owned utilities … which will likely fight to ensure states retain jurisdiction over large load interconnection processes.”

To make matters worse, utilities and hyperscalers don’t have much experience together, according to some in the industry.

“Utilities and technology companies still don’t speak the same language, and now we’re all in the same sandbox,” said Richard Ward, a senior policy adviser at Venable and a former lobbyist for EEI. “Collaboration isn’t optional anymore; it’s the only way forward.”

On top of that, many of the policies that directly determine electricity rates take place at state-level utility commissions.

“The hardest part is that most of this plays out at the state level. Washington can set the tone, but it can’t just flip a switch and solve everything overnight,” Ward said. “The federal government needs to stay focused on the looming energy supply gap. The shortfall everyone’s projecting isn’t theoretical—it’s coming fast.”

Renewable opposition and fossil fuel fiat

The Trump administration earlier this year tried to halt work on the 80 percent-complete Revolution Wind farm offshore of Rhode Island, and it has threatened to derail more wind projects.

And last month, the Trump administration canceled a review for a major solar project in Nevada that was approved by the Biden team. Across the board, the administration is frustrating permits for wind and solar farms on public lands.

Yet utilities in recent years have dramatically boosted plans for renewables. Solar accounted for more than half of electricity capacity added to the grid in the first half of 2025, according to an influential solar association. Batteries, meanwhile, are likely to account for roughly a quarter of all grid installations this year.

“Whether any given utility loves or hates renewables, most of them are relying heavily on renewables and storage for a large part of their portfolios to meet demand in the 2020s,” said Gramlich of Grid Strategies.

Experts in the energy sector fear a Democratic backlash in the future.

“There’s also the trepidation that eventually, at some point, Democrats will be back in the majority. Would we really want them doing the same thing to baseload or dispatchable resources?” said another energy lobbyist.

Meanwhile, the Department of Energy this year deployed emergency powers to keep a set of fossil fuel plants running, arguing the power is needed to stave off blackouts.

DOE, for example, ordered the Michigan utility Consumers Energy to continue operating the J.H. Campbell coal plant until at least Nov. 19, even though Consumers said the emergency order raised net costs at least $80 million this year.

Speaking on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly in September, Wright said utilities support the emergency orders.

“Now we’re just talking with utilities,” he said. “More utilities are coming out of the woodwork, saying, ‘Shoot, we got forced to agree to close our coal plants. Can you help us? We don’t want to close our coal plants.’”

Duke Energy, a major U.S. utility operating in the Southeast and elsewhere, is planning to delay retirements for three coal plants. But many experts say the administration is overreaching.

“A lot of these retiring plants tend to be very old,” said the lobbyist who spoke about a Democratic backlash in the future. “Utilities shouldn’t be forced to keep them open.”

Rogers, the White House spokesperson, said DOE “will continue using emergency powers to ensure American communities do not experience blackouts or brownouts.”

The foreseeable future is likely to be messy for White House plans on electricity. Still, some experts say the administration is a long-term boon for the utility sector.

“There will be tension and push-pull in the sausage making because utilities have made decisions to close plants or build renewables,” said Tom Pyle, president for the American Energy Alliance, a conservative group that advocates for limited government. “But the Trump administration is a bright spot for utilities of all types because he wants to expand the pie across the board.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/99/07/f52f387a4ecb937b9ca2c5cd2f8f/draft-dabbs-trump-vs-utilities.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 07:59:16.623194

Wells Fargo joins as tax equity partner for Enlight’s New Mexico project

Enlight’s fifth U.S. tax equity partnership brings total to nearly $1 billion in value

Quail Ranch, a 128 MW solar and 400 MWh storage project, is expected to reach COD toward the end of 2025

TEL AVIV, Israel, Nov. 03, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Enlight Renewable Energy (TASE & NASDAQ: ENLT), a global renewable energy IPP and developer, announced today that its U.S. subsidiary Clēnera Holdings has closed a tax equity agreement with Wells Fargo Bank N.A. (Wells Fargo) for the Quail Ranch project in New Mexico.

Under the agreement, Wells Fargo will provide tax equity financing, including a contribution following commercial operation (COD) of $131 million, expected to increase to nearly $150 million when including pay-go contributions over the first 10 years of operation.

The Quail Ranch project, a co-located solar and energy storage project totaling 128 MW of solar generation and 400 MWh of energy storage, involves a total investment of $275 million. The project is expected to achieve commercial operation towards the end of 2025. Once fully operational, it is expected to generate annual revenues of approximately $24 million in its first full operating year and EBITDA of around $17 million. The project shares interconnection infrastructure with Atrisco, leveraging Enlight’s “Connect and Expand” strategy to utilize large interconnections for incremental capacity and cost efficiencies.

Quail Ranch benefits from a 20-year busbar power purchase agreement (PPA) with Public Service Company of New Mexico (PNM), an investment-grade offtaker, consistent with Enlight’s U.S. projects to date and providing stable, long-term revenues over the contract term.

The tax equity financing is expected to provide production tax credits (PTC) for the solar component and investment tax credits (ITC) for the storage component. Quail Ranch is also expected to qualify for the 10% Energy Community Adder under the Inflation Reduction Act. Quail Ranch is Enlight’s fifth tax equity deal in the United States. Altogether, the company’s U.S. portfolio has nearly $1 billion in tax equity arrangements.

“The Quail Ranch tax equity deal marks another step forward in scaling our U.S. platform,” said Adi Leviatan, CEO of Enlight. “Welcoming a top-tier institution like Wells Fargo as our partner affirms both the strength of the project and the robustness of our portfolio strategy. We’re proud to continue building long-term, trusted partnerships that expand access to reliable, affordable clean power at scale.”

“The Quail Ranch facility builds on our success in New Mexico,” said Jared McKee, CEO of Clēnera. “Our partnerships power that success and this tax equity arrangement with Wells Fargo is one more way we are executing our growth strategy in the U.S.”

Guelph, Canada

“In 2026, Guelph will execute its Race to Zero commitment with bold, tangible action. This includes issuing an additional $4 million for the Guelph Greener Homes programme to fund energy upgrades and cut utility costs. Construction will begin on the new Guelph Transit and Fleet Services Facility, adding 50 electric chargers to support the ongoing transition and expansion of the city's electric bus fleet,” said Mayor of Guelph, Cam Guthrie.

Hobart, Australia

""In 2026, Hobart will accelerate its strategy to become a zero emissions, resilient city by 2040. The city is using AI mapping to guide urban greening, addressing areas with canopy cover as low as 7% in the CBD and pushing toward a 40% canopy target by 2046. Hobart will also introduce a new policy encouraging the development of more than 3,000 dwellings across the city by 2040. This is a critical move to protect natural areas and make life easier and cheaper for residents by supporting efficient public transport, walking, and cycling,"" said Lord Mayor of Hobart, Anna Reynolds.

Quito, Ecuador

“Under its Climate Action Plan (PACQ), the Metropolitan District of Quito is strengthening its commitment to a healthier, greener, and more resilient urban future. The city will construct four major wastewater treatment plants, beginning with the Cumbayá–Tumbaco facility in 2026, and finalise the Calderón Drinking Water Treatment Plant. Through the “Quito, Greener Than Ever” initiative, 100.000 native trees will be planted to restore fire-affected areas and improve biodiversity. During 2026, new electric buses will be integrated into the public transport system. That same year, Quito will begin developing a new environmental complex for waste treatment using sustainable technologies,” said Mayor of Quito, Pabel Muñoz.

Rotterdam, The Netherlands

“In Rotterdam we are wiring the future of mobility, ensuring zero-emission transport works for every resident and business. Rotterdam has already installed over 8,000 public charging points, guaranteeing everyone is within 200 meters of a station. We are now drastically expanding this network with 1,000 new points, 80 fast chargers, and three heavy-duty locations to support clean port freight by 2026. This is smart infrastructure, fueled by innovation like utilising unused metro capacity, making our entire city cleaner and our green economy stronger,” said Mayor of Rotterdam, Carola Schouten.

Santiago, Chile

“In 2026, Santiago will complete the first phase of the Pocket Forests program, an initiative that aims to create 33 small native forests in neighbourhoods with limited green areas and high exposure to extreme heat. The Pocket Forests are a key measure for climate adaptation, helping the city respond to rising temperatures and environmental stress. Through this initiative, we will plant more than 30,000 native trees, expanding equitable access to nature, improving air quality, enhancing local biodiversity, and strengthening urban resilience,” said Governor of the Metropolitan Region of Santiago de Chile, Claudio Benjamin Orrego.

Tshwane, South Africa

""In 2026, Tshwane will revitalise heat-exposed and socially vulnerable urban areas through large-scale tree planting, improved waste management and focused urban maintenance. These actions will cool public spaces, reduce pollution and create safer, walkable and bike-friendly environments. Through the Mayor’s weekly Re A Spana campaign, meaning “we are working”, city teams will continue to lead clean-up and greening operations across all regions.

By the end of 2026, Tshwane will have hosted more than 50 Re A Spana campaigns across the city, planted 100,000 trees and developed 7 Community Gardens thus advancing our vision of a more inclusive and climate-resilient capital city,"" said Executive Mayor of Tshwane, Dr Nasiphi Moya.

Wuhan, China

In 2026, Wuhan will continue to improve the urban environment by protecting and restoring Xibeihu Lake. The project will see volunteers and residents work together to document biodiversity, remove invasive species, and keep the lake clean. This will improve the local ecosystem, act as a natural filter, and provide health and recreational benefits for the community. Beihu Community will strengthen pollution control by optimising public service facilities and improving the rain and sewage system around the lake. Meanwhile, a new garden initiative will transform unused spaces like rooftops into biodiversity hotspots, using sustainable practices like composting kitchen waste to thrive.",https://c40.shorthandstories.com/from-negotiation-to-delivery-the-yearly-offer-of-action/assets/LB2UtfwG3o/lead_yooa-social-cover.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 06:19:53.454371

Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that Prop 50 is likely to pass.
If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans shifted their direction in Texas earlier this year.
Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50.
Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said.","LOS ANGELES — Adelaide Stone Van Gessel says she doesn't agree with partisan gerrymandering in practice.

But she voted yes on Proposition 50, a California ballot measure that would allow the state's Democratic leaders to temporarily bypass California's independent redistricting commission and enact a more Democratic-friendly congressional map ahead of next year's midterm elections.

Van Gessel and others who back Prop 50 told NPR the proposal provides the Democratic-leaning state a rare opportunity to directly counteract President Trump and Republican efforts to redraw political maps in their favor in other states.

""What we're doing is gerrymandering to stop gerrymandering,"" she said. ""And that's not really the best solution, but it is something that we find ourselves in this kind of environment having to do.""

Voting for the one-issue special election concludes Tuesday, with polling showing that Prop 50 is likely to pass. If it does, California's Democratic state leaders can use a new congressional map that makes five U.S. House seats more favorable to the party, offsetting the five districts Republicans shifted their direction in Texas earlier this year.

GOP lawmakers in Missouri and North Carolina have also enacted new maps, and a bipartisan deal reached last week in Ohio tilts that state's congressional map further to the right. Lawmakers in other states, including Virginia Democrats, could join the redistricting fight.

In Southern California, many left-leaning voters approving Prop 50 reported having mixed feelings about the measure, but ultimately felt that allowing a partisan gerrymander is one of the only options they have to stop Trump from shutting out a Democratic win in Congress next year.

""We can't play the game like decent people anymore,"" said Stephanie Eberstein, who, like Van Gessel, lives in the liberal LA neighborhood of Venice. ""I mean, those rules are out the window. So, we have to do what we have to do.""

In Orange County, Eva Hernandez agrees.

""We got to do something,"" Hernandez said. ""Can't just sit back and let things roll like they've been rolling. … California's got to do it. We're a blue state. We got to do what we got to do to counteract that.""

Republican voters in California fear losing representation

With surveys showing Prop 50 likely to be approved, it appears none of the opposition's arguments against the measure is truly landing in a state that is strongly Democratic.

A number of voters told NPR they're focused on the current proposal, and could not recall how they voted about 15 years ago, when the state's citizen-led, nonpartisan redistricting commission was enacted.

Kathy Brewer voted no on Prop 50. She lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, one of a few GOP-leaning enclaves in Southern California. She told NPR she thinks this special election and redraw are unnecessary.

""It's a waste of money,"" she said. ""Of good California money that we need.""

Betty Roth is another no vote. She says that as a Republican she already feels pretty powerless in the state.

Out of the 52 seats California has in the U.S. House, only nine are currently held by Republicans. Roth says she doesn't want the GOP to lose what little representation it has.

""They're trying to take away the vote from a good portion of the American people by, you know, gerrymandering,"" she said.

But a lot of Democratic voters don't feel much sympathy for this argument.

Aaron Leal, who also lives in Rancho Santa Margarita, says Republicans are trying to rig the midterms in their favor because they aren't sure they can win on policy. He says the party is practically forcing Democrats to react.

""If one side is going full force pushing their agenda, we cannot bring, as they say, like a knife to a gunfight,"" he said.

Leal says he also likes that the measure is temporary. After 2030, the state would go back to the independent redistricting commission.

""Somebody has to do something""

Polling shows the Democratic base has been largely frustrated with their leaders — mostly because they haven't been able to do much.

""The Democrats haven't really fought back and done anything to combat what's going on with the Republican Party and Trump,"" said David Checel in Culver City. ""So, yeah. I don't know what you're supposed to do on this, and I'm glad I'm not a politician.""

Checel wasn't thrilled about Prop 50 but voted in favor of it because it's better than doing nothing, he said.

Other Democrats say they are really excited to see their leaders fight back, including Reina Santiago in Venice.

""I'm glad that our state is taking the charge against this because somebody has to do something,"" she said. ""The GOP is totally complicit with Trump, and if we let them walk all over us, they'll do it. So that's what this vote is about.""

And while Jim Lind, who lives in Irvine, agrees with this sentiment, he said he's also pretty sad that this is what politics has become.

""It's unfortunate that any party, whatever it may be, has to stoop to a lower level to get things done,"" he said. ""You know, all my life I've probably been more idealistic as far as the honesty of people. And it's just not working out.""

The other, on carbon capture, was transferred to UConn and UL officials said they don’t know the status of it.
And a flood of federal grant money from DOE was slated to go to companies looking to build both traditional carbon capture and direct air capture projects in the state.","The Trump administration has quietly paused funding for initiatives at LSU and the University of Louisiana at Lafayette that were studying direct air capture and solar energy employment, amid a broader movement that may result in hundreds of millions of dollars in Louisiana energy projects being cut.

The funding pause comes as a list of proposed cuts by the Department of Energy has circulated in Washington, D.C. Its targets include Project Cypress in southwest Louisiana, a massive federally supported direct air capture project, as well as carbon capture projects by Entergy, Shell and Honeywell, among others.

It’s not yet clear whether the projects will ultimately be cut, and the Department of Energy declined to answer questions for this story about the list’s authenticity.

But the changes raise questions about whether Louisiana will continue to be a beneficiary of a national movement under former President Joe Biden’s administration to bring technologies like direct air capture to market. And the potential cuts come at the same time an unusual coalition of rural conservatives and environmentalists have banded together to push back against a wave of projects by petrochemical companies to store CO2 deep underground all across the state.

The DOE had already announced a round of $8 billion in funding cuts to clean energy in early October. Not long after, another list started circulating that proposed a second round of cuts, which include at least two university projects in Louisiana that have reported having their funding paused.

In all, the various cuts, pauses and proposed trims have led to an enduring state of uncertainty in parts of Louisiana’s burgeoning clean energy economy ever since U.S. President Donald Trump took office at the start of the year. The president hit the brakes on a wide array of spending, especially around clean energy and efforts to fight climate change.

“Every day, there’s a new list,” said Ramesh Kolluru, vice president for research, innovation, and economic development at the University of Louisiana at Lafayette. “It’s getting tough to keep up.”

Projects halted

Greg Upton, executive director at the Center for Energy Studies at LSU, was leading a project with Shell and the University of Houston to study the feasibility of a direct air capture project in southwest Louisiana. Direct air capture is a nascent technology that sucks CO2 directly from the air in a bid to reduce the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

Those greenhouse gases, like CO2, are the primary cause of climate change, climate scientists say. They have linked warming global temperatures with worsening hurricanes, rainfall and extreme heat.

But after finishing the first phase of the project earlier this year, the Trump administration’s communications became “limited,” Upton said, and the group was uncertain if it would be reimbursed for more work.

In a quarterly report due Friday, Upton said the group informed DOE it is pausing work on the project and laying off its employee brought on to help until it gets more clarity.

Upton said the subsequent list of proposed cuts to other direct air capture and carbon capture projects is not a surprise, given the funding pause on his and other university-led projects.

“On one hand, the Trump administration is sending a signal they’re pro-carbon capture,” Upton said. “On the other hand, you see programs like this (being cut).”

He also noted that direct air capture is different from the traditional carbon capture projects being proposed by a wide array of petrochemical companies. Direct air capture is far more expensive and less commercially viable.

Shell, a partner on the project, declined to comment. Upton said a company could still take the work they’ve completed so far and use it as a jumping-off point for a direct air capture project, even if the grant is ultimately terminated.

The University of Louisiana at Lafayette was awarded more than $3 million for two separate projects that are on the list of proposed cuts by DOE. The grants were announced in 2021 and 2023.

One, the Louisiana Solar Corps, is an initiative to bolster the state’s fledgling solar industry workforce. The plan was to train workers to build solar microgrids at churches, public buildings and National Guard bases to make the state more resilient after hurricanes knock out the power grid. The other, on carbon capture, was transferred to UConn and UL officials said they don’t know the status of it.

Kolluru, of UL, said the school “slowed” spending on the solar corps project after the DOE paused it, to avoid having to foot the bill for costs if the project is ultimately canceled. Funding is already sparse at UL, with the university recently announcing cuts to more than 70 positions as they try to chip away at a $25 million deficit.

While the school didn’t get a formal stop-work order for the solar corps project, Kolluru said, “it seemed like that was a project at risk.”

Carbon capture uncertain

A rush of companies have sought to build out a network of pipelines and wells in Louisiana to take CO2 from industrial emitters, pipe it to geologic formations around the state and inject it deep underground, a process known as carbon capture.

The reasons are twofold: Customers overseas are increasingly willing to pay more for products with a smaller carbon footprint. And the Inflation Reduction Act, one of Biden’s signature accomplishments, provided tax incentives for companies who successfully capture and store CO2.

Companies have filed 60 applications with Louisiana regulators to drill such carbon capture wells. But Gov. Jeff Landry recently signed an executive order that puts the brakes — at least temporarily — on all but six of them.

Direct air capture is further from reality. The IRA provided an even more lucrative incentive for that technology, and the DOE had allocated billions in direct federal aid to help the fledgling technology reach commercial viability.

Louisiana officials — both Republican and Democrat — have largely welcomed both technologies with open arms. And a flood of federal grant money from DOE was slated to go to companies looking to build both traditional carbon capture and direct air capture projects in the state.

The future of those projects is shaky, given the list of potential cuts that’s been circulated.

The federal government is slated to cut a project by Entergy to capture and store CO2 from its Lake Charles Power Station, a natural gas-fired plant. Other projects on the chopping block of federal grants include a plan by Honeywell to establish a plant to build battery inputs in Geismar; a Vale USA project to build an iron ore briquette facility in Convent to develop cleaner steel; and a series of grants to Battelle, part of a coalition of companies trying to establish a massive direct air capture hub in southwest Louisiana called Project Cypress.

Entergy declined to comment for this story. Vale said it was still working on its project and in communication with DOE. Honeywell didn’t respond.

Patrick Courreges, a spokesperson for the state Department of Energy and Conservation, declined to comment on the list, but said the agency hasn’t received any indication that projects running through it are on the chopping block.

It’s not yet clear which of the projects on the list — totaling more than $20 billion in federal spending — will ultimately be cut, and DOE press secretary Ben Dietderich declined to verify the list’s authenticity.

“No determinations have been made other than what has been previously announced,” Dietderich said. “As Secretary Wright made clear, the Department continues to conduct an individualized and thorough review of financial awards made by the previous administration.”

The DOE’s initial round of $8 billion in cuts largely targeted Democratic states, but the agency subsequently cut $700 million in battery projects on the second list, E&E News reported. Those projects spanned red states as well.

Vikrum Aiyer, head of global policy at Heirloom, one of the companies involved in Project Cypress, said, “We aren’t aware of a decision from DOE and continue to productively engage with the Administration in a project review.

“At this time, we’re proud to stand with the governor, state leadership, workforce development and economic development organizations and many others who are strong advocates for this project and its many economic benefits for the state. They understand that subnational governments and international jurisdictions are clamoring for DAC investments as part of the race for energy dominance, and this should not be America's lead to cede.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/e/cc/ecc024f7-a5ce-5251-a02c-c83205f4396b/637be462cb438.image.jpg?crop=1300%2C683%2C0%2C65&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-03 05:17:46.833987

What if the same fundamental principles could be applied to one of the largest, most challenging and overlooked sectors in our economy? What if the solution to a billion-gallon-a-day water problem was sitting right under our feet?

There is a colossal market hiding in plain sight: industrial process cooling. Specifically, the oil and gas refinery sector, an industry that underpins our modern world, is facing a dual crisis of heat and water that it is ill-equipped to handle. For the forward-thinking mechanical contractor, this crisis represents an unprecedented opportunity to deploy our industry’s expertise on a transformative scale.

The twin liabilities: Heat and water

To understand the opportunity, we must first grasp the sheer scale of the problem. A typical refinery is a massive heat engine, constantly generating an enormous surplus of thermal energy — often estimated at more than a billion BTUs per hour. This isn’t useful, low-grade heat; it’s a massive liability that must be continuously rejected to maintain stable operations.

For decades, the default solution has been the wet cooling tower. These colossal structures use the principle of evaporative cooling to dissipate heat. In doing so, they consume staggering volumes of water. According to industry data, more than 70% of the water pulled into a refinery’s cooling system is lost to the atmosphere as steam. This can amount to millions of gallons of water per day for a single facility.

For years, this was considered a simple cost of doing business. However, in an era of increasing water scarcity, tightening regulations and rising utility costs, that view is becoming dangerously obsolete. Water is no longer just a consumable; it’s a strategic liability. A drought or a new water rights regulation could cripple a refinery’s operations overnight.

This is where geothermal exchange transitions from a green technology to a critical tool for industrial resiliency and financial stability.

Applying a familiar solution to an industrial giant

At its core, geothermal exchange is simply about using the earth as a massive, stable thermal battery. As HVAC professionals know, the earth maintains a nearly constant temperature only a few feet below the surface year-round. This provides a perfect heat sink — a place to reject unwanted heat — that is vastly more efficient and reliable than the fluctuating ambient air.

Instead of evaporating millions of gallons of water, a geothermal system rejects a facility’s waste heat into the ground through a closed loop of buried pipes or a series of wells. The concept is identical to the commercial geothermal systems we install every day, only engineered for a much larger thermal load.

The advantages of this approach are immediate and profound:

• Drastic water reduction. By eliminating the need for evaporative cooling, geothermal exchange can reduce a refinery’s cooling water consumption by more than 90%. This directly addresses the core risk of water scarcity, insulating the facility from drought and regulatory pressure.

• Enhanced resiliency. Geothermal infrastructure is buried and protected. It isn’t vulnerable to hurricanes, winter storms or other extreme weather events that can damage or disable cooling towers, leading to costly shutdowns.

• Improved efficiency. Geothermal systems operate with unparalleled efficiency, significantly reducing the parasitic energy load required for cooling and lowering the facility’s overall peak electricity demand.

• Public health and safety. It eliminates the chemical treatments required for cooling tower water and removes the risk of Legionnaire’s disease associated with aerosolized water drift.

The financial tipping point: The IRA changes everything

While the technical and operational benefits are clear, the financial case has been transformed by the Inflation Reduction Act. This legislation has significantly reduced the risk associated with capital investment for industrial-scale geothermal projects.

The key mechanism is the Investment Tax Credit. For geothermal projects meeting standard prevailing wage and apprenticeship requirements, the IRA provides a 30% tax credit as a starting point. However, the real power is in the “stackable” bonuses. A 10% bonus is available for projects located in designated “energy communities” — a definition covering most refinery locations. Another 10% bonus can be added for using domestic iron, steel and manufactured components.

Suddenly, a project can qualify for a tax credit covering 50% or more of its total upfront cost.

Furthermore, the IRA’s “transferability” provision allows a facility to sell its tax credits to an unrelated entity for cash. This creates a liquid market for the credits, meaning the project owner can monetize the incentive immediately to help finance the construction, rather than waiting years to apply it against future tax liability. The economics have never been more favorable.

The future vision: From liability to community asset

The vision extends beyond simply solving a problem within the refinery’s fence line. By capturing the facility’s massive waste heat, rather than rejecting it, a refinery can transform itself from a thermal polluter into a valuable community energy anchor.

This is the concept behind thermal energy networks. The recovered waste heat from the refinery can be piped to a shared thermal loop, providing low-cost, carbon-free heating for nearby buildings, data centers, industrial parks or even greenhouses. The refinery not only saves money on water and energy, it creates an entirely new revenue stream by selling its waste heat.

This symbiotic relationship is already being explored. Imagine a hyperscale data center — another facility with a massive cooling demand — colocating next to a refinery. The data center can draw on the refinery’s geothermal cooling loop, while the refinery can use its waste heat to power absorption chillers, creating a virtuous cycle of efficiency and shared infrastructure.

For the mechanical and HVAC industry, this is more than a new application; it’s a call to lead a fundamental shift in how we think about energy. We have the technical expertise in heat pumps, hydronics and large-scale system integration. We are the ones who can design, build and maintain these transformative systems.

The oil and gas industry is facing a challenge it cannot solve with its traditional toolkit. It’s time for us to demonstrate that the solution is, and always has been, right beneath its feet.",https://www.phcppros.com/ext/resources/2025/10/29/PE1025_oil-refinery.jpg?height=635&t=1761742960&width=1200,N,,2025-11-03 11:10:28.252340

At a study session, Boulder city staff and leaders of Xcel Energy reviewed five years of the city's franchise and energy partnership and discussed wildfire mitigation, targeted undergrounding projects and progress toward local renewable and emissions targets.

City officials said the partnership, which took effect Jan. 1, 2021, includes a 20-year franchise with opt-out checkpoints at the five-, 10- and 15-year anniversaries. Council and staff framed the meeting as an update to inform whether the city needs additional analysis to decide whether to continue the franchise.

""Tonight's study session is an important opportunity to reflect on the city of Boulder's partnership with Xcel Energy as we marked 5 years since the franchise agreement was signed,"" City Manager Nuria Rivera Vandermeid said at the start of the presentation. Jonathan Cohen, director of the city's Climate Initiatives Department, told the council staff's goal was ""to provide an update on the partnership activities, where we are today, looking at some opportunities for improvement, and again...look to the future state of the partnership to make sure we continue to serve the needs of Boulder residents, businesses, as well as Xcel.""

City staff and Xcel officials reviewed the governance and program work that has flowed from the agreement. Carolyn Elam, senior manager overseeing the partnership for the city, outlined projects funded through the agreement's undergrounding program and other partnership initiatives. She said the city and Xcel have advanced multiple undergrounding projects timed to public works work, noting North Broadway, 19th Street and East Arapahoe projects, and a new Chautauqua project the city described as focused on community resilience and wildfire-risk reduction. Elam said those projects, together with others, ""will represent at least the 16 plus million dollars that were part of the first 5 years.""

Xcel executives described how wildfire mitigation, system hardening and communications were being advanced across their service territory, and how those tactics fit into broader decarbonization plans. Robert Kenny, president of Xcel Energy's Colorado operating company, said Xcel has grouped its wildfire work into situational awareness (weather cameras and detection), system hardening (targeted undergrounding, covered conductor and conductor upsizing), and operational mitigations (enhanced power-line safety settings and the public-safety power shutoff or PSPS). ""We've only employed PSPS once,"" Kenny said, and he acknowledged that communications after the single April PSPS event ""had significant opportunity for improvement,"" which Xcel said it has tried to address in its wildfire mitigation plan.

Xcel emphasized a number of other partnership accomplishments and plans discussed in staff materials: the city's targets for 100% renewable electricity and 100 megawatts of local installed generation by 2030, an inventory of partnership focus areas (efficiency, electrification of buildings and transportation, local generation and storage, and resilience), and partnership projects including a Department of Energy-funded virtual power plant pilot in Boulder. Xcel also outlined its distribution-system planning and an electric resource ""Just Transition"" solicitation that it said could add thousands of megawatts of new wind, solar and storage to replace retiring coal plants.

Council members pressed Xcel on several topics. Multiple council members cited the April PSPS event and asked how Xcel will shorten restoration times and provide better advance notice. Kenny said Xcel's intent is to give layered notice (72, 48 and 24 hours as forecasts firm up) and to preposition crews and use drones so that restoration will be faster and safer, but he added that exact restoration timelines depend on the scope of any event and the number of line miles to be patrolled. Several council members also asked for additional clarity on costs and pace of undergrounding: Xcel said undergrounding costs vary widely by topography and whether lines are distribution or transmission.

Council members and staff also asked Xcel for more information on a short list of items staff and council said they needed to evaluate the franchise at five years, including:

- a clearer, Boulder-specific list and schedule of wildfire mitigation and undergrounding projects that affect the city;

- more precise estimates of customer cost impacts over time tied to specific project and resource portfolios, including how tax credits and avoided fuel costs affect rates; and

- whether Xcel will provide additional monitoring and reporting for the Valmont ash cleanup and any other environmental remediation projects that affect Boulder residents.

Xcel said it would follow up. Regarding federal funding, Kenny said the DOE virtual power plant grant was in hand and under way, and he described federal tax credits under the Inflation Reduction Act as an important driver of project economics. Xcel described its clean heat plans and other filings to expand electrification programs and said it had included substantial funding in a recent filing to support customer electrification and beneficial electrification programs.

City staff and council members said they will use the next weeks to identify any additional analyses they need to inform a future decision on the franchise opt-out available at the five-year checkpoint. Council members asked staff to return with a clearer timeline for the opt-out process and with the list of Boulder-specific projects and further economic and operational detail from Xcel.

What happens next: staff said they will consolidate council's requests for more information and follow up with Xcel on specific items (air and groundwater monitoring for the Valmont project, an itemized Boulder project list and more specific cost and timeline estimates for undergrounding and resilience projects). Xcel said it would provide follow-up materials after the presentation and looked to continue the partnership work on the items identified tonight.

Ending: Council did not take a formal vote on the franchise at the session; the meeting was an informational study session and staff said additional information and follow-up briefings will be provided to the council to inform any future decision about the franchise.

The US currently accounts for nearly 60% of Waaree’s ₹47,000 crore ($5.3 billion) order book. Higher import tariffs by the U.S. government and import probes into Chinese-linked solar components have disrupted global supply chains, prompting Indian manufacturers like Waaree to invest locally in America to ensure long-term access.

Paithankar further said that solar energy remains the cheapest and fastest-deployable renewable source, and demand in the U.S. is surging amid AI-driven data center expansion and the broader electrification of transport. “All the factors clearly point towards an extremely strong and robust US demand,” he said.","https://media.fortuneindia.com/fortune-india/2025-11-03/s3ctkvsg/SATG7295-1.jpg?w=1200&ar=40:21&auto=format,compress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100",N,,2025-11-03 04:17:36.690288

Of the 98,345 heat pumps sold last year, 32,920 were produced in the UK, representing a 40% increase on 2023 figures.

The HPA says the growth underscores the growing role of British manufacturing in the clean energy transition. The Government’s Clean Energy Industries Sector Plan, published in June, highlights heat pumps as a key growth industry, with the wider heating and cooling sector projected to contribute £4.8 billion annually to the economy by 2050, including £900 million from exports.

Industry experts say the UK’s strong foundation in boiler and HVAC manufacturing provides a natural springboard for scaling heat pump production, with shared engineering expertise, components, and supply chains offering a clear pathway to boosting domestic output and securing high-value, long-term jobs, according to the Institute for Public Policy Research.

To support this, the Government’s £30 million Heat Pump Investment Accelerator programme is backing large-scale investments in UK-based manufacturing. Two projects have already received nearly £10 million in funding, with further details on a second phase expected under the forthcoming Industrial Strategy.

However, the HPA emphasised that sustained growth will depend on stronger market confidence, particularly through timely implementation of the Future Homes and Buildings Standard, and addressing the imbalance between electricity and gas prices.

The release of figures coincided with Heat Pump Day, an annual event celebrating the role of heat pumps in Europe’s energy transition.

The European Heat Pump Association (EHPA) has also reiterated its call for clear, long-term policy frameworks to drive demand and strengthen local production.

Charlotte Lee, Chief Executive of the HPA, said: “As the heat pump market in the UK matures, it’s great to see the sector investing in on-shoring supply chains to increase resilience and responsiveness. Confidence in the market is crucial to secure further investment, and we call on the Government to publish the Future Homes and Building Standard without delay. This no-regrets step clearly sets the direction for the heating transition, and shouldn’t be underestimated in its importance to strengthen the supply chain.”

Minister for Energy Consumers Martin McCluskey added:“These figures show the clean power mission in action, with skilled, homegrown jobs in the clean technologies of the future. The British public have shown record demand for heat pumps as more and more families take up our offer of a £7,500 grant. Which is why, to help meet the growing demand, we have already committed almost £10 million to boost homegrown heat pump production in the UK.”

EHPA Director General Paul Kenny commented: “This new UK data is yet more proof that confidence and a stable market are crucial to ensure the local demand that drives local production.

Editor's note: Yasiru Ranaraja, a special commentator on current affairs for CGTN, is a researcher on maritime affairs and an expert on Belt and Road Initiative development. He is also the founding director of the Belt & Road Initiative Sri Lanka, an international development organization and think tank in Sri Lanka. The article reflects the author's views and not necessarily those of CGTN.

In July 2023, at the National Conference on Ecological and Environmental Protection, Chinese President Xi Jinping restated his intention to accelerate the advancement of modernization of the harmonious coexistence between human beings and nature, an ambitious and forward-looking commitment. This pledge goes beyond political rhetoric, as it reflects a revolutionary concept based on the doctrine of ecological civilization.

Through record advances in pollution reduction, nature restoration and clean energy growth, China has become a world leader in green development. Nevertheless, the way toward full ecological modernization is still a challenge, with key fields needing fresh urgency and greater international collaboration.

In the last decade, China has experienced an environmental shift of historic proportions; the ratio of days with good air quality in 339 major cities rose from 63.3 percent to 87.5 percent, and the density of PM2.5, a particulate matter that is the primary driver of severe respiratory illness, averaged more than a 50 percent decline, according to China's Ministry of Ecology and Environment.

China's green transition is also driven by its leadership in renewable energy, and it accounted for nearly half of global renewable energy investment in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency. The country's total installed renewable energy capacity is now over 1.45 billion kilowatts.

A major force behind the shift is the systematic integration of environmental protection into governance. Flagship policies have set sector-specific emission reduction pathways. The ecological protection redlines formally integrated into national policy through the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016–2020), aim to preserve biodiversity, maintain ecosystem services and ensure ecological security, which now covers over 25 percent of China's territory, safeguarding key ecosystems from encroachment.

Moreover, China has formally released the first draft of its historical environmental code, marking a major step in consolidating its ecological governance. Unveiled on April 27, 2025, during a session of the National People's Congress Standing Committee, the draft comprises an extensive 1,188 articles across five chapters: general provisions, pollution prevention and control, ecological protection, green and low‑carbon development, and legal liability and supplementary provisions.

Legal scholars in both China and abroad applaud this move for unifying fragmented environmental regulations, enhancing enforcement clarity and filling legislative gaps ultimately reinforcing China's commitment to sustainable development and ecological civilization.

China is also extending its green ideas abroad in spite of these domestic challenges. As a champion of global environmental governance, China has made ecological civilization a pillar of its foreign policy.

Through the Green Silk Road, an environmental spinoff of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), China is helping developing countries adopt greener infrastructure models, transferring technological expertise and building environmental management capacity. An example is the China-Laos Railway, which was designed to have as little ecological impact as possible. More than 60 percent of its route is constructed on bridges or through tunnels to avoid disrupting local wildlife and sensitive landscapes.

These international inputs point to a deeper reality: The building of a greener China is not just an issue of national rebirth; it is also an obligation to offer a different model of harmonizing ecological protection and economic development while emphasizing that protecting the ecological environment is a global responsibility.

The synthesis of traditional Chinese ecological philosophy, such as the Daoist belief in the interdependence of all living things, with modern regulatory and financial innovation makes up a ""green code"" that resonates beyond China's borders. It is a code based on long-term planning, technological scale and state coordination, and a tool that many emerging economies are looking for in dealing with the climate crisis.

Looking ahead, there are a number of key areas that require fresh attention. First, China needs to start phasing in a cap on the growth of coal projects and introducing definitive sunset clauses on fossil fuel subsidies. Furthermore, Sustainability education, particularly for young people and rural communities must be integrated into national curricula.

Moreover, nature-based solutions, ranging from the conservation of wetlands to agroecology, must be given precedence for their low-cost, high-impact advantages. Lastly, China should further engage with international agreements like the Paris Agreement, the UN Environment Programme and the Global Methane Pledge, and foster South-South cooperation on green technologies.

By interpreting China's green practice, the world not only learns about one nation's transformation but is inspired toward a more sustainable and equitable planetary future. It will require courage, innovation and collaboration to arrive there but the green trajectory, once initiated, cannot be reversed.",,N,,2025-11-03 05:58:19.345630

States are the best place for action and progress, in large part because so much of energy policy lives at legislatures and state agencies.","While the federal policy and regulatory landscapes in 2025 are, to put it mildly, full of uncertainty and outright antagonism — from the cancellation of programs like Solar for All to the rapid drawdown or outright elimination of the Inflation Reduction Act’s incentives for technologies like solar, storage, wind, and electric vehicles — the choice for the industry is either to wait and hope for better political tides in Washington or to adapt and fight to meet the moment.

“It is very easy to get overwhelmed by this moment,” said Amisha Rai, senior vice president of advocacy at Advanced Energy United (United), an industry association representing many of the leading solar, wind, storage, and demand and distributed energy companies. “You could go into the zone of just being flustered and become part of that chaos. Or you can figure out a construct where you can continue leading and focus on a solutions-oriented path.”

The choice for Rai and United was simple. Founded in the aftermath of the 2010 failure of the federal Waxman-Markey cap-and-trade bill, United was built from the start to engage deeply with state policymakers and regional regulators to educate them about the benefits that advanced energy technologies can deliver to citizens and the grid.

United has achieved a long list of legislative and regulatory achievements over its decade-plus of state and regional engagement. Most recently, United championed California’s passage of the “Pathways Initiative” bill, which grants the state’s independent system operator authority to collaborate with other Western states to create an entirely new day-ahead energy trading market for the Western region — a move that is expected to bolster clean energy deployment and save participants upwards of $1.2 billion annually.

Meeting the moment with practical, available solutions

Despite the headwinds from the nation’s capital, United continues to make progress for the industry in state capitals. Recently, the association leveraged its deep experience to develop a playbook that the entire industry can use to further this progress. “The playbook is a way to organize the solutions available to decision-makers and a guide to leaders of any political stripe and in any state about how to think about the urgent challenges they face today,” Rai said.

The challenges are significant. Electricity demand is projected to surge in coming years, driven by data centers, artificial intelligence, electrification, and industrial reshoring. At the same time, energy costs are spiking, supply chain constraints and tariffs are slowing energy infrastructure development, and extreme weather events are straining grid resilience.

State leaders find themselves caught between rising and understandable citizen concerns about energy costs and the urgent need to meet explosive load growth while maintaining grid reliability. Unlike hyperpartisan Washington, state capitals remain a venue for problem-solving. “We have had these conversations with lawmakers that are across the map — rural, urban, Republican, Democrat, Independent,” Rai explained. “The beauty of this playbook is it applies in Texas, and it applies in Pennsylvania, California, Indiana, or Virginia.”

State and local decision-makers understand that they are accountable to constituents who expect the lights to stay on and bills to remain affordable. The advanced energy technologies available today — from large-scale solar, wind, and storage to distributed resources like virtual power plants and advanced efficiency innovations such as smart thermostats and building energy management systems — offer immediate, deployable solutions. Unlike new gas plants and pipelines that take years to build and also risk becoming stranded assets, these technologies can be deployed quickly to meet urgent reliability needs while containing costs.

A three-pillar framework for action

United's playbook organizes solutions around three core objectives that address the full spectrum of state energy challenges:

Build it: To meet projected load growth, states can accelerate deployment of least-cost energy projects by reforming generation and transmission development processes. This includes streamlining planning, siting, permitting, interconnection, and procurement procedures to build a stable pipeline of projects that will meet growing future residential, business, and industrial needs.

California's Pathways Initiative exemplifies this approach. The landmark legislation, nearly a decade in the making, enables Western states with vastly different energy portfolios to work together on market expansion, making it easier to boost transmission capacity, get more clean energy projects connected to the grid, and create efficiencies that will benefit affordability and reliability across the region.

United has also been working on improving energy markets in other parts of the country. For instance, the organization has been leading efforts to have PJM Interconnection — the nation’s largest grid operator, serving 13 states and D.C. — make significant reforms to address the massive backlog of projects waiting to connect to its grid, a critical bottleneck preventing clean energy deployment and keeping prices sky high. These regional efforts complement the statewide developments in siting and permitting legislation that United recently helped secure in Michigan and Massachusetts.

Make it flexible: States can maximize existing grid infrastructure by scaling up distributed energy resources, energy waste reduction, virtual power plants, and advanced vehicle and building electrification solutions through state-led programs, plans, and rates. These technologies help grid operators manage costs in real time while preparing the system for increased demand.

Following Winter Storm Uri's devastating blackouts in 2021, state leaders in Texas recognized the value of flexibility, energy waste reduction, and consumer participation. Recent legislation in Texas has expanded opportunities for those demand-side programs to help shore up the grid. ""Texas has showcased that these resources can actually keep the lights on and help strengthen the grid system,"" Rai said. ""We don’t need to wait 20 years to solve all of our problems. These are solutions that can actually be deployed immediately.""

Make it affordable: States can ensure public utilities are planning, optimizing, and delivering the right types of energy investment at the lowest possible cost while identifying least-cost financing avenues for projects both big and small. This includes avoiding investments in infrastructure that may become a stranded asset.

Colorado leads the way in comprehensive energy system planning. The state has implemented country-leading electric distribution system planning that accounts for how distributed resources can play an increasing role in grid reliability, and Colorado has one of the strongest frameworks for containing costs on the gas pipeline system. As a result, the state’s utility regulators are currently reviewing a proposal to save Coloradans $150 million by investing in efficiency, electrification, demand flexibility, and a small liquefied natural gas facility instead of the traditional gas-only solution.

A path forward

The United playbook recognizes a fundamental truth: There is no single answer to America’s energy challenges. The energy system is complex and interconnected, and decision-makers must assess how different technologies combine to keep prices low, secure the economic opportunities represented by data centers and AI, and ensure a resilient and reliable grid.

States are the best place for action and progress, in large part because so much of energy policy lives at legislatures and state agencies. ""The urgency right now is making sure that state leaders have a path for action and are not stuck in the chaos and noise of the moment,"" Rai said. “This playbook provides a constructive path that works despite the chaos people are seeing at the federal level — a focus on action, not just talk.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/KM6JudXXoTCPJW5k2jrV6A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/aa3f1668645f0a437e471d8e5cb191dd,N,,2025-11-03 04:57:41.097428

He added, “In 2019, India’s module manufacturing capacity stood at six gigawatts. With the ALMM scheme, it has now increased to 120 gigawatts in just three years”.

The Solex CMD’s comments come amid efforts by solar companies to reconfigure supply chains to maintain access to US markets affected by tariff measures.

Innovation and collaboration

On trade diversification, Shah said that shifting global dynamics have created new opportunities for India and Europe to collaborate. “As an Indian, we see a lot of opportunities. We were inventors in the past, we lost it, and now it is time to regain it again,” he said.

Solex Energy recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with ISC Konstanz, Germany, for advanced R&D and technological cooperation in solar cell manufacturing. Shah noted that future growth for Indian manufacturers will rely on balancing innovation and affordability.

Commenting on US tariffs, he described them as “temporary”, noting that “the US has no choice — they don’t have any manufacturing”. He added that India could benefit from the geopolitical situation as global markets increasingly seek cost-effective alternatives from India and China.

Many investors in green stocks will still remember seeing the sector sink at the end of the pandemic.","A dramatic rebound in clean-tech stocks has investors in the green economy hoping they can finally turn the page on years of punishing underperformance.

The timing is somewhat unexpected. Even as President Donald Trump has canceled many US government programs dedicated to boosting wind, solar and electric vehicles, green stocks have become one of this year’s most lucrative bets.

Those equities have significantly outpaced most other stock indexes. The S&P’s main gauge tracking clean energy is up about 50% this year; the MSCI World Index has gained less than 20% in the same period.

Much of that development is pegged to a near-insatiable demand for energy to power the data centers feeding artificial intelligence. It also reflects China’s relentless drive to build out its low-carbon economy. For investors, those factors have outweighed Trump’s attacks on what he often calls the “green scam.”

Analysts at Jefferies have seized on the moment to declare this the “glory days” for green investors, even dedicating an entire client event to the idea.

Aniket Shah, global head of sustainability and transition strategy at Jefferies, says investors have been too distracted by Trump’s anti-green rhetoric in the US. Instead, they should look at the global level of capital piling into clean technologies: the $2 trillion dedicated to low-carbon spending last year is an “insane number” that indicates the green economy is enjoying a “wonderful moment,” according to Shah.

He points to a whole array of factors, including the stunning ascent of China’s green economy and its clean-tech exports to the developing world. And then there are the so-called hyperscalers driving AI, such as Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft Corp. and Alphabet Inc.’s Google, all of which Shah says is “very much a sustainability story.”

The new mood of euphoria among green investors also comes with a layer of irony, however. Electricity demand tied to AI is on track to quadruple within a decade, and though renewables will play a huge role in powering that development, fossil fuels will also be a big part of the mix, pumping up emissions in the process, according to BloombergNEF.

So as world leaders prepare to gather at the COP30 climate summit in Brazil, Shah says it’s important to acknowledge that even with this year’s green rebound, the planet is on track to miss not only the critical temperature threshold of 1.5C, but also 2C. “You have to keep both of those stories in your mind at the same time,” he said.

But not all investors are convinced the green stock rally is solid. And some worry that too much of it is tied to AI, around which bubble speculation persists.

Tim Bachmann, a climate-tech portfolio manager at the fund management unit of Deutsche Bank AG, DWS, says investors should be prepared for another “Deepseek moment,” referring to the Chinese startup that stunned the world earlier this year after it unveiled a low-cost, energy efficient version of AI.

The idea that it might be possible to power AI with considerably less energy than assumed in the US was “a shock not only in the data-center operators, but also in the suppliers of cooling, ventilation equipment, cables, transformers,” Bachmann said.

Alex Monk, a portfolio manager for the global resource equities team at Schroders, says the alternative energy sector would likely be dragged down by a bursting AI bubble.

Deirdre Cooper, head of sustainable equity at Ninety One Plc, says the Anglo-South African asset manager is being “careful to avoid the hype” around parts of the green rally. It’s clear that some clean-tech stocks have been “caught up in the speculative end of the AI trade,” she says.

And Renaud Saleur, founder and chief executive of Anaconda Invest, a Geneva-based boutique hedge fund that specializes in the energy sector, says that some of the stocks that have outperformed are “not really the quality ones.”

He also questions whether the insatiable energy needs of the data centers powering AI can ever be met. “The extra demand for AI is impossible to fuel,” Saleur says. The end game will be “a lot of disappointment.”

The best-performing company in the S&P Global Clean Energy Transition Index is Bloom Energy Corp. The company, which makes solid-oxide fuel cell systems that can generate electricity where it’s needed, is up almost 500% this year.

Bloom Energy, which agreed in July to provide on-site power to Oracle Corp.’s AI data centers, is planning to double its manufacturing capacity by the end of 2026 to meet demand. And with the construction of new power plants proving slow, combined with a shortage of gas-fired turbines, Bloom’s fuel cells – which have a deployment time as short as 90 days – have generated considerable interest.

“Their product is very much tailored and levered to the whole AI data center demand dynamic,” said Christopher Dendrinos, an analyst at RBC Capital Markets. “That has been a huge driver for the stock,” Dendrinos said.

And because Bloom Energy’s fuel cells are — for now, at least — largely powered by natural gas, they actually benefit from Trump-administration incentives that didn’t exist under the Biden administration.

But others urge caution. Analysts at Bank of America Corp. say Bloom Energy’s “fundamentals don’t justify” its share price gains, according to a September note sent to clients.

Michael Tierney, Bloom’s head of investor relations, says the company’s valuation is based on both strong anticipated demand for electricity and an improving financial condition, including revenue that’s expected to climb more than 30% this year to almost $1.9 billion.

“We’re not a startup anymore,” he said. “We have a significantly better balance sheet than in the past.” Tierney says that positions Bloom Energy for sustained growth, which is attracting investors.

Many investors in green stocks will still remember seeing the sector sink at the end of the pandemic. And even after this year’s rebound, clean-tech equity indexes are far off the highs of 2020 and 2021, when interest rates were at crisis lows and Covid-19 lockdowns stifled demand for traditional sources of energy.

But this rally feels different, according to some of the biggest asset managers investing in the sector.

Natalie Adomait, chief operating officer for Brookfield’s renewable power and transition unit, says demand for low-carbon energy sources to power AI is strong, “not only because they’re cheap and abundant, but critically because they’re quick to bring online.”

Brookfield Asset Management recently announced it had raised $20 billion for the world’s biggest private fund dedicated to the clean-energy transition. And Brookfield just agreed to invest as much as $5 billion to deploy the fuel cells of Bloom Energy at new data centers that operate AI.

Among money managers predicting a near-limitless need for energy to power data centers is Apollo Global Management, whose outgoing chief sustainability officer says the demand gap “will not be closed in our lifetime.”

Even in the US, where Trump’s anti-green sentiment dominates policy, low-carbon energy sources look to be emerging as a popular bet for powering data centers. And Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill has proved less punitive for US solar and wind than many investors initially feared. The upshot is that demand for clean energy won’t necessarily be powered by ideological views on climate change, but by the economic benefits.

“If you’re offering green electrons to a company, they can be agnostic as long as you can promise the delivery of the electricity when they need it,” says Timothy Ho, European utilities and renewables analyst at Amundi SA, Europe’s biggest asset manager.

Trump’s policies remain “quite challenging” for certain renewable energy segments such as residential solar projects, says Joseph Osha, an analyst at Guggenheim Securities. So the huge gains in some clean-tech stocks are best explained as a “recognition that the business can survive,” he says.

For example, after triple-digit percentage gains this year, both SunRun Inc. and SolarEdge Technologies Inc. are “still trading at a fraction of their historic highs,” Osha says.

Amundi’s Ho says the green sector should still be treated with some caution.

Investors need to be aware that “sometimes, when you have these broad thematic flows, you can detach a bit from valuations,” he says. And that means markets “can end up detaching a bit from fundamentals, at least temporarily.”

On the eve of a highly anticipated federal budget, a central pillar of which is said to be a climate competitiveness strategy, comes a flagship report from the One Canadian Clean Economy Task Force.

Launched last month, the task force is made up of members representing companies across critical minerals, batteries, clean transportation, clean buildings, energy efficiency, forest products, clean electricity, and clean technology.

The One Canadian Clean Economy Task Force believes Canada can simultaneously safeguard its economy from the trade and tariff shocks of today while setting itself up to compete for the long term, ultimately reaping massive economic advantage from the global energy transition.

Accordingly, Our North Star Action Plan lays out 30 solutions aimed at this government’s biggest priorities: selecting strategic projects of national significance, reducing internal trade barriers (for which a November meeting of ministers is approaching), Indigenous reconciliation, and of course tomorrow’s climate competitiveness strategy.

This task force was brought together precisely to identify many of the roadblocks to realizing these goals—and critically, how we can clear the way for Canada to build up the best version of its clean economy. To name just a few:

Regulatory approval processes can be lengthy and complex, often with overlapping jurisdiction and duplicative requirements, adding cost to and slowing down clean economy projects. Streamlining processes with earlier Indigenous engagement and prioritizing clean growth projects in nation-building efforts are among the vital solutions needed.

Workers face barriers in the clean economy, from inconsistent education and training standards to outdated approaches to workforce planning. Governments should prioritize clean economy trades and regulated professions in labour mobility and target new federal reskilling investments toward clean economy jobs.

A lack of coordinated electricity planning between provinces and inadequate transmission infrastructure means our industries don’t have access to the clean electricity they want, and thus Canada is more reliant on U.S. power. It’s time for a “United Canada” grid initiative and more interregional planning.

Canada’s clean economy sectors need better access to capital to retool and scale up. Finalizing the clean economy investment tax credits and ensuring Canada’s strategic tariff response measures are deployed in ways that enhance climate competitiveness can help Canada attract clean investment, especially as those dollars flee the U.S.

For the full list of 30 recommendations, organized within eight key focus areas, read the One Canadian Clean Economy Task Force’s North Star Action Plan. Our aim: responsibly eliminate barriers and build up Canada’s essential clean economy—and a stronger, competitive Canada.

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states.
This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed.
If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.
It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease.","Who wants higher electricity rates? Ask just about anyone and they’ll agree that energy prices have risen. They’re not wrong. In recent weeks there has been significant attention in the Mountain State on what is driving those costs. The question has no doubt arisen from people seeing their electricity bills steadily rise, especially since the beginning of the COVID-19 Pandemic five years ago.

A review of data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration shows that electricity rates have risen for most states. For example:

West Virginia: +27.71%

Ohio: +30.11%

Pennsylvania: +30.85%

Virginia: +19.78%

Kentucky: +17.66%

North Carolina: +24.17%

Texas: +27.58%

Power rates have risen by a quarter or more in five of those states. Virginia has seen slower rate increases due to significant growth in Northern Virginia, and Kentucky’s increases are significantly offset by subsidies from the Tennessee Valley Authority in the western part of the state.

With the backdrop of these prices, some politicians in the West Virginia Legislature have announced plans to introduce legislation that requires coal-fired power plants in West Virginia to at least run at 69% capacity all the time or forego the ability to recoup future costs. The claim is that coal is a cheap fuel source and that such a bill will lower electric rates and put nearly 3,500 coal miners back to work. If it sounds too good to be true, it’s because it is.

Your power company understands the best way to keep your rates as low as possible is to participate in the market. For our region, that market is PJM. PJM is making constant decisions about how to provide the least expensive and most efficient power. One of the key drivers in that decision is what the fuel needed to run the power plant (coal, gas or nuclear) costs. Another is going to be what the power grid needs at any given moment to provide reliable electricity to our state and region.

On a windy day, wind turbines will be called upon to provide a decent share of the power on the grid. If it’s not as windy, that won’t be the case. It’s the same with sunny days and solar farms. The wind and sun don’t charge for their fuel, so instead those electricity costs are largely driven by the hard physical costs (solar panels, windmills) that have already been factored into the capacity market. The intermittent nature of renewable energy, however, means that those energy sources will supplement what is on the grid, but won’t provide the baseload power that is required.

That brings us to the fuel sources that can provide the baseload electricity needed for the power grid — coal, natural gas and nuclear. As I write this, here’s a list of the current generation fuel mix for PJM:

Total Generation – 87,551 megawatts (MW)

Natural Gas – 33,469 MW (38.22%)

Nuclear – 28,371 MW (32.41%)

Coal – 13,197 MW (15.07%)

Renewable Energy – 10,043 MW (11.47%)

The reason that natural gas is providing so much more power than coal is simple: natural gas is significantly cheaper right now. In August 2025, electricity produced with natural gas priced through the Henry Hub cost $24.11 per MWh (megawatt hour), while electricity produced from Central Appalachian Coal cost $36.37 per MWh – nearly 50% more.

So, what would be the practical effect of running coal plants at 69% when they weren’t required? Even higher electric prices hitting your wallet, taking more of your hard-earned money. Power plants bid into PJM on a continuous basis to provide electricity. The first energy sources called up will be those that are less expensive, and then the more expensive will be utilized as additional capacity is needed. Think of it this way: If you park in the school pick-up line 15 minutes early on a nice day you will probably roll down the windows and turn your car off. You don’t need — or want — to burn gasoline that’s not needed. If the weather is too hot or too cold, you will probably keep your car running to stay comfortable. This is not unlike what is happening at power plants, except it’s based on the amount of power needed. If more power is needed, additional generation is called up and more fuel is used. If less power is needed, power plants throttle back to keep costs in check.

It’s understandable that some want to introduce legislation in an attempt to address electricity rates, but in this case the cure is worse than the disease. Requiring the use of a certain fuel source is picking winners and losers and will add to the cost of generating electricity — ultimately increasing your power bill.

However, notwithstanding these initiatives, India’s cleantech manufacturing sector continues to face significant challenges.
Dependence on imported upstream components, technologies, and raw materials highlights the need for technology-sharing agreements and the enhancement of domestic manufacturing capabilities.
In alignment with India’s climate objectives, the mission emphasises cleantech manufacturing, promoting domestic production and strengthening supply chains for critical clean energy components.
Collectively, these government-led initiatives underscore a strong commitment to advancing clean technology manufacturing in India.","India is at a critical juncture in its transition to clean energy. The nation has set ambitious targets: achieving net-zero emissions by 2070, sourcing 50% of its energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030, and ensuring that 30% of new vehicles sold by 2030 are electric. Currently, India’s total installed energy capacity stands at 442 GW, with renewable sources comprising 33% and hydropower contributing 11%. Due to the rapid expansion of renewable energy installations, India remains confident in meeting its 2030 clean energy objectives ahead of schedule.

India’s progress has primarily stemmed from clear and targeted policy incentives. Between 2010 and 2023, the country’s renewable energy capacity grew eightfold, driven by supportive government policies and declining costs of solar and wind technologies. These policies, alongside financial innovations, have encouraged more venture capital investments and created more opportunities for startups and MSMEs. As a result, cleantech expenditure reached USD 68 billion in 2023, a 40% rise compared to the average from 2016 to 2020.

However, these ambitions bring their own set of challenges—chief among them is reducing India’s reliance on imported cleantech components. India’s cleantech manufacturing import dependence across renewable energy, electric mobility and other cleantech sectors’ value chains vary from 20% to 90%; specifically, 80% in Solar, 60% in Wind, 75-90 % in Battery Energy Storage Systems, 60-70% in E-mobility (EV motors and controllers), 90% in Green Hydrogen, and 20-30% in Bio-energy sectors. Without decisive policy action, India’s cleantech imports could surge to USD 85–110 billion by 2030 and as high as USD 140–300 billion by 2040, rivalling the country’s current oil import bill. Reducing this dependence and capturing the economic benefits of the green transition requires indigenizing supply chains and establishing a robust domestic manufacturing base. Policy must address capital costs, supply chain bottlenecks, and constraints in local technology expertise to seize this opportunity. This dependence is more than economic; it is strategic. In a world of techno-nationalism and fragmented supply chains, clean technology has become the new oil. Nations are weaponising critical minerals and tightening export controls. For India, relying on foreign hardware to fuel our green economy is a risk we cannot afford to take. That is why our green transition must be Made in India. As Prime Minister Modi has rightly emphasised, the path to Atmanirbhar Bharat and Viksit Bharat runs through Swadeshi innovation.

To achieve its clean energy objectives, India must realign its policy priorities to expand domestic manufacturing across all relevant sectors. This calls for comprehensive, well-structured interventions throughout the cleantech value chain, including incentivising private investment, expediting adoption among local manufacturers, and addressing areas with lagging progress. By adopting this approach, India can not only advance its energy transition but also enhance economic autonomy and support broader socio-economic development. The nation’s strategic assets, its favourable geographic location, competitive labour costs, and rapid growth in renewable energy, provide a strong foundation for becoming a leading cleantech hub. However, realising this potential requires closing supply chain gaps and maintaining cost-competitiveness in domestic production. Developing a robust cleantech manufacturing ecosystem will rely on advanced local technology, economies of scale, reliable access to raw materials, affordable inputs, sufficient financing, and a skilled workforce. While existing policy measures and private sector initiatives have produced encouraging initial outcomes, a more integrated and large-scale effort is necessary.

The international landscape is undergoing a significant transformation. As nations have pursued “China Plus One” strategies to diversify global supply chains, India has encountered intense competition from other emerging markets in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. To differentiate itself, India should not only strengthen its own capabilities but also adopt an “India Plus Many” strategy, cultivating alliances with like-minded economies to develop diversified, secure, and resilient supply networks. Establishing strategic partnerships will improve India’s competitiveness, expand market opportunities, and reinforce its position as a reliable provider in the cleantech sector. A new approach of going “Swadeshi with Partnership” may be the optimal way forward. Global alliances on finance, technology transfer, and market access should bolster our Swadeshi efforts.

Substantial policy-driven investments are currently underway, exemplified by the Production-Linked Incentive (PLI) schemes that have stimulated domestic output across critical sectors, including solar photovoltaics (PV), advanced battery storage, e-mobility, and green hydrogen. Notably, the solar PLI initiative, with an allocation of USD 3.21 billion, has facilitated integrated manufacturing spanning modules, cells, and wafers. Supplementary strategies, such as safeguard duties and manufacturing-linked auctions, have contributed to a decrease in import reliance, while annual cleantech investment reached a record high of USD 68 billion in 2023.

However, notwithstanding these initiatives, India’s cleantech manufacturing sector continues to face significant challenges. There is an urgent need to promote indigenisation at competitive costs by overcoming hurdles related to infrastructure, raw materials, logistics, and associated expenses—this can be achieved through supply chain partnerships and investments in research and development of affordable climate technologies. Financing remains a significant barrier, as high capital costs and unfavourable risk-return dynamics deter investment. Therefore, establishing long-term, innovative financing mechanisms is crucial to attract both domestic and international capital. Additionally, the sector faces a skilled workforce deficit, making it vital to enhance green skill development and improve the industry’s appeal to talented professionals for roles in supply chain management and emerging cleantech domains.

Furthermore, insufficient investment in research and innovation hinders the development of affordable, locally relevant solutions, underscoring the need for targeted initiatives and collaborative approaches. Dependence on imported upstream components, technologies, and raw materials highlights the need for technology-sharing agreements and the enhancement of domestic manufacturing capabilities. Finally, limited access to advanced machinery and manufacturing technologies continues to constrain the country’s production potential.

National Manufacturing Mission 2025 – including a focus on Cleantech Manufacturing

The National Manufacturing Mission, introduced in the Union Budget 2025, aims to advance India’s ‘Make in India’ initiative by providing comprehensive policy support, strategic execution plans, and a robust governance framework to coordinate activities among central ministries and state governments. In alignment with India’s climate objectives, the mission emphasises cleantech manufacturing, promoting domestic production and strengthening supply chains for critical clean energy components. These components include solar PV cells and modules, electric vehicle batteries and parts, hydrogen electrolysers, wind turbines, ultra-high voltage transmission equipment, and grid-scale batteries. This initiative aims to reduce India’s reliance on imports, enhance energy security, and accelerate the country’s transition to renewable energy.

The mission is structured around five principal pillars, each addressing a critical area of implementation. Its primary objective is to ease the process of doing business by optimising regulatory frameworks and offering incentives to support domestic production. The initiative seeks to develop a future-ready workforce via targeted skill development programmes and collaborative partnerships between industry and academia. Additionally, the mission aims to foster a robust and dynamic MSME sector with increased access to capital and enhanced supply chain integration. Further emphasis is placed on advancing technology through the promotion of research and development, innovation, and technology transfer. Finally, it seeks to elevate quality standards in manufacturing through recognised benchmarks and certification systems, thus enhancing global competitiveness. Collectively, these government-led initiatives underscore a strong commitment to advancing clean technology manufacturing in India.

EAGLE MOUNTAIN, UT, UNITED STATES, November 2, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- As federal tax incentives for energy-efficient home improvements phase out by year's end, Ninja Plumbing, Heating and Air is advising Utah homeowners to upgrade systems promptly. The Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit (Section 25C), modified under the One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBBA) and set to expire December 31, 2025, provides up to $3,200 in savings for qualifying HVAC and plumbing installations like heat pumps and tankless water heaters.

These credits, aimed at promoting sustainability, apply to primary residences and require ENERGY STAR-certified products. With Utah's energy prices rising— including an 18% hike from Rocky Mountain Power this year—timely upgrades can reduce bills while claiming federal benefits before they vanish.

KEY QUALIFYING UPGRADES AND BENEFITS

Homeowners can claim credits for installations completed by December 31, 2025, potentially saving thousands upfront plus ongoing energy costs:

HEAT PUMPS: Up to $2,000 credit for air-source or geothermal models; average annual energy savings of $300–$650, depending on efficiency and home size.

TANKLESS WATER HEATERS: Up to $600 for efficient gas or electric units; reduces water heating costs by 24–34% compared to traditional tanks for low-usage homes.

BOILERS AND FURNACES: Up to $600 for high-efficiency models; ideal for Utah's cold winters, cutting heating costs significantly.

CENTRAL AIR CONDITIONERS: Up to $600 for ENERGY STAR systems; enhances cooling efficiency amid rising summer demands.

INSULATION AND AIR SEALING: Up to $1,200; often bundled with HVAC work for comprehensive savings, boosting overall home efficiency.

""With Utah energy prices rising, these expiring credits represent a critical opportunity for families to invest in reliable, eco-friendly systems,"" said Ian Furse, Owner of Ninja Plumbing, Heating and Air. ""We've helped hundreds of local homeowners cut utility bills by up to 30% through these upgrades—don't miss out before December 31.""

Added Michael Prisbrey: ""Research shows heat pump installations can lower annual bills by $300–$650 in many cases, making this a smart move for long-term affordability.""

I&M’s Tips to Fight Back I&M recommends multiple practical steps to reduce phantom energy: Unplug small electronics when not in use — phone chargers, game consoles, etc.
Bottom Line Phantom energy may not be the most visible component of your utility bill — but it can be a silent drain on your wallet and on the environment.","FORT WAYNE, Ind. (Oct. 2025) – What looks like a powered-down home may still be costing you money. Utility company Indiana Michigan Power is urging customers to beware of so-called phantom energy — the electricity consumed by devices and appliances that are plugged in but not actively in use.

What is Phantom Energy?

Also known as “vampire load” or “standby power,” phantom energy is the small yet continuous power draw from electronics when they appear switched off but remain plugged in. According to recent studies, this hidden drain can account for 5% to 10% of a household’s total energy use. For example, smart TVs in standby mode have been measured drawing up to 40 watts.

Why It Matters

Even a few watts of wasted power, when multiplied across dozens of devices in a home and across thousands of homes in a region, adds up — in dollars paid and environmental impact.

For consumers, the cost can reach tens or hundreds of dollars per year. One estimate: if phantom loads represent 5% of average household energy use (the U.S. average ~10,791 kWh/year), the annual cost might be $90–$180 or more depending on local rates.

For utilities and the grid, wasted standby power means avoidable demand, increased infrastructure strain and extra emissions from power generation.

I&M’s Tips to Fight Back

I&M recommends multiple practical steps to reduce phantom energy:

Unplug small electronics when not in use — phone chargers, game consoles, etc.

Use advanced power strips or smart plugs that cut power flow when devices aren’t active.

Replace old or inefficient appliances with ENERGY STAR® models that draw very little standby power.

For customers equipped with smart meters, I&M says they should regularly review their Weekly Energy Update reports in their account — helping spot unusual usage patterns.

Smart Meters & Usage Tracking

I&M’s rollout of smart meters enables customers to monitor energy usage in 15-minute increments, often through the online account portal or mobile app. By reviewing detailed usage data, households can identify when devices may be drawing power unnecessarily — for example, during “off hours” when everything should be asleep.

Real-World Impact & Consumer Example

According to the U.S. Dept. of Energy and other sources, phantom loads can add up to 10% of home electricity use, which translates to significant cost over time.

One scenario: A typical home might have 40 devices drawing even a small standby wattage each; combined, that could lead to hundreds of extra kilowatt-hours per year.

While each device’s draw might be modest, the cumulative effect is real — and preventable.

Why Many Homes Let It Slide

Many consumers assume that “off” means “zero power,” but that isn’t always true — especially for devices with standby modes, remote-control capability, network connection or digital displays.

Unplugging everything manually can be inconvenient, so tools like smart plugs or power strips that shut off groups of devices are often more practical.

Some devices continue to draw minimal power by design (for memory retention, remote access, clock displays), so complete elimination may require new equipment or changing habits.

What to Do Today

Walk through your home and identify devices that stay plugged in continuously but are rarely used.

For each: Ask “Does this need to be plugged in all the time?” If the answer is no, unplug it or plug it into a switchable strip.

If you have a smart meter through I&M, log into your account and review the Weekly Energy Update. Does usage drop during known “quiet” periods (overnight, work hours)? If not, investigate what could be drawing power.

Consider investing in smart plugs (especially for entertainment systems) or advanced power strips with auto shut-off features.

When replacing major appliances, look for models with low standby power draw (check specs for standby watts) and buy ENERGY STAR rated when available.

Bottom Line

Phantom energy may not be the most visible component of your utility bill — but it can be a silent drain on your wallet and on the environment. With thousands of homes under I&M’s service area, the combined savings from reducing standby power could be substantial. The good news? Simple adjustments + smart monitoring can make a real difference.

For I&M customers, checking your smart-meter data, unplugging unused chargers, and using switchable power strips are easy steps you can take today. Over time, those small actions add up — both in dollars saved and carbon emissions reduced.",https://wowo.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Power-lines.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:02:02.595913

Labour’s newly published Clean Energy Jobs Plan is a million miles away from where we’d be with Reform. It’s a credible plan to double the jobs in the clean energy sector within five years. It’s a plan that sets out routes to provide up to 20,000 more jobs in Yorkshire alone, making thousands of new jobs in construction, engineering, electronics and applied science.

And these aren’t jobs for elites or distant promises. These are secure futures for existing workers and the promise of good futures for real people in their own towns. It’s a plan for you and your family. This is a plan for economic security of a type we’ve not seen here for decades.

Farage would scrap all this. Reform’s rhetoric of ‘net stupid zero’ is a promise to take away your future, to pull the rug from under thousands of workers and young people, and plunge Yorkshire into futureless contemplation of a lost chance at reindustrialisation.

The clean energy economy is already growing at twice the rate of the wider economy, and this plan both increases that growth and scoops up our people to ride it out. These clean energy jobs come as standard with good wages, stability, and reliable career trajectories. They’re the kind of jobs you can put down roots with; jobs you can build families on.

Reform votes against improving workers’ rights. Reform is the party of zero-hour contracts, unfair dismissal, and fire and rehire. They’re the party of the past.

Labour works with trade unions. That’s why this plan includes commitments to grow pay packets, standardise good conditions, and ensure trade union recognition in clean energy industries. Good work builds strong industries and strong communities. This plan offers our working-class communities a future to be proud of.

We now have a roadmap that leads to a thriving clean energy sector right here on our doorstep.

Clean energy means we slow climate change, prevent flooding in our communities, stave off deadly heatwaves, reduce climate migration turmoil, and ensure stable food supply and pricing.

But with this government’s commitment to building the kind of clean energy sector that trade unions are fighting for, clean energy also means prosperity for Yorkshire and the Humber, a stop to the brain drain from our towns, resolidified coastal and rural communities, and work to be proud of.

The trade union movement wants these things. And we’re, on this at least, largely in step with Labour.

Reform doesn’t want you to have a slice of this future. Reform wants our communities to absorb climate chaos in higher insurance costs, more heat deaths, dangerous and insecure work. And Reform wants you to blame someone else for their ideological choice to sell your future down the river.

In the TUC, we’re standing with good jobs, secure futures and our communities. That’s why we’re celebrating this plan. It’s a plan for working people and a plan for a strong Yorkshire.

Laurence Tubiana, a key architect of the Paris Climate Agreement, says the EU must learn from China’s clean tech strategy, which has seen it establish a commanding manufacturing dominance in solar panels, wind turbines, batteries, and electric vehicles.

Tubiana, who is CEO of the European Climate Foundation and was appointed the COP30 special envoy to Europe by the summit’s Brazilian president, was in Luxembourg in September to address a forum organised by the Chamber of Commerce.

In a press briefing she argued that the EU’s defensive industrial policy on clean tech and electric vehicles from China was the wrong approach. As recently as 22 October, Commission President Ursula von der Leyen told the European Parliament that the bloc must learn lessons from the way it lost out on being a global leader in solar energy to “heavily subsidised Chinese competitors”.

That was a “a cautionary tale that we must not forget,” von der Leyen told MEPs the day before a council meeting of EU leaders in Brussels agreed to move ahead rapidly – before COP30 – with setting a 2040 target for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 90% compared to 1990 levels.

They ambitiously want to finalise the appropriate amendment to the European climate law at a meeting of environment ministers in the Belgian capital on 4 November, just two days before the COP Heads of State Summit in Brazil.

Von der Leyen insists that the shift to a clean economy is Europe’s chance to revitalise industries and cut reliance on imports from China.

Strategy could create jobs and help develop new skills

This is contrary to what Tubiana wants to see from the EU leadership. She said that seeking agreements with China that create the conditions for joint ventures, investment, and technological cooperation was a smarter approach, especially if such a strategy could create jobs and help the workforce develop new skills.

Tubiana is supported in her views by fellow climate experts Emmanuel Guerin and Bernice Lee. “Europe and China must find common cause on clean trade and investment – one of the few areas where strategic self-interest and global public goods still converge,” they wrote in an article for Project Syndicate.

But Luxembourg is not biting. Not publicly, at any rate. In response to a query from Luxembourg Times, Luxembourg’s ministry for foreign affairs and foreign trade said that “as a general rule” it “does not comment on policy outlines and recommendations of individuals in academia.”

Tubiana has argued that Europe must show humility in recognising that technological leadership has shifted. “The transfer of knowledge must be reversed,” she said. “Rather than merely hosting Chinese manufacturing, Europeans should consider what they can learn from it, just as China did from European and American firms in earlier phases of its industrial rise.”

Indeed, as The New York Times pointed out in an article this summer, “China applied for more than twice as many high-quality clean energy patents as the United States in 2022, the most recent year of complete data.” These include what the NYT called “new, groundbreaking versions” of widespread clean energy technologies that were pioneered elsewhere.

That article cited Jenny Wong Leung, an analyst and data scientist at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, who said that the sheer volume of Chinese investment in clean tech has been significantly larger than in the West. “It meant they [the Chinese] could build industries from the ground up, all the way through the supply chain,” Wong Leung said.

Luxembourg-China trade

Bilateral trade between Luxembourg and China, including Hong Kong, reached a total volume of €5.69 billion in 2024, placing China 12th among Luxembourg’s individual trading partners according to state statistic office Statec.

“Luxembourg is among the countries in the world where China is not among the three biggest trading partners,” the ministry of foreign affairs and trade told Luxembourg Times.

If grouped by trading bloc, China comes 5th as Luxembourg’s top export and import destination - behind the rest of the EU, US, UK and Switzerland.

Trade between the two countries has grown consistently, by 62.5% over the past decade, while Luxembourg’s overall foreign trade has nearly doubled (+99.1%) during the same period.

But, as Foreign Minister Xavier Bettel pointed out in his annual address to parliament last week, while China is the world’s largest producer of green technology it is also the world’s largest greenhouse gas emitter. Its emissions from fuel combustion made up 32.1% of the global total in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.

Luxembourg must maintain dialogue with China

Bettel, who together with Economy Minister Lex Delles led a delegation to the Middle Kingdom last year with a focus on clean tech and the automobile sector, said that Luxembourg must maintain dialogue with China, “even if we are not of the same opinion or if subjects are difficult,” he told MPs last week. “We shouldn’t be afraid to say anything.”

There have been suggestions that Chinese clean tech could pose security risks, for instance by exploiting cyber vulnerabilities in supply chains, alongside a slew of warnings that AI platform DeepSeek and social media app TikTok could serve as a tool for mass data collection and surveillance. Luxembourg seems to think it has such threats in hand.

“Any personal data transfers from the EU to third countries — including China — are strictly regulated under the GDPR,” the foreign ministry said in an email. “Luxembourg’s data protection authority, CNPD, and the other EU independent supervisory authorities are responsible for monitoring the application of this regulation.”

And the ministry also said that Luxembourg, along with its EU partners, will continue to “maintain a balanced and independent approach in its relations with both the United States and China.”

This comes after new US Ambassador to the Grand Duchy Stacey Feinberg issued a warning during evidence she gave to a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing in July that she believed Luxembourg was blind to what she called the “nefarious” intentions of China. She said that she would “humbly like to educate” Luxembourg about how to scrutinise China’s intentions and argued that the Grand Duchy should “decouple” from China.",https://img.wort.lu/public/wirtschaft/p8j7yc-33888336.jpg/alternates/SIXTEEN_NINE_1200/33888336.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:20:05.924264

Solar’s long-term economics are simply too strong to ignore, even without the tax credit.
Because the developer owns the system, they can claim the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, which remains available through 2027.

To me, this isn’t the end of residential solar; it’s a reset.","When Congress and the president cut the 30% residential solar tax credit last July, ending it 10 years ahead of schedule, it sent shockwaves through the solar industry.

Homeowners and installers alike have been racing to get systems energized before Dec. 31, knowing it’s their last chance to claim the 25D credit.

There’s no question we’ll see a slowdown in residential installations once the year ends. But I believe it will be temporary. Solar’s long-term economics are simply too strong to ignore, even without the tax credit.

Utility rates continue to climb nationally, with residential electricity prices rising 11% between January and August, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. And as Bret Biggart (CEO of TXSES Platinum Business Members Freedom Solar) explained on Doug Lewin’s “Energy Capital” Podcast, “Every utility in Texas that we operate in estimates a 5% increase in electricity prices next year ... and probably a lot more ... even in municipal utilities like Austin Energy or CPS. And in Austin Energy, it’s a five-year, 5% step-up ... so in a couple of years, we work back to a price of power being pushed up where the 30% tax credit is sort of offset.”

In other words, at this pace, the savings from going solar will soon make up for the lost tax incentive.

48E tax credit use through

third-party ownership The good news is that there’s still a workaround for those who miss the deadline, and it comes through third-party ownership, or TPO. Instead of buying a system outright, homeowners can host one that’s owned by a developer or financier. The company installs, maintains and operates the panels, and the homeowner simply pays for the power it produces (through a power purchase agreement) or for the right to use the system (through a lease).

Because the developer owns the system, they can claim the Section 48E Clean Electricity Investment Tax Credit, which remains available through 2027. That credit covers up to 30% of project costs, and potentially more for projects that meet domestic content or labor standards.

Developers can pass those savings on to homeowners through lower monthly payments or discounted energy rates.

This approach isn’t new. TPO already makes up about 45% of residential solar installations in the U.S. But it’s about to become much more important. Analysts expect the TPO market to grow by 25% in 2026, driven by companies like Sunrun, Palmetto and GoodLeap that are already leveraging the 48E credit.

A temporary setback, not the end Yes, there are hurdles — domestic content and foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions — but some developers are finding creative ways to adapt.

Nonprofits like Georgia BRIGHT are even offering “Safe Harbor” programs that lock in 48E eligibility through 2029 for projects that purchase at least 5% of their equipment this year.

To me, this isn’t the end of residential solar; it’s a reset. Rising utility prices and innovative financing models like TPO mean solar will continue to thrive, even without the 25D credit.

If you’re planning to go solar this year, make sure your system will be fully interconnected and energized by Dec. 31 to ensure you get the 30% credit. After that, third-party ownership may be the best path forward in a post-tax-credit world.",https://static2.boernestar.com/data/wysiwig/logo/social%20media%20logo.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:59:07.424691

The Scheme aims to significantly increase appropriate end-of-life battery disposal and recycling in Australia.
Interested parties have raised broader policy issues around battery stewardship, including that participation should be made mandatory, and the scope and operation of the Scheme.
“It is also not the ACCC’s role to determine public policy outcomes or broader policy issues, including regulation reform to make battery stewardship mandatory.
More information, including the ACCC’s draft determination, is available online on the ACCC’s public register at Battery Stewardship Council.","The Battery Stewardship Council (BSC) has been granted an exemption for the next five years by the ACCC to allow it to continue to operate its B-cycle Battery Stewardship Scheme (Scheme). Following the decision, BSC members and industry participants can continue to operate the Scheme without breaching competition laws.

The Scheme aims to significantly increase appropriate end-of-life battery disposal and recycling in Australia.

“We consider the Scheme is likely to result in environmental benefits by diverting batteries from landfill as well as reducing fire risks in the collection, transport, sorting, and processing of end-of-life batteries,” ACCC Deputy Chair Mick Keogh said.

“It should also support some increased research, development and innovation in the disposal and re-use of end-of-life batteries in Australia.”

The ACCC's role is to assess the application put before it and to determine whether the proposed conduct is likely to result in an overall public benefit, which was satisfied in this instance.

The ACCC recognises that in part, due to the voluntary nature of this Scheme, participation rates and therefore the number of batteries collected and recycled has been relatively low.

Interested parties have raised broader policy issues around battery stewardship, including that participation should be made mandatory, and the scope and operation of the Scheme.

“The ACCC recognises that higher rates of participation in battery stewardship would substantially increase public benefits from greater collection and recycling of batteries. However, it is not our role to develop such a scheme,” Mr Keogh said.

“It is also not the ACCC’s role to determine public policy outcomes or broader policy issues, including regulation reform to make battery stewardship mandatory. This is a matter for governments”.

“Minimising the safety risks associated with storing button batteries must continue to be a priority,” Mr Keogh said.

“Therefore, we have imposed a condition in our authorisation that the BSC continues its Button Battery Safety Strategy, which aims to educate consumers and mitigate the risks associated with button batteries, such as the serious injuries they can inflict on children when ingested.”

The ACCC recognises that the BSC has undertaken broad consultation with industry stakeholders on approaches to the Scheme’s design and protocols.

However, to ensure this dialogue continues, the ACCC has imposed a condition requiring the BSC to create, publish and implement a consultation protocol outlining the consultation process with Scheme participants should certain changes to the Scheme be made throughout the authorisation period.

To ensure sufficient transparency and effectiveness of the Scheme, the ACCC has also required an annual report on key Scheme outcomes and targets to be published by the BSC. An independent review of the Scheme’s performance, governance and financial position must be undertaken in three years’ time.

The ACCC considers a three-year timeframe to commence an independent review allows sufficient time for the BSC to implement its proposed improvements to the Scheme and for measurable outcomes to be assessed.

Interested parties have proposed a shorter authorisation period of two to three years due to uncertainty around the introduction of mandatory product stewardship legislation.

“The ACCC does not consider the authorisation replaces or diminishes government's role or ability to act in relation to product stewardship arrangements for batteries as the two processes are largely independent of each other” Mr Keogh said.

More information, including the ACCC’s draft determination, is available online on the ACCC’s public register at Battery Stewardship Council.

Note to editors

The ACCC is not an environmental regulator or policy agency. The ACCC’s role as Australia’s competition regulator includes assessing applications for authorisation. ACCC authorisation provides statutory protection from court action for certain conduct by competitors that might otherwise raise concerns under the competition provisions of the Competition and Consumer Act 2010 (Cth) (the Act).

The ACCC must not make a determination granting authorisation unless it is satisfied, in all the circumstances, that the conduct would likely result in a benefit to the public and that benefit would likely outweigh any potential detriment from the conduct. In this instance, authorisation is proposed in respect of Division 1 of Part IV (cartel conduct), section 45 and section 47 of the Act (contracts, arrangements or understandings that restrict dealings or affect competition, and exclusive dealing).

Background

Product stewardship is an environmental management strategy that means whoever designs, produces, sells or uses a product takes responsibility for minimising that product’s environmental impact through all the stages of its life cycle.

The BSC is a not-for-profit entity established to operate and oversee the Scheme, which promotes the safe collection, recycling, and disposal of end-of-life batteries. The Scheme does not cover automotive lead-acid batteries or batteries already included in other recycling programs.

The proposed conduct also adds an annual review process to set the levy and rebates using eco-modulated formulas based on battery type to cover the increased costs and risks of battery collection and recycling. The BSC’s proposal seeks to raise sufficient revenue that it can continue to implement public awareness campaigns to increase participation in battery recycling.

On 4 June 2025, the ACCC granted interim authorisation with a condition for the BSC to continue operating the Scheme with the ability to increase levies to reflect increases in the Consumer Price Index since the Scheme’s commencement. The BSC is also able to progress the development of new levy arrangements involving an eco-modulated levy to reflect the different costs of collecting and recycling different battery types, until the substantive authorisation comes into effect.

Regulatory developments

On 16 October 2025, the NSW Environment Protection Authority (NSW EPA) released the proposed regulation under the Product Lifecycle Responsibility Act 2025 (NSW) (PLR Act) for public consultation. The draft regulation provides the legal framework for the proposed mandatory NSW product stewardship scheme for end-of-life batteries, where brand owners who supply batteries into NSW will be required to be a member of a product stewardship organisation that has an agreement with the NSW EPA. The draft regulation would also require product stewardship organisations that enter into an agreement with NSW EPA to comply with that agreement (potentially with penalties for non-compliance) and:

prepare and publish an action plan detailing how they intend to meet requirements in the regulation and their agreement with the NSW EPA

keep records and report quarterly/annually on a range of performance and financial measures.

The battery types in scope of the NSW draft regulation include standard size batteries used to power household items, button and button cell batteries, removable rechargeable batteries weighing 5kg or less, and portable power banks weighing 5kg or less. The draft regulation also captures e-micromobility devices where it is not practicable to remove a regulated battery from an e-micromobility device. NSW EPA’s regulatory impact statement for the proposed draft regulation states that it has engaged extensively with other Australian states and territories to discuss opportunities to put in place similar legislative frameworks to achieve a nationally aligned approach and reduce the impact on the common market.

NSW EPA is seeking feedback on the proposed regulation by 14 November 2025 and expects the regulation to commence in mid-2026.",https://www.accc.gov.au/sites/www.accc.gov.au/themes/acccgov_theme/images/og-image.png,N,,2025-11-03 03:18:05.143556

Though it is tempting to suggest the reason is purely a matter of GM’s overeagerness to catch up to the electric vehicle push, the reality is a bit more complicated.

At the company’s Ultium Cells battery cell plant in Lordstown there are expected to be approximately 550 cuts and 850 temporary layoffs, according to a report by CNBC. There will also be approximately 700 layoffs at the Ultium Cells plant in Tennessee.

Those gleefully pointing to the staffing cuts as evidence that the electric vehicle movement is failing should be quickly silenced by the reminder that these are hundreds upon hundreds of Buckeye State residents being laid off or losing their jobs entirely, less than two months before Christmas — and in the middle of a federal government shutdown that has put all kinds of resources in jeopardy.

And this isn’t about reassessing Americans’ desire to drive electric vehicles.

“In response to slower near-term (emphasis ours) EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said in a statement. “Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our U.S. manufacturing footprint … ”

One of those changes is a planned upgrade of the facilities in Ohio and Tennessee, which will allow it to resume operations at both sites in the middle of next year, according to CNBC. Meanwhile, the company is also cutting hundreds of jobs at its global tech campus near Detroit, and working through that “evolving regulatory environment” — i.e. uncertainty about which way the wind will blow from day to day in Washington, D.C.; and continued slow spending growth as families remain cautious about how they use their money.

Companies don’t make this kind of decision based on political whims. They’re interested in numbers, facts … what will make them money AND be best for the company and its employees.

“We continue to believe that there is a strong future for electric vehicles, … but we do have some structural changes that we need to do to make sure that we lower the cost of producing those vehicles,” CFO Paul Jacobson said on CNBC.

GM isn’t giving up on EVs. It’s changing the way it thinks about producing them. While it goes through those growing pains, the rest of us should steer clear of political cheap shots and remember instead that GM’s workers are experiencing pain, too.",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.tribtoday.com/images/2016/10/11191558/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 01:01:25.720115

NJBIZ panel explores energy costs, infrastructure and innovation in NJ

Experts cited grid constraints, AI demand and renewable project backlogs

Panelists discussed efficiency upgrades, clean energy programs and C-PACE

AI’s role in managing energy demand and predictive maintenance is growing

As part of NJBIZ’s latest virtual discussion, panelists spoke about current trends and issues relating to energy, infrastructure and innovation in New Jersey.

Moderated by NJBIZ Editor Jeffrey Kanige, the Oct. 28 program featured:

William Heller, of counsel at Newark-headquartered law firm Genova Burns LLC

Tiffany Lewis, outreach manager for TRC Cos. Inc., a global consulting, engineering and construction management firm specializing in environmentally focused, digitally powered solutions

Laurie Weigand-Jackson, president and CEO of Utility Advantage, a Woodstown-based energy consulting and services firm

Matthew Fazelpoor, energy and infrastructure reporter at NJBIZ

During the 90-minute roundtable discussion, panelists addressed the significant energy rate hikes New Jersey consumers have experienced this year and how to offset those cost increases, using AI to optimize energy efficiency, demand and maintenance, and protecting critical energy infrastructure from cyber threats.

In June, New Jersey consumers saw significant energy rate hikes, with residential electricity bills rising between 17% and 20%, or roughly $22 to $28 more per month for an average household.

The increases were largely driven by higher wholesale and capacity costs in PJM Interconnection LLC’s regional power market and a supply that is outpaced by demand. To ease the impact, state regulators approved a temporary $60 summer bill credit and extended protections against shut offs for low-income and vulnerable customers.

On the campaign trail

Fazelpoor described it as a “prominent issue” in the Nov. 4 gubernational election between Democrat Mikie Sherrill and Republican Jack Ciattarelli.

“In other campaigns, energy’s mentioned, but not always. Property taxes and affordability in New Jersey is always top of mind,” he said. “If not the top issue right now, it is one of the top two, three issues in the state that’s being discussed everywhere.”

“It hits into all the other things going on – cost of living, health insurance, mortgage rates, everything,” he said. “And just the timing of it hitting June 1 right before summer, it definitely made an impact.”

Weigand-Jackson said, “I think what the business community is dealing with right now is just trying to understand why? And are we going to see this for the next couple of years? Is this just a one-off? I think from our perspective, this is going to be for a couple of years.”

Weigand-Jackson went on to explain that recent electricity price hikes and supply constraints stem largely from issues between PJM and Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. For years, the back-and-forth over how to run capacity auctions disrupted the usual three-year planning cycle, making it hard for power generators and developers – both fossil fuel and renewable – to plan new projects, she said.

Not an overnight fix

As a result, generation hasn’t kept pace with rising demand driven by data centers, AI and cryptocurrency. She also blames PJM’s backlog of unprocessed renewable projects, higher natural gas prices, and outdated federal rules that kept some clean-energy projects out of the market — all of which have combined to tighten supply and push prices higher.

“There’s a lot happening in the market that over the past five or six years led to this point. So, it wasn’t as if one thing caused it, and it’s not something that’s going to get fixed overnight. But fundamentally, the issues relate to the fact that we do not have enough supply to meet demand,” she said.

She went on to say, “The grid absolutely needs to be modernized. Our grid is this grid that we’ve had a hundred-plus years … And we have been investing in upgrades to the grid, but not specifically to support where this new generating assets would be coming online per se. And that’s why PJM has this really long queue of projects because what they’re doing is assessing the impact on the transmission system. It is tied together – both transmission and generation – but we don’t know what the transmission upgrades are until PJM does their analysis.”

“They’re the ones that are responsible for this. They manage and operate that power grid from Illinois to Jersey to West Virginia. This massive grid – the biggest in the country is operated by PJM – and they’re the ones that have to do these analyses, approve transmission projects or submit them up. And then FERC [Federal Energy Regulatory Commission] also gets involved because it’s interstate commerce. So, there is a combination of the need for transmission upgrades, but where do we upgrade the transmission system? Well, we have to know where the generation is going to be.”

Surge of support

Lewis said, “All of the utility companies throughout the state are really investing to support customers with decreasing their energy use. So, they’re putting more teams out there in terms of engagement and community engagement and doing outreach to really connect with the customers and ensure that even underserved communities and UEZ [Urban Enterprise Zone] zones are receiving that additional support so that they can help fund projects that will help decrease their utility bills.”

“There are individuals where their utility bills are a significant portion of their expenses … there’s a sector of our state here that is really struggling with these high energy costs and I’m appreciating what is happening right now to try to alleviate some of that specifically for our most affected consumers,” Weigand-Jackson said.

Lewis went on to encourage all rate payers – whether they are homeowners, renters or businesses – to connect with utility companies to learn about the range of available resources, such as energy audits and financing support, to fund energy efficient upgrades.

She also pointed out that the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is actively investing in clean energy programs by offering funding and credits for municipalities and commercial facilities that look to add technology or undertake projects to save energy and strengthen resilience.

“Part of the goal is to decrease the customer’s energy use so that we can decrease that demand on the grid to support with less power outages and these issues while the utilities are still upgrading their infrastructure because they have a long way to go,” said Lewis, who works with JCP&L (FirstEnergy company Jersey Central Power & Light) through her role at TRC.

Getting energized

While offshore wind development in New Jersey remains at a standstill, panelists spoke about growing adoption of solar power across the state in recent years. For example, Heller, a former senior vice president and general counsel of the New York Giants NFL team, noted that when NRG became a sponsor of MetLife Stadium about a decade ago, it added a ring of 1,350 solar panels on the roof of the East Rutherford property.

Because New Jersey lacks large open land for massive solar farms, the state’s focus is on smaller distributed energy projects placed strategically where the grid can support them, according to Weigand-Jackson.

She emphasized the need to improve energy efficiency and expanded distributed resources, like solar, battery storage and demand management, as a way to reduce consumption and costs. “I do think the solution is more distributed energy solutions and not large-scale plants,” Weigand-Jackson added.

As for public-private partnerships to help spur development of such systems, Fazelpoor said he hasn’t heard of much happening in that area.

“And even if a company were going to make an investment right now, the timeline is many, many years out,” he said. “Given that the problem is already at our doorstep and likely to grow with the demand of data centers and AI, it’s all kind of colliding with those factors in place.”

And, with energy becoming such a political issue in New Jersey, he believes that will make it “even harder to get anything done right now.”

Data center demands

Additionally, participants reflected on the issue of data centers.

In New Jersey, development and construction of facilities involved in AI operations and cloud computing is typically focused in the central and southern parts of the state. But the massive amounts of electricity and cooling required for the sites has led to local concerns. Much of the opposition centers on how that high-energy demand can strain the grid and raise electricity prices. Environmental impacts, like noise, water use and land consumption, have also been flagged.

Weigand-Jackson said data centers should fund their own energy generation or infrastructure upgrades rather than passing those costs to all ratepayers.

“We can absolutely require them to do that. We can develop rate structures specifically for data centers. We can put policies in place that is something the state can control,” she said, noting that Ohio recently began regulating such sites more closely after rapid growth in the industry.

As of July, Ohio’s utilities commission requires large data centers to pay for at least 85% of their subscribed electricity capacity, even if they use less, to prevent higher costs for other customers. Regulators also created a special tariff class for data centers and ended a temporary moratorium on new connections once those rules were in place.

At the same time, the Buckeye State continues to offer tax incentives to attract data center development, such as sales tax exemptions for major investments, while managing its grid impacts.

‘The time is now’

Panelists also agreed that how energy is used and managed is key.

Lewis explained that an important step for ratepayers right now revolves around energy management, such as upgrading systems and optimizing equipment to reduce peak energy use. Utilities are also offering incentives and training for businesses and contractors to help meet energy-saving goals while batter storage and distributed energy are still being developed.

Lewis continued, “There are funds available … the time is now. Please reach out and there is a wealth of resources and support available.”

One such resource is the Garden State Commercial Property Assessed Clean Energy (C-PACE) Program. Through the state-run initiative, commercial, industrial, agricultural and certain nonprofit owners can receive financing toward clean energy, water conservation and resiliency improvements.

Through C-PACE, power consumers can access long-term, low-interest financing for improvements such as solar panels, HVAC upgrades or flood protection, and repay the loan through a special assessment on their property tax bill. The financing stays with the property, not the owner, if it’s sold.

After the New Jersey Economic Development Authority approved the offering in October 2024, it began accepting project applications this past summer.

However, for property owners to use the program, municipalities must opt into it. As of August 2025, only six of the state’s 564 towns are active participants – Hackensack, Lakewood, New Brunswick, Oldmans Township, Plainfield and Woodbridge.

Weigand-Jackson said, “If you think this is something that would be good for your business, go talk to your municipality and ask them where they’re at … They probably all have heard about it, but they may not know enough or think that the demand is even there to go through the process of becoming a C-PACE municipality. But it is a financing mechanism that’s been operating all around the country successfully and ultimately is now here.”

‘Incremental steps’

“For a lot of business owners, they say, ‘Yeah, OK, that sounds great, but I don’t have the capital to replace this equipment right now. And if I’m going to put the money in, I’m going to put it into the main purpose of my business and not upgrading my heating or cooling or lighting or refrigeration equipment.’ But now we have either 0% or very low percent financing on your utility bill. It’s never been easier for businesses to take advantage of both the incentives and the financing. Energy efficiency is definitely something every business that’s listening should be looking at,” Weigand-Jackson added.

“Take a look at your utility bills, try to understand them, reach out to professionals who can help you understand them and start looking at energy as a manageable expense. It isn’t something you just have to take. You can actually do things to manage those costs,” she said, adding, “I would encourage people to be looking at energy efficiency and renewable energy. They’re cost-effective solutions and they are not too expensive, they’re viable today.

“Maybe 10, 15 years ago, things like solar were expensive. Now, it’s very commercially available. Very cost-effective. Battery storage? Not quite yet. But we will get there. That doesn’t mean don’t do battery storage — it just means that the cost is going to come down over time. So, it’s really a financial decision on your part at this point. But these are the things that you can do to help yourself at these times of volatile and rising energy costs,” Weigand-Jackson said.

“I think it’s even a better approach to talk to people about incremental steps. It’s important to have goals, I get that, but we need to be realistic. We don’t know how long it takes for technology to evolve and so I think it’s better to have the shorter-term ones of what we can do in the next three to five years and then keep working toward something,” she said.

AI-powered

The use of AI to manage energy is only increasing. According to business consulting firm Grand View Research, the global market is expected to rise from about $11 billion in 2024 to nearly $55 billion by 2030, as more adopt AI for grid management, forecasting and efficiency.

Driven by the need for cost reduction, greater efficiency and clean energy integration, utility and energy firms are using the tech for grid optimization, predictive maintenance and demand forecasting.

Just some of the tasks that AI is tapped for include: predicting energy demand so utilities can balance supply; optimizing building systems to use less energy automatically; detecting inefficiencies or equipment problems to prevent energy loss; and coordinating renewable sources, such as wind and solar, by forecasting output and adjusting usage.

The energy industry is also focused on collaborating with tech companies, like Microsoft, and research institutions, such as the Electric Power Research Institute, to scale AI, share data, develop models and modernize the grid for reliability and decarbonization.

Heller stressed the need for caution with AI.

“It is a tool and it’s a good tool, but it cannot be the sole tool because it generates the wrong information,” he said. “Many, many people are affected by the adoption of an AI-generated solution.

“And one of the issues that I face as a lawyer doing contracts in this field is whether a corporation relying on AI has insurance coverage to almost analogous to legal malpractice insurance to enable the use of AI, but to protect the business against the risks of overreliance on AI,” he said.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/10/Energy-Generation-stock-art.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 02:20:10.663858

Mr. Gates’s path to becoming a climate authority is rooted in the same disruptive ethos that defined his technology career.","For more than a decade, Bill Gates’s views have come to define the respectable centre of climate discourse for the American elite. His words have carried the weight of authority and his ideas have bridged science, capital, and philanthropy in a distinct technocratic register.

Around 2019-2021, Mr. Gates’ climate messaging leaned towards apocalyptic urgency as he issued dire warnings of collapsing ecosystems, mass displacement, and a narrowing window for the world to achieve net-zero. The rhetoric helped spur public concerns but also reproduced the pitfalls of climate alarmism, which is to overstate catastrophic inevitability without also emphasising adaptive capacity and human agency. Alarmism can mobilise communities in the short term but in the long-term it invites disbelief and political backlash.

Now, Mr. Gates appears to have overcorrected. In a recent memo, he said that while climate change will have serious effects, it won’t threaten humanity’s survival. He also suggested that reducing poverty and disease would better equip vulnerable populations to face a warming world. The differences between “not apocalyptic” and “not severe” are crucial yet easily lost in public discourse. He assumed the audience would parse gradations of scientific probability; in reality it mainly registers tone.

A dangerous pivot

Mr. Gates’s position on climate adaptation has long been defined by the belief that technological innovation, investments, and systems engineering can decouple growth from emissions. While this view helped raise considerable funds for low-carbon energy research, it also perpetuated certain political tensions.

The foremost issue was that the optimism could be autocratic in practice. Mr. Gates’s philanthropic model channels private wealth into setting priorities for entire governments, and in his pre-recalibration era, these were technically sophisticated measures to limit the amount of carbon in our environs without addressing the human and natural processes that put it there. His philanthropy often bypassed democratic deliberation, so his approach to “solving” climate change could crowd out alternative discourses, especially those emphasising structural change.

Even now, Mr. Gates has said the world has made significant progress on cutting emissions. This isn’t strongly supported by data. The Global Carbon Project and Carbon Brief states that global fossil fuel emissions reached record highs in 2022-2024, although their rate of growth slowed from about 3% per year in the 2000s to roughly 0.5% per year in the last decade. Emissions due to land-use changes have decreased by 28% since the late 1990s but this progress is outweighed by continued growth in emissions, particularly in China and India.

There are also uncertainties in emissions accounting. Land-use change emissions estimates are uncertain due to incomplete data on forest degradation and regional data gaps, especially in tropical regions. Even where declines are reported, revisions between datasets shift cumulative global emissions by tens of gigatonnes. Year-to-year changes also have wide error ranges. Taken together, these uncertainties mean that while the rate of emissions growth may have slowed and land-use emissions likely decreased, it is premature to claim progress in emissions reduction.

Likewise, Mr. Gates’s pivot to prioritising global poverty and health also risks being read, especially by Western or corporate audiences, as the more convenient “we can keep burning now if we vaccinate the poor later”. This logic of substitution undermines the systemic simultaneity that climate adaptation action demands.

U.S. President Donald Trump’s reaction to Mr. Gates’s memo, claiming he had “won the war on the climate change hoax”, unsurprisingly reduced a re-evaluation to a hollow political victory. The more important consequences lie in the ripple effects of Mr. Gates’s own shift.

Ripple effects of the shift

While it was commendable, two facts complicate its perception. First, Mr. Gates continues to occupy an outsized place in the global climate discourse as he translates science into a sort of climate common sense for the elite. His moderation carries both symbolic and practical weight. Second, his first alarmist position raised the stakes to untenable levels, then lowered them in the face of conflicting evidence, setting up a textbook example of why brinkmanship is bad. Even if stepping back from the brink is laudable, it will fuel overweening denialists such as Mr. Trump, who have trouble differentiating moderation from retreat.

Mr. Gates’s path to becoming a climate authority is rooted in the same disruptive ethos that defined his technology career. He did not conquer the computing world with perfect, high-end products but by strategically pushing software and hardware that simply made computing more accessible. Ironically, he protected this dominance and opposed the open-source movement because he viewed it as a direct threat to Microsoft’s business model. But as the technology landscape evolved with the rise of the internet and cloud computing, Microsoft’s stance began to turn under new leadership. Mr. Gates himself acquiesced after it became clear the new paradigm would not cramp his business model.

In a world where great wealth and success are seen as a license to arbitrate on all critical societal issues, it is almost inevitable that Mr. Gates would become a climate seer — and that his opinions can’t be dismissed out of hand.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/xq6cwc/article70233869.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/California_Wildfires_Palisades_Investigation_15709.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 03:57:54.345873

""High-profile incidents and misinformation continue to impact public perception,"" Dr. Robert Roop, an executive at the company Axalta, told the publication.

As for EV batteries, all of these improvements work together to make EVs safer, more reliable, and more accessible for everyone.
When people feel confident in the technology, more drivers will be willing to make the switch from polluting gas-powered cars.","A German company has developed an innovative battery coating that can withstand extreme heat, potentially solving one of the major safety concerns for electric vehicle drivers.

The issue Axalta's creation solves is called thermal runaway. According to Interesting Engineering, it's a rare but serious event where a single battery cell overheats, triggering a chain reaction that can lead to a fire.

While statistics show that electric cars are far less likely to catch fire than gas-powered ones, scary stories can stick in people's minds.

""High-profile incidents and misinformation continue to impact public perception,"" Dr. Robert Roop, an executive at the company Axalta, told the publication.

Axalta's solution is a pair of new coatings that act like a super-powered fire blanket for batteries. One of the coatings, Alesta e-PRO FG Black, is designed for extreme heat protection and can withstand direct flames at temperatures up to an incredible 2,192 degrees Fahrenheit without producing any smoke.

This helps to delay or even prevent a fire from spreading, giving passengers crucial time to get to safety.

""The new coatings reflect our commitment to innovation and to partnering with customers to meet the challenges of next-generation mobility,"" Dr. Roop said.

This breakthrough is part of a huge wave of innovation happening in the EV battery world. For instance, researchers at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory are exploring ways to recycle and repair old batteries instead of just melting them down.

In Africa, a new project is developing sodium-ion batteries to create a local supply chain that doesn't rely on lithium. Meanwhile, another team in Germany has developed a new laser welding technique to build stronger, crack-resistant battery housings.

Of course, switching to an EV already saves drivers a lot of money on gas and maintenance. Those savings get even bigger when you can charge up at home using energy generated via solar panels.

For homeowners looking to get a clear sense of the costs of solar panels, EnergySage is a trusted source that makes it easy to compare quotes from trusted local installers.

As for EV batteries, all of these improvements work together to make EVs safer, more reliable, and more accessible for everyone.

When people feel confident in the technology, more drivers will be willing to make the switch from polluting gas-powered cars. That means cleaner air in our communities, which is a huge win for public health.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/axaltaalestae-pro.jpg,N,,2025-11-03 03:18:08.922600

The group issued the call after monitoring plastic waste scattered across public and private cemeteries in Bataan, Bulacan, Pampanga, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, and Metro Manila — including the Manila North and South cemeteries — from October 31 to November 2.
Among the single-use plastics observed were plastic bags, bottles, cups, cutlery, straws, and polystyrene food and beverage containers, according to EcoWaste.
“We urge our lawmakers to prioritize the enactment of a law that will phase out and eventually ban the production and consumption of SUPs,” EcoWaste campaigner Ochie Tolentino said in a statement on Monday.
“This long-overdue pollution prevention legislation will surely help reduce the volume as well as the toxicity of what we throw away every day, especially during Undas and other cultural celebrations,” he added.","MANILA, Philippines — Pro-environmental group EcoWaste Coalition has called on Congress to enact a law that would phase out and eventually ban single-use plastics (SUPs) to help reduce the country’s growing volume of garbage, following this year’s observance of Undas (All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day).

“This long-overdue pollution prevention legislation will surely help reduce the volume as well as the toxicity of what we throw away every day, especially during Undas and other cultural celebrations,” he added.

EcoWaste noted that while less litter was observed inside cemeteries due to the efforts of street sweepers and regular cleanups, streets outside cemetery compounds from November 1 to 2 were still littered with assorted garbage, including food packaging and leftovers.

“Less litter and less garbage will be generated in the future Undas if SUPs are phased out, if local government units effectively enforce existing plastic ban ordinances, and if RA 9003-compliant waste management systems are implemented inside and outside cemeteries, memorial parks and columbaria,” the group said.

Republic Act No. 9003, also known as the Ecological Solid Waste Management Act of 2000, aims to protect public health and the environment by promoting sustainable waste prevention and reduction practices, including source reduction, reuse, recycling, composting and proper disposal.

But Tolentino emphasized that simply placing trash bins for mixed waste in cemeteries is not enough, as garbage still needs to be properly segregated to ensure efficient recycling, prevent contamination, and minimize the amount of residual waste that ends up in landfills.

“As most cemeteries lack ecological solid waste management plans and adequate personnel to carry them out, especially during Undas when thousands visit their departed loved ones, it is best for visitors not to leave any trash behind, no matter how little,” he added. /apl",https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/files/2025/11/Manila-North-Cemetery-1-3-scaled-e1762144670969.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 23:57:49.048498

The fight for science and human progress can only take place through the building of a socialist movement in the working class.","Changes in the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), run under the direct control of the president since it was established by Richard Nixon in 1970, will transform the mission of the agency from protecting human health from environmental toxins to directly serving the profit interests of corporate polluters. Field workers and scientists are being terminated by the Trump administration, and the leadership of EPA divisions is being replaced by corporate flunkies.

Earlier this month, President Trump declared that during the federal government shutdown, Office of Management and Budget (OMB) Director Russell Vought would decide “which of the many Democrat Agencies, most of which are a political SCAM, he recommends to be cut, and whether or not those cuts will be temporary or permanent.” Trump added, “I can’t believe the Radical Left Democrats gave me this unprecedented opportunity.”

In July, the EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) was closed and replaced by the Office of Applied Science and Environmental Solutions (OASES), which has been systematically staffed with Trump-aligned administrators after previous officials were forced out.

In an October 21 article, environmental reporter Hiroko Tabuchi of the New York Times summarized articles she has written exposing the restaffing of the EPA with former industry lobbyists whose careers were made fighting the agency’s anti-pollution measures:

David Fotouhi has been installed as EPA deputy administrator under Administrator Lee Zeldin, himself a former Army intelligence officer and Republican congressman. Fotouhi is a lawyer who has fought the banning of asbestos on behalf of corporate interests.

Alex Dominguez, the new deputy assistant administrator, is a former petroleum industry lobbyist.

Aaron Szabo, who heads the Office of Air and Radiation, was a lobbyist for the American Chemistry Council, the chemical industry trade association.

Nancy Beck, who is overseeing the approval of new chemicals for the EPA, was an executive of the American Chemistry Council.

Lynn Dekleva, formerly a director of the same industry organization, who lobbied against the regulation of formaldehyde, is now leading the EPA chemical safety office.

Steven Cook was an attorney for the chemical industry and is now working to repeal cleanup rules for PFAs, known as “forever chemicals.”

Kyle Kunkler has been placed in charge of pesticides policy. Previously he represented the soybean industry, promoting the unrestricted use of the weed killer dicamba. The latter is a controversial chemical sold by Monsanto, BASF and DuPont that is tailored to boost genetically modified soybean plants but can damage neighboring crops when it drifts into the air. Within weeks of Kunkler’s appointment, the EPA recommended a rollback of restrictions on dicamba.

In late June, hundreds of EPA scientists submitted an open letter of protest titled a “Declaration of Dissent.” Addressed to Zeldin, the letter centered on “Five Primary Concerns” over policies that “recklessly undermine the EPA mission:”

1. Undermining public trust

2. Ignoring scientific consensus to benefit polluters

3. Reversing EPA’s progress in America’s most vulnerable communities

4. Dismantling the Office of Research and Development

5. Promoting a culture of fear, forcing staff to choose between their livelihood and the population’s well-being.

The letter of protest cited Trump’s OMB director, Russell Vought, the co-author of Project 2025, which declared that EPA employees should be in a constant state of terror. It stated:

When they wake up in the morning, we want them to not want to go to work because they are increasingly viewed as the villains. We want their funding to be shut down so that the EPA can’t do all of the rules against our energy industry... We want to put them in trauma.

The response of Trump to the protest was to retaliate. An investigation was carried out to identify the signatories, including those who signed the letter anonymously. Some 140 employees, including drinking water field workers, were subsequently placed on administrative leave.

The signatories are to be permanently fired. The Trump administration announced a “zero-tolerance policy for career bureaucrats unlawfully undermining, sabotaging and undercutting the administration’s agenda.”

The attacks on the EPA express the drive of the capitalist establishment to destroy any and all measures that stand in the way of its pursuit of corporate profit.

In a statement distributed to the “Stand Up for Science” demonstrations held in March of this year, titled “The defense of science requires a fight for socialism!”, the Socialist Equality Party wrote:

Modern science and technology have made it possible to wipe out hunger and disease, vanquish ignorance and mysticism, and provide a high standard of living for every human being on the planet. Moreover, the revolutionary developments in transportation and communications, most recently through the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution, have shattered the barriers to human interaction and made possible the education and integration of all humanity on a scale never before seen in history.

The fight for science and human progress can only take place through the building of a socialist movement in the working class. Scientists are experiencing the same process of proletarianization now affecting doctors, teachers and other professionals. Scientists must recognize their common interests with all workers facing attacks on their living standards, jobs and democratic rights. No matter your education level or salary, to the oligarchy that rules America, you are as expendable as any other worker.",https://www.wsws.org/asset/d2b2f2b8-5b26-4485-8914-a2efdda24529?rendition=1600x900,N,,2025-11-03 02:20:50.471253

In letters dated Oct. 29, the coalition accused the U.S. Plastics Pact, the Consumer Goods Forum, and the Green Blue Institute’s Sustainable Packaging Coalition of organizing large-scale business conduct that could unlawfully restrain trade.

The attorneys general claim in the letters that by jointly dictating standards for plastic production, packaging, and recycling, the groups may be driving “systemwide changes” in the marketplace that restrict competition, reduce product quality, and increase consumer costs.

“Radical environmental activists do not have the right, nor the avenue, to suppress business operations in our market,” said Uthmeier. “We have reason to believe that the policies of the Consumer Goods Forum, the Green Blue Institute, and the U.S. Plastics Pact are hindering states’ economic prosperity by coordinating business behavior, which would constitute violations of Florida’s antitrust laws. We will not allow these activist organizations to push misguided policies that can’t win at the ballot box and inflate prices for Florida consumers.”

The letter to the U.S. Plastics Pact focuses on the organization’s “Roadmap to 2025,” which requires member companies to meet four central goals: eliminating problematic plastics, ensuring all packaging is recyclable or compostable, recycling or composting 50 percent of plastic packaging, and incorporating 30 percent recycled or biobased content in products. The attorneys general argue that such uniform targets could artificially alter output and quality across industries, violating prohibitions on agreements not to compete.

A similar letter to the Consumer Goods Forum raises concerns about the group’s “Coalition of Action on Plastic Waste,” which promotes its “Golden Design Rules” for packaging and seeks to align corporate members on circular economy principles and extended producer responsibility policies. The coalition asserts that these efforts represent coordinated market behavior rather than independent business decisions.

The letter to the Green Blue Institute’s Sustainable Packaging Coalition echoes those concerns, noting the group’s stated goal of “harnessing the power of industry” to drive new packaging strategies across the “entire value chain.” The attorneys general said this type of collaboration may constitute an “agreement to make a product of inferior quality,” which courts have recognized as an unlawful output restriction.

For years, Virgin Islanders have fought for Maroon Ridge and Annaly Bay on St. Croix to be protected, and a deal finalized in August by the administration of Gov. Albert Bryan Jr. has made that possible.

""This investment is about conservation and about honoring the struggles of those who came before us,"" Bryan said. ""It ensures that future generations of Virgin Islanders will have access to lands that tell our story, reflect our heritage and strengthen our pride.""

Kristina ""Kitty"" Edwards, the director of the Division of Territorial Parks and Protected Areas, added, ""Today is a victory for [advocates] and for everyone who values our natural and cultural heritage.""

According to a press release, the land acquisition cost $69 million. It was funded through the U.S. Department of Commerce and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration as part of the Inflation Reduction Act.

The vast expanse of land, known as Maroon Sanctuary Territorial Park, will extend the Territorial Parks System and be managed by DPNR's Division of Territorial Parks and Protected Areas.

The newly protected area of Maroon Ridge holds cultural importance, as it was once a settlement for enslaved Africans who escaped bondage, as GoToStCroix.com detailed.

This surge appears to be driven by strong second and third quarter results, as well as expectations that solar power orders will increase in response to rising electricity demand from artificial intelligence (AI) data centers.

Previously, on October 27, HD Hyundai Energy Solution, a company specializing in the production and supply of solar cells and modules, announced its preliminary consolidated results for the third quarter of this year: sales of 121 billion won and operating profit of 14.7 billion won. Compared to the same period last year, sales jumped by 20.3% and operating profit soared by 328.8%. Although the company posted a loss in the first quarter of this year, it has delivered strong results for two consecutive quarters in the second and third quarters.

Meanwhile, the market expects that as the construction boom for AI data centers-especially in the United States-drives a surge in various types of electricity demand, solar power orders will also increase. A testament to this is the recent large-scale solar power purchase agreement signed by Meta, the parent company of Facebook and Instagram, for nearly 1 GW (gigawatt) of capacity. One gigawatt is equivalent to the output of a nuclear power plant, enough to power approximately one million households simultaneously.

According to IT media outlets such as TechCrunch on October 31 (local time), Meta recently signed an agreement to receive power from a new 600 MW (megawatt) solar power plant being built by the North American subsidiary of French energy company ENGIE in Lubbock, Texas, with operations set to begin in 2027. Meta has also entered into a contract with another power provider, Trittioak Clean Energy, to receive 385 MW of solar power generated in Louisiana after 2027.

Unlike thermal power, which is experiencing turbine supply bottlenecks, or nuclear power, which takes a long time from order to completion, renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, as well as fuel cell power generation, can be built within one to two years. This advantage is expected to lead to continued orders as a source of electricity for the rapidly increasing number of data centers.

It's also no surprise to learn that almost everything, in terms of valuation, now rides on robotaxis and on achieving the aim of making publicly available unsupervised full self-driving (FSD) software a reality. However, what's less discussed is that CEO Elon Musk just doubled down on the recent earnings call, which is making the stock riskier.

Why robotaxis and unsupervised full-self driving matter

The importance of robotaxis and publicly available unsupervised FSD (the two are not the same thing, and the latter is likely to lag the former) can't be overstated. They are the key to unlocking value for both investors and Tesla EV owners.

Not only will their success create a long-term stream of highly lucrative recurring revenue for Tesla via ride-per-mile charging, but they will also drive future sales of Tesla's dedicated robotaxi, Cybercab. In addition, the ability to transform a Tesla into a robotaxi using unsupervised FSD will boost the value of Tesla EVs and the adoption rate of FSD.

Tesla investors are patiently waiting for both things to come to fruition while eagerly monitoring the robotaxi rollout as it expands from Austin and the San Francisco Bay Area to Nevada, Arizona, and Florida, as Musk expects by the end of the year.

Elon Musk doubles down

But here's the thing. Tesla is now aggressively adjusting its operations on the assumption that it will succeed with robotaxis and achieve its unsupervised FSD goals. Musk couldn't have been clearer on the recent earnings call, stating that he was ""reticent"" to expand Tesla's production ""until we had clarity on achieving unsupervised full self-driving. But at this point, I feel like we've got clarity, and it makes sense to expand production as fast as we reasonably can.""

However, this isn't just a mission statement; it's a call to arms for production:

According to Musk, ""our intent [is] to expand as quickly as we can our future production.""

Musk also confirmed that the ""single biggest expansion in production will be the Cybercab, which starts production"" in the second quarter of 2026.

CFO Vaibhav Taneja said management is projecting a substantial increase in capital spending in 2026, from an estimated $9 billion in 2025, to prepare the company for growth, including investments in artificial intelligence (AI) and Optimus robots.

Why these plans increase risk

It's fair to assume that Tesla's internal projections for earnings and cash generation in 2026 are based on the same assumptions Musk is making over EV and Cybercab sales; otherwise, what is the point of expanding production ""as fast as we can""? The question then turns to how feasible Tesla's production and sales plans are, not least given the recent expiration of EV tax credits in the U.S.

Much depends on Musk's feeling of ""clarity"" over robotaxis and achieving unsupervised FSD. If these aims aren't achieved, then the ramp-up in production, notably with Cybercabs, coupled with the pre-commitment to increasing capital spending to fuel growth, could compromise the company in 2026.

There's no reward without risk

On the other hand, if Musk is right about robotaxis and unsupervised FSD, then it would be a major mistake not to ramp up production in anticipation of future demand. As such, Tesla's preparatory actions are increasing the potential reward for investors, and its robotaxi rollout and FSD development are also potentially increasing the value of Tesla EVs.

It's possible this thinking is also causing some reticence to deliver lower-cost (say $25,000) vehicles, as robotaxis and unsupervised FSD should increase Tesla EV values anyway.

How to think about Tesla stock

It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming more risk means a less favorable stock proposition. It doesn't; at least it might not, if the potential reward has increased, too. Consequently, the best way to think about the recent events is that Tesla is becoming a higher-risk/higher-reward proposition.

That might not suit all investors, but it's likely to suit investors looking to buy a stock to fill a position at the aggressive end of their portfolio, and the stock will be somewhat derisked if Tesla achieves Musk's aim of eliminating safety drivers in robotaxis in Austin in due course -- something to look out for.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/840164/two-teslas-in-a-line-driving-on-road.png,N,,2025-11-02 22:18:19.846964

These consist largely of captive coal projects in Indonesia, India, Laos, Zimbabwe, and Zambia.
This loophole casts a growing shadow over the progress made in ending China’s overseas coal investments.
To-date, China’s overseas captive coal projects have added an estimated 1.5 billion tonnes of lifetime CO₂, which comes to almost half of all emissions currently in operation.
Policy recommendations CREA and PACS propose the following policy recommendations to expedite the implementation of President Xi’s 2021 pledge to phase-out China-backed overseas coal projects, including but not limited to:","More than four years after President Xi Jinping pledged to end China’s financing of overseas coal projects, the annual assessment from the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air (CREA) and the People of Asia for Climate Solutions (PACS) finds that while some progress has been made, the rise of privately owned off-grid captive coal projects for industrial needs, particularly in Indonesia and Africa, is a growing concern.

While many coal plants have been cancelled, others continue to move forward, especially privately funded, off-grid projects for industrial use, revealing that implementation gaps and loopholes persist.

The assessment analyses five categories — cancelled; pre-permitted; permitted; under construction; operational — and adds a new project category that has emerged this year for idle plants that could return to service at any time without entering a formal permitting process: mothballed.

As of July 2025, the total capacity of overseas coal projects in the pipeline has dropped to 31.4 gigawatts (GW), down from nearly 50 GW in 2024. Cancellations have also accelerated, after a slowdown in 2024, with 16.4 GW of new capacity cancelled in 2025. Since the 2021 pledge, a total of 59.3 GW of projects have been cancelled, which is equivalent to 6.1 billion tonnes of avoided lifetime carbon dioxide (CO₂) emissions.

Despite these positive trends, operational projects have grown by 4.1 GW in 2025. Most of these projects were under construction in 2024 or about to be commissioned, demonstrating that once a plant enters the construction stage, it is unlikely to be cancelled.

Although the pace of construction has slowed in 2025, 12.1 GW of capacity remains under construction across 14 projects. These consist largely of captive coal projects in Indonesia, India, Laos, Zimbabwe, and Zambia. These are off-grid facilities that serve industrial needs and are owned by private Chinese companies. This loophole casts a growing shadow over the progress made in ending China’s overseas coal investments. See report annex for further details in the field studies.

To-date, China’s overseas captive coal projects have added an estimated 1.5 billion tonnes of lifetime CO₂, which comes to almost half of all emissions currently in operation. The current projects under construction could add a total of around 3.4 billion tonnes of potential lifetime CO₂ emissions upon completion.

The REGO tranche, meanwhile, has been touted as the successor to the Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme, which is currently being phased out by 2030.
The CER says the REGO will provide an “enduring and extended framework” for the certification of renewable electricity in Australia, verifying when, where and how renewable electricity was generated.

The Guarantee of Origin (GO) is designed to verify the use of renewable energy and low emissions products and has been developed by the federal government to be a key plank of its Future Made in Australia program to boost local clean manufacturing.

It will launch under two branches: Renewable Electricity Guarantee of Origin (REGO) and Product Guarantee of Origin (PGO).

Under the PGO side of the scheme, certificates will record the emissions intensity and key attributes of Australian made products like green hydrogen and metals. It also enables access to government incentives like Hydrogen Headstart and the Hydrogen Production Tax Incentive.

The REGO tranche, meanwhile, has been touted as the successor to the Renewable Energy Target (RET) scheme, which is currently being phased out by 2030.

The CER says the REGO will provide an “enduring and extended framework” for the certification of renewable electricity in Australia, verifying when, where and how renewable electricity was generated.

Initially, the REGO will be open to eligible renewable electricity generators, including power stations already accredited under the RET scheme, and energy storage systems. It will later expand to include aggregated systems like virtual power plants.

Assistant federal energy and climate minister Josh Wilson says the scheme will give Australian producers the confidence and credibility they need to compete in a global economy that’s rapidly decarbonising.

“The GO Scheme will help Australia to realise the full economic potential of the energy transition by supporting jobs and investment in a Future Made in Australia,” Wilson said on Monday.

“A key tool in the Albanese Government’s energy transition toolbox, GO will catalyse the development of renewable hydrogen to the scale we need to power the growth of new industries and jobs, and to decarbonise critical but hard-to-abate industrial sectors.”

CER Chair David Parker says the establishment of a “robust certification system” for emerging low-emissions products is key to enabling their growth and building trust across the supply chain.

“Transparent, high-integrity digital certificates issued under the GO scheme will enable Australian businesses to differentiate their products as low-emissions or renewable, gaining a competitive edge in both domestic and export markets,” Parker said on Monday.

“For example, low-emissions hydrogen produced through electrolysis can provide effective methods for decarbonising high-emitting operations like ammonia and iron production and it will be important that those products are able to verify their low carbon status.”

Brown, Nate Weisberg, James Hassett, Brian Shearer, Arnav Rao",,,,,https://washingtonmonthly.com/2025/11/02/trumps-industrial-policies-whats-right-and-wrong/,"In recent months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations.
Unilateralism: Trump’s industrial policy has been personalist, flowing from and controlled by the president himself.
Legally dubious boundary pushing: Much of Trump’s industrial policy has operated in legal gray zones.
This has insulated much of Trump’s industrial policy from administrative procedure, due process, and judicial review.
For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption.","In recent months, Donald Trump’s administration has supplemented its globe-spanning tariffs with bespoke industrial policy deals with U.S. corporations. These include the federal government taking equity stakes in Intel, a “golden share” in U.S. Steel, and profit sharing on Nvidia and AMD’s chip sales in China. The deals have astonished and unnerved economic analysts across the political spectrum. Commentators from The Wall Street Journal editorial page to MSNBC have decried them as “unprecedented” and amounting to “socialism,” “corporatism,” or “state capitalism with American characteristics.”

In truth, Trump’s actions are rooted in a long history of presidents from both parties taking temporary control or ownership of systemically important companies. However, until now, most of these interventions have been temporary and involved either wartime emergencies or too-big-to-fail corporate collapse. Under Woodrow Wilson, the federal government took temporary ownership of the railroad industry to support troops during World War I. During World War II, Franklin D. Roosevelt’s administration directed much of the corporate industrial sector. In 1980, Jimmy Carter’s administration extended loan guarantees to Chrysler in exchange for stock warrants. After the company recovered and repaid its loans, the government earned $311 million in capital gains. During the financial crisis, Barack Obama’s administration provided the auto industry with tens of billions of dollars in exchange for equity stakes and commitments for substantial restructuring.

Trump’s moves also build on recent industrial policy interventions by his and Joe Biden’s administrations. Until now, those policies stopped short of the government seeking direct influence over corporate governance through golden shares or equity stakes. During his first term, Trump primarily conducted industrial policy through targeted tariffs and trade actions to promote American industry, and by jawboning corporations to boost domestic manufacturing. The Biden administration went further, providing computer chip and clean energy companies with hundreds of billions of dollars—and detailed requirements for how they could be spent—as part of a long-term post-neoliberal industrial strategy for national security. Those actions were consistent with, though a major step beyond, Trump’s first-term trade policies, just as Trump’s second-term corporate dealmaking is an advance on Biden’s (even if neither president would admit it).

So, while Trump’s dealmaking spree is not unprecedented, it ventures into new territory reflecting his strongman tendencies: He has claimed for himself concentrated power to oversee and influence corporate decision-making, authority thus far ceded to him by Congress and the courts. He has operated outside the law through handshake deals that corporations often cannot afford to refuse, endowing the presidency with powerful—and dangerous—economic tools for routine use.

This is unlikely to be a mere Trump-era aberration. Presidents typically don’t forego inherited powers. Today’s novelty policies may become tomorrow’s precedent, as the last decade has shown. Some elements of industrial policy with Trumpist characteristics may become long-term features of American governance. But Congress and the judiciary should assert democratic and constitutional control over American industrial policy now and in the future to prevent its abuse and, potentially, its collapse.

Here’s a rundown of Trump’s corporate dealmaking thus far:

U.S. Steel: In June, the White House greenlit Nippon Steel’s takeover bid for the American steelmaker U.S. Steel. Trump overturned Biden’s blocking of the deal—on the condition that the government receive a “golden share” of the company, allowing it to veto major corporate decisions, such as offshoring jobs and closing plants.

MP Materials: In July, the Department of Defense announced an investment in MP Materials, the country’s only active producer of certain rare earth minerals used for military equipment. The deal provided government support for the company, guaranteeing a minimum price for its products and providing a guaranteed buyer—the federal government—for all its output for the next 10 years. The feds also extended a $150 million loan and purchased $400 million in company stock, making it MP’s largest shareholder.

Japan: Also in July, the White House announced a trade deal with Japan that purportedly included Tokyo creating a $550 billion investment fund for the administration to use toward its industrial policy priorities, including energy infrastructure, semiconductor manufacturing, critical mineral supply chains, pharmaceutical production, and shipbuilding. Japan quickly contested the administration’s description of the deal, explaining that the investment fund would be nearly entirely composed of loans the U.S. would need to repay.

Nvidia and AMD: In August, the administration agreed to allow the semiconductor makers Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices to sell certain modified chips in China, reversing national security restrictions. The companies also agreed to give 15 percent of all profits earned in China to the U.S. government.

Intel: Later that month, the administration took a 10 percent equity stake in the chipmaker Intel. The deal converted billions of dollars in grants the company was due under the CHIPS and Science Act into equity stakes, making the federal government Intel’s largest shareholder. That conversion also, without any legal authority, dispensed with CHIPS Act taxpayer safeguards that required Intel to reach milestones toward completing new domestic manufacturing sites to receive federal funding.

Trump’s economic interventions bear a number of distinctive qualities that expand on industrial policy precedent, but five stand out.

1. Unilateralism: Trump’s industrial policy has been personalist, flowing from and controlled by the president himself. Unlike the Biden administration, which shepherded industrial policy bills through Congress, Trump relies exclusively on executive action. His industrial policy has at times been colored by favoritism and personal relationships. The Nvidia export agreement, for instance, came after meetings between Trump and CEO Jensen Huang. The president himself asked Huang for a share of the company’s Chinese profits. In other cases, bargained-for benefits have been structured to accrue directly under Trump’s control. The Nippon Steel agreement gave control of the golden share not to the office of the president but to Trump himself; only after he leaves office does the share transfer to the secretaries of treasury and commerce. Finally, the (contested) $550 billion pot from Japan would be, according to Secretary of Commerce Howard Lutnick, a fund to be spent however Trump wished—part of “a national security and economic fund managed by Donald Trump.”

2. Public ownership in the absence of a fiscal crisis or national security justification: While direct government ownership of industry is not unheard of in American history, the Trump administration has been uniquely eager to wield it as a routine industrial policy tool. The MP Materials and Intel deals both gave the government equity ownership of private companies, and the U.S. Steel approval netted the government special, powerful veto rights over that company’s decision-making. After announcing the (contested) terms of the Japan trade deal, administration officials even contemplated using the deal’s (disputed) investment fund to build government-owned factories that could then be leased to private companies.

3. Bullying individual companies: Trump has a quid pro quo mentality of wanting a cut of any private gains he feels he has facilitated—he has openly compared his presidential dealmaking to waiving property rights on his real estate for the benefit of a third party, in exchange for a fee. When he agreed to grant Nvidia export licenses to sell modified chips in China, Trump told its chief executive, “If I’m going to do that, I want you to pay us something.” Or as Lutnick described the Intel equity stake, “If we’re going to give you the money, we want a piece of the action.”

4. Leveraging government power: Beyond just flexing the rhetorical might of the presidential bully pulpit, Trump has used the levers of government to offer firms deals they can’t refuse. The administration has created or exploited bargaining power to induce targeted firms to relent to its demands. Under export control regulations, Nvidia and AMD needed the administration’s permission to sell chips in China, forcing them to acquiesce to Trump’s profit-sharing demand. Nippon Steel could not take over U.S. Steel without approval from the government’s foreign investment review committee. Shortly before Intel agreed to the equity deal, Trump ratcheted up the pressure by calling for its executive to be fired and withholding its CHIPS Act grants.

Two other examples illustrate Trump’s leverage power plays. In May, he issued an executive order instructing pharmaceutical companies to agree to adhere to “most-favored-nation price targets … to bring prices for American patients in line with comparably developed nations.” The order threatened that the administration would put the squeeze on pharmaceutical companies that don’t comply, through newly authorized competition from drug imports, restrictions on their own exports, antitrust scrutiny, reconsideration of FDA approvals of their drugs, and loss of National Institutes of Health grants. And in August, the administration announced that it would impose high tariffs on semiconductor imports—but would exempt tech companies that made new domestic investment pledges. The administration thus imposed tariffs to create leverage and offered relief from those tariffs to advance its industrial policy goals.

5. Legally dubious boundary pushing: Much of Trump’s industrial policy has operated in legal gray zones. To bypass routine federal contracting and procurement laws that typically require competitive bidding, the administration’s investment in MP Materials relied on a little-used provision of the Defense Production Act authorizing transactions “without regard to the limitations of existing law.” Trump’s profit-sharing deal with Nvidia and AMD flouts prohibitions on export taxes and fees under both the Constitution and federal law. There is also no firm legal basis under the CHIPS Act to convert Intel’s grants into equity (nor was there to withhold its grants in the first place).

Trump has avoided legal constraints by relying on “regulation by deal,” rather than legislation or agency rulemaking. (He’s also been firing the regulators who would otherwise shape such government interventions.) Companies have acquiesced to White House demands that may not otherwise withstand legal scrutiny to avoid lost business opportunities, the cost and time of litigating against the federal government, and the general ire of the Trump administration. This has insulated much of Trump’s industrial policy from administrative procedure, due process, and judicial review.

Some elements of Trump’s approach are likely to endure. The wraparound support for MP Materials, for example, could well become a model for how the U.S. government cultivates strategically important domestic production. The type of golden share Trump obtained in U.S. Steel could be on the table for future mitigation agreements between the federal government and foreign companies seeking to invest in critical domestic sectors.

As I have written for this magazine, there are also compelling reasons for the government to insist on a direct return on its industrial policy investments. Taking equity stakes in semiconductor companies funded by the CHIPS Act was originally a Bernie Sanders proposal. When used in the right context, equity stakes ensure that industrial policy returns upside revenue to the public, instead of merely socializing profits for corporations.

External trends may also lend Trump’s industrial policy approach greater staying power. As policymakers seek new revenue sources beyond traditional taxation, they may increasingly look to levers like equity stakes, profit-sharing agreements, and royalties. Congress’s tendency toward gridlock and paralysis has long spurred administrations to seek creative executive workarounds, but the courts have increasingly limited the discretion given to the administrative state. That may steer administrations toward regulation-by-deal as a flexible means for the executive branch to regain power from the judiciary.

It’s not hard to imagine where Trumpist industrial policy may be headed. White House advisers have said they will seek equity stakes in other companies receiving federal grants and loans to seed a sovereign wealth fund. Moreover, if Intel cannot right its ship, it may be forced to revisit previous discussions of spinning off its semiconductor factories to a foreign firm like the Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company. The Trump administration, which has opposed such a move, could, as Intel’s largest shareholder, dictate the terms of such a deal. (Indeed, the Intel agreement included a poison pill to stymie the sale of its foundries.) Plus, any such sale must win the administration’s approval through the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States. One could imagine the administration negotiating on economic and national security grounds for government ownership of Intel’s factories, which could then be leased to another chipmaker.

Trump’s industrial policy toolkit may empower future administrations with different priorities. For instance, federal policies—steep tariffs and national security exclusions—are sparing U.S. automakers from a flood of low-cost, cutting-edge Chinese electric vehicles. A future administration could condition that continued industry protection on American carmakers offering more affordable low-emissions vehicles and ramping up their research and development investments.

A future administration could use the specter of the government’s statutory powers to limit or override patents on federally funded technologies to negotiate long-term profit-sharing agreements with artificial intelligence companies. It could also use similar authority to negotiate price reductions from pharmaceutical companies and leverage the Medicare Advantage market to acquire golden shares in health insurance companies, with veto power over major corporate decisions.

A future Democratic administration could grant targeted tariff reductions to countries or companies that decarbonize their energy grids and production processes—and dangle extra reductions to those that use American-made clean energy technology. It could use the Defense Production Act’s preemption power to expedite clean energy and new housing development around other legal impediments. If the industrial policy arc from the first Trump administration to the Biden administration is any guide, the next Democratic president will make fulsome use of these kinds of Trump-inspired tools.

So sheer inertia may well propel Trumpist industrial policy forward. But there are several stark and urgent reasons Congress and the courts should pump the brakes and reconsider major elements of Trump’s approach. For one, this approach may simply yield worse industrial policy. Absent exceeding care and deliberation, go-it-alone executive branch industrial policy can overreach and implode without the safeguards and democratic legitimacy of operating through Congress. Even if Trump’s deals successfully evade the courts, a subsequent administration could deem some contrary to law and declare them null and void—regulation by deal has far less long-term durability than regulation by regulation, let alone legislation. Such whipsawing will make the U.S. government a less reliable, more tumultuous economic actor.

For another, elements of Trump’s industrial policy are a recipe for abuse and corruption. Pay-to-play regimes for exporting sensitive technologies to foreign adversaries jeopardize fair competition and national security. Personalist policymaking is a recipe for cronyism, corruption, and favoritism for well-connected dominant firms. As The New York Times reported, Trump’s family was directly benefiting from billions of dollars of investment in its crypto company by the United Arab Emirates—at the same time it agreed to provide the UAE with highly sensitive and valuable advanced semiconductor chips.

It is all too easy to foresee more future gambits redounding to the private benefit of the Trump family (like the Paramount merger with Skydance, which routed $16 million into the Trump presidential library). Moreover, while leverage can be useful for achieving policy aims, marshaling the vast regulatory state as one big pressure cooker to coerce concessions from targeted companies risks undermining other vital policy interests. We’re already seeing that regarding antitrust. Companies seeking merger approvals have won favorable treatment from the Trump administration by making side promises for domestic manufacturing investments. The potential for Trumpist misuse of industrial policy risks poisoning the whole enterprise.

That’s where Congress and the courts come in—or where they should. Congress was a true coequal branch during the Biden administration’s major industrial policy programs, shaping and passing the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, CHIPS and Science Act, and Inflation Reduction Act through normal legislative processes. It could again instill democratic prerogatives and guardrails for industrial policy. Congress could determine when the government should take equity stakes in private companies. It could set ground rules around taking golden shares, like which corporate decisions may be subject to a government veto and which are off-limits. It could set standards around appropriate uses of revenue-sharing deals with the federal government. It could stipulate where the revenue generated from industry policy investments should go and how it should be spent. It could set rules preventing the government from unduly favoring companies where it has taken equity stakes in competitor firms. It could establish safeguards to ensure that industrial policy is not used to enrich public officials. Meanwhile, the courts may need to revisit legal doctrines like standing to ensure that some party can contest deals of questionable legality, like the Nvidia revenue-sharing agreement or the Intel equity swap.

If Congress fails to act, it could be understood as blessing Trump’s mode of industrial policy by one-man dealmaking. That doesn’t just invite corruption, but is also a recipe for managerial disaster. The Obama administration’s masterful overhaul of Detroit is arguably less remembered today than the failure of Solyndra. After receiving an Energy Department loan, the solar panel firm’s bankruptcy led to a series of high-profile investigations that ultimately uncovered no criminal wrongdoing or corruption but soured the public on Obama’s nascent clean energy industrial strategy.

With Trump’s state capitalism, the hands-off market fundamentalism era is over. The question is whether the government’s new terms of engagement with industry will be dominated by the president or deliberated on by Congress and the courts. Acquiescence by the other branches to Trump’s deals, warts and all, risks heralding the unchecked and unbalanced industrial policy of the unitary executive. Activation by them, however, could lead to a whole-of-government effort to sand away the roughest edges of Trump’s approach to craft an industrial policy that is both powerful and responsible to effectively guide the country forward.",https://washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nov-25-IndustrialPolicy-Dodge.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:14.017369

The IRA didn’t just spur investment in battery manufacturing; it helped create over 133,000 decent blue-collar jobs in battery production in just two years.
The nascent American battery industry hasn’t had enough time to relocate its supply chain.","In July, Donald Trump’s administration announced a staggering 93.5 percent tariff on Chinese graphite—a material essential to battery production. China not only dominates graphite mining but also controls 96 percent of the global supply of processed anode-grade graphite, a key component of lithium ion batteries. The move sent shockwaves through the already fragile battery supply chain and all but guarantees higher costs for U.S. manufacturers. It’s only the latest in a string of irrational policies that make it harder, not easier, to bring manufacturing back home.

This summer, congressional Republicans passed the president’s massively unpopular budget bill, rolling back Joe Biden’s signature clean energy legislation, the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). While much of the attention on the bill’s energy components has focused on the damage to the wind and solar industries, the legislation will also upend the booming battery business, gutting one of the economy’s fastest-growing and strategically vital industries. While the Biden administration made substantial progress in building a domestic battery supply chain, Trump is kneecapping battery manufacturing in the U.S. by crushing demand and hiking up input costs.

The contradictions in Trump’s “America First” strategy are hard to miss: The White House pushes policies to streamline critical minerals production while dismantling the industries that need such minerals; it taxes essential imports without supporting adequate domestic replacements; and it proclaims its mission to bring back American manufacturing jobs while enacting policies that shut down factories.

America’s clean energy transition cannot be stopped, but it can be slowed. Trump and the Republicans have decided to do just that—even if it means fewer jobs, higher prices, and more energy dependence.

The industrial policies passed under Biden ushered in a resurgence in American manufacturing by employing carrots (tax credits) and sticks (tariffs and domestic content requirements). The IRA, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law (BIL), and the CHIPS Act jump-started a clean energy boom, using targeted public investment to catalyze trillions in private capital.

The Biden administration strategically designed an industrial policy for batteries. Tax credits “derisked” investment and improved the cost-competitiveness of domestic battery manufacturing, while Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) provisions penalized companies that continued to rely on imported battery components. Those restrictions were set to tighten gradually, giving American firms more time to build out a domestic supply chain.

It worked. According to the Clean Investment Monitor, Biden’s green industrial strategy tripled quarterly investment in clean manufacturing from 2022 to 2025. Since the IRA was passed, more than 380 clean tech factories have been announced, with 161 already operational. Of the $115 billion in manufacturing investment the IRA attracted, batteries led the way, accounting for 69 percent. In a short time, the Biden incentives made U.S. battery production cost-competitive with China—which dominates over three-quarters of the global battery supply chain—and put the nation on track to meet all of domestic battery demand with a Made in America battery manufacturing industry by 2030.

But then the Republican Party returned to power.

Trump’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed in July, guts the tax credits that help American manufacturing catch up to China, while his administration continues to impose tariffs in a blunderbuss manner. The main outcome of this so-called economic “strategy” will be higher inflation and persistent shortages of foreign goods and commodities. And the effects of Trump’s tariffs are only beginning to reach consumers.

Since Trump’s inauguration, more than $27 billion of investment in clean energy manufacturing has been canceled, bankrupted, delayed, or scaled back, taking nearly 19,000 jobs. More EV manufacturing facilities, including battery plants, were canceled in the first three months of 2025 than in all 2023 and 2024 combined.

The elimination of the EV tax credit and the EPA’s move to rescind Biden-era tailpipe emissions regulations deals a blow to EV adoption, but it will cripple America’s battery manufacturing. A report by Princeton’s ZERO Lab estimates that not only could these repeals result in the cancellation of an eyepopping 100 percent of planned battery facilities, but they also potentially threaten to shut down up to 72 percent of battery manufacturing plants. Withdraw market incentives, and the market dries up. EV sales could also fall 30 percent by 2027 and 40 percent by 2030. That translates to 8.3 million fewer EVs, and 8.3 million fewer batteries needed to power them.

The IRA didn’t just spur investment in battery manufacturing; it helped create over 133,000 decent blue-collar jobs in battery production in just two years. Within the first five months of Trump’s presidency, more than 6,000 of those jobs were wiped out.

With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, the nonpartisan energy policy think tank Energy Innovation projects that 31,000 battery jobs will evaporate by 2030. But the more profound tragedy is the number of American jobs—approaching 1 million—in manufacturing, supporting industries, and local economies that will now never materialize.

These aren’t workforce reductions for a dying industry. They are layoffs in the sectors of tomorrow—cuts to a technology that makes a more resilient, affordable energy system for America possible.

Trump and the GOP are doubling down on fossil fuels as the economics of renewables—even paired with the costs of battery storage—make that strategy irrational. Batteries absorb electricity during the day while prices are low and discharge it during peak demand hours, improving grid reliability and cutting energy costs for consumers.

Look at Texas, the country’s largest deregulated electricity market, where battery storage is booming to take advantage of dirt-cheap solar power. The growth of solar and batteries there has significantly reduced the risk of grid emergencies for which the Lone Star State had become infamous. Solar provides power during the hottest hours of the day, while batteries store the excess and release it as the sun sets. In California, where battery capacity has exploded 30-fold since 2018, record discharges of battery power during last year’s extreme heat meant that the state didn’t need to issue a single energy conservation alert.

Ironically, battery storage provides precisely the type of dispatchable energy that Trump administration officials claim they want. A recent report by the North American Electric Reliability Corporation, a nonprofit regulatory authority that sets and enforces grid reliability standards, found that battery expansion improved overall grid reliability even as the rapid uptake of data centers increases strain on the system.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has pulled support for long-duration battery storage projects and cut funding for scientific research into advanced battery technologies. As one former senior Department of Energy official told The Guardian, “If you stop any research for next generation solar or battery technology, or wind or geothermal or other pieces, what you’re effectively doing is compromising a huge range of technology that has the potential to reduce costs.”

For all its talk about American energy dominance and lower prices, raising energy costs is exactly what the Trump administration’s policies are accomplishing. Since January, thanks to Trump’s tariffs, short-term battery storage costs have risen 56 percent to 69 percent. Unsurprisingly, deployment of battery storage on the grid is expected to fall 30 percent over the next decade. The Trump administration likes to harp constantly about supporting “affordable, reliable, and secure energy”—they forget to add “as long as it suits my party’s ideological priors.”

This comes as Trump and the GOP rail against U.S. dependence on Chinese batteries and the need to reshore American manufacturing, after passing a bill that decimates the domestic battery industry.

While the final version of the GOP mega bill technically retains the advanced manufacturing tax credit for battery producers, new FEOC rules (read: China) impose unworkable domestic content requirements that make the credits inaccessible. Both complex and overly restrictive, the FEOC provisions will require regulatory guidance from the Treasury Department—a process that took two years under Biden. Until then, it’s unlikely that companies will invest without knowing whether they’ll qualify for the credits.

Meanwhile, the GOP is aggressively deregulating extractive industries. While boosting critical mineral production can support the buildout of a domestic supply chain, it makes little sense to simultaneously undercut the high-value-add industries like battery manufacturing that create the very demand for those minerals.

Yet Trump is doing just that. He has leaned on the Cold War–era Defense Production Act to boost investment in critical mineral production. The Department of the Interior is streamlining permitting processes for lithium mines. Trump strong-armed Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky into granting the U.S. sweeping economic privileges over Ukraine’s mineral resources. However, these resources are critical because they serve the transition to clean energy. Why produce more lithium if not to make more batteries?

Trump announced a 50 percent tariff in July on copper imports, citing the critical need for the conductive metal in everything from semiconductors to ships to batteries. But the U.S. imports 40 percent of its copper, and there’s no alternative path to achieve copper self-sufficiency in the near or long term. Whereas a new battery plant can come online within two years, a new mine can take over 20 years to open up production. In the U.S., the average development time to open a new copper mine takes up to 32 years. Investors can hardly expect American trade policy to remain stable for 30 days, let alone during the remaining three-plus years of Trump’s term in office. Ultimately, the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have been pursuing policies to expand domestic mining, refining, and processing of critical minerals—arguably worthy goals, but not if you’re simultaneously destroying the manufacturing of products derived from such resources. They are ceding the lead in clean tech to China so the U.S. can become a raw materials exporter like so many Third World nations trapped in the cycle of extraction without development.

Justin Wolfers, the University of Michigan economist, accurately sums up Trump’s “plan” to restore U.S. manufacturing: “Raise the price of inputs like steel, aluminum & copper; create shortages of rare earths; invite retaliatory tariffs; cut R&D; raise borrowing costs by blowing out the budget; and … cover it all in a thick cloud of uncertainty.”

The 50 percent tariff on imported steel has doubled the price of domestic steel, yet many companies still import because even inflated foreign steel is cheaper. The nascent American battery industry hasn’t had enough time to relocate its supply chain. China still dominates the global market for key battery components, which U.S. companies must depend on until suitable (and competitive) domestic alternatives emerge. Trump’s on-again, off-again tariff wars don’t guide investment—they paralyze it.

Trump returned to office partly under the dubious promise to “Make America Great Again” by reviving domestic manufacturing and restoring high-wage blue-collar jobs. Now he and the GOP aren’t just breaking that promise, they’re spitting in the face of the Americans who believed them.",https://washingtonmonthly.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Nov-25-Battery-Hassett.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:18.284647

Long Beach received notice from the Washington State Department of Commerce on Oct. 8 that its application to install solar panels at the city’s fire station at 701 Washington Ave. N, was selected to receive $316,185 in grant funding. The city is required to cover 5% in matching funds for the project; around $16,000.

The funding comes through the department’s Clean Energy Grants program, which prioritizes construction-ready projects aimed at increasing access to reliable and affordable energy, reducing greenhouse gas emissions and aligning with state energy strategies. More than $41 million was initially awarded to 49 projects across the state, the majority of which were solar-related.

The city’s application was not originally selected to receive funding, according to Long Beach Deputy City Administrator Ariel Smith, but was ultimately awarded after further funding became available through the grant program. The contract was formally signed in late October, allowing the city to start incurring costs.

The installation of solar panels at the fire station will reduce electricity costs and make the building more energy-efficient, said Smith and David Glasson, the city’s administrator. While noting that he’s still reading up on the final agreement with the PUD, Glasson said the intention is for the fire station to be “net metered” — meaning the city will receive billing credit for the power the solar panels generate, with any usage that the exceeds what the solar panels generate being billed on the “net.”

“We will generate a surplus during most days and have to use power at night or during inclement weather,” said Glasson, adding that the fire station’s electricity bill ranges from a low of about $250 during the summer months to a high of more than $1,000 in the colder months.

In all, Glasson estimates that the city has paid about $9,000 annually for power at the fire station over the past three years.

Long Beach was also looking at installing solar panels at its wastewater plant during the same funding cycle for Commerce’s clean energy grant program, Glasson said, “but the application wasn’t going to score well, so we decided the fire station was the better option.” With the grant program only requiring a local match of 5%, he added that the city would like to add solar panels at both the water and wastewater plants because of how much power they require to operate.",https://chinookobserver.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/07/Chinook-Observer.png,N,,2025-11-02 19:18:22.017803

Under its six-year ""Energy Symphonics"" strategy from 2025 to 2030 the company intends to deal with key energy challenges to achieve business sustainability.

Energy Symphonics refers to a synchronised approach to creating new and sustainable energy solutions to address the world's surging energy demand, while also looking after the planet, according to chief executive Sinon Vongkusolkit, who unveiled this strategy late last year.

""We are passionate about tackling the energy trilemma head-on,"" he said, referring to Banpu's ongoing efforts to balance energy security, equity and sustainability.

This strategy replaced the ""Greener and Smarter"" strategy implemented during the previous five years, paving the way for more serious efforts to combat climate change.

Banpu has pledged to achieve a net-zero target, meaning a balance between greenhouse gas emissions and absorption, by 2050, 15 years ahead of the government's goal of 2065.

PURSUING SUSTAINABILITY

The company continues to adjust its businesses to be less dependent on fossil fuels and focus more on new sources of energy.

Banpu wants to be part of global efforts to ensure energy needs are met and, through improved environmental protection, maintain the ability of future generations to meet theirs, said Mr Sinon.

Over the next two years, the company plans to seriously reduce or avoid greenhouse gas emissions from its businesses, said Jirameth Achcha, head of Banpu's corporate services and activities.

The company mines coal and produces natural gas, as well as operates power generation facilities using fossil fuels and renewable energy. Banpu also offers smart energy solutions, focusing on new energy technologies that support the transition towards clean energy.

""The company is trying to avoid injecting a large portion of money into businesses that emit a high level of greenhouse gases,"" said Mr Jirameth.

Banpu plans to reduce investments in coal businesses, with the aim of cutting the share of coal earnings to less than half of total revenue in a shift towards sustainable energy development, he said.

Revenue from the coal trade, which comprised 65% of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation last year, should be reduced to less than 50% by 2030, according to Mr Sinon.

The company operates coal businesses in Australia, China and Indonesia.

Banpu is making its coal mines more environmentally friendly by replacing oil-powered vehicles used at its mines with electric vehicles (EVs), said Mr Jirameth. The company is also less reliant on coal by using more biomass fuel at its power plants, he said.

A shift towards other natural resources supports Banpu's campaign to promote clean energy. For example, the company is pursuing a new opportunity related to nickel mining in Indonesia.

Nickel is a key component in batteries used to power EVs, helping to reduce tailpipe emissions from oil powered-vehicles. The element can also be recovered from old batteries for reuse.

PT Indo Tambangraya Megah Tbk, a subsidiary of Banpu, invested in the nickel mining business by acquiring in July this year a 9.62% stake in PT Adhi Kartiko Pratama Tbk (AKP), which is listed on the Indonesia Stock Exchange.

AKP operates a nickel mine in North Konawe in Southeast Sulawesi province.

This investment in nickel mining accounts for 20% of the company's five-year investment budget of US$3 billion, said Mr Sinon.

The spending plan is scheduled to be implemented from 2025 to 2030 under the Energy Symphonics strategy.

Some 60% of the budget is to support natural gas and power businesses, while the remaining 20% funds the company's renewable energy business.

ENERGY RELIABILITY

Banpu is addressing concerns over unsteady electricity supply from renewable energy sources by adopting battery energy storage systems (BESS).

This stationary form of battery serves as back-up power for users to ensure electricity from renewable power generation facilities is always available for use.

The sun and wind are intermittent sources of energy generation making them dependent on weather conditions and seasons. These renewable energies cannot produce electricity all the time, so a BESS can ensure a more reliable supply.

A BESS can be developed by using a battery farm, ensuring a stable supply of clean energy.

Banpu Power Plc, the power generation arm of Banpu, announced earlier it is preparing to venture into the BESS business in the US.

The company already pursued a similar opportunity in Japan, where it developed a battery farm.

Banpu Power proposed the second BESS project to the Electric Reliability Council of Texas, which oversees and manages the electrical grid in most of the southern US state, said Issara Niropas, chief executive of Banpu Power.

He stressed the need to catch the growing trend in utilising BESS as demand for renewable power is rapidly growing.

Electricity demand in the US is rising, driven by the development of data centres and greater use of artificial intelligence (AI) technology, according to the company.

In Japan, Banpu Next, Banpu's energy technology arm, operates a 58-megawatt-hour BESS farm in the city of Tono. The facility is designed to supply electricity to 5,800 houses.

The company plans to expand its BESS business to other Asia-Pacific nations, said Mr Issara.

GREATER AFFORDABILITY

To make energy prices more affordable, Banpu devised various approaches to control its expenses, diversify energy sources and adopt technologies to enhance productivity.

Despite the challenges of a volatile energy market, Banpu is confident its Energy Symphonics strategy will drive growth and create long-term value for shareholders, said Mr Sinon.

Regarding mining, the company plans to adopt AI and smart mining technology to reduce operating costs and enhance productivity, he said.

According to Banpu, the company does not depend on a single energy source to avoid price volatility.

The company's businesses use both traditional and cleaner forms of energy.

In the US, Banpu is focusing on gas production as an alternative to coal and because it allows the company to better manage costs from the source, said Mr Sinon.

The company is also expanding its renewable energy portfolio by investing in solar and wind power businesses to benefit from decreasing renewable energy costs.

The investments should help the company reduce the total cost of energy generation in the long term, he said.

Banpu also utilises high efficiency, low emissions (HELE) technology to reduce power generation costs.

The technology is applied to its Temple I combined-cycle power plant with electricity generation capacity of 768 megawatts.

HELE increases the facility's thermal efficiency through the use of both a gas turbine and steam turbine, allowing the plant to produce more electricity from the same fuel input, thus reducing fuel costs per megawatt-hour.",https://static.bangkokpost.com/media/content/dcx/2025/11/03/5835318_700.jpg,N,,2025-11-02 18:18:18.333466

The lobby group said the change could add as much as £300 to the annual charging bill for some people if the cost is passed on to the customer.
Business rates are taxes paid on most commercial properties in the UK to fund local services, but charging bays have not yet been added to lists of rateable properties.
That might mean that the first bill for the current financial year could be more than double the £100m.
The Conservative government in 2022 exempted charging equipment from business rates, but the parking bays themselves were not included.","The UK charging industry has said it could face a £100m bill as the government considers making public charger operators pay business rates for the first time, at a time when slower-than-expected electric car sales have put pressure on the sector.

ChargeUK, an industry body, said that its estimates suggest that operators will have to pay business rates on as many as 64,000 parking bays beside chargers which have not, up to now, been liable for the taxes. The lobby group said the change could add as much as £300 to the annual charging bill for some people if the cost is passed on to the customer.

The number of public chargers has soared during recent years to cater for more than 1m battery electric cars on British roads. There were 86,000 public chargers at the end of September, an 18% increase on the 73,000 at the end of 2024, according to data company Zap Map.

Business rates are taxes paid on most commercial properties in the UK to fund local services, but charging bays have not yet been added to lists of rateable properties. The Valuation Office Agency (VOA) has told the charging industry this will change next April – meaning charging companies will have to pay the taxes for the first time.

Ian Johnston, the chief executive of Osprey Charging, said that his business would consider closing some sites and slowing down investment because of the extra costs – particularly away from London, which has the highest number of electric cars.

“Large, high-power hubs in certain regions of the Midlands and north [of England] are more likely to be loss-making because we have built ahead of EV uptake,” he added.

ChargeUK said it believed that the VOA’s own assumptions of a £25m cost for the sector were too small, because it had underestimated how many bays would be rateable, and the average rents paid.

To make matters worse for the charger companies, the bill may be backdated as far as 1 April 2023 as the VOA works out the final details of its review. That might mean that the first bill for the current financial year could be more than double the £100m.

The Conservative government in 2022 exempted charging equipment from business rates, but the parking bays themselves were not included. The VOA said that individual bays in larger charging sites and standalone EV charging sites would probably be added to ratings lists, because the operator tends to have exclusive occupation of the spaces.

ChargeUK argued that the bays should also be exempted, given the government’s desire to promote the uptake of electric vehicles to meet its legal obligations to cut polluting carbon emissions. The Treasury would have to exempt the sector in the budget on 26 November.

Vicky Read, the ChargeUK chief executive, said: “The cost pressures the sector is bearing are tough, with business rates threatening to be the straw that breaks the camel’s back. We need government intervention to remove this unexpected burden, alongside action to address sky high standing charges [on electricity] and inequitable VAT.”

A VOA spokesperson said it would engage with the charging companies, and added: “We have a statutory duty to maintain non-domestic rating lists. If any property meets criteria in line with legislation and rating law, we must assess it and assign it a rateable value.”

The Treasury was approached for comment.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c5fb3040d17a8fb58e70942562025b76af0fb878/833_0_4167_3335/master/4167.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=0aad082998a2a8d81759a18967c65998",N,,2025-11-02 18:18:36.706668
