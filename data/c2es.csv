In the last two decades, coal mining in the U.S. has steadily declined due to innovations of renewable energy sources, and public opposition to coal due to the myriad of negative impacts coal production has on public health and the environment.
Earlier this year, the Trump administration delayed compliance of health protections for coal miners, and cut free black lung screenings for miners.
Coal power is now not only the dirtiest form of electricity, it is one of the most expensive, contributing to the rising cost of Americans’ energy bills.
“Donald Trump’s plan doesn’t just saddle us with higher bills, he wants to lease millions of acres of public lands to mining companies and further slash protections for our clean air and water.","Raleigh, N.C. - Today, the Trump administration announced its “Coal Day 2.0” agenda, which includes opening 13.1 million acres of federal land for coal mining leases and extending compliance deadlines and rolling back safeguards against air and water pollution. Since Trump took office, Duke has expressed interest in burning more coal, supported his coal-pollution agenda, and will be able to pollute North Carolina more as a result.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration delayed compliance of health protections for coal miners, and cut free black lung screenings for miners.

North Carolina Beyond Coal Organizer Olive Burress issued the following statement in response:

“Every North Carolina utility leader has an obligation to the people of this state to deliver affordable, clean, and reliable energy, not bow down to a dangerous political agenda at the expense of clean air and public land. Energy affordability for North Carolinians will not be achieved by propping up the declining coal industry at the expense of our wallets, health, or natural resources.”

Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender issued the following statement:

“The Trump administration’s reckless actions announced today will hurt the American people, all to prop up the aging and outdated coal industry. Coal power is now not only the dirtiest form of electricity, it is one of the most expensive, contributing to the rising cost of Americans’ energy bills.

“Donald Trump’s plan doesn’t just saddle us with higher bills, he wants to lease millions of acres of public lands to mining companies and further slash protections for our clean air and water. Rather than investing in clean, affordable energy to power our country, more coal will increase deadly air pollution, poison our water with harmful heavy metals, and drastically worsen the health of our loved ones.

“If this dangerous agenda continues to advance, years from now we will look around at failing health outcomes, skyrocketing bills, and a decaying environment, and there will be one man to blame: Donald Trump and his Republican enablers. But we will not stand by as this administration takes a wrecking ball to the progress we have made, and we will continue to defend our health, our environment, and our futures.”",https://www.sierraclub.org/sites/default/themes/custom/bootpt/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-29 15:03:47.070808

Of course, that degree of decline means that in the used market, complaints about EV affordability are being resolved.

Total EV sales in 2024 made up about 9% of the U.S. new-car market, according to Kelley Blue Book.
So why the probable convergence of prices for used gas and EV cars is certainly remarkable, it's a modest milestone for now.","Skepticism about electric cars has been eroding as more EVs have hit the streets, and nowhere is that more apparent than in the used-car market. According to Bloomberg, used EVs have posted a major sales surge through 2025:

Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in America are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles, on average, and are selling even faster, according to Cox Automotive.... What's more, sales of used EVs this year through June increased by 34% over the year-earlier period, while the market for new EVs only ticked up a tad.

Bloomberg goes on to note that while the end of a $7,500 federal incentive this month is expected to curtail already sluggish new EV sales in the U.S., the loss of a maximum $4,000 credit on used EVs isn't projected to have the same negative effect. That's because used EVs and used gas-powered vehicles are closing in on price parity. A used EV at $34,700, Bloomberg reported, is about even with a used gas-burner at $33,800. The EV isn't as old, nor is it likely to require as much maintenance going forward. What's not to like?

Fears about EV ownership — ranging from range anxiety to concerns about the potentially high cost of replacing batteries — have obviously been eased by the sheer number of vehicles that have hit the road, validating the technology. Real-world experience has enhanced the reputations of EVs, batteries are lasting longer than originally anticipated, and the prices have become right.

The appealing stickers on used EVs are of course not all a positive story. These vehicles are aggressively depreciating, establishing a buyer's market for those interested in taking the plunge. Bloomberg cites a Ford Mustang Mach-E GT buyer who picked up a 2024 model for $33,000. Original price? $55,000. Of course, that degree of decline means that in the used market, complaints about EV affordability are being resolved. In fact, it almost makes more sense to hold off on a new EV purchase because, as Bloomberg reports, a lot of vehicles that were first leased three years ago are now hitting the market.

There is no used EV market without a new EV market, so a natural question to ask in the face of this relatively optimistic news is, ""Will a collapse in sales and leasing of new EVs undermine growing used sales?"" That will be something to keep an eye on over the next year or two. One might expect a reduced supply of new EVs coming into the used-car market to bid up prices, reversing or stalling the trend that Bloomberg noticed, sending buyers back to gas vehicles even if they want to give EVs a shot.

One other factor to take into account is that although the situation for new and used EVs is better than it was a decade ago, they still occupy a niche. Total EV sales in 2024 made up about 9% of the U.S. new-car market, according to Kelley Blue Book. New cars remain overwhelmingly powered by petrol, as do used cars.

Barring a last-minute deal, government funding will expire on Wednesday, launching a shutdown and possible reductions in force across federal agencies. President Donald Trump plans to meet with the top four congressional leaders this afternoon to discuss a funding extension.

The White House Office of Management and Budget directed agencies last week to consider RIFs as part of their shutdown “lapse plans.” These RIFs would be in addition to standard furloughs and should target programs that do not have alternative sources of funding and are “not consistent with the president’s priorities,” the OMB memo states. In a statement last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed doubt that any such RIFs would be permanent. “These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today,” he said.

OMB earlier directed agencies to submit updated lapse plans by Aug. 1, but many do not appear to be available online yet. The National Science Foundation’s plan from 2023 would have furloughed nearly 80% of its employees, while NASA’s plan would have furloughed more than 90%.

If Congress passes a continuing resolution to avoid a shutdown, interim NASA Administrator Sean Duffy has directed the agency to “work toward” the spending levels in the House’s funding proposal for fiscal year 2026, according to Ars Technica. That proposal would cut NASA’s Science Mission Directorate by 18%, compared to the 50% cut in the president’s budget request and near-level funding in the Senate proposal. Meanwhile, a report released today by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) states that NASA has been implementing cuts from the president’s budget request since early summer, disregarding congressional intent concerning funding levels.

Scientific societies protest grantmaking executive order

More than 50 scientific and medical organizations urged Congress last week to block key elements of the grantmaking executive order President Donald Trump issued in August, arguing that it will increase politicization of federally funded research and add inefficiencies to the grantmaking process. “The EO does not advance the administration’s goal of implementing Gold Standard Science,” reads the letter sent by the societies. (Multiple AIP Member Societies signed the letter.)

The letter asks Congress to ensure that independent peer review “remains the cornerstone” of scientific grantmaking, “such that the most meritorious proposals are funded in this and all future administrations.” Trump’s order states that agencies may use peer review methods for grantmaking on an advisory basis but places ultimate decision authority in the hands of political appointees. The letter also asks Congress to reject the order’s requirement that science agencies permit “termination for convenience” in all grants, warning of a chilling effect for research that could be perceived as controversial. Finally, the letter calls on Congress to block the order’s directive for agencies to prioritize research proposals from academic institutions with the lowest indirect cost rates.

New batch of S&T nominees teed up for confirmation

The Senate is preparing to vote on a bloc of more than 100 nominees, which includes several science and technology positions:

Ned Mamula to be director of the U.S. Geological Survey;

Neil Jacobs to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration;

Taylor Jordan to be head of environmental observation and prediction programs at NOAA;

David Peters to be assistant secretary of commerce for export enforcement;

Audrey Robertson to lead DOE’s Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy;

Catherine Jereza to lead DOE’s Office of Electricity;

Timothy John Walsh to lead DOE’s Office of Environmental Management;

Jacob Helberg to be under secretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment; and

Thomas DiNanno to be under secretary of state for arms control and international security.

Senate Republicans confirmed the first bloc of nearly 50 nominees two weeks ago after modifying the chamber’s rules to allow confirmations in groups instead of one at a time. Democrats had been using the old rules to severely slow down votes on Trump’s nominees. Some of the nominees in the second bloc had advanced out of committee more than four months ago.

As a result, National Parks are experiencing some major problems such as deferred maintenance, overcrowding, worse environmental outcomes, and underfunding.
More accurate pricing for entrance fees can help address these issues and more.","September 27 was National Public Lands Day. To celebrate, the National Park Service (NPS) advertised free admission to national parks that normally charge an entrance fee. Most NPS sites offer free admission every day of the year.

A more appropriate term for the NPS to use would be “unpriced,” because while visitors didn’t have to pay an entrance fee on Saturday, the money required for NPS operations still came from somewhere. Theoretically, the money lost from entrance fees on National Public Lands Day was made up for through other sources, such as congressional appropriations.

But it’s not just on September 27 when most of the NPS’s funding comes from Congress. In FY25, their total request from all funding sources was $4.81 billion, of which $3.6 billion was discretionary. In 2024, the estimated revenue from recreation fees was only $355.5 million. Significant funding also comes from other sources like the Land and Water Conservation Fund and donations.

Some might say that this seems right; the people of the United States have decided (through their representatives) that we want to have national parks. So, it’s fair that all Americans pay for the NPS’s budget through tax dollars.

Yet some Americans will never visit a national park but still pay roughly $20 per year, on average, toward the NPS budget through taxes. Proponents argue that non-visitors should contribute to the NPS budget because they still receive some utility from just knowing that the national parks exist, but whatever utility that may be is trivial in comparison to that of a park visitor.

NPS has tried to address these problems by charging entrance fees and other types of user fees at some of the most popular sites. For example, the most expensive parks to enter, such as Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, charge an entrance fee of $35 per car per week, which is still an extremely cheap price.

In fact, policymakers should increase park entrance fees to more closely reflect the demand to visit. Current prices haven’t even kept up with inflation. As a result, National Parks are experiencing some major problems such as deferred maintenance, overcrowding, worse environmental outcomes, and underfunding. More accurate pricing for entrance fees can help address these issues and more.

National parks have often been called “America’s best idea.” If Americans truly feel this way, then park visitors should be expected to pay a reasonable user fee.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1370171185-1-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:02:57.791282

The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition formed to change that.
Meeting people where they are “The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition works because it blends trusted, high-quality tax preparation with the deep community connections of our outreach partners,” said Matt Hetherwick of Accounting Aid Society.
“Congress of Communities participates in the tax coalition because the residents we serve need access to affordable tax preparation and clear information about all the benefits available to them,” said Amanda Holiday.
By centering trust, access, and community leadership, the Detroit Tax Credit Coalition is helping families file for the future—and keep more of what they’ve earned.","When tax season arrives in Detroit, the stakes are high. More than 40% of the city’s children live in poverty, and the tax code is one of the surest, fastest tools for putting money into family budgets. Refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC) can return thousands of dollars to eligible households—often enough to pay down debt, purchase a reliable vehicle, or take a first step toward homeownership. Yet every year, Detroit families leave an estimated $80 million in tax credits unclaimed—too often because filing feels confusing, costly, or out of reach.

The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition formed to change that. Launched in 2021 with support from a group of funders led by The Kresge Foundation, the coalition’s mission is straightforward: make it easy, trustworthy, and free for low- and moderate-income Detroiters to file taxes and receive every credit they’ve earned.

A coalition built on trust—and results

The Coalition builds on a 2017 effort spearheaded by Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan’s office. Today, United Way for Southeastern Michigan facilitates the steering committee alongside the City of Detroit and two tax preparation leaders—Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency—while a network of community organizations carries the message deep into neighborhoods.

“The key to increasing the number of Detroiters who file taxes and claim their credits comes down to three things: awareness, trust, and access,” said Megan Thibos of United Way. “Our central website, GetTheTaxFacts.org, offers clear information and a unified scheduling tool, and our VITA partners operate dozens of convenient sites so help is close to home.”

An evaluation by the University of Michigan estimated that in 2021–2022, the coalition helped Detroit families claim more than $6.5 million in Child Tax Credits that otherwise would have been missed—evidence that coordinated outreach and high-quality preparation can move real dollars into household budgets.

Meeting people where they are

“The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition works because it blends trusted, high-quality tax preparation with the deep community connections of our outreach partners,” said Matt Hetherwick of Accounting Aid Society. “We meet people where they are—geographically and in terms of trust—so no one is left behind because they didn’t know help was available or feared they couldn’t afford it.”

Wayne Metro’s Ricky Palitti underscored the impact: “Partnership makes it possible to reach as many people as we do. The result is real impact, saving families hundreds of dollars each in filing fees and putting more money back into household budgets where it’s needed most.”

For neighborhood partners, participation is about aligning with community priorities. “Congress of Communities participates in the tax coalition because the residents we serve need access to affordable tax preparation and clear information about all the benefits available to them,” said Amanda Holiday.

In HOPE Village, Executive Director Jeffrey Jones said tax help is core to the mission: “This work is a vital resource to our community. We exist to mitigate disparities in wealth, health, and education—and the coalition’s approach advances that priority.”

Breaking down barriers to benefits

Access is often blocked by multiple, overlapping hurdles. “Families may not know what they can claim, they may mistrust financial systems, or they may face practical challenges like transportation, language, or technology,” said Hetherwick. “We address this by offering free, trusted services in community settings; training outreach partners to share accurate, culturally relevant information; and providing in-person, drop-off, and virtual options. We invest in long-term relationships so residents know there’s reliable help year after year.”

Wayne Metro complements tax services with wrap-around support. “Our agency helps clients tackle other life needs that can stand between them and the credits they’ve earned,” said Program Manager Tameka Gray.

United Way targets common misconceptions. “Some families mistakenly believe they aren’t eligible,” Thibos said. “For example, grandparents raising grandchildren may qualify even when the children are not biological. We’ve added a trilingual flyer in English, Spanish, and Arabic, made our website and scheduling tool available in Spanish, provide 1:1 navigation for issues like IDs, and are exploring transportation support next year.”

Reaching the hardest to reach

The coalition’s outreach strategy is layered and persistent. “Mass outreach through text messaging and targeted digital ads casts a wide net and makes it easy to click straight through to schedule,” said Thibos. “Community-based outreach kick-starts word-of-mouth networks. And for those who are hesitant or face barriers, our team offers personalized navigation.”

Congress of Communities focuses on multiple touchpoints. “Research shows people need to see information several times before acting,” Holiday said. “We set up at community events, send texts and emails to members, and use social media—often handing out free books to encourage conversations and promote literacy at the same time.”

For HOPE Village, accessibility and presence are the rule. “Be accessible and show up in a variety of places,” said Jones. “That’s how trust is built.”

Virtual access and language capacity round out the approach. “Virtual appointments have been a game-changer, and our bilingual team members help ensure those whose first language isn’t English receive the assistance they need,” said Palitti.

Policy progress—and what’s next

The coalition pairs on-the-ground services with policy advocacy. Recent progress includes the 2023 expansion of the Michigan EITC, which quintuples the state credit and puts millions more dollars into family budgets. Even amid a volatile policy environment—with recent federal changes increasing the Child Tax Credit by $200 per child alongside cuts to SNAP and Medicaid—partners remain focused on expanding eligibility and benefit amounts for both the EITC and CTC over time.

Implementation work continues year-round: strengthening existing outreach partnerships, building new ones, expanding tax prep capacity, and learning from data to improve resident experience. The invitation is open. If your organization would like to collaborate, email taxes@unitedwaysem.org. To learn more or schedule a free appointment, visit GetTheTaxFacts.org.

Why it matters

When families file, children thrive. A maximum EITC can exceed $10,000 (state and federal combined), with an additional $1,700–$2,200 per child from the CTC—dollars that stabilize households and unlock opportunity. By centering trust, access, and community leadership, the Detroit Tax Credit Coalition is helping families file for the future—and keep more of what they’ve earned.

The federal EV tax credit was implemented in 2022 under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and since then sales of EVs have been steadily increasing.
Data from Argonne National Laboratory tracking EV sales found that EV sales in the U.S. for August 2025 were up 14.7 percent over the same time period in 2024.
Used EV sales were up nearly 60 percent in August 2025 over the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive shows.
Karl Brauer, the executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press that EV sales are ""going to crater"" once the incentive wraps.","Car buyers are rushing out to buy electric vehicles as the clock ticks down on a tax credit program allowing them to save thousands on new and used cars.

The federal EV (electric vehicle) tax credit is ending on September 30. The program, which allows EV buyers to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a new vehicle and up to $4,000 on a used vehicle, was originally slated to last until 2032, but President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" is bringing it to a close years earlier.

According to an analysis from the Detroit Free Press using data collected from Cars.com, approximately half of buyers considering an EV purchase are accelerating their purchases to try to get them in before the deadline.

The website told the outlet that demand for new EVs on its site are up by 33 percent when compared to a year ago, and up 22 percent for used EVs over the same time period.

In August, Cars.com conducted a survey asking its customers what was motivating them to buy EVs, and nearly 75 percent of the 950 respondents said that the federal tax credit was a ""major or contributing factor"" to their decision.

The federal EV tax credit was implemented in 2022 under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and since then sales of EVs have been steadily increasing.

Data from Argonne National Laboratory tracking EV sales found that EV sales in the U.S. for August 2025 were up 14.7 percent over the same time period in 2024. In 2024, EV sales were up 7 percent over the number of vehicles sold in 2023.

The laboratory found that, cumulatively, more than 7.3 million plug-in EVs have been sold in the U.S. since 2010.

Used EV sales were up nearly 60 percent in August 2025 over the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive shows.

""As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,"" Cox said in its report.

Some experts predict that interest in EVs will come to a halt once the tax incentive ends on the 30th.

Karl Brauer, the executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press that EV sales are ""going to crater"" once the incentive wraps.

He predicted that there will be ""almost no buyers"" after the 30th because EVs are typically priced higher than gasoline vehicles.

Tim Horvick, the owner of San Tan Ford dealership in Phoenix, told CBS News that the end of the credit is a concern for him, and admitted ""it could be challenging"" to move EVs once the incentive expires.

Cars.com's Detroit bureau chief had a different take, telling the Detroit Free Press that even after the deadline, buyers will still be able to take advantage of incentives offered by state and local governments. He added that car manufacturers like Nissan, Chevrolet, and Hyundai are already planning to roll our new, lower-priced EV models.

In fact, lower prices for EVs, at least in the immediate aftermath of the tax credit expiration, may be on the way. Assuming there is a significant drop-off in EV sales beginning in October, car manufacturers who produce EVs will have to consider how to price their supply of the vehicles amid a sharp decline in demand.

In 2019, and an EV tax credit for Tesla and General Motors ended, both car companies responded to the decrease in demand by cutting prices, according to CNN.

If prices are cut, it won't likely stay that way longterm. Manufacturers are likely going to cut back on the production of EV models to ease the supply pressure to lower their prices.

While some analysts are more pessimistic than others about the fate of EVs, a survey by Cox found that, for more than half of prospective EV buyers, saving money with a tax credit isn't their main interest in purchasing an EV.

According to Cox, 65 percent of those prospective buyers said they planned to buy regardless of the tax credit, and only 20 percent said they would instead choose to buy a gas or hybrid vehicle.

The same survey found the respondents still hoping to buy an EV were more concerned with the fuel and maintenance savings, vehicle performance, and with environmental concerns than their potential savings via a tax credit.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/07/24/11/54/GettyImages-1392610598.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-09-29 15:03:36.024951

If you’ve been to a dealership the past couple of months, you may have noticed more drivers expressing interest in electric vehicles (EVs). One reason is that the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill means that the federal EV tax credit will expire at the end of September.

For those looking to buy an EV, there are several things to consider regarding eligibility and finances.

An Increase in Sales

“EV inventory is selling fast,” said Justin Fischer, automotive expert at CarEdge. “As buyers rush to take advantage of federal incentives before they expire, EVs are selling faster than gas-powered models for the first time ever.”

According to Fischer, CarEdge Insights shows a 62-day supply of new EVs in September and a 37-day supply of used EVs. Per Fischer, once incentives expire on Sept. 30, don’t expect big manufacturer incentives until December’s year-end sales.

Buyers: What To Know Now

Here are three things every buyer should know now with the credit ending.

The federal tax credit for new and used EVs ends after Sept. 30. As noted by Kiplinger, you must purchase before the deadline to claim up to $7,500 for a new EV or $4,000 for a used vehicle.

Eligibility rules still apply. In fact, Fischer said many EVs don’t qualify, and recommended buyers check the government’s fuel economy website to learn more. This may be especially helpful given that there’s been a great deal of confusion over the federal tax credits, who qualifies and how exactly they work.

Do your homework. If you’re ready to buy an EV, make sure you know what you qualify for and whether your finances are in good enough shape to afford a vehicle. Keep in mind that some state and local incentives might remain in effect even with the federal credits ending.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-of-electric-vehicles-at-charging-stations_iStock-1393199281.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:20.446507

From the cliffs of Sloan Canyon to the Ruby mountains, our public lands are more than scenery.
But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us.
Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.
The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.","On Saturday, folks across the country celebrated Public Lands Day. Each year, Public Lands Day is a chance to celebrate the open spaces that make Nevada extraordinary. From the cliffs of Sloan Canyon to the Ruby mountains, our public lands are more than scenery. They provide clean water and wildlife habitat, preserve Indigenous cultural sites and Indigenous homelands, drive Nevada’s outdoor recreation economy, and offer places for families to hike, camp, hunt, and recharge.

But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us. They’re moving through Congress right now, and if passed, they could forever reshape our landscapes.

Two pieces of legislation in particular deserve Nevadans’ attention: the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act (SNEDCA), which was scheduled to be heard in Congress on October 1 but has since been postponed, and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which is advancing rapidly on Capitol Hill, having just passed out of House Natural Resources on September 17. Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.

SNEDCA is being promoted as a balanced bill that conserves lands while allowing for development. Supporters point to provisions that designate certain areas as protected. But Nevadans should look closely. At its core, this bill is a sweeping public lands sell-off.

SNEDCA would open tens of thousands of acres in Clark County for disposal, turning our desert into a land bank for real estate developers. SNEDCA doubles down on a sprawl approach to development at a time when we desperately need smarter planning, water conservation, and genuine climate resilience. We know that sprawl raises costs for working class folks, both directly and indirectly, and detracts from mass transportation services. This bill fails to guarantee any of the land proposed for disposal would actually be used for affordable housing.

The consequences are not abstract. Development on this scale fragments wildlife habitat, threatens desert tortoise populations, and paves over landscapes that recharge groundwater and absorb carbon. Once developed, these lands cannot be restored. We lose them forever.

This is exactly the type of land sell-off Nevadans pushed back against during the federal reconciliation process, when proposals to liquidate Nevada’s deserts raised alarm bells statewide, and indeed, across the country.

At the same time, another bill moving through Congress threatens Nevada’s lands in a different way. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.

Under current law, mining companies must demonstrate a valid mineral discovery before they can use federal land for waste dumps or processing. This safeguard ensures that sensitive lands are not simply commandeered for industrial use without scrutiny. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would gut that requirement, allowing companies to dump toxic mine waste on public lands without ever proving that valuable minerals exist.

For Nevada, home to more mining activity than any other state, the impact would be staggering. The result would be more toxic pollution on public land, more scarred landscapes, and less accountability for corporations.

Taken together, SNEDCA and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act represent a one-two punch: one bill sells off Nevada’s lands to developers, while the other makes it easier for mining companies to pollute what’s left. Both bills prioritize corporate profits over community well-being, over Tribal sovereignty, and over the conservation values Nevadans have fought to uphold for decades.

We know what happens when we fail to protect public lands. Red Rock Canyon, Avi Kwa Ame, and Gold Butte did not gain protections by accident. They were defended through years of community organizing, advocacy, and public outcry. Tribes, conservationists, recreationists, and everyday residents came together to demand that these landscapes be safeguarded for future generations. If Congress approves SNEDCA or the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, we risk unraveling decades of progress in a matter of months.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Nevada can pursue genuine conservation and responsible economic development without selling out our public lands. We should be expanding access to parks and trails, supporting Tribal stewardship of ancestral lands, and protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change. We should not be doubling down on extractive and short-sighted policies.

The choice before us is clear. We can allow corporations and their lobbyists to dictate the future of Nevada’s open spaces, or we can stand up for the values that make our state unique.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-scaled-e1759166037351-2048x1225.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:04.102934

Residential electricity prices rose by 25% during his term in office. States across the country are looking at ways to stop or reduce the increases. But it may be too little too late, as reliable coal plants are being shut down and replaced by costly new systems that magnify the demand growth issues.

PJM Auction Prices Hit Record Highs

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator of 13 states, had its capacity auction clear at record-setting prices as electricity demand is rapidly increasing while supply growth is limited. Growing supply is made more difficult by significant delays in connecting new generation projects to the PJM grid and the retirement of coal power plants. PJM has warned states against prematurely retiring power plants and replacing them with solar and wind units. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation has also stressed in its 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment that solar and battery additions have made the resource mix less flexible and more variable.

The 13 states in the PJM Interconnection recently met to discuss the situation, as states are seeing electricity prices increase. For example, this year, energy prices increased across Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with PPL Electric getting a 16% rate increase and JCP&L getting a 19.6% increase. According to 69WFMZ, in Pennsylvania, regulated utilities like PPL Electric are prohibited from owning electric generation. Its electricity is purchased through a series of competitive auctions through PJM.

Electricity Price Increases Enter into the New Jersey Governor’s Race

Beginning in June, New Jersey residents were to receive a 20% increase in electricity prices, resulting mainly from the state’s most recent capacity auction. According to Consumer Energy Solutions, every year in February, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) holds an energy auction that sets the wholesale electricity price that NJ customers pay if they have not chosen a third-party energy supplier. The auction is held yearly to help lessen price volatility. The auction prices apply to about one-third of the state’s supply each year, as they are combined with prices from the previous two years’ auctions. Similar to PJM’s capacity auction, the NJ auction received record-high prices as the state closed its last two coal-fired plants in 2022 and divested its fossil-fuel generating stations in 2023.

NJ state policies, however, have exacerbated the supply problem. Governor Phil Murphy set a goal to make New Jersey’s electricity production fossil-free by 2035 and instituted other decarbonization policies, such as phasing out fossil-fuel plants. New Jersey is also a net importer of electricity from other PJM states, as it does not produce enough electricity in-state to meet demand, forcing it to buy expensive power from the regional grid. According to Gabriella Hoffman in RealClear Energy, it is estimated that NJ Governor Murphy’s green transition plan to wind, solar, battery power, and electric vehicles, if fully implemented, would result in $1.4 trillion in lost income, or $140,000 per average New Jerseyan over the next 25 years. Some family energy bills in New Jersey have exceeded $500 per month.

Via CFACT, while Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican challenger for NJ Governor, wants to overturn Murphy’s green energy mandate, ban expensive offshore wind, diversify the state’s energy sources to include nuclear and coal, and withdraw New Jersey from a multistate carbon tax plan known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Democratic candidate, Mikie Sherrill wants to continue with the failed policies of Governor Murphy to the detriment of affordable energy. And, to gain an edge, she is twisting the words of Mr. Ciattarelli regarding tax increases.

Via Hoffman, the 20% rate hike that was supposed to take effect in June was delayed until September 30, after the height of the air conditioning season. On August 14, the BPU also announced a $100 Residential Universal Bill Credit to help lower bills in September and October, essentially disguising the cost of the new utility bills until after the NJ Governor’s election in November.

Nevada Public Utility Commission Approves New Charges

Some Nevada residents are expecting higher utility costs due to the state’s Public Utility Commission’s approval of a demand charge and net metering changes for NV Energy, a major Nevada utility serving over 1.4 million customers. In April 2026, NV Energy will add a monthly demand charge of $20 based on an average customer’s bill and will make changes to its net metering policy, affecting rooftop solar systems. The plan is to calculate credits for energy returned to the grid from rooftop solar systems every 15 minutes of peak usage each day, rather than monthly.

According to regulators, most residential and small business customers of NV Energy will see lower bills, adding to their already comparatively low rates. Through June, Nevada’s average retail price for residential customers was about 60% lower than California’s price and 22% lower than the U.S. average price. Last year, Nevada generated 53% of its electricity from natural gas, its smallest share in 19 years, with solar contributing 31%. Nevada imports natural gas from neighboring states like Utah.

In 2019, Nevada lawmakers set a 100% zero-carbon emission energy mandate by 2050 under former Democratic Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak. To achieve zero-emission energy by 2050, Nevada has phased out its coal plants. That means rate payers are paying for the coal plant retirements and their replacements, requiring the build out of a whole new system. Pushing for an accelerated green energy transition while phasing out reliable energy sources like coal is linked to rising utility costs and reliability issues.

According to Utility Dive, renewable advocates are against the change for net metering, saying that it would erect further barriers to renewables adoption because it would reduce annual solar customer compensation by $136. Depending on how the compensation is calculated, non-solar rooftop customers could be subsidizing rooftop customers, particularly if they are compensated at retail rates where they do not pay for the use of power lines.

Depending on usage, Advanced Energy United indicates that the demand charge could be higher than NV Energy indicates. It calculates that the new demand charge could add $27 per month to the bill of a customer using five kilowatt hours and $38 per month to customers using six kilowatt hours. NV Energy claims the new charge will not make a major difference to the new bills of an average NV Energy customer because the utility is moving some parts of the volumetric rate into the daily demand charge. Via KTNV Las Vegas, the purpose of the demand charge is to incentivize customers to decrease their overall energy usage by spreading out their energy usage and avoiding simultaneous operation of numerous appliances, which would result in less strain on the power grid during times of peak demand.

California Passes Bills to Supposedly Lower Energy Costs

According to The Hill, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several climate and clean energy bills supposedly to “lower electricity costs, stabilize the petroleum market and slash air pollution.” The measures include legislation to increase climate credits on utility bills, expand regional power markets out West, and add $18 billion to the California Wildfire Fund. The cap-and-trade program, renamed “cap-and-invest,” was also extended through 2045.

Analysis

Energy consumers in states across the country are facing higher bills as the grid becomes strained by additional demand, particularly from artificial intelligence data centers and electrification. Unfortunately for consumers, utilities are ill-equipped to deal with these challenges because of prohibitive permitting policies and state renewable portfolio standards that incentivize intermittent wind and solar generation over natural gas and coal. To prevent consumers from being burdened with rising costs, states need to adopt “best of the above” approaches to energy policy that let the market dictate which sources are optimal to meet rising demand.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bigstock-A-Woman-Inspects-A-Dollar-Mone-445270193.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:02:47.179918

It’s connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.
The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action.
Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years.
Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.","So you’re booking your flight, and just when you’re about to check out, the airline asks if you’d like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight’s pollution. Or, maybe you’re an environmentally minded person, and you’ve heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.

Are they worth it? Let’s explore.

Why planes are so pollutive

A roundtrip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That’s about the amount of pollution you’d save if you swore off meat for 17 months.

Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space — additional warming that isn’t typically included in a flight’s emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.

Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel — biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel — is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacking sufficient supply to be in wide use.

“Aviation is the problem child,” Vitry said. “Aviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.”

That’s where carbon offsets come in.

What is a carbon offset?

A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It’s connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.

The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the pollutive action (driving) is offset (tree planting).

They’ve gotten popular enough that there’s an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.

Do the offsets work?

Vitry doesn’t think so. She calls them a fake climate solution.

“Unfortunately, it is not what is going to solve aviation’s climate problem,” she said. “You can’t clear your climate conscience with an offset.”

Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn’t stop your flight’s emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can’t possible absorb all the emissions it’s supposed to.

Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years. She said some offset schemes are overcounted by 10 to 13 times their actual value.

“There’s so much over-crediting on the offset market, so many credits that either don’t represent any emissions reductions at all or represent just a small fraction of what they claim,” Haya said.

She said that’s partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it’s really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets. “The buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,” Haya said.

Jodi Manning, chief executive of the carbon offset nonprofit Cool Effect, said consumers should beware of offset programs that don’t say clearly which project will benefit from your purchase or how much of your money is going to a project. But she said “high-quality” carbon credits can play an important role where emissions are unavoidable.

Manning said offsets have to be permanent, transparent, and unable to exist without the offset funding.

“When carbon is done correctly, it can provide a credible, immediate way to account for the emissions that travelers cannot otherwise reduce. We all create emissions at some point and it is certainly better to take action to compensate for it than to do nothing,” she said.

Several airlines that offer offsets did not respond to requests from AP to talk about their use. One that did, Southwest Airlines, said in a statement that it does not plan to rely on carbon offsets to help it reach a goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

What are you some other options for offsetting your air travel?

Fly less, take the train if you can, and pack light, Manning said.

If you have to fly, think about cutting your emissions in other ways, Haya said.

Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.

“We have an ethical obligation not to fly unless we really have to,” she said.

The school system was awarded $7.1 million earlier this year through the federal Clean School Bus Program to replace 25 of its diesel buses with zero-emission, battery-operated buses. The district, which applied for the money last year, must contribute around $3.4 million of its own funds under a grant stipulation that requires districts to foot 30% of related costs, board members said.

The board’s facilities subcommittee voted 2-1 last week to pay for the buses with the combined federal and local funding, with members Clay Moise and Ralph Brandt voting in favor and member Michael Pedalino opposed. The full board will vote on the plan Wednesday.

In their application for a grant through the Environmental Protection Agency’s $5 billion electric bus program, which launched under the Biden administration, Jefferson Parish officials said the switch will likely save the district around $2.3 million annually in fuel and maintenance costs. The district was awarded the funds in January, and the school board voted in April to accept them.

The Trump administration earlier this year paused funding for several environmental programs, including the clean bus program, causing delays for school districts that planned to purchase new buses. Federal courts have blocked the freeze, but the Trump administration challenged the rulings, making the future of many such programs uncertain.

Changing out diesel buses for electric ones is a growing national trend for school districts, many of which are making the change out of environmental concerns or with the hope of saving money on fuel and maintenance costs.

High up-front costs associated with purchasing an electric vehicle, which can often be twice as much as a typical diesel bus, have also remained a barrier for most districts. Pedalino said that even with help from the EPA’s grant program, he worries about the potential burden on local taxpayers.

“If the grant covered 100% of everything, I’m sure it would probably have an easier road to pass because we wouldn’t be taking resources out of our general funds to pay for it,” he said.

Moise disagreed, saying that the money to cover the buses will come out of an existing district fund for bus maintenance costs.

“Taking advantage of this program is in the best interest of our students,” he said, adding the projected savings mean Jefferson Parish will “have money left over to push into the classroom.”

If the board approves the grant, the district is expected to purchase the vehicles over a period of two years at a cost of around $370,000 each, board documents show. The grant will also pay for 25 charging stations.

In its grant application, the district said that converting to electric school buses will “profoundly impact the community of Jefferson parish,” which has been heavily impacted by pollution attributed to offshore oil extraction. The summary also says that replacing the district’s diesel buses with electric ones is projected to reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions by 383 tons annually or by 6,130 tons over 15 years.

If funded, the project “can serve as a blueprint for successful zero-emission journeys for other fleets,” it adds.

The number of electric school buses in the U.S. has grown rapidly, with Louisiana helping to lead the way. Several school districts, including East Baton Rouge, Livingston and Rapides, have received EPA grants to purchase the vehicles.

More than 12,000 electric buses were being used by school districts nationwide as of June 2024 – up from nearly zero in 2017, according to data from Climate Central, a nonprofit that seeks to find solutions to climate change. Around 300 of those buses were reported to be in use in Louisiana, more than in most other states, though fewer than South Carolina and Florida.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/a4/da4c9c0e-9a91-4459-86b2-cdee90931417/659dde0f6cc3a.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:28.719283

A consortium of public and private partners announced a plan last week to explore expanding nuclear power production and energy storage in Kansas.

Midwest utility provider Evergy, Washington-based TerraPower, and officials at the Kansas Department of Commerce are partnering on a proposed project to locate a nuclear reactor and energy storage system somewhere in Evergy's Kansas service territory.

TerraPower, a nuclear power company founded by Bill Gates, is proposing a Natrium power plant in Evergy’s Kansas territory.

“Our Natrium technology features a next-generation reactor with enhanced safety and efficiency, paired with utility-scale storage to ensure grid resilience,” TerraPower President/CEO Chris Levesque said in a Sept. 23 press release. “The TerraPower team is excited to advance conversations with Evergy, state leaders, and local communities on the opportunities that the Natrium reactor and energy storage system brings to Kansas.”

TerraPower described its Natrium technology as a 345-megawatt electrical (MWe) sodium-cooled fast reactor paired with a molten salt-based energy storage system.

TerraPower said the agreement will allow the company to evaluate site-specific characteristics for the potential power plant, while exploring the plant’s technical design and ability to support Evergy’s customers.

""Nuclear energy has been part of Evergy's generation mix for decades, and this next step will allow us to explore the opportunity to add reliable, non-carbon emitting advanced nuclear energy in the state of Kansas,"" Evergy Chairman and CEO David Campbell said in a press release announcing the memorandum of understanding. ""This agreement supports our all-of-the-above energy strategy and will allow us to evaluate the cost, technology, and feasibility of potentially deploying Natrium advanced nuclear plants.""

Evergy operates the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generation Station in Burlington, Kansas, about 95 miles south of the Kansas City metro area. The plant, which opened in 1985, generates 1,200 megawatts of electricity and is currently the only nuclear reactor in Kansas.

""My administration has always supported an 'all-of-the-above' approach when meeting the energy needs of Kansas citizens and businesses,"" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly. ""We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state, and I'm pleased we're using innovative methods to do just that.""

According to TerraPower, site selection will be based on many factors, such as community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the site's ability to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure.

Kansas' U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, both Republicans, are included in the project's supporters, citing the project's ability to potentially reduce electric costs to consumers.

""Expanding the use of nuclear energy strengthens U.S. energy independence while bringing down electricity costs for Kansas rate payers,"" Moran said in the release.

Marshall described nuclear as ""the way of the future.""

""Nuclear produces reliable, clean power — and a lot of it,"" Marshall said. ""I'm excited about the prospect of welcoming TerraPower's Natrium reactor to Kansas and look forward to helping bring this project to fruition so that Kansans can have safe, reliable, and affordable energy.""

Capital News Service

New federal policy is aimed at addressing the nation’s wildfire crisis by boosting timber production, but some experts say it’s not expected to have a major impact in Michigan.

There are more than 2.5 million acres of national forest in the Northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula, but most forestland in Michigan is owned by the state, local governments and private entities and individuals.

The policy change is reflected in federal actions such as President Donald Trump’s “Empowering Commonsense Wildfire Prevention and Response” executive order and provisions about the sale of timber and long-term contracts by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

For example, Trump’s “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production” executive order was promoted as a way to prevent wildfires by reducing fuel loads in high-risk areas.

In part, it requires federal agencies to update guidance to speed up timber delivery and delay or suspend regulations to expedite permitting and reduce environmental reviews.

In addition, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins issued a memorandum stating that her department’s future efforts will promote the production of timber, remove hazardous fuels and remove trees damaged by natural disasters.

Supporters of the policy change say it also will provide a major boost for the U.S. timber industry, as well as preventing wildfires.

However, some experts, including Shivan Gc, an assistant professor in the Michigan State University Department of Forestry, criticize the new policy as more focused on the economy than on the environment. She researches forest economics and environmental policy.

Gc said the policy change may increase timber production in the short term but that she doesn’t expect a big impact on the economy, especially in Michigan, since it primarily applies to federal land.

That includes areas managed by the U.S. Forest Service (under the Department of Agriculture) and the Bureau of Land Management (under the Department of the Interior), and does not apply to state or private forests.

David Prince, the forest planning and operations manager at the state Department of Natural Resources, also said the law will apply only to federal forests and will not affect state and privately owned forests.

Prince said there are three federal forests in Michigan: the Huron-Manistee National Forest in the Northern Lower Peninsula, the Hiawatha National Forest in the eastern and central UP and the Ottawa National Forest in the western UP.

Michigan has almost 4 million acres of state forest.

According to Gc, federal forests make up about 31% of the nation’s total forestland. The non-federal forests are owned mostly by private individuals and companies, with roughly 11% managed by state and local governments.

“These (federal forests) are not distributed evenly across the country,” said Gc. “So, if you think about the Rocky Mountain region or Pacific coast, a large percentage of those forests are federally owned, versus Michigan, where 62% of the forests are privately owned.”

Thus, the new policy’s on-the-ground impact in a state like Michigan may be limited, experts say.

The question of the policy’s economic scope will lead directly to specific government actions on federal forestlands.

Gc said, “So these kinds of treatments probably may be like active forest management kind of strategies, which are going ahead and identifying areas that need to be thinned and then removing excess dead trees or downed woody material from the forest floor.

“Those create hazardous fuel buildup, so removing those should have some positive effects on forest health.

“But that also depends upon how much will be removed. And if you hit that sustainability balance, then it could have negative effects on wildlife or sensitive species,” said Gc.

While the new federal policy prioritizes timber production and fire suppression, a more scientific and balanced strategy, according to Gc, would focus on a different set of priorities.

“If you focus more on the environmental aspect of it, then you’d probably frame it a little bit differently,” she said, “Not just opening up forests for timber production or increasing timber harvest, but maybe focusing more on science, like fire management science or ecological aspects of it.”

It also would take into consideration and incorporate the public’s view and not reduce public comment, she said.",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FORESTS-PHOTO.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 13:02:52.969019

If an investor could pick one, which stock is the frontrunner in clean energy? To get that answer, let’s delve deeper into the fundamentals of these companies.

Financial Strength & Growth Catalysts: GEV vs SMNEY

GE Vernova’s cash and cash equivalents as of June 30, 2025, totaled $7.89 billion, while both the current and long-term debt values were nil. A comparative analysis of these figures reflects that GE Vernova boasts a strong solvency position, which should enable it to fulfill its commitment to invest $9 billion in cumulative research and development (R&D) and capital expenditures through 2028.

As part of this plan, the company has plans to invest $600 million in its U.S. factories and facilities over the next two years (as mentioned in a January 2025 press release). GEV also plans to invest a total of nearly $20 million to expand capacity at its Grid Solutions facilities in Charleroi, PA, which will support the smooth integration of renewable electricity across the United States.

On the other hand, SMNEY ended June 2025 with cash and cash equivalents worth $9.64 billion. On the other hand, its current debt totaled $1.72 million, while its long-term debt amounted to $2.48 billion. A comparative analysis of these figures reveals that Siemens Energy maintains a strong solvency position, which, in turn, should enable the company to execute its manufacturing facility expansion plans effectively and meet the growing electricity demand. These plans include the company’s goal, as of September 2025, to invest approximately $257 million to expand its transformer factory in Nuremberg, Germany.

As far as growth catalysts are concerned, rising demand for both offshore and onshore wind continues to strengthen the outlook for the broader wind industry, as renewables increasingly outcompete fossil-fuel power on cost. This trend positions GE Vernova and Siemens Energy to benefit, as both companies advance their expansion efforts in the wind market.

In September, GEV received an order from Germany’s Enertrag to supply seven 6MW, 164m turbines, among others. In the same month, GEV announced that it clinched an order from Germany’s Prokon Regenerative Energien eG to repower a wind farm with eight 6MW-164m turbines in the second quarter of 2025.

On the other hand, in June 2025, Siemens Energy Berlin delivered its 2000th SF6-free 8VM1 Blue GIS to the monumental Hornsea 3 wind farm in the North Sea, developed by Siemens Gamesa. These are indicative of the solid demand that both GEV and SMNEY’s products enjoy in the wind industry.

Apart from the growth characteristics of the wind energy industry, increasing demand for efficient grid and storage solutions, along with the rising use of non-fossil energy sources such as nuclear, has also been driving growth for GEV and SMNEY.

Risks of Investing in GEV vs SMNEY

Both GE Vernova and Siemens Energy face shared risks in the wind industry, particularly offshore wind, where rising material costs, supply-chain bottlenecks, and regulatory hurdles have strained project economics and slowed deployment. Compounding these challenges, U.S. import tariffs introduced in early 2025 threaten to further inflate raw material and installation costs while extending project timelines — a key downside risk for wind-focused stocks like GEV and SMNEY, which are already navigating a fragile supply landscape and facing pressure to meet ambitious targets.

Beyond the issues related to the offshore wind market, both these companies are vulnerable to the high volatility in cost and availability of raw materials required for manufacturing renewable energy products, including steel, copper, and rare earth elements. This can compress margins and affect the final cost of their equipment and services.

How Do Zacks Estimates Compare for GEV & SMNEY?

The Zacks Consensus Estimate for GE Vernova’s 2025 sales and earnings per share (EPS) implies an improvement of 6.6% and 36.6%, respectively, from the year-ago quarter’s reported figures. The stock’s EPS estimates have moved south over the past 60 days.

Final Call

To conclude, although GE Vernova benefits from a pure-play focus on grid modernization and a pristine, debt-free balance sheet, Siemens Energy is currently the stronger contender in the clean energy space.

SMNEY’s financial profile shows a significant advantage with its lower forward earnings multiple than GEV. Furthermore, SMNEY boasts a superior Return on Invested Capital (ROIC), higher projected sales growth, a positive movement in earnings growth projections, and a considerably better one-year stock performance compared to GEV.

Thus, for investors prioritizing capital efficiency, stronger stock momentum, and a more favorable valuation as the energy transition accelerates, SMNEY stands out as the stronger clean energy choice for now.

SMNEY sports a Zacks Rank #1 (Strong Buy) at present, while GEV has a Zacks Rank #4 (Sell).

However, starting on Inauguration Day, President Trump halted all new leasing, permitting, and approvals for offshore wind energy, which stopped any new wind projects. Since then, attacks against offshore wind have escalated, with the president signing legislation to rapidly phase out and otherwise restrict access to tax incentives while rescinding funding for port redevelopment and transmission upgrades.

Now the administration is interfering with approved projects in the Atlantic: Of the five projects under construction, two were ordered to immediately cease construction, with only vague justifications provided (one project has since been allowed to resume construction and the other was recently temporarily lifted by granting a preliminary injunction); one project had a necessary federal permit revoked; and the federal government has started a process to voluntarily remand the approval of three other projects. In total, the administration has interfered with just above 62 percent of approved offshore wind energy.

Together, these actions jeopardize billions of dollars in private investment, thousands of good-paying jobs, and several gigawatts of clean electricity that grid operators and states are counting on to keep the lights on and meet clean energy mandates.

At the same time, federal officials have engaged in false rhetoric, portraying offshore wind as unreliable and environmentally damaging and repeating unfounded claims about harm to whales without identifying any credible evidence to back up their statements. Indeed, federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths. Collectively, these actions send a chilling signal to investors and developers that the federal government is hostile to business, undermining confidence across U.S. industries and discouraging the commitments needed to cut costs, expand supply chains, and grow the economy.

The immediate consequences of these rollbacks harm consumers and grid reliability. With offshore wind sidelined—and increasing numbers of power-hungry data centers—the East Coast could be forced to lean more heavily on natural gas, exposing families to the same price spikes that have already driven up winter heating and electricity bills. Without the stable, long-term contracts that offshore wind projects would have provided, ratepayers are left at the mercy of volatile fossil fuel markets.

One of the projects that was ordered to cease construction, Revolution Wind, was poised to deliver 704 megawatts of clean energy to Rhode Island and Connecticut next year. The stop order for Revolution Wind, which was recently overturned while an underlying lawsuit challenging it proceeds, will force Rhode Island and Connecticut consumers to rely on more expensive fossil fuels, driving electricity bills up by at least $500 million each year. And because offshore wind delivers power when demand is often high in the winter months, losing this supply weakens the grid and increases the risk of blackouts during extreme cold.

Offshore wind remains the largest untapped clean energy resource, with the potential to deliver gigawatts of reliable power right where it’s needed most. Early returns are demonstrating the benefit of offshore wind: The South Fork Wind project off Long Island has exceeded production goals, reliably delivering power when needed most.

Defending offshore wind will take a village, with a role for everyone, ranging from states and Congress to each and every one of us.

A critical step is fighting back—in the courts and in Congress. Developers and states have already filed lawsuits challenging the administration’s stop work order and permitting and leasing ban, and the outcome of these cases will be critical in determining whether key projects can move forward. At the same time, Congress must act to restore the $679 million in rescinded offshore wind funding and protect future federal investments that are essential for building out the industry. Even where direct authority is limited, Congress can exert soft power through oversight hearings, public pressure, and funding priorities to push back against these cuts.

Governors and state legislatures also have a central role. States must defend their clean energy solicitations and contracts, ensuring that planned projects are not abandoned. States can move forward with transmission projects that lay the groundwork for future offshore wind integration. They should also continue investing in ports and supply chain readiness to keep the region competitive and prepared and support research and technology development that improve the responsible deployment of offshore wind. Above all, offshore wind must remain a cornerstone of state energy strategies, even in the face of federal hostility.

Finally, all of us can help educate our communities on the critical importance of offshore wind development to the health of our environment and our communities. In the face of anti–offshore wind rhetoric from the president and his administration, it is important to understand the facts and help maintain support so that offshore wind can proceed once federal roadblocks are relieved.

Attacks on offshore wind aren’t just a clean energy setback; they are also direct hits to family budgets and our ability to keep the lights on as electricity demand soars. Organizations and individuals across sectors must join forces to raise the alarm that stopping offshore wind will result in higher bills, greater blackout risks, and stalled climate progress, all because of reckless federal hostility.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-09/rhode-island-wind-turbine-construction-2156801158.jpg?h=060ec7d7&itok=4F1pYdwY,N,,2025-09-29 13:01:38.179359

Governor Candidate, small business owner, energy expert Brett Hulsey unveiled the Positive Energy Plan(PEP) yesterday before the wisconsinclimatemarch.org.

“My Positive Energy Plan makes Wisconsin better for my family and yours. PEP gives our families good clean jobs, less air pollution, and lower energy and grocery bills for a better future,” said Hulsey, who founded Better Environmental Solutions, an affordable housing, energy and environmental, and general contracting firm in 1995.

“We will move forward to implement Gov. Tony Evers Climate Change Action Plan due out later this year, but we need to move the deadlines up to 2030 because immediate action is needed,” said Brett. “Our families should not have to worry about higher food costs, killer heat waves, deadly rains and floods, losing crops and cows, and poisonous air from carbon pollution, according to the WI Department of Natural Resources.”

The Positive Energy Plan will also build on Governor Thompson’s Climate Change Action Plan from the 90’s, make all Wisconsin government buildings produce more energy than they use as Brett did with grocers across the state.” The seven Green Grocer stores taking action reduced 4 million pounds of CO2 emissions and save 2.3 million kilowatt hours of electricity next year, equal to taking 328 cars off the road.

Brett Walks the Talk for Good Union Jobs

Brett has worked with Master Electrician and IBEW member Dan McGrath to install appropriate and controllable LED lights in dozens of remodeling projects.

“Brett knows what he is doing and walks the talk of clean jobs and energy,” said Dan McGrath of Mainstage Lighting of Madison. “He keeps me busy and wants to put every union electrician in Wisconsin to work with his Positive Energy Plan that will relight every government building in the state.” Brett wants to expand apprenticeship programs so workers can get paid to learn trades needed to build the Positive energy future.

He also worked with Madison Area Technical College to set up training for biofuel plant operators.

Brett’s Positive Energy History

Brett designed and helped build a passive solar addition on the left side of his westside 1930’s Madison farmhouse at 110 Merrill Crest Dr. to accommodate his two kids and family. He used recycled newspaper insulation, Wisconsin barnwood on some of the floors and light colored roofing to reduce cooling costs.

Brett also helped build one of America’s first positive energy homes for energy expert Amory Lovins in western Colorado in 1982. This 4,000 square foot home pumps 18,000 watts of clean solar electricity back onto the grid. The added solar and energy efficiency costs paid for themselves in less than a year, making the home both comfortable and beautiful.

Over 40 Year’s Energy Efficiency Experience

Brett’s energy efficiency experience started as an Energy Conservation Advocate in the Volunteer in Service to America Program (VISTA) in the Carter Administration in Alaska during the Energy Crisis in 1978-1979, earning $396 a month.

“Helping residents and Native Tribes all over Alaska make their homes more energy efficient not only saved them money, it saved lives,” said Brett, whose great-great-grandmother was Native American. “The winters there are brutal and too many people freeze to death.”

County Board, National Positive Power Leader

Brett pushed positive power programs on the Dane County Board for 14 years and was on the National Association of Counties(NACo) Energy, Environmental and Land Use Steering Committee.

Brett spearheaded efforts to build two bioplants to treat 20,000 cow’s manure to make biogas and remove phosphorous to reduce water pollution and uncontrolled cow methane.

Brett pioneered efforts working with utilities and Johnson Controls to make county building more efficient, increase comfort for nursing home patients, and save tax money.

Helped write and pass the first NACo resolution to address climate change in a cost-effective manner.

Brett’s Farm Family Roots Help Him Reach Farmer

Growing up in Oklahoma, Brett worked on his family farm and as a cowboy in Kansas. In Wisconsin, he worked with the WI Corn Growers to build two advanced biofuel plants and promote low carbon fuels, and the WI Soybean Association to start the WI Biodiesel Association, attempting to build a soybean processing plant for producing food and fuel.

“Working on my family’s farms, I understand that protecting farmers and their families protects Wisconsin’s future and landscape,” said Brett. “I worked on federal Farm Bills to create the Conservation and Wetland Reserve Programs that protect millions of acres of habitat critical for fish, wildlife, reducing flooding, and providing cleaner water. Wetlands are nature’s sponges and an acre can store up to 1 million gallons of floodwater.”

For his work, Brett was one of the first civilians to win the prestigious FEMA Distinguished Pubic Service Award for using wetlands to control floods.

Brett’s Family and Education

Brett attended UW-Madison, holds a Master’s in Natural Science and Science Education from the University of Oklahoma, attended engineering graduate school at Dartmouth College, studied Wildlife Biology at Colorado State, and has a B.A. in Political Economy from Middlebury College, VT, where he captained the Cross Country Running Team.",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2025-09-29 14:03:58.229708

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Air Quality approved dust control plans for wood pellet manufacturer Enviva and wood-chipping company Basaga International. The new regulations follow two confirmed complaints in the last year from nearby Sunset Park residents about wood-dust pollution.

Enviva has been manufacturing wood pellets since 2011 in North Carolina and is known in Wilmington for their large white dome storage facility at the Port of Wilmington. Though most citizen complaints are directed at Enviva, the state has identified Basaga, a wood-chipping facility operating at the port since 2022, as a “reoccuring source” of dust pollution as well.

In June 2024, NCDEQ required both companies to adopt fugitive dust-control plans. “Fugitive dust” is the term for particulate matter that becomes airborne from non-point sources, meaning it does not come out of a traditional vent or stack. At the Port of Wilmington, this dust primarily consists of small wood particles escaping during the loading and handling of Enviva’s wood pellets and Basaga’s wood-chip processing.

Wood dust can lead to short-term health problems, including respiratory irritation that can pose a heightened risk for people with conditions like asthma, but long-term effects are still being studied.

The newly approved plans by DEQ outline a step-by-step procedure for Enviva and Basaga International employees to prevent wood dust from leaving the Port of Wilmington site.

Key to Enviva’s plan is enhanced monitoring during ship loading, where associates must record wind speed and direction every three hours. If winds from the west exceed 10 miles per hour, a second observer must be deployed to watch closely for dust. If any fugitive dust is observed leaving the property or if a citizen complaint is received, employees are immediately required to stop work until the dust source is investigated and fully mitigated.

Furthermore, the company must maintain a detailed fugitive dust complaint log of all incidents and actions taken, with the entire plan subject to an annual review by DEQ. The plan also imposes a two-year record-keeping requirement for all operational documentation and stipulates Enviva must cross-reference on-site dust observations with official wind data from the Wilmington International Airport.

“Enviva has been proud to be part of the Wilmington community since 2016,” a spokesperson for the company told Port City Daily. “Over the years, we have continued to build relationships, listen to feedback, and take action to be a responsible and engaged neighbor. Enviva remains committed to being a strong partner in the communities where we live and work.”

The Basaga International dust-control plan is strictly focused on controlling emissions from its wood chipping operations. The plan centers on reducing dust at the source, primarily through the regular application of water or chemical suppressants to stockpiles and work areas to cut back the likelihood of particulates going into the air. This may involve stopping chipping activity when weather like high winds makes dust control difficult. Like Enviva, the company is required to keep detailed records of all incidents and actions, and the entire plan is subject to annual DEQ review.

Port City Daily reached out to Basaga International for comment on the implementation of the dust control plans but did not received a response by press.

Ivy Miller, a resident of Sunset Park, has dealt with the persistent problem of fugitive wood dust for years. She and a neighbor have sent nearly 50 complaints to NCDEQ over the last decade, including letters to the attorney general’s office, which she said have gone unanswered.

“It’s definitely not fun,” Miller explained. “It makes you not want to sit outside, but at some point, you feel pressure you’re going to give up because there’s nobody really holding anybody accountable.”

Miller and her neighbors have dealt with the wood dust accumulating on their homes, in their yards and coating their vehicles. She and other neighbors have also experienced health issues, including heavy sinuses and congestion, which they attribute to the exposure.

Miller explained the dust decreased for a few months when NCDEQ first issued requirements for the management plans in June 2024, but the particulates still continue to pollute the neighborhood.

“There were weeks where we didn’t see anything, but, suddenly, there’d be like two or three days in a row where you see sawdust every morning,” Miller stated. “You wake up and the car, you can see it’s just covered.”

As far as the dust management plans go, Miller is not convinced they will solve the problem.

“I just honestly don’t really think they care,” Miller said about the companies. “Enviva has tried to give us money through gift certificates for Winnie’s [Tavern] down the road and car washes and house washes and I’ve told them, ‘No, I want you to figure out the problem because I moved here before you guys did, and you’re ruining our environment.’”

According to an NCDEQ spokesperson, both Enviva and Basaga will be required to be in compliance with their respective fugitive dust control plans by Oct. 18. The agency will monitor compliance through inspections spurred by new complaints.

NCDEQ has not assessed any civil penalties against Enviva in the last year, but has previously for air quality violations.

The Enviva plant in Sampson County has received five air quality violations from NCDEQ since opening in 2016 for emitting too much carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, resulting in fines in excess of $148,000.

Widely considered the world’s largest wood pellet producer, Enviva operates four plants in North Carolina collectively generating roughly 2.3-million metric tons of wood pellets annually. They are shipped overseas, primarily through the Port of Wilmington. These plants — located in Hertford County, Northampton County, Sampson County, and Richmond County — have all undergone or sought capacity increases since they began operation.

Most notably, the Northampton plant received an expansion permit from NCDEQ in 2019 to boost its production to 780,000 tons of pellets per year, while the Hertford County plant was permitted in 2023 to increase its capacity to 630,000 tons per year. These expansions are coupled with the required installation of new pollution control devices, such as regenerative thermal oxidizers, which destroy air pollutants using heat.

The wood pellet industry is sustained by large subsidies provided by the United Kingdom and the European Union. The UK and EU, starting with a 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, classify the burning of wood pellets as a renewable and zero-carbon energy source, allowing European utility companies to access billions in financial incentives. Although the U.S. also classifies wood pellets as renewable biomass, it provides no comparable subsidies, driving the domestic industry to focus on European exports.

The renewable classification propels international demand, as evidenced by the fact that nearly all wood pellets produced by Enviva are exported to power plants overseas. As a result of this system, Enviva has received approximately $7.7 billion in cumulative net revenue from the start of its public reporting in 2014 through the end of 2023.

In addition to the foreign incentives, North Carolina has provided taxpayer-backed funds to attract and retain Enviva’s operations. State and county economic development grants, including Job Development Investment Grants and One North Carolina Fund awards, total over $7 million for the company’s North Carolina plants since 2011.

However, these revenue streams did not prevent the company from collapsing under its own debt. Enviva filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2024 to restructure about $1 billion. The company’s financial issues stemmed from unfavorable contracts with overseas utility companies and operational issues at its plants. No longer a publicly traded company, Enviva emerged as a private entity in December 2024, having eliminated more than $1 billion in debt and secured new financing from private equity firm American Industrial Partners Capital Fund VIII.

Despite the subsidies powering the industry, the environmental classification justifying them remains controversial. Environmental educator and conservationist Andy Wood explained that claims of “renewable” and “carbon-neutral” wood pellet biomass energy are not entirely accurate. While trees eventually do grow back, he said it can take 50 years or longer for a forest to re-absorb the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere from burning wood pellets.

“It’s harming the climate in two ways: One, burning wood pellets releases more carbon dioxide than burning natural gas or coal,” Wood stated. “The other is, we’re burning trees that, when left to their homes, sequester existing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. So we’re cutting ourselves twice — and we are paying a company to do it.”

Wood, along with other environmental advocates from the Dogwood Alliance, the Southern Forest Conservation Coalition, the Alliance for Cape Fear Trees, and Save Sledge Forest, held an informational tour for the public on the Cape Fear River recently to discuss Enviva’s operations locally and in the state. Environmental advocates have held similar cruises in the past — Port City Daily last attended in 2021.

Anita Cunningham, executive director of the Southern Forest Conservation Coalition and resident of Robeson County near the Enviva facility, spoke during the tour about the impact of the Enviva plant in Robeson County. Cunningham also serves as the co-director of the NC Climate Solutions Coalition and was appointed in 2024 to serve on the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council.

She previously led grassroots opposition through the Robeson County Cooperative for Sustainable Development, achieving a victory by successfully stopping the proposed Active Energy wood pellet plant (a company distinct from Enviva) in Lumberton in 2022.

Cunningham explained the Robeson community’s struggles with persistent noise pollution from tree debarking as well as particulate matter expelled from the Enviva plant.

“If [particulates] covers their yards, their homes, cars, plants and flowers,” Cunningham stated. “It’s gonna be harmful to you and your community, your health and welfare and your ability to live freely and enjoy your life at your home.”

California now has 68% more electric vehicle (EV) charging ports than gas pumps statewide, according to the California Energy Commission (CEC).

That’s 201,180 publicly available and shared EV charging ports throughout the state, California Governor Gavin Newsom said.

“With this expanding public network, EV chargers are becoming ubiquitous in California,” said CEC Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “Our goal is to make driving an EV a no-brainer choice for Californians. They are fun to drive, never need an oil change, don’t cause smog and it’s getting easier to charge your vehicle with public EV infrastructure.”

California’s publicly available EV chargers can be found at convenience stores such as Love’s Travel Stops, Jacksons Food Stores, 7-Eleven, Circle K and more. They are also available at various grocery stores, parking lots, workplaces and sports facilities.

Federal tax incentives for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) are set to end on Sept. 30. After that date, tax credits of up to $7,500 for eligible new electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles, and up to $4,000 for qualifying used models, will no longer be available. Additional credits of up to $1,000 are also available for installing home charging equipment and battery storage systems. This expiration is the result of decisions made by the Trump administration.

California state agencies, however, continue efforts to speed up EV charger installation and plan for increasing grid demand. These efforts include:

Providing grant funds that support publicly accessible, workplace and at-home charging installations, including in multi-family complexes, throughout the state.

Prioritizing shovel-ready fast-charging installations for the funding incentives available through the CEC’s grant solicitation programs.

Developing the ZEV Infrastructure Plan, a comprehensive plan that lays out the overall infrastructure strategy to meet California’s zero-emission transportation goals.

Establishing charger reliability standards.

Meanwhile, at the federal level, other recent updates aim to further support EV infrastructure growth. In August, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced revised rules for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula (NEVI) Program, which had been paused earlier this year for review. The new guidance streamlines approvals, increases state flexibility and removes several planning and consultation requirements.

These changes may reduce regulatory and planning burdens for businesses, including convenience stores, that are eligible to host charging stations. By encouraging site-host-owned locations and simplifying the approval process, the revisions could make it easier for retailers to participate in the NEVI program and expand the public charging network.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-09/background/ev-sign.jpg?VersionId=61nfLcWlg6rvsL1RXFZnuMuoAeNWXb5g,N,,2025-09-29 12:07:28.055829

CARFAX reported a sharp surge in sales of electric and hybrid vehicles in September in the U.S. They said consumers rushed to take advantage of federal tax credits for new and used EVs before they expire at the end of the month. EVs and hybrids are selling about 30 per cent faster than they were at the start of the summer, based on the company’s data.

“EV and hybrid sales are spiking, yet prices remain stable,” said Patrick Olsen, Editor-in-Chief at CARFAX, in a statement. “For shoppers considering a purchase, experts say now is the time to act.”

According to CARFAX, the Inflation Reduction Act included EV and some plug-in hybrid incentives. A $7,500 tax credit is offered for new models and $4,000 for used. Congress voted to eliminate the credits, with Sept. 30 as the deadline for eligible purchases to qualify.

A recent Cox Automotive report is forecasting a record 410,000 EVs will be sold in the third quarter. That’s a significant increase — of 21.4 per cent — year-over-year, and up more than 30 per cent compared to Q2. The federal tax credit was considered a “key catalyst” for EV adoption.

“This shift (away from the tax credit) will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, in a statement.

Cox Automotive is anticipating that EV sales will slow notably in Q4, but long-term sales growth will continue.

Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, this week exposed the malign influence of the fossil fuel industry’s climate denial operation and its infiltration of the Trump administration in a comment submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency. Whitehouse’s comment was filed during the same week that President Donald Trump attempted to spread pro-polluter falsehoods at the United Nations General Assembly. Speaking before world leaders in New York City, Trump falsely claimed that renewables “don’t work” and that climate change is “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Whitehouse submitted the comment in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s legally deficient and factually inaccurate proposed rollback of the endangerment finding, a 2009 scientific determination by EPA that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare that provides a legal bedrock of U.S. climate policy. Repealing the endangerment finding would fly in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence and set the stage for rolling back emissions standards for motor vehicles, power plants, airplanes, and more, making it easier to pollute.

“This sham regulatory proceeding can only properly be understood against its backdrop: a multi-year, multi-billion dollar, semi-covert campaign of climate denial fraud by fossil fuel interests; and its related multi-year, multi-billion dollar, semi-covert campaign of dark-money political influence and corruption,” wrote Whitehouse.

Whitehouse’s opening in the comment letter details the fossil fuel industry’s orchestration of the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans’ energy agenda, and the industry’s corrupt mission to use the power of government to kill America’s clean energy industry. Whitehouse wrote:

“With this sham proceeding, climate denial fraud has metastasized inside government, with an arm of the operation operating within the halls of government, allowing fossil fuel interests to capture and exert official government agency power. A long and sordid history of agency capture, aka regulatory capture, resounds through the literature of economics and administrative law; this sorry episode of climate denial fraud is its latest and perhaps worst chapter. Consider it fraud-by-government.

“The climate denial fraud operation has never had the goal that its statements be true; only that the falsehoods be loud and persistent enough to confound rational public debate; and that it provide a rhetorical structure for the political forces influenced and/or corrupted by its dark money operation. Those persistent falsehoods and related rhetoric litter EPA’s work here.

“The tactics of the climate denial fraud operation, now deployed from within government, remain the same: an embrace of fake science, propagated by a small stable of reliable climate deniers; deployment of fake proceedings that resemble legitimate proceedings but aren’t; and behind it all the power of fossil fuel industry’s pressure to ram the falsehoods home and protect its free-to-pollute business model. This is a simulacrum of a regulatory proceeding, not a real one.”

The rollback of the endangerment finding, if finalized, would constitute a formal denial by EPA that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare—a position that defies years of scientific evidence, agency precedent, and Supreme Court rulings. To justify the repeal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin relied on a pseudoscientific Department of Energy report written by known climate deniers with close ties to fossil fuel and polluting industries. Rife with clear errors, cherry-picked data, and misrepresented facts, the report peddles the lie that human-caused climate change is not a threat.

“In a world where climate change is causing homeowners to face gut-wrenching financial decisions as insurance premiums and nonrenewal rates soar; farmers to endure massive crop losses from flood and drought; and families to suffer grocery ‘climate-flation,’ food insecurity, displacement, and even illness and death, EPA’s Proposal, with its legal and factual deficiencies, deserves zero credence. As a product of the fraud-by-government stage of the fossil fuel industry’s linked climate denial fraud and dark money corruption operations, it merits condemnation,”Whitehouse’s letter concluded.

Whitehouse and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) led the entire Democratic Caucus in a separate comment letter demanding the Trump Administration withdraw its legally deficient and factually inaccurate proposed rollback of the endangerment finding. The 47 senators comprising the Senate Democratic caucus called the repeal of the climate and public health protection a “dereliction of duty” and a “blatant failure to protect the American people.” Whitehouse has also launched an investigation into the extent of fossil fuel and related entities’ improper influence on the Trump Administration’s proposed roll back of the endangerment finding.

Whitehouse has long been the Senate’s leading voice exposing the corruption of the fossil-fuel-funded climate denial operation and the fossil fuel industry’s long-running covert operation to profit off the American people while damaging the economy and wrecking the planet. Whitehouse has delivered 301 speeches on the Senate floor urging his colleagues to wake up to the threat of climate change and the coming systemic shock to the economy that will be triggered by the climate crisis.",https://www.whitehouse.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/Whitehouse_Logo_Social_Option1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 12:08:14.945727

The terms staffers are forbidden from using include: climate change, green, decarbonization, energy transition, sustainability, sustainable, subsidies, tax breaks, tax credits, and carbon footprint.

Also on the banned word list is the term “emissions.” According to the report, the term apparently implies some level of negativity, despite the neutrally worded dictionary definition. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases aren’t simply emissions, though, but instead can be regulated as air pollutants.

The EERE was established in the late 1970s after several government agencies were rolled into one. The office was a response to the 1973 energy crisis, which had sent oil prices skyrocketing. The intent of the EERE was to foster renewable energy and energy efficiency in an effort to stabilize the American economy from price shocks that can roil commodity markets, like oil and gas.

President Trump and his appointees have decided to bet the American economy on expanded use of those commodities.

In speeches and official communications, the Trump administration has continually referred to anything related to the energy transition as the “green energy scam.” Last week in a speech at the United Nations, Trump took aim at countries around the world for investing in technologies like solar, wind, and batteries.

WASHINGTON — U.S. Senator Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and founder of the Senate Fusion Caucus, and U.S. Senator Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), a member of the Senate Committee on Science, Commerce, and Transportation, are welcoming an announcement from Pacific Fusion, a commercial fusion energy company, that it is investing $1,000,000,000 to construct a Research and Manufacturing Campus in Albuquerque.

The $1 billion research facility, to be located in Mesa del Sol, Albuquerque, will create more than 200 long-term jobs, plus hundreds more in construction and workforce development. The nuclear research and manufacturing facility, which is developing low-cost commercial fusion energy, builds on technology first developed in New Mexico and further cements New Mexico’s status as a leader in energy innovation.

“Pacific Fusion’s investment will be transformative for New Mexico. This facility will cement Albuquerque at the forefront of clean energy innovation, create hundreds of jobs, and drive long-term economic growth for our state. Fusion energy has the potential to deliver abundant, affordable, carbon-free power, and New Mexico will now play a central role in making that future a reality,” said Heinrich, Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and founder of the Senate Fusion Caucus.

Why should I stick with a Ford EV next time?
I think you’re going to find that the Ford EV product range will be much sharper, more specific, and more valuable to customers than it was when you last shopped.
Let’s dig into the news you just announced, which is that you have something called Ford Universal EV Platform.
There are a lot of tariffs that a company like Ford gets because there are auto-specific tariffs and non-auto-specific tariffs.","Hello, and welcome to Decoder! This is Nilay Patel’s show about big ideas and other problems. I am not Nilay Patel, though I have long wanted to be him.

I am Joanna Stern, the senior personal technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, author of the upcoming book I AM NOT A ROBOT (releasing spring 2026), and, once upon a time, a cofounder of The Verge. I’m the last Monday guest host filling in for Nilay while he’s out on parental leave with his adorable new son, and I’m very excited to be talking today to Ford CEO Jim Farley.

I’m a longtime Decoder listener and my favorite episodes are car episodes. I might not own a gas-powered Mustang convertible like Nilay — I’m not cool enough — but I did, in fact, lease my first EV, a Ford Mustang Mach-E, back in 2023. I think car CEOs are currently facing some of the most fascinating and complex challenges in both tech and business.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

So when I was asked to guest host the show I said, “That’s it, car CEOs.” And Jim was at the top of the list. Jim was on this show once before — his first appearance was in May 2021. And, well, a whole lot has changed in the past four years. Actually, a whole lot has changed in the last four months. The second Trump administration’s barrage of tariffs, trade wars, and a whole lot more, just to name a few.

For Ford, it’s an especially critical moment. Last month, the company announced what it calls the Ford Universal EV Platform, an all-new manufacturing process that the company is calling a “Model T moment” for EVs. That’s because it should, in theory, allow Ford to produce cheaper EVs in a more efficient manner than it does with its current lineup, including my Mach-E. You will hear Jim say “last week” a few times — that’s because we taped this episode in August just after their announcement.

It’s also not just tariff troubles for Ford. There’s the general weakening of demand for EVs in the US, the loss of the federal tax credit, and rising competition from low-cost Chinese competitors like BYD and Xiaomi.

One thing I love about talking to Jim is that he’s honest about it all. You’ll hear him say in plain terms that China is, in some respects, miles ahead of the West when it comes to some parts of its EV industry. And this major multibillion-dollar gamble on a Ford Universal EV Platform isn’t a done deal. You’re going to hear him say the word “risk” quite a lot in this conversation, and how this major manufacturing and strategy pivot could very well fail.

Jim had quite a lot to say about rebuilding the manufacturing base of blue-collar workers here in the US to compete with China — and even AI. Plus, he didn’t shy away from what he’d like to see from the Trump administration on tariffs. He says specifically, “We’re just asking for a fair fight.”

And don’t worry, I didn’t forget to do my best Nilay impression with a bunch of Decoder questions. Is Ford considering Apple’s CarPlay Ultra? (His answer is so great on that one.) How does Jim Farley make decisions? And, most importantly, do I stick with the Ford Mach-E when my lease is up next summer? I also couldn’t let Jim go without hitting him with a special call-in question from an old friend who’s technically not supposed to be working right now. I think you’re going to really like that one.

Okay, hopefully you’re in your car listening to this: Ford CEO Jim Farley, here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Jim Farley, you are the CEO of Ford Motor Company. Welcome back to Decoder.

Great to be here with you, Joanna.

Thank you for coming on my show. Obviously, this is not my show, this is Nilay’s show, but I want to give you some background. I listen to Decoder all the time, and I love Nilay’s car CEO interviews. But often I find myself saying, “Nilay, why didn’t you ask that question?” So, when he asked me to do this, I said, “That’s it, I’m going to bring on car CEOs. And I’m going to ask the questions I want.”

I see.

[Laughs] So you were last on the show in May 2021. Things have changed considerably in the world, in technology, in the country, and at Ford. I want to talk about all of those things. But something also changed for me. In 2023, I got a Mustang Mach-E. I leased one.

Thank you.

And that lease is up next summer.

Ah, I’ll be reading about your decision process.

Well, that’s going to inform a lot of this conversation because I wanted to give you the chance to be the world’s best car salesman to the most annoying customer. I think that’s just going to set a lot of the backdrop of this conversation.

[Laughs] I love it.

Last month, you said at a press conference that the Mach-E is not so great, that it’s not the future of Ford. Why should I stick with a Ford EV next time?

Well, we just won the revised Model Y versus Mach-E drive evaluation by a pretty respected magazine. I’m still pretty proud of the Mach-E. We knew what we knew then (five years ago) and we now know what we know now. Those are, as you said, two different things.

I would say that in the second inning of product development, Ford really understood the opportunity to serve the EV market more fully than we did several years ago and we executed a product with the right approach based on those lessons. That’s with the consumer, because we’ve learned what consumers are willing to live with and not — like charging on the fly — as well as where in the market Ford should participate and put its limited resources. I think you’re going to find that the Ford EV product range will be much sharper, more specific, and more valuable to customers than it was when you last shopped.

Let’s dig into the news you just announced, which is that you have something called Ford Universal EV Platform. What is that, and when is it coming? More specifically for me, will it be out next August, and will I be able to get that kind of new Ford versus an upgrade to my Mach-E?

You’ll learn a lot more about the first product. It’s a platform that will be out in 2027. We learned so much from the Mach-E. We’ve been number two to Tesla. We’re a long way behind them, but we’re number two in the US market in EV sales. EV sales aren’t the most important metric, but it does give you an indication that Ford has learned a lot and has served a lot of wonderful customers like you. We have all of the data coming off the vehicle, so we have learned a lot about customers.

We believe the platform that we shared in Kentucky is a breakthrough approach for developing and delivering an affordable, electric platform to customers, where we’ll develop and launch several vehicles over the subsequent few years and show that we can have a profitable vehicle that’s sustainable in terms of the company’s resources and made in the US. But in order to compete with the likes of BYD, who we think are among the best in the world, we had to completely reinvent the platform for the customers.

There’s a lot to that. I’m sure we’ll get into it, but in short, the evolution revolution of our thinking was to develop a vehicle for manufacturability, to radically reduce the cost and the complexity of the vehicle with all new thinking that is not embedded in a traditional car company. To do that, we needed all new talent, and we needed them to be separate from Ford, separate from our IT solutions that we used to develop and release parts, and separate from a philosophy standpoint about how to radically simplify the vehicle. This is all to really get back to the basics of Ford and Henry Ford’s idea of a “universal car.”

Our first body style will be a pickup, but it’s really not a pickup. I would say it’s a new silhouette. What I mean by that is that it has more room than a RAV4, the best-selling passenger car in the US. That doesn’t include its frunk and pickup truck bed. It is very fast, it’s rear-wheel drive, it’s super fun to drive, and it has a digital experience that no one’s seen — at least that we’ve seen — even in China. The digital experience is quite different for customers. I think the whole package is something that has not been offered in the US or anywhere else to date. I think this first product is quite revolutionary.

And this first product is what you’re going to have out in 2027?

Yes, exactly.

You’ve mentioned BYD, which is a Chinese competitor that is making low-cost, very high-tech EVs. Here in the US, you’re up against Tesla and GM. You mentioned that you have the second-best-selling EV, but GM seems to have had some real luck with the Equinox EVs, and they’re quickly taking off because of price.

Absolutely.

Is the move to put this new platform out against this backdrop enough? Is it enough to compete both here and in China?

For us, it could be. Globally, no,, it’s not enough. In North America, it’s absolutely the right strategy, but it’s not our complete strategy. GM has 14 nameplates, we have three. We came out with our vehicles four or five years ago, and it’s coming out with them now. So, our product cycle is completely different. What I mean by that is we’re about to launch our second generation of products, and it has its first 14 out now. I hope it outsells us. If I were GM with 14 nameplates, it should easily scale. I personally didn’t think we would be number two for three years with our simple lineup, but it seems to have worked so far in the first inning.

The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry. There’s no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we’ve seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China. They have 20 million units locally, and about 11 million are EV or [extended-range EVs], So half that market. We’re barely at a million vehicles here in the US. That’s one tenth of China’s volume. Europe’s only twice as big as us, so that’s maybe only one fifth. China’s successful for good reason. It has great innovation at a very low cost.

For example, it bet on [lithium iron phosphate] technology, not these expensive lithium batteries. There’s hundreds of companies, and they’re all sponsored by their local governments, so they have huge subsidies. It’s new brands. It’s BYD and Geely, and companies like Nio and Xiaomi, many of which have never been in the car business before, and that’s a big advantage for them. In China, the brands that are winning are indigenous brands. They’re not global automotive companies, they’re really Chinese companies. To beat them, we need a completely different approach. It’s not the number of vehicles you have or the price you offer the customer. Everyone’s going to have affordable EVs. If you sell an affordable EV in the US for $30,000 but it costs you $50,000 to make, you could say you have an affordable EV, but that’s not a sustainable business.

Three or four years ago, we saw this affordable customer duty cycle changing with our sales. It became very obvious to me that we had to go outside of Ford, create this maverick group, give them resources and stay out of their way, but make sure that they deliver on a completely new approach because the Chinese are so formidable, they have so much support from the government, and their customers have such a high expectation for the digital experience that an incremental approach from Mach-E would never work.

I love you telling it to me real straight here. It’s exactly what I was thinking. In some ways I’m driving a dinosaur, right? That’s the whole reason I leased a number of years back.

Smart move.

I want to go back to price. I was charging at an Electrify America station in Connecticut recently, and four out of the six stalls had these Chevy Equinox EVs. I asked this woman how she likes hers. She said she liked it, but the thing she was really talking about was the price. She said, “We like this car and the price so much that we actually got two.” And she pointed to her husband who’s in the other stall. I’m not thrilled that this type of family’s taking up all these stalls, but it’s fine. I forgive them.

I’m wondering if just getting that price down so that EVs can finally take off in lower, more affordable areas is one of your motivating factors right now.

To your point, I think it was inevitable that government support would wane. It was inevitable that the duty cycle wound up being EV customers who use their car for commuting and shorter trips, and occasionally taking a longer trip. This happened in the 1910s over 100 years ago. Steam was 30 percent, electric was 30 percent, and the rest was internal combustion engines. A few years later, it was totally different.

Back then you could not call which technology would win. It’s the same now. The EVs came at the high end, and I would say $40,000 is expensive now for most people. We don’t talk about it in the car business because more than two-thirds of the cars sold in the US are used. We never really talk about those two-thirds, but their average price is around $30,000. The average new car is obviously much higher than that. Most of the five-year-old vehicles that people are driving around in the US are going to be around $30,000. This is the most important part of the EV market. It’s not expensive Lucids and Teslas. That’s all interesting, but what is really going to move this market is a non-government-subsidized, affordable EV that people can afford, and that’s at a lower cost to use than a used Model Y because there’s a lot of those around.

For people in America who have a tough time with all their demands, want to go on vacation, want to put their kids through college, and want to have a house or whatever, $30,000 is the most they want to spend. I think that customer you met is very typical. Sorry to use a baseball analogy, but this next inning is completely different from the first one, where the fitness of the companies doesn’t rely on the government, and we have to innovate.

I said it last week, and I’ll emphasize it now: there are no assurances that we can do this. No one has ever built a car in three pieces. No one’s offered their own electric architecture at this price. We’ve never done it. We’ve never had two large unit castings and high quality. No one’s done it. Tesla’s talked about it, but it hasn’t done it. In fact, our manufacturing process has radically moved on beyond what Tesla’s ever shown in its unboxing. So, there’s a lot of risk here. This is not a guarantee that Ford’s going to get this done.

You’ve segued really nicely into my next set of questions, which are the Decoder questions. You’ve set out to build something, and now you’ve got to figure out the structure to build it. You said you had to create a maverick group that was separate from Ford, separate in terms of IT. Now, you’ve got to take this skunkworks engineering team, which I believe is in California, and you’ve got to bring that into the big castle that is Ford.

Yes.

How do you think about integrating these new skunkworks ideas into this bigger system? Have you mapped out how that’s going to happen?

Yes. We’ve been working on that for a couple years now. One of the things that really helped us in that regard was that Alan [Clarke], the leader of this Universal EV Platform team, was free to have Ford people on his team but had the right to say no to anyone. So, he went through a very rigorous process. He’s had the team that scouts for the manufacturing process for all this new stuff for three to four years.Of course, we’ve been listening to them. We have a lot of good experience at Ford, too, that knows how to handle risk in supply chain and risk in manufacturing and new processes like the one we use with aluminum F-150. It’s a different problem, but the same process of risk elimination. It’s a plan that has come together.

It’s important to have a plan, but you get out of the plan pretty quickly because of surprises. The supplier isn’t as good as you thought, they’re running late, or software for a module is running late. Then, you have to really de-risk. The way we’re thinking about it is, “Let’s make a simple one first. Let’s not try to add all the complexity. Why don’t we just make one color, one version, one spec at the beginning, and massively simplify the task for everyone? What is the basic level of software capability?”

We don’t need all the singing and dancing, hands-free automation at launch. Maybe we focus BlueCruise on a simple operating domain like high-speed safety, with hands-off highway operations for the autonomy solution. Then gradually, as we verify the delivery of that base capability — whether it’s the vehicle structure, the manufacturing process of the suppliers, or even automation — we start to introduce more complexity and capability over time when we feel comfortable. That makes it stressful for the go-to-market team because, frankly, they don’t know what they’re going to be selling in a year and a half. But that’s the only way we’ve found to do this.

I want to stay on some more Decoder questions, and call you out. In your first Decoder interview in 2021, you dodged the question, “How do you make decisions?” In fact, I was listening to the episode in my Mach-E last week and just screaming, “Jim, you didn’t answer.” You answered about the company’s strategy, but you didn’t answer how you specifically make decisions. I feel like you’ve had to make some big decisions here with this new platform. So, how do you do it?

Let’s just be specific. In this case, I looked at the wiring loom in the Mach-E. It’s a beautiful wiring loom, but it’s 70 pounds heavier than the Model Y’s wiring loom, and it’s $200 a battery to carry that wiring loom around. I just had to ask myself the question, “Can my team do it?” Taking the wiring loom as a metaphor, can my team beat BYD?

I went to [Executive Chairman] Bill Ford, the board, and my team. I said, “I love you guys, but I don’t think we can do this.” The decision I arrived at, which was highly informed by meeting Doug Fields, was that we had to do it completely separately. Doug is a Model 3 chief engineer and worked on the car project at Apple. He was one of the first-generation software designers in AOS. He also designed the Segway early in his career. He’s been at the forefront of a lot of technology revolutions time and time again. I asked him, “Why can’t Ford do it?” He’s like, “Jim, your part release system, your IT, your CAD design systems are 25 years uncompetitive. There’s no way you can beat BYD with that. You need real expertise.”

BYD has vertical integration with the batteries. Its batteries are 30 percent cheaper than what we can buy from CATL. For us to beat that battery, to even be in the neighborhood in terms of cost, we have to radically redesign the efficiency of the motors, gearboxes, and inverters on the EV side so it uses 30 percent less battery. We can’t beat BYD’s vertical integration on the cost of battery. The only way we can beat it was with innovation on the draw of the battery.

When I got the list of inventory from Doug about what we have to do to beat BYD, even three to four years ago, it became very obvious to me that I had to look my team in the eyes and say, “Eventually we’re going to come back to you for the industrialization of this product. But for now, leave these people alone, trust that they don’t have any prejudice in coming up with something better. If you want to get mad at me, you can come into my office and shout at me, but don’t waste their time.”

I talked to Bill, and I also do Gemba. I go in person for every big decision I ever make. I went to that teardown and looked at every piece. I looked at the number of fasteners in a Model Y. It was literally a third of the fasteners that go into a Mach-E. From a customer standpoint, you won’t tell the difference, but from manufacturability and cost standpoints, fasteners are an output metric for how elegant your engineering solution is. When I looked at those fasteners and the wiring loom, I knew I had no choice because I gemba walked and talked to people who knew. I can’t put the company’s future at risk by making people happy. I have to do the right thing. That’s how I approached that particular decision.

Can I interrupt you quickly to tell me what gemba is?

Gemba is something that I fell in love with at Toyota. Gemba is “genchi genbutsu,” which is a Japanese phrase for “go and see with your own eyes, learn with your own eyes.” It’s actually the five senses. The idea is that before you make a big decision or want to understand a problem, you have to go and see the real problem and where the waste is. It’s a tool in problem solving.

In my case, the waste was that wiring harness, those fasteners, all the welds, the front and rear structures that’ll eventually get displaced by unicasting. You see the waste. You look at it, you ask the engineers: “Why do we have this waste? Why do we use a 25-year-old parts release system?” As a leader, you get down on the floor and you ask them the basic questions, so you can visualize your decision. That’s what gemba is.

Love that. Didn’t know that before. I need to practice gemba, clearly.

Let me back up here. You have to restructure your company, but it also seems like you’ve been talking about restructuring the economy. You’ve been talking about a refocus on the “Essential Economy,” or the blue-collar jobs that are the backbone of this country.

You wrote a LinkedIn essay in June about the focus of AI on white-collar productivity, but that we need to do the same for blue-collar work. How are you thinking about automation at Ford?

There’s a complete crisis in the country that’s not being talked about. People like Mike Rowe will talk about it, but we have a crisis that’s not in the public debate. We have a 500,000 construction worker shortfall. We have a 500,000 factory worker shortfall. We don’t have enough people in emergency services to support our society when things go wrong. Firemen, ambulance workers, medical workers, plumbers, and electricians — the frontline people that make our society run that many of us take for granted.We call this the Essential Economy.

We see this at Ford because we’re on the edge of this software-defined vehicle, but we’re also a heavy manufacturing industrial company. Whether it’s a technician shortage in our dealerships to work on these vehicles or the factory worker shortage, I really learned as a leader during the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike what a crisis we have as a country. I see it with our customers. Plumbers and electricians are constantly trying to get young people into those vocations, and there’s no training. The trade schools and apprentice programs that our grandparents had that made this country so great are not there anymore. We’re very vulnerable as a country.

The productivity of those essential workers, as you said, is way behind that of white-collar workers. Automation, AI deployment, and everything else that has happened for white-collar tools, it’s not the same for blue-collar work. There’s very little training. Companies like Ford, thankfully, have enough resources that we can put our backs behind this problem with trade schools and scholarships, but our society isn’t doing it. In fact, we’re going to have a conference here in Detroit in the fall where we’re going to gather other companies that have the same problem and really see it — solution providers, academics, and creative people in government — and we’re going to try and start working on this problem.

Is it a Farm Aid or medical crisis like COVID? No, it’s more. In a way, it’s just as threatening to our society. The way we’re thinking about it is that we’re going to walk the walk and invest heavily. We have been. We spent about $1 billion on the dignity of the workplace and safety in our plants. We’ve modernized our buildings. We’re investing in trade schools and scholarships to recruit technicians for vehicle repair as well as our factories.

But this is a society problem. The one that bothers me the most is cultural. We, as a culture, think that everyone has to go to an Ivy League school to be valuable in our society, yet we all know that our parents and grandparents made our country wonderful because of these kinds of jobs. There’s incredible dignity in emergency services, and people can have wonderful careers. But our society doesn’t celebrate those people like they do the latest AI engineer.

That’s exactly what I wanted to ask you. This seems like such a reversal of decades of messaging in America that said “Get out of manufacturing and go to the office.” Is your advice to this next generation to actually go get a job in manufacturing?

I think it would help all of us as a society. Look, my son [Jameson] is 17. He’s a senior in high school. He’s got every opportunity that you could ever imagine. He doesn’t have to worry like most people. I made sure that he had a summer job where he learned how to weld, to fabricate, to really work with his hands, and relate to people. And he can make a choice. I have no prejudice for Jameson. If he turns out to be the greatest welder or a mechanic working on our Super Duty diesel engines, I will be so thrilled as a parent. I think we all need to look at ourselves and decide what kind of society we want to build in America. Let’s say that we’re getting into war somewhere. Google’s not going to make the boots, but Ford will. To defend our own country, we need these people.

Now, we’re having critical issues. The average ambulance is 15 years old. We do not have enough emergency care people. Look at what firemen are having to go through in California with smoke and their own health. These are very dangerous jobs, and we have a shortage. It’s going to affect all of us in a lot of annoying ways. We need to really get serious about readjusting our expectations for our kids, younger people, and our country to give them opportunities to grow. And these are great jobs. A factory job at Ford could make way over $100,000 a year, and you can bridge into a lot of other things. My grandfather was a factory worker at Ford, and he became a Ford dealer in his 60s. Think about the possibility. He was an orphan, he had nothing. He never went to college. It didn’t matter to him.

I’m really excited and energized about this. It’s a much bigger problem than fixing Ford and making it a world-class company. It’s important for our country. We need to focus on this just as much as the new exciting AI and the new social media dance on Instagram. Let’s get busy working on these important problems.

I do have a call-in question from a guest caller.

Nilay Patel: Hey, Jim, it’s Nilay. I’m very excited to be calling in with this question. As you know, I’m a Mustang guy. I have a 2021 Mustang GT convertible. It’s one of my favorite cars ever. People love this car because it’s so easy to mod and tune. You can just reprogram the engine control unit (ECU) to make the car go faster. But with the new version of the gas Mustang, the one with all the screens running on your new platform, the ECUs are locked. People can’t just reprogram them. A lot of enthusiasts attribute the recent drop in gas-powered Mustang sales to the locked ECUs.

My questions are: Do you agree with that, that the locked ECUs are behind the recent drop in gas-powered Mustang sales? Do you have a plan to let people unlock the ECUs and tune the car more easily? Thanks for answering the question. Joanna, I’m sure you’re doing a great job.

I have no idea what that question means. So–

[Laughs] I do.

I’m going to set a timer. You get a minute to answer that.

I have this debate with my son, actually, because he has an older Mustang. He didn’t buy the new one for reasons like that. I would absolutely say the drop in sales is not due to that. Actually, we’re doing really well with Mustang. I think we’re the only one left really, which we’re quite proud of. We’re investing a lot in Mustang. I think the thing people don’t get about Mustang is that it’s a global car. It’s the best-selling sports coupe in the world. We outsell Mustang outside of the US than inside the US. When I look at sales for Mustang, I look at globally. The Mustang continues to grow in some of our biggest countries like Australia and Sweden because people want a little slice of that America. Everyone wants to do a burnout.

As far as the vehicle’s tunability, I think the call-in question is outstanding. This is a real dilemma for us, and there’s no easy answer. We want people to modify their cars, but we also have to take quality and privacy really seriously. I think he was talking more about the performance of the vehicle, and over time, our approach would be to give people the option to digitally adjust their vehicle from Ford, so that we can maintain quality but still let the user have their own idea of performance. That’s different for everyone, and I think that vision will come to life in the coming years.

The aftermarket is a real opportunity, but it’s also a big challenge for us because a lot of people like to write software in the control module that controls the powertrain to get better performance. But what they don’t know, and what the user may not be aware of, is that all the reliability and the quality issues that might come up are very expensive. My daughter’s boyfriend is one of these people. He bought a brand new F-150, he’s got a supercharger on it. He recently got a bunch of error codes because he updated the ECU against Ford’s standards, and now he needs thousands of dollars of expensive repairs because the vehicle has started chewing its camshaft. It was great that he could get 650 horsepower out of his EcoBoost F-150. He didn’t think about what he was doing to the reliability of the vehicle, but we have to at Ford.

All I would say is that it’s a tough problem to solve. We always want to give customers a chance to tune their vehicles, but we actually know a lot about the reliability of the vehicle. Are we as a brand going to let our quality reputation suffer to give a person the ability to modify the vehicle? I think that’s a hard compromise for us to make.

I actually understood most of it. I want to move on to the big T in the room: the tariffs. Last quarter, you operated at a loss despite record revenue because you took $800 million in tariff charges in Q2, when tariffs were actually lower than they are now. What are your conversations like right now with the administration?

They’re very important. Ford is the most American company in terms of the quantity of vehicles we make in the US. Over 80 percent of our vehicles sold here are made here. But we also are the largest importer of parts. The discussion we’re having with the administration today covers three policy areas: tailpipe emissions, tax policy, and especially tariffs. On tariffs, the biggest issue is the $2 billion bill for our imported parts. Because we make the most in the US, we import the most parts. We have a lot of stackable tariffs. There’s fentanyl tariffs, [Section 301 tariffs] from China. We have steel and aluminum tariffs that are now over 50 percent. There are a lot of tariffs that a company like Ford gets because there are auto-specific tariffs and non-auto-specific tariffs. They all stack up. So, we have this layering of all these imported parts.

To make an F-150 affordable, there are a lot of parts we can’t make locally, like wiring looms and fasteners. There are thousands and thousands of parts that we have to import because we can’t even buy them in the US. If we did, the vehicle would be $100 to $200 a month too expensive for customers. Our discussions with Washington, D.C. are really clear: “Look, we both agree. Let’s strengthen US companies like Ford that have bet on America. We have more UAW jobs than anyone, but don’t penalize us for trying to make the vehicle affordable.”

We’ve had very productive discussions with the Department of Commerce, the president himself, and the whole administration on how to come up with a way to minimize this $2 billion bill so that we are advantaged as a company. Originally, they were thinking that there would be high tariffs for finished automotive vehicles. Fifty percent of all vehicles bought in the US are imported through a port or a rail across a border. Now, it looks like the standard tariff will be about 15 percent and 12.5 percent from Japan. That’s not a fair fight. We’re just asking for a fair fight. If you’re going to allow people to import with 15 percent tariffs, which includes their parts in the vehicle, but you put a 50, 60, 70 percent tariff on the aluminum steel that goes into our US-made vehicle, let’s work on a process for tariff relief that would allow us to do that and still make the vehicles affordable.

That’s what we’re talking about with the administration. They’re extremely open, and they’re extremely supportive of us. They’re also making a lot of policy changes on tailpipe emissions and tax. Look at the EV credits as an example. We can get to that if you want. But the tariffs are the most critical for our profitability. About 20 percent of our profit has evaporated now because of these parts tariffs. We’re highly engaged with the administration. I remain very optimistic that we will find a solution, but it is very expensive.

I wanted to ask about the EV credits because between the tariffs and the EV credits going away, it feels like this administration is on your side. Yet, you are also adding more jobs than ever to manufacturing here in the US. You’re doing the things the president wants.

Yes. I do generally believe that those three policy areas are very important. Joanna, we didn’t feel like we should get a $7,500 check on an EV to make the transition successful. We do need support for the production tax credit on batteries, so that we could be competitive with China because it has such a huge advantage, and we do need to onshore that IP to start really scaling battery manufacture. You can’t ship a battery overseas. It’s very heavy and it’s not a good shipper, which we say as a shipper.

We have gotten a lot of support from them for making batteries here in the US. The PTC credit is very important. We have changed our EV investment to not depend on the consumer tax credit from the government, and we’re fine with that. Other countries like China and in Europe do support their EV consumers. We didn’t really expect that at Ford. We’re kind of a “lift ourselves up by the bootstraps” kind of company anyway, so that was something we already did.

But the relief on fuel economy standards is a very important topic that the administration clearly has a point of view on. We want one national standard, and we want to be able to sell what customers really want. Hybrids are really popular now, and so are EVs. I think we’ll find a tailpipe emission standard that is more reasonable and sustainable and not have a bunch of states with unique standards that make logistics for cars a nightmare, since you have to send different states different emission-standard cars. And that’s really expensive for customers, too.

The real area that is super critical for Ford and for companies like Ford that are committed to the US, is tariffs, working through and making adjustments as they and bilateral trade deals get announced. We need to find a landing spot that works for companies like Ford, where it’s a level playing field from a tariff standpoint and the administration accomplishes what it wants to accomplish. We’re not there yet, and that’s why we’re working really hard. I spent a lot of time in DC, and there’s a good reason for it. This is really important for our factory workers, for the future of our country, and for the shareholders of Ford.

I want to come back to me because really this whole podcast is about me, obviously.

[Laughs] Good.

One of the main reasons I decided to get the Mach-E, other than it having good range and me loving the way it drives, was that it had Apple CarPlay. Some of your competitors have abandoned CarPlay. A lot of the newer, upstart car companies, like Rivian and Tesla, have their own software. I want to talk about this new Digital Experience you guys are working on, but I want to just cut to the chase with CarPlay. What about CarPlay Ultra? Are you considering that?

We are. We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one, but we’re very committed to Apple. I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car. We want you, Joanna, and all the customers to bring in their digital life, and make it as easy as possible. We don’t think we should restrict that to make money off the customers. We don’t want it to be a hassle. We don’t think we can design an experience that’s going to displace your phone. At the same time, there are things that Ford is working on to add on top of the Google and CarPlay digital experience, whether it’s automated systems or the way a trip gets planned, that will make it even better.

We’re highly informed by what’s going on in China right now, specifically the customer experience part. An AI assistant in the car, let’s say, is very important for Ford. We think that every customer should have an AI assistant in the car. Not just a voice to move to your phone-based AI system but something specific that you can talk to, almost like a companion. To allow everyone to bring their digital life into the car and have it seamlessly integrated is a more complicated journey for us to execute. Then, put more on top of that, whether it’s productivity software (we’re now up to 1 million Ford Pro subscriptions now), BlueCruise, how you plan a trip, or auto specific things like how your [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems] (ADAS) system works and how it integrates into your entertainment system. We believe we have to design something that works with your digital life as well.

It’s a more complicated choice, especially when you look at backcasting it into all of our past vehicles, but I believe it’s a more customer-centric approach. And you will see that, Joanna, in your next shopping trip. You’ll make that choice, we’ll all read about it. That’s our philosophy. Now, other companies have different philosophies, but we believe that our philosophy is the most customer-centric.

But it seems like with the Ford Digital Experience, which you have rolled out to some cars and is based on Android Automotive, that you’re going to have to choose. Are you going to do this Android Automotive experience with the things you’re talking about building on top, or are you going to pick a CarPlay Ultra experience and go all on Apple?

I see what you mean. It’s a really good question. I don’t know where Apple’s going to go. I think Apple has to make a big decision. It’s not a Ford decision, actually. Then, we will decide based on their decision.

You mean that Apple has to make a decision, or are you going to allow this to also run in combination with other infotainment software?

Yes. Not only that, are you going to allow OEMs to control the vehicles? How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?

We’re doing that now for our Pro customers. If you’re a Pro customer, you can limit access to the vehicle on the weekend. Many of our plumbers and electricians have a company vehicle and they’re not allowed to use it on the weekend. We allow speed control now, so you can’t go above the speed limit. Is Apple going to want to do that? If Apple wants to do that, I think we’re going to have a tough time because then the Digital Experience gets really messy, and we’ll have to decide between Google and Apple, to your point.

Now, Google has two different layers. It has Google Automotive Services, which is a curated digital services experience in the car, but it also has Android Auto, which is an operating system that we can build our own experience on top of. So, Google as a platform company gives us both. Apple has a totally different approach. Again, I’ve talked to the Apple team and our team is in contact with them. I think Apple has to decide if it wants control of the entire experience inside a vehicle. If it does and it wants to follow Ultra with the Ultra 2 or whatever is next, then Ford will have to make a big decision.

I know where we would go. We believe ADAS integration with your entertainment system is so critical. In three or four years when you’re flying down the highway with your eyes off the road going 80 miles an hour on Interstate 5 and you’re watching a movie, having a ChatGPT moment, or having a wearable on, we don’t think that a system from a tech company that’s not integrated into the car is going to save your life. So we’ll have to make a choice.

It sounds to me that you’ve been forced with the reality that you’ve got to build your own.

Yes, but the good thing is that now versus when you and I last talked, Android Auto is advancing nicely. We’ve learned a lot about how to build an experience on that. I hear a lot of OEMs say, “Well, it’s about controlling the customer. I don’t want Apple to be able to...” That’s not a big deal for us. We just want it to be easy for customers. But if those companies want to control the vehicle, I think that’s a bridge too far. In that case, we have to invest a lot more in a Ford experience.

I hope that doesn’t happen, by the way. I look at what has happened with Huawei and Xiaomi in China. It’s amazing. Those companies are all in on auto. When you’re a Huawei or Xiaomi customer, you either buy a Huawei system in someone else’s brand or you buy a Xiaomi car, and it’s completely seamless. I wish our tech companies had approached the auto industry that way, but they haven’t. Now we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do.

You said something really interesting about how you want to have an AI companion in the car. I am actually spending a lot of time in the car now talking to ChatGPT. I’m not listening to Decoder. I have my iPhone, it’s coming through CarPlay, it’s Bluetooth paired, and I’ve got my ChatGPT app. I’m not looking at it, it’s safe. I just have it in voice mode and I’m driving to a meeting to meet you. I’ll say, “Tell me what I should know about Jim Farley and where he’s been in the news.” It’s a very interactive conversation, almost like I’m on the phone.

How do you think about this? Does Ford have to be a part of that relationship?

It’s a good question. I think, yes, especially for anything transportation-related. I want to go somewhere, I want to know about my car and the condition of the car. We either have to be part of the conversation or we have to supply that. Not to be arrogant because of the safety control and the vehicle control, but we actually think we can provide a chat experience that has added value beyond your non-vehicle experience. To your point, we don’t want to burden the customer with two different experiences. That would be really arrogant and really bad for the company.

I think people are starting to realize why you’ve been on this, Joanna. The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that. We have to sort this out really thoughtfully.

Now, in China, Nio has an AI companion in the car. It’s like a physical thing. It’s like a little person, and it works really well. Customers love it. If you look at China being ahead of the West in terms of integrating AI as a companion in your vehicle, early indications are that a well done companion-like functionality from the OEMcan add a lot of value to people’s lives. That’s the direction we’re going. It’s similar to not investing in Level 4 autonomy and robotaxis and putting our effort towards Level 3 automated, eyes-off driving in the AI space. It’s a similar kind of bet. Pick a few places where Ford can add value, but don’t make the customer go backwards. That’s our philosophy.

To be clear , you’re more focused on that highway driving experience right now with BlueCruise?

For sure. Our number one priority is to not be the first one to do eyes-off, Level 3highway driving, but to be the best, most reliable, and the safest, the one you want to use for you and your loved ones. We took all the Argo AI people and we gave them a choice. Do you want to do highway high speed, eyes-off automation? Push a button, watch a movie, or whatever people want to do? We could do this podcast in your car.

All of our AI deployment for autonomous driving is going there because we think that’s a cooler problem to solve for most average Americans than a robotaxi. Even though the robotaxi is a really cool problem — I love being in a Waymo — we think that highway miles are a bigger societal opportunity.

Alright, my last question. You get to play car salesman. It’s next August, I got to get rid of this Mach-E. What do I do?

Oh, you need to buy another Mach-E. We’ve improved it a lot since your last one. It’s a lot more affordable. We have some wonderful new experiences. I’m going to give you a run for your money in terms of value. It’s a really incredible product that we’ve refined over four years. The Mach-E’s we’re making now are pretty radically different from the earlier ones. We have OTA updated your car, and I know what improvements were in that. The new vehicle, the compute power onboard, the efficiency, the quality, and the improvements to the fit and finish are all material enough that I think you should test-drive one and see what we have.

There’s a reason why we just beat the revised Model Y, which is the best-selling alternative — not that you would just use that as your benchmark. I think you’re going to have a lot of fun shopping. I’m going to learn a lot as you go shopping, like the rest of America. What I would love for you to do is wait six months because I want to show you this new Universal car. You’re going to go, “Jim, I’m so glad you told me to wait.”

That’s what you can do for me. You can give me an extension on the lease. This is what you should have been doing for me. This is where I would’ve sold me. I would’ve said, “Extension on the lease, six months, we’re going to give you a good deal Joanna. You’re going to be happy.”

And bridge you to something that no one will be able to offer. You’ll go, “Oh, my god, this is so much better than anything I could buy, including the Mach-E. I’m really glad I waited.” That’s the right approach.

See, I should be working in your dealership. That’s how I would’ve sold it. Well, Jim Farley, thank you so much for spending so much time. I’ve got a ton more questions, but we’ll do this again sometime and have you back on the show.

I don’t think you’re driving a dinosaur either. I think you’re driving a fantastic automobile. I love my Mach-E. Frankly, we’re really proud to have you as the owner, and thank you for being on the podcast. I always enjoy our interaction. I can’t wait to learn more about the ChatGPT experience inside your car. I hope you don’t mind if a few of our software engineers call you.

Yeah, they should call me. Again, this is not sponsored. I have been a very happy Mach-E driver. I’ve been in it a lot this summer. We didn’t get to it, but the charging infrastructure has improved so much. I charge for 30 minutes at Electrify America, and Electrify America has gotten better. Get that CEO on here. I charge, I’m on my way. I drove 350 miles up to New Hampshire last week.

Oh good.

I’ve been happy. We’ve got some software things to deal with. We didn’t really get into that, but it sounds like you’re working on it for me.

We are. That you for the time, Joanna. All the best to you.

You too.

""This approach, if permitted, would open the floodgates to multiple competing 'settlements' among differently aligned intervenors that do not include the utility,"" FPL attorneys wrote.
FPL filed an initial rate proposal in February but scaled it back in the proposed settlement filed Aug. 20.
The counter proposal, which was filed Aug. 26, would have resulted in increases of $867 million in 2026 and $403 million in 2027.
The Office of Public Counsel and its allies said the FPL proposal could lead to cumulative increases over four years of $6.903 billion, while the counter proposal would total $5.241 billion.","Florida Power & Light on Friday fired back at a renewed request for state regulators to consider a ""counter proposal"" to a proposed settlement that would increase the utility's base electric rates.

Opponents of the proposed settlement, including the state Office of Public Counsel, which is designated by law to represent utility customers, want the Florida Public Service Commission to consider the counter proposal. Commission Chairman Mike La Rosa, on Sept. 12, denied the request, but the Office of Public Counsel and its allies are seeking reconsideration of that decision.

But in a 32-page document filed Friday, FPL argued the ""request for reconsideration collapses under even the most cursory scrutiny and falls far beneath the legal threshold required to warrant reconsideration before this commission. Moreover, even assuming… that their request met the standard required for reconsideration, which it does not, the (opponents') arguments are legally indefensible and wholly without merit.""

The sparring about the counter proposal has come as the regulatory commission prepares for the Oct. 6 start of what could be a two-week hearing on FPL's proposed four-year settlement, which it reached in August with numerous businesses and groups. The hearing will include complex financial and technical issues and likely will be contentious.

After the FPL settlement was proposed, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups last month filed a competing settlement proposal that, in part, would lead to smaller rate increases. But La Rosa, acting as a prehearing officer in the case, dismissed the counter proposal, ruling that FPL is an ""indispensable party to any settlement.""

Attorneys for the opponents on Sept. 19 filed a motion for reconsideration, saying the Florida Supreme Court has never ruled on whether a utility would have to be a party to a settlement.

""If the commission were to find that the terms of the (counter proposal) were in the public interest, and that the (counter proposal) would result in fair, just, and reasonable rates, then the commission would have just as much authority to approve it without FPL's consent or over FPL's objection,"" the motion for reconsideration said.

Also, the motion said the regulatory commission's authority to set utility rates is ""not conditioned on any party's approval or absence of objection, including FPL.""

But in the document filed Friday, FPL said ""there simply is no authority or precedent to support the proposition that the commission can resolve a contested matter by approving a settlement or stipulation that does not include the utility in question.""

""This approach, if permitted, would open the floodgates to multiple competing 'settlements' among differently aligned intervenors that do not include the utility,"" FPL attorneys wrote. ""In other words, intervenors representing endless combinations of aligned interests could settle with themselves — all in the same proceeding and without the utility — in multiple versions of 'settlements.' This approach to 'settlement' defies logic because it does not result in the resolution of a dispute between opposing parties — it merely memorializes an agreement among aligned parties.""

FPL filed an initial rate proposal in February but scaled it back in the proposed settlement filed Aug. 20. FPL reached its proposed settlement with the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Energy for Innovation Association; Americans for Affordable Clean Energy; the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy; Walmart Inc.; EVgo Services, LLC; Circle K Stores, Inc.; RaceTrac Inc.; Wawa, Inc.; Electrify America, LLC; Armstrong World Industries, Inc.; and federal government agencies.

The proposed settlement would lead to base-rate increases of $945 million in 2026 and $766 million in 2027, according to the utility. FPL also would collect additional amounts in 2028 and 2029 for solar-energy and battery-storage projects.

The counter proposal, which was filed Aug. 26, would have resulted in increases of $867 million in 2026 and $403 million in 2027. It also would have left open the possibility of FPL seeking increases of an estimated $195 million in 2028 and $174 million in 2029 for generation-related projects that could include solar and battery projects.

The Office of Public Counsel and its allies said the FPL proposal could lead to cumulative increases over four years of $6.903 billion, while the counter proposal would total $5.241 billion.

Along with the Office of Public Counsel, the counter proposal was filed by the groups Florida Rising, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Floridians Against Increased Rates.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/30/1f029fb5-e206-44ef-8986-e704d588a2de/thumbnail/1200x630/a82eb547cc0e2f9a1521316f8539601a/cbsmiami-energy-bill-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:03:10.751813

For 2025 alone, residential storage growth is forecast to reach 96% in terms of megawatts and 41% in terms of the number of installations.
Financial and Market Implications The scale of Q2 2025 installations underscores the growing importance of storage as a vital component of the U.S. energy transition.
Overall, the report underscores both the opportunities and challenges facing the U.S. storage market.
Outlook The report projects that cumulative U.S. energy storage capacity will reach 87.8 GW/261.2 GWh by 2029, with growth led by residential and utility-scale storage.","The U.S. energy storage market achieved its strongest ever quarter in the second quarter (Q2) of the financial year 2025, with total installations reaching 5.6 GW/17.8 GWh, according to the latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie.

The utility-scale segment accounted for 4.9 GW/15 GWh of this total, a 63% year-on-year increase. Texas, California, and Arizona together contributed nearly 75% of this newly installed capacity, each adding around 1.2 GW.

Oklahoma re-entered the utility-scale market with three projects totaling 170 MW, while the national project pipeline has seen some contraction, falling from 1,080 projects in 2024 to 801 in 2025, a 26% decline.

Installations for the residential storage sector increased by 8% quarter-on-quarter, with California, Arizona, and Illinois driving the majority of the growth. The rise is largely attributed to state-level policies such as California’s Net Billing Tariff, declining solar export rates, and additional state incentives in California, Arizona, and Illinois.

Higher-capacity systems are increasingly being adopted in the residential market, which is projected to outpace solar in growth due to high policy resilience, strong attachment rates in markets such as California and Puerto Rico, and continued access to the federal investment tax credit (ITC), particularly under third-party ownership models.

For 2025 alone, residential storage growth is forecast to reach 96% in terms of megawatts and 41% in terms of the number of installations.

CCI Market Gains Momentum

The community, commercial, and industrial (CCI) market posted its best second quarter since 2023, driven by commercial solar-plus-storage deployments in California under the state’s Net Energy Metering 3.0 framework.

Storage incentive programs in New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts are also contributing to steady growth, although community storage remains limited due to high development costs and policy constraints.

Massachusetts’ upcoming SMART 3.0 program is expected to provide future support, though nationwide CCI capacity is projected to remain under 1 GW by 2029.

OBBBA and Federal Policy

Federal policy developments under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) have preserved ITC benefits for most storage applications but introduced new equipment sourcing requirements that take effect after 2025.

This has led to a rush to begin project construction ahead of the restrictions, temporarily boosting forecasts according to the report. While domestic cell supply is expected to ramp up, supply chain limitations and U.S.–China trade barriers are likely to create challenges.

Distributed storage remains highly sensitive to OBBBA impacts, with the CCI sector potentially benefiting from reduced solar incentives, which could lead to an increase in solar-plus-storage installations. However, growth is expected to remain slow. For residential storage, the decline in solar incentives may accelerate the adoption of virtual power plants and third-party ownership models.

Low Case Forecast and Risks

The low-case scenario forecasts a potential reduction of 16.5 GW, or 19%, in cumulative installations between 2025 and 2029, driven by risks including supply shortages compliant with the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rule, sustained trade barriers with China, and delays in federal land permitting for renewable projects.

In this downside case, utility-scale projects would be most affected, particularly those not safe-harbored in 2025. Residential forecasts would be constrained by uncertainty around FEOC-compliant supply and potential restrictions on third-party ownership qualification for the ITC.

The CCI sector would face further headwinds if the rollout of Massachusetts’ SMART 3.0 program is slow, and costs remain high.

However, the report notes that the final version of OBBBA was less restrictive than the House bill, which had proposed a 60-day construction start window and a 2028 in-service deadline to qualify for the ITC.

As a result, the low-case outlook was raised by 23% quarter-on-quarter compared to the earlier baseline, which had assumed the stricter House version would pass.

Beyond the 2025–2029 outlook period, downside risks remain if gas supply chain bottlenecks ease and permitting restrictions increase for solar and storage projects. These conditions could slow the pace of deployment in the longer term.

Financial and Market Implications

The scale of Q2 2025 installations underscores the growing importance of storage as a vital component of the U.S. energy transition. With 7.6 GW installed in the first half of 2025, the year is expected to set a new annual record for storage deployment.

While policy and supply chain challenges persist, particularly in terms of equipment sourcing requirements and federal permitting, the resilience of the residential market and the dominance of leading states such as California, Texas, and Arizona position the U.S. storage sector for continued growth.

The utility-scale market remains vulnerable to policy and trade uncertainty; however, the extension of the ITC provides a foundation for sustained development over the next decade.

Residential and distributed storage are increasingly adapting through models such as virtual power plants and third-party ownership, ensuring continued deployment even as solar incentives decline.

The CCI segment, though lagging, is likely to see incremental growth supported by state-level incentive programs and the eventual rollout of SMART 3.0 in Massachusetts.

Overall, the report underscores both the opportunities and challenges facing the U.S. storage market. Strong near-term growth is balanced by risks of supply shortages and policy headwinds, but the cumulative capacity of nearly 88 GW by 2029 remains achievable under the base case.

Outlook

The report projects that cumulative U.S. energy storage capacity will reach 87.8 GW/261.2 GWh by 2029, with growth led by residential and utility-scale storage. Utility-scale capacity is forecast to reach 72 GW/259 GWh by 2029 despite a projected 10% year-on-year decline in 2027.

After 2025, which is expected to remain the record year for utility-scale installations, annual deployments are not expected to reach similar levels until 2029. Federal policy will continue to be a significant factor in shaping the outlook.

While the ITC has been extended through 2033, new equipment sourcing requirements and continued uncertainty in global trade are expected to slow growth. The strongest markets for utility-scale deployment will continue to be California, Texas, and other states with favorable storage policies, coupled with high load growth.

The residential segment is expected to remain the most resilient, with growth supported by virtual power plant models and third-party ownership structures, even as solar incentives decline.

The CCI segment is forecasted to experience gradual growth, although the sector will face challenges from high costs and slower transitions to programs that reduce support for solar projects.

The U.S. energy storage market added more than 2 GW across all segments in the first quarter of 2025, marking the highest Q1 on record, according to U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-06-18T121458.313.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:18.195372

This move continues the company’s path to delivering affordable fusion energy, following 50 years of applied innovation at U.S. National Laboratories in New Mexico and California.
“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, Co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion.
Pacific Fusion will receive these incentives as it meets its commitments to create new jobs and make significant capital investments.
The Pacific Fusion headquarters, including three research and development campuses, will remain in California.","Pacific Fusion has selected Albuquerque, New Mexico as the site for its first research and manufacturing campus. The company plans to build the $1 billion campus at Mesa del Sol and expects to create more than 200 high-wage jobs and hundreds of construction jobs. This move continues the company’s path to delivering affordable fusion energy, following 50 years of applied innovation at U.S. National Laboratories in New Mexico and California.

“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, Co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion. “Working alongside the City of Albuquerque, the Governor’s office, and the state’s economic development leaders, we’ve built true partnerships that give us confidence we can move quickly to deliver on the promise of low-cost fusion power.”

Supporting the project is legislation signed by Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller on September 26, 2025 authorizing the performance-based incentives that include: $10 million in Local Economic Development Act funds; $9 million from the State; and $1 million from the City, as well as $776 million in City-issued Industrial Revenue Bonds, abating property taxes over 20 years. Pacific Fusion will receive these incentives as it meets its commitments to create new jobs and make significant capital investments.

“After years of working to build Albuquerque as a hub for energy technology innovation, Pacific Fusion joins a growing number of companies that are choosing our city to literally ‘power’ our future,” said Mayor Keller. “Today is proof of the assertion that we have passed a turning point — that our city is not only on the map, but can define the next chapter of clean energy innovation.”

The Albuquerque campus will house Pacific Fusion’s Demonstration System, with the goal of achieving net facility gain, producing more energy from a fusion reaction than the total energy used, by 2030. Pacific Fusion’s decision builds on New Mexico’s long history of energy innovation and decades of research at Sandia National Laboratories, while adding to the city’s growing clean-tech ecosystem.

“Pacific Fusion’s decision to build in Albuquerque proves our city is ready to lead in the industries of the future,” said the City of Albuquerque Economic Development Director Max Gruner. “This project will bring good jobs, drive innovation, and anchor a clean-energy ecosystem that benefits our entire community.”

Stated the company: “Our Albuquerque campus will build on New Mexico’s legacy in applied physics, including decades of foundational research at Sandia National Laboratories. The state’s expertise in advanced energy technologies, workforce that aligns with our future hiring needs, and capital-efficient environment for large projects make it a natural choice for Pacific Fusion’s strategic expansion.”

Construction on the new Mesa del Sol facility is scheduled to begin in 2026, with manufacturing operations launching before the end of the year.

The Pacific Fusion headquarters, including three research and development campuses, will remain in California.

The methodology this year changed to split energy infrastructure into “energy availability” and “energy cost.” The report says this best analyzes the “unique challenges posed by the modern grid.”

“We also continue to elevate the importance of water access, permitting speed, and site readiness – all increasingly make-or-break factors in large capital investment decisions,” Area Development said. “The states that perform well aren’t just ‘pro business.’ They’re aligned.”

Across 15 categories judged, South Carolina netted first place in business incentives programs; overall cost of doing business; and site readiness programs. It was second in availability of sites; cooperative local and state government; and favorable regulatory framework.

The state didn’t make the top 10 for climate risk and resilience and water availability.

The other categories judged are access to qualified labor; corporate tax structure; energy availability; energy cost; favorable property tax; logistics and infrastructure; and workforce training programs.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/south-carolina-state-house-2024.webp?resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-29 11:03:37.853614

The words on the DOE list are at the heart of EERE’s mission: It is the government’s largest investor in technologies that help reduce heat-trapping emissions that cause climate change as well as the hazardous pollution from fossil fuels. It is the latest in a series of Trump administration efforts to dispute, silence or downplay the realities of climate change.

“Please ensure that every member of your team is aware that this is the latest list of words to avoid — and continue to be conscientious about avoiding any terminology that you know to be misaligned with the Administration’s perspectives and priorities,” the directive from acting director of external affairs Rachel Overbey said.

Those instructions apply to both public-facing and internal communications and cover documents such as requests for information for federal funding opportunities, reports and briefings.

In addition to “climate change” and “green,” EERE forbid officials from using “emissions” to avoid the implication that they are a negative. Climate change is caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions, which is driven primarily by burning oil, coal and natural gas for energy.

Other terms officials must ditch include “energy transition,” “sustainability/sustainable,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “Carbon/CO2 ‘Footprint’” and “Tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies.”

DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new policies come days after President Donald Trump excoriated world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly for pursuing actions to confront rising emissions.

“I’ve been right about everything and I’m telling you that if you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” he said during his Tuesday speech.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has also sought to impugn climate science by touting a report he commissioned that downplayed the role rising emissions have had in worsening weather extremes. He has endorsed some of the report’s most controversial findings, such as claiming the potential benefits of a warmer planet are undervalued.

DOE has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s efforts to quash renewable energy subsidies and incentives. Last week, Wright canceled $13 billion of funding for renewable energy projects and took shots at wind and solar incentives that the Republican megalaw will quickly sunset after more than three decades of existence.

By Roberto Hugo González

Westlake, Texas — September 2025- Governor Greg Abbott highlighted Texas’ expanding economic influence during the Texas Economic Development Corporation (TxEDC) Investor Summit, held at Hillwood’s Circle T Ranch in Westlake and hosted by Ross Perot, Jr. Themed “Texas Takeover: America’s New Financial Hub,” the summit convened more than 200 business leaders, investors, and officials from across the state and the nation.

In a fireside chat moderated by Glenn Hamer, President and CEO of the Texas Association of Business, Abbott pointed to the advantages driving Texas’ economy. These include a “booming, diversified economy anchored by technology, energy, and manufacturing,” a “young, skilled, and diverse workforce ready to power growth,” and what he described as a “predictable regulatory climate and no state income tax that gives Texas an edge over coastal competitors.”

“We’re cutting red tape and keeping government out of the way so both small businesses and large investors can thrive here in Texas,” Abbott said, according to the Governor’s Office. “The future of finance is no longer limited to New York or California—Texas is leading the way.”

The governor emphasized the Dallas–Fort Worth region’s emergence as a financial hub, highlighting expansions by Nasdaq, NYSE, and multiple Fortune 500 relocations. He was joined on stage by Arun Agarwal, Chair of the TxEDC Board of Directors, and Aaron Demerson, President and CEO of TxEDC, who both underscored the summit’s role in advancing Texas’ global competitiveness.

The program featured panels on venture capital, private equity, and banking, as well as networking opportunities for institutional investors. TxEDC also introduced its new Investor Guide, a resource designed for businesses evaluating expansion or relocation to the state of Texas.

The summit reinforced Texas’ goal of becoming a premier financial center in addition to its traditional leadership in energy, aerospace, and technology.

Economic development leaders from across the Rio Grande Valley also attended. Teclo Garcia, CEO of the Mission Economic Development Office, praised the event: “Thank you, Governor Greg Abbott and your economic development & tourism team, for hosting an outstanding Texas Economic Development Corporation Investor Summit and for delivering a strong message of competitiveness and Texas leadership in innovation and business as we advance.”

Garcia added that it was an opportunity to reconnect with state leaders and colleagues. “It was good to catch up with TxEDC Board of Directors Chairman Arun Agarwal, TxEDC President & CEO Aaron Demerson, Adriana Cruz, Executive Director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development and Tourism, and good RGV friend Fernanda S., an industry specialist within the ED&T office, as well as Dr. Valerie G. Segovia. Excellent work on the dynamic meeting and for all the leadership.”

Garcia also noted the participation of other Rio Grande Valley representatives, including Adam Gonzalez and Dalith Cantu, Industrial Development Executive at Cil Commodities Integrated Logistics.

“I am grateful to Ross Perot Jr. for hosting the 200+ leaders from around the state at the beautiful Circle T Ranch,” Garcia said. “Texas is on the right road for economic development.”",https://texasborderbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MEDC-Abbott.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 12:09:52.148389

Months later, one of Newsom’s top energy regulators was dispatched on a plane to America’s petroleum heartland, on a mission to placate the oil companies threatening to flee California.

Newsom, a Democrat in his second and final term, is making a remarkable shift in his approach after leading a yearslong crusade against fossil fuels - which may have ended up being more successful than he intended. California, often home to the country’s highest gasoline prices, is now staring down a potential energy crisis as the industry pulls up stakes.

Chevron Corp. moved its headquarters out of the Golden State, refineries are closing, a key oil pipeline is hemorrhaging money and Republicans are warning that gasoline prices could soon top $8 a gallon ($2.11 per liter).

Newsom has disputed that estimate, but says it’s a top priority to bring down gasoline prices for Californians. The focus comes amid growing speculation that he’s gearing up for a presidential run in 2028.

The cost of living is a top issue for Americans, and steep fuel prices in California have been central to critics’ attacks on Newsom. President Donald Trump has highlighted the issue, there are billboards dotting California highways blaming Newsom and opponents took out a full-page newspaper ad mocking “Gavin’s Gas Station” where prices are “$2 higher than the other guys.”

“Newsom owns this gas crisis,” Brian W. Jones, the Republican leader in the state Senate, said in a statement. “His policies have made it nearly impossible for California refineries to stay open.”

Now Newsom has approved the biggest streamlining of oil permitting the state has seen in decades, enraging environmentalists who say he’s taking a page from Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” play book. His regulators spent months working closely with the industry to come up with avenues to deregulate and increase profits. Lawmakers even discussed giving Texas-based Valero Energy Corp. hundreds of millions of dollars to keep its San Francisco Bay area refinery open.

“This is not an ideological endeavor,” Newsom told journalists this month, applauding the oil drilling legislation, which was part of a larger package of bills seeking to stabilize the state’s energy markets. “We’re in the practical application businesses.”

More oil drilling will allow California to reduce price spikes at the pump while marching forward with a years-long transition away from fossil fuels, his office said. And Newsom’s pivot is only a partial win for the industry. The governor also approved tighter regulations on offshore drilling that will hamper efforts to restart a controversial pipeline north of Santa Barbara. A carbon trading program will force polluters to pay billions of dollars for greenhouse gas emissions over two decades.

As Newsom works to raise his national profile, he has sought to project a more open stance, hosting conservative guests including Stephen Bannon and the late Charlie Kirk on his podcast. He highlights his sense of humor with social-media posts that mimic Trump’s style. How Newsom handles the energy crisis will weigh heavily on Californian’s pocketbooks, but also on his prospects for higher office.

“He has called for the end of an industry that is completely vital in our state,” said Congressman Vince Fong, a Republican who represents oil production hubs in California’s Kern County. “And he is begrudgingly acknowledging the fact that he needs their input.”

California has long been controlled by Democrats and long had some of the country’s most expensive gasoline prices, currently averaging about $4.47 a gallon, more than $1 above the US mean. California fuel prices are inflated by environmental fees and taxes, a requirement for a unique fuel blend that cuts air pollution and dwindling in-state supply.

The current crisis has its roots in attempts to keep prices in check. In 2023 and 2024, Newson signed measures that sought to establish a maximum profit margin for refiners and required that they keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to mitigate the impact of any disruptions.

Two days after Newsom signed the bill on inventories in October 2024, Phillips 66 announced it would close its more-than-century-old Los Angeles refinery by the end of 2025, removing over 139,000 barrels a day of fuel from a market whose top politicians and energy regulator were busy trying to shore up supply.

In April, Valero announced it planned to close its 145,000-barrel-a-day Benicia refinery - about 35 miles (56 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco - by April 2026. The company cited, in part, an $82 million penalty that local and state environmental regulators imposed in 2024 for violations related to cancer-causing emissions that went unreported.

The state’s largest inland oil pipeline, operated by Crimson Midstream LLC, is losing $2 million a month and could close this year as demand for oil from the few remaining Bay Area refiners slows to a trickle.

Meanwhile, gasoline imports are expected to replace the shuttered refinery output, but the industry has warned it isn’t ready for new emissions regulations at ports.

There is a “new or renewed understanding that all this is intertwined,” Jas Sajjan, the head of government affairs at oil driller California Resources Corp., said in an interview.

Crude capacity

All together, almost one-fifth of the state’s crude-processing capacity is set to vanish in the coming year. Many in California’s fuel industry say it was the Valero announcement that finally got lawmakers’ attention.

“We have a crisis on our hands that may have been self-created,” Democratic Senator David Alvarez said in a May hearing with the California Energy Commission, a powerful state body that sets standards for the industry.

As the risks became apparent, Newsom backed off his attacks on the industry. In April, he sent a letter to the commission, instructing Vice Chair Siva Gunda to work with refiners to ensure affordable and reliable fuel supplies. And regulators began meeting with the oil industry, alongside labor unions and environmental groups, in closed-door sessions to hash out a path forward, according to people who attended the meetings.

The administration has a “firm belief” that refiners “can profitably operate in California - a market where demand for gasoline will still exist for years to come,” Newsom said in the letter.

Two months later, much of the industry’s wishes were incorporated into a 24-page proposal to stabilize California’s fuel markets. The California Energy Commission said Newsom shouldn’t move forward with the profit cap on oil refineries. Gunda also said California should increase fuel imports to make up for refinery closures and stabilize in-state oil production, especially in the once prolific Kern County oil basin.

It came after Gunda made several trips to San Antonio and Houston to meet with officials from Valero and Phillips 66. The companies made it clear that they were focused on profits. Environmental laws weighed on their margins and they were concerned that in-state oil producers would be underpriced by imported oil not subject to the state’s strict environmental regulations, the California Energy Commission said.

Among environmental groups, there was surprise at how receptive lawmakers were to pocketbook arguments being made by the industry. “Fear mongering around price shocks sent legislators scrambling,” said Faraz Rizvi, policy and campaign manager for the Asian Pacific Environmental Network. Oil lobbyists and refiners “smelled blood in the water,” Rizvi said.

California’s looming oil crisis is most apparent in Benicia. Hugging San Francisco Bay, the small town has been home to an oil refinery for more than 50 years. If Valero goes through with plans to shutter its site, it could wipe out 10% of the city’s annual tax revenue.

“I was thinking this is something we would be dealing with in 2035, not 2025,” said City Manager Mario Giuliani, who is planning for budget cuts next year. The town, he said, is a small window into the energy crisis that could soon face the entire state.

Benicia, with the help of the Valero refinery that was once owned by Exxon, has flourished with healthy tax revenues, Giuliani said. In the shadow of the refinery, Benicia grew into an affluent suburb with an attractive waterfront and small-town feel.

But change is coming soon. The town has already stopped paying for July 4 fireworks and an annual Christmas tree lighting due to budgetary constraints. Next year, cuts will be far more severe without Valero, the single largest taxpayer. “It provided that economic blanket to remain a small community,” Giuliani said. “Well, now that is gone.”

A last-minute attempt by lawmakers to pay Valero hundreds of million of dollars to keep the refinery open hasn’t materialized, and the state has six months before the company cuts off a key source of supply to Northern California.

The new reality in California, and Newsom’s pivot, may also usher in an era in which Democrats will seek to work with the oil and gas industry instead of taking an outright hostile stance.

Henry Stern, a Democratic state senator who has championed environmental causes, acknowledged that there’s now an appetite among a diverse range of Democrats for more oil drilling in California, alongside more aggressive climate action.

“It’s strange for me to be talking this way sometimes,” he added.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/29/PDTN/86418668007-newsombg-mojwzj-3-ozjdkjd-4-cabuh-44-shsy.jpg?crop=3996,2251,x0,y290&width=3200&height=1803&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-29 12:08:22.366741

One year after Meta began data center operations at its new campus in Montgomery, Alabama, the tech giant is heading back into the city to expand the site. Last week, Meta announced a $700 million investment would introduce two new facilities and 100 new direct jobs. This move would bring the campus to a total of 1.3 million sq. ft. once complete. Energy used at the site will be matched with 100% renewable energy, in addition to new renewable energy projects that will bring 227 megawatts to Alabama’s electricity grid. “Montgomery has proven to be a perfect home for our data center, and we are excited to be expanding,” the company said in its announcement. Before the end of the year Meta plans to launch its Data Center Community Action Grants program in the region. This annual program will provide funding for technology-focused projects that enhance the community and boost local STEAM education, building upon the company’s partnerships with the Montgomery Public Schools system and non-profit organizations for skills building initiatives.

A FAVORABLE BUSINESS CLIMATE CAPTURES ELI LILLY

In order to boost Eli Lilly and Company’s small molecule drug production pipeline, the manufacturer is heading to Houston, Texas, with a $6.5 billion project investment. This is the second facility to come of the company’s $27 billion commitment to four new U.S. manufacturing sites. The location at Generation Park was said to be chosen based on local incentives, access to utilities, transportation and its overall business environment. Notably, the new Houston plant is among a few sites chosen to manufacture Eli Lilly’s first oral, small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist, known as orforglipron, which will be submitted to global regulatory agencies by the end of 2026. “Our new Houston site will enhance Lilly’s ability to manufacture orforglipron at scale and, if approved, help fulfill the medicine’s potential as a metabolic health treatment for tens of millions of people worldwide who prefer the ease of a pill that can be taken without food and water restrictions,” said Eli Lilly Chair and CEO David A. Ricks. “This significant U.S. investment and onshoring of our API production capabilities will ensure faster, more secure access to orforglipron and to other life-changing medicines of the future.” Anticipated to be complete by 2030, the investment will create 615 new jobs in the region.

TERMINAL INVESTMENT DIVES DEEP IN SPAIN

A $165.6 million expansion initiative will soon boost APM Terminals’ annual capacity to 1.23 million twenty-foot equivalent units at the Port of Barcelona in Spain. Over the next three years, the Netherlands-based logistics company will pursue modernization and expansion that will not only scale the Port’s activity but also target its decarbonization goals via a new Offshore Power Supply system that provides docked ships access to power supply through the local grid. The move will cut emissions while improving environmental performance at the port. “[The modernization is] a strategic milestone for APM Terminals and reaffirms our firm commitment to the port development of Barcelona and to the sustainable growth of Spain as a key logistics hub in Europe,” said APM Terminals Spanish Gateways Managing Director Julián Fernández. The expansion phase of the project details reinforcing the South Quay berths; replacing rails for new Ship-to-Shore cranes; updating infrastructure to support up to 15-meter (49-ft.) drafts; and ensuring the terminal can handle two mega-container ships at once.

“For a variety of reasons, [nuclear power] has priced itself out of the market as the market used to exist.
I think a lot of large users of electricity are recalculating whether or not they want to place very large, one-time bets for a huge increment of power in the form of nuclear,” Gore said.
“And I think you’re going to see some resurgence of nuclear power.” Eager to discuss nuclear: Harder writes that Gore “was eager to dive deeper into nuclear power in our conversation.
Still, doubts: According to Harder, Gore expressed some reservations about nuclear.","Demand from data centers: Amy Harder, the national energy correspondent for Axios, writes that Gore said the “surge in demand for electricity is causing some reanalysis of what role nuclear might play when you have large, wealthy, consumer-facing businesses that need enormous amounts of new power,"" likely referring to such businesses as Meta’s AI data centers.

Gore indicated during his interview with Harder that this new demand may help reverse a problem that has halted the growth of the nuclear energy industry over the past few decades—namely, high costs. “For a variety of reasons, [nuclear power] has priced itself out of the market as the market used to exist. Now the market is different. . . . I think a lot of large users of electricity are recalculating whether or not they want to place very large, one-time bets for a huge increment of power in the form of nuclear,” Gore said. “And I think you’re going to see some resurgence of nuclear power.”

Eager to discuss nuclear: Harder writes that Gore “was eager to dive deeper into nuclear power in our conversation. Unprompted, he sought to address various concerns about it.”

Of used fuel Gore told Harder, “I think that the waste can be stored safely.” He also touched on nonproliferation during the interview, saying, “I think the terrorism threats are real, but they’re shared by a lot of other kinds of facilities around the world. . . . The proliferation issues are very real and have to be attended to with extreme care, safety of operation.” I think we can handle that. I really do.

Still, doubts: According to Harder, Gore expressed some reservations about nuclear. “The cost issue is the one that’s really a barrier to the expansion of nuclear,” he said.

Regard small modular reactors, Gore wasn’t sure how big of a role they would play in a nuclear resurgence “due to their price tag.” He said, “Some of the most responsible policy analysts that I respect are now shifting back away from SMRs as maybe a technological dead end again.”",https://cdn.ans.org/i/favicon-128.png,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:21.739147
,Louisiana American Energy ,2025-09-29 14:20:47+00:00,Mississippi Today,Louisiana's power upgrade for Meta project raises questions about who should pay,"Emily Wagster Pettus, Associated Press",,,,,https://mississippitoday.org/2025/09/29/louisiana-power-upgrade-meta-who-should-foot-the-bill/,"Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build.

New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users.
Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

The colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, about 50 miles west of Vicksburg, Mississippi. But not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a “kill switch” law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Cool factor: Oregon Trail Solar represents the second recent renewable energy PPA between Avangrid and Amazon in the Pacific Northwest, adding to a previously announced deal for power from the Leaning Juniper IIA repower project, also located in Gilliam County. Avangrid and Amazon have agreements to generate power from several renewable energy projects in Illinois, Ohio and North Carolina as well.

Construction of Oregon Trail is expected to generate 200 jobs, mostly filled by local union labor. It will use over 100,000 solar panels and produce the same amount of electricity used by about 10,000 U.S. homes each year. Operations at Oregon Trail will also support several new full-time jobs in the community. Over its lifetime, Avangrid expects the project to contribute $6 million in combined PILOTs (payment in lieu of taxes), as well as property taxes for Gilliam County which will support a variety of public services, including schools and infrastructure.

Oregon Trail will add to Avangrid’s longstanding presence in the state, with its oldest project dating back to 2001. Today, the company operates 2.5 GW of capacity in Oregon. Avangrid also maintains its National Training Center in neighboring Sherman County and a large corporate office in Portland.

Lightstar Renewables launches New York’s first agrivoltaics project

Lightstar Renewables LLC hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the groundbreaking for Plains Road agrivoltaics project Montgomery, New York. The commissioning event was held at the DiMartino Farm, drawing attendance from state officials, agricultural leaders, and local media, and other local faming families. Representing Assembly Member Brian Maher, whose legislative support was instrumental in the project’s development, was his chief of staff, Meghan Hurlburt. She stood alongside representatives from American Farmland Trust (AFT) and Iain Ward, farmer, founder, and CEO of Solar Agricultural Services Inc. (SolAg).

“Today marks a turning point for sustainable development in New York,” Maher said in a statement. “The Plains Road project demonstrates how we can honor our agricultural heritage while meeting our clean energy goals. This is the kind of innovative thinking we need to build a resilient future for rural communities.”

Cool factor: The Plains Road project marks New York’s first agrivoltaics installation. The ribbon-cutting ceremony highlighted the unique design features that allow hay planting and harvesting equipment to operate seamlessly around the solar facility. The project will also add two acres of vegetable production, providing opportunities for new entry farmers while generating enough clean energy to power 466 homes annually.

Ever.green uses RECs to support 28 MW solar project in South Carolina

Ever.green partnered with Wells Fargo through a long-term purchase of High-Impact RECs to support a 28 MW solar project in Lee County, South Carolina. The deal displays how corporate energy buyers can accelerate the deployment of new renewable energy projects. The solar installation, developed by Headwater Energy, will generate approximately 50,000 MWh of electricity annually.

“High-Impact RECs are making it easier for companies to directly support new, impactful projects,” said Cris Eugster, CEO of Ever.green. “This project is a powerful example of how forward-thinking buyers can accelerate the energy transition while advancing grid resilience.”

Cool factor: Ever.green’s High-Impact RECs are renewable energy certificates sourced from yet-built clean energy projects via long-term, fixed-price forward contracts that are material to the project’s finance-ability. Projects are selected for their ability to maximize climate impact, minimize environmental harm, and deliver social benefits.

The Bishopville project uses low-carbon, domestically manufactured solar panels, helping to create new U.S. manufacturing jobs while strengthening the domestic energy supply chain. The panels use thin-film technology, which performs well in hot and humid climates, and they are both sustainably constructed and designed to be recycled at their end-of-life. A comprehensive environmental assessment of the project ensured compliance with biodiversity and land use protections, including the safeguarding of wetlands and floodplains through best management practices. Non-reflective panels and habitat preservation efforts have helped minimize impacts on 12 migratory bird species. At the end of its useful life, the site will be fully restored with native vegetation to preserve local ecosystems.

OCI Energy, ING finalize construction financing for battery project in Texas

OCI Energy has closed on the construction financing for its Project Alamo City, a flagship BESS installation under development in Bexar County, Texas. OCI Energy selected ING to underwrite the construction financing package which includes a construction-to-term loan, a tax equity bridge loan, and letters of credit. ING served as sole coordinating lead arranger, sole bookrunner, and sole green loan coordinator, and will also act as administrative agent. The relationship between ING and OCI Energy has proven instrumental in advancing the project from concept to construction.

“This project not only advances the deployment of cutting-edge battery storage technology in Texas, but also demonstrates the power of collaborative, innovative financing to accelerate the energy transition,” said Sven Wellock, head of renewables and power, Americas, ING.

Pennsylvania’s target of sourcing 18% of its electricity from renewables by 2025 underscores the importance of these projects, which will contribute directly to the state’s clean energy goals.

The company has developed or acquired more than 600 renewable energy projects across 26 states in pursuit of a more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy future.

Nexus secures $220 million, energy offtaker for Project Goody

Nexus Renewable Power LLC has closed on a series of transactions that together represent approximately $220 million of project funding for MRG Goody Solar and Storage (Project Goody), a 171.72 MWac solar project combined with a 237 MWh storage project located in Lamar County, Texas.

Goldman Sachs is making a preferred equity investment into Project Goody to support the hybrid tax equity financing. Nexus also executed a tax credit purchase agreement with respect to Project Goody. Meta is the power offtaker for the project, which will help match its data center electricity use with clean and renewable energy. This aggregate financing complements the previously announced $300 million construction-to-permanent financing facility with HPS Investment Partners, and the $100 million Nexus-Bad Carbon carbon credit financing joint venture.

Cool factor: Project Goody is named after, and honors the service of, Michael R. “Goody” Goodboe who died on Nov. 24, 2020, from injuries sustained while serving his country overseas. He was a highly decorated Navy SEAL and served his country with distinction in multiple theaters including Iraq, Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, and Africa. He is remembered for his warrior spirit, sense of humor, and high standards for himself and his comrades.

Project Goody is currently under construction, with a scheduled commercial operation date in the fourth quarter of 2025. It is the first in a series of projects being developed and constructed by Nexus. The project will provide employment opportunities and economic benefits to Lamar County, creating hundreds of construction jobs and contributing millions in long-term tax revenue to support the local school district and the community at large.

Verogy begins construction on sixth SCEF solar project in Connecticut

Connecticut-based developer Verogy has started construction on its sixth project under the state’s Shared Clean Energy Facility (SCEF) program in 2025. These projects, totaling more than 30 MW of renewable energy, enable Verogy to advance equal access to solar power and drive meaningful economic impact across Connecticut.

As part of its commitment to using domestically sourced materials and power generation technologies, Verogy continues to partner with Arizona-headquartered First Solar Inc. to supply its modules.

Cool factor: The SCEF program, overseen by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA), was designed to expand access to solar power, particularly for low- to moderate-income (LMI) households. Participating residents can subscribe to a portion of the electricity generated by a SCEF project and receive credits on their electricity bills, which results in long-term savings without installing any equipment on their own property.

“Verogy is committed to ensuring the benefits of renewable energy are felt across all communities, not just those with access to on-site solar,” said William Herchel, CEO of Verogy. “The SCEF program makes it possible for more Connecticut consumers than ever to participate in and benefit from the solar economy.”

Upon completion of these six SCEF projects, Verogy anticipates delivering enough clean energy to power more than 3,600 average homes every year. In addition, these projects will generate an estimated $975,000 in annual savings for LMI households and other utility customers for the next 20 years.

“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club.
The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said.
Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said.
“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said.","TOPEKA — Big utility companies nationwide lost ground this year in their plans to meet minimum climate targets, and Kansas’ Evergy received an F for a “multi-year backslide” from renewable investments, a Sierra Club report said.

Evergy received 9 points out of 100 this year, dropping from 12 last year. The company earned a spotlight because of its move toward delaying the closure of a coal-burning plant and plans to build new gas-burning plants, the Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges report said.

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035 and transition to clean energy through 2035, a press release said.

“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club. “The average score was 15. The purpose of the report was to inspire utilities to move us forward towards a livable future. We didn’t expect to see it go backwards.”

Gorman said Evergy’s decisions about natural gas plants and delaying closure of coal plants is part of a national trend. The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said.

Planning for a clean energy transition requires that utilities shift to running everything off of clean electricity, he said.

“There’s a good reason to increase load, but that’s at a steady pace that brings a lot of other benefits to the economy, to jobs, to ratepayers,” he said.

Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said. The Kansas Sierra Club was part of the work at the Kansas Corporation Commission recently to determine how utilities like Evergy should make sure costs associated with new customers, like data centers, aren’t borne by other customers, he said.

“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said. “I’d say that Evergy customers need to hold these large loads, these data centers, accountable to keep our bills low and lower our pollution by demanding that they use renewable energy.”

Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman, said the company is delaying its expectations of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.

“The reasons for this include growing demand growth because of the record economic growth in our service area and the need for new dispatchable generation, which is generation that can be turned on and off when our customers need it,” Penzig said. “The only sources of that would be natural gas, coal and potentially nuclear.”

Evergy announced last week that it is partnering with TerraPower to explore the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in Kansas, using advanced technology designed by TerraPower.

Penzig said Sierra Club has a narrow mission of retiring all fossil-fuel generation as soon as possible.

“At Evergy, we have to first ensure that it’s reliable, so it’s there when our customers need it. And what is the least cost combination of resources that we can use to get there,” she said. “If you look at our long-term plan, it has a considerable amount of renewables also being added to serve customers. The only reason we can do that is by combining it with traditional energy sources so that we can ensure we have reliable service.”

Penzig said the new generation of natural gas plants has advanced technology that makes them more efficient and cleaner than older plants.

Gorman said focusing on decreasing fossil fuel use is critical because of the effects of the climate crisis.

“We see them all across the country, the extreme weather, extreme heat, extreme cold,” he said. “They’re causing utility infrastructure to fall apart, especially gas and fossil fuel infrastructure. In response, these utilities in order to increase their profits are doubling down on that same gas and coal infrastructure that’s the most expensive.”

Gorman said it’s clear the utilities are going in the wrong direction.

“(Evergy CEO) David Campbell is taking Evergy backwards, trying to increase fossil fuel product pollution and shareholder profits by spending as much as they can on expensive fossil fuel infrastructure, as much as the Kansas Corporation Commission will allow them to,” he said. That’s making our climate crisis worse. It’s making our bills higher, and it’s making our health worse.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Evergy-Lawrence-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:01:59.196582

Clean energy projects are great for the economy.
On top of that, the proliferation of clean energy sources can attract businesses.
According to Sustainable Views, a recent survey of nearly 1,500 business leaders from 15 countries showed that the majority would be willing to move business operations to a country with a higher adoption of clean energy.
The Redditor believes clean energy regulations — not lower labor costs and reduced operating costs — drive companies to move operations overseas, resulting in lost jobs and a worse economy.","A Reddit user took to the r/unpopularopinion forum and did exactly what it calls for: They posted an unpopular opinion. This particular opinion was chock-full of misinformation about clean energy and the economy, and commenters were quick to point that out.

Clean energy projects are great for the economy. They create jobs in multiple industries. Besides employment created in a given area directly associated with the necessary construction, the demand for equipment, components, and services creates additional employment down the supply chain. The ripple effect continues, as the wages earned are then spent in local economies.

On top of that, the proliferation of clean energy sources can attract businesses. According to Sustainable Views, a recent survey of nearly 1,500 business leaders from 15 countries showed that the majority would be willing to move business operations to a country with a higher adoption of clean energy.

A healthier population due to the reduction in pollution caused by dirty energy generation can also lead to huge economic savings. According to Yale Climate Connections, cleaner air and the resulting better public health will save the U.S. economy an estimated $118-200 billion between now and 2030.

The misinformed opinions shared by this Redditor said otherwise.

The Redditor believes clean energy regulations — not lower labor costs and reduced operating costs — drive companies to move operations overseas, resulting in lost jobs and a worse economy. They also believe this ends up in more planet-overheating pollution being released into the environment.

As mentioned above, commenters were quick to correct the original poster.

""Sounds like you have no clue at all about any of this,"" one person commented.

Another added: ""Your fear is not supported by reality.""

Another commenter debunked much of the general premise of the original post by mentioning that the U.S. had been sending jobs overseas long before the clean energy push started.

""American industry has been sending good manufacturing jobs to China and elsewhere for a half century,"" the commenter said. ""Singling out green tech is a bad faith argument.""

One commenter pleaded with the original poster to educate themselves on this, posting: ""Please spend a few minutes researching this … The premise that the transition to green energy is causing more problems than it's solving is nonsense.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/clean-energy-regulationsimage-recY7eCzOgl1iWZ0L.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:02:05.087152

Energy Vault’s Calistoga Resiliency Centre comes online, company secures US$50 million

In other news from Energy Vault, the company, along with utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) announced the successful completion and operation of the Calistoga Resiliency Centre (CRC) located in California.

CRC integrates hydrogen fuel cells with a lithium-ion BESS to ensure power resilience during grid outages caused by wildfires or natural disasters.

The Calistoga community microgrid will benefit from the CRC by sustaining power during shutoffs or disconnections. According to Energy Vault, the 293MWh system provides about 48 hours of continuous energy, with a peak output of 8.5MW during public safety power shutoff (PSPS) events.

During such events, the system operates in ‘island’ mode, using green hydrogen to generate electricity.

After fulfilling the black-start and grid-forming roles of the microgrid, Energy Vault’s B-VAULT DC battery technology works with the fuel cells to ensure grid stability.

In April, Energy Vault closed on US$28 million in project financing for the CRC, including the sale of an investment tax credit associated with the project.

In August, the company received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to pursue market-based participation in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market with the CRC.

A representative from Energy Vault said to Energy-Storage.news:

“Ultimately, the system will need to be approved for market participation by CAISO itself, but the CPUC clearance is a key milestone toward that goal. That being said, the system’s operation relies on a hybrid combination of lithium-ion battery and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, so there is no distinction to be made in terms of which technology will be considered for CAISO market participation.”

The company also announced on 26 September that it entered into a definitive funding agreement with YA II PN, for up to US$50 million in corporate debenture financing.

Energy Vault noted the funding agreement is separate from and in addition to the recently announced US$300 million preferred equity investment with a leading infrastructure investor, which is pending final closure.

Upon final closing, Asset Vault will be established as a fully consolidated subsidiary to manage Energy Vault’s storage assets, which it will own and operate.

These assets will be backed by long-term offtake agreements, which Energy Vault says will secure project revenue and support Energy Vault’s strategy as an independent power producer (IPP).

The latest greenlight followed Heidelberg Materials and Encyclis signing contracts for difference with the government-owned Low Carbon Contracts Company last week.
Heidelberg Materials is also building a new 10 km spur pipeline to connect Padeswood to the wider HyNet network.
Heidelberg Materials noted that its facility will create 50 new operational roles while supporting 200 existing positions.
UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: “Our clean energy mission means good jobs, regional growth and investment for local communities.","TWO PLANNED carbon capture facilities in the UK have become the first HyNet cluster projects to advance toward construction, following the signing of final government contracts last week.

The Padeswood cement works in north Wales and the planned Protos energy-from-waste incinerator in Ellesmere Port, northwest England, are set to begin capturing CO2 emissions from 2029, following contract agreements that will enable construction to start this year. Emissions will be transported and stored in depleted gas reservoirs in Liverpool Bay as part of the HyNet carbon capture, utilisation and storage (CCUS) project – a scheme coordinated by Italian oil giant Eni to repurpose existing pipelines to transport emissions from a cluster of industrial emitters across northwest England and north Wales.

The latest greenlight followed Heidelberg Materials and Encyclis signing contracts for difference with the government-owned Low Carbon Contracts Company last week. The value of the contracts has not been disclosed owing to commercial sensitivity, although the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said that funding will be taken from the £9.4bn (US$12.6bn) earmarked for CCUS in the spending review in June.

Combined, the two facilities are expected to capture almost 1.2m tCO2e/y, including 800,000 tCO2e/y from Padeswood, amounting to around 95% of the cement works’ total emissions and more than half of all emissions from Heidelberg Materials’ UK overall cement operations in 2023. The 370,000 tCO2e/y expected to be captured at Protos, meanwhile, amounts to just under half of Encyclis’ total emissions from its three incinerators in the UK and Ireland in 2024. Encyclis plans to incinerate 500,000 t/y of non-recyclable waste at Protos, generating 49.9 MW of electricity.

Cement production is one of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries, responsible for around 8% of global emissions, largely from the vast heat required to turn limestone into clinker.

Emissions at Padeswood are generated from burning domestic waste to heat the cement kiln. Heidelberg Materials says the plant will be the first cement works in the world to capture almost all CO2 emissions from industrial-scale production.

The facility Heidelberg Materials plans to build at Padeswood will use an amine solvent-based technology already deployed at its Brevik cement plant in Norway, which became the world’s first industrial-scale site to capture emissions from cement production when it opened in June. The Brevik plant captures only 50% of emissions, making Padeswood a significant technological advancement.

Heidelberg Materials is also planning to build a new heat and power plant to support the additional energy demand created by the capture facility. The company told TCE that the new heat and power plant will be fuelled by waste heat from cement production and natural gas, and that emissions will be captured.

Heidelberg Materials is also building a new 10 km spur pipeline to connect Padeswood to the wider HyNet network.

Olivia Powis, CEO of the CCS Association, said: “Cement and energy from waste are two of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, yet they are fundamental to our economy and way of life – from building new homes and vital infrastructure to managing society’s unrecyclable waste and providing reliable low-carbon power.

“These world-leading projects show how carbon capture can provide credible, scalable pathways to net zero securing the future of essential UK industries and keeping businesses competitive in global markets.”

The UK government expects the two projects to generate around 500 jobs, primarily in construction. Heidelberg Materials noted that its facility will create 50 new operational roles while supporting 200 existing positions. UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: “Our clean energy mission means good jobs, regional growth and investment for local communities. These trailblazing projects showcase north Wales and the northwest’s workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation.”

It can be life-threatening and lead to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in losses.

Unfortunately, research out of Texas A&M discovered that the country is shockingly vulnerable to grid outages — and some states are more at risk than others.

What's happening?

EnergySage spotlighted Texas A&M's report in a recent article examining how installing solar panels with battery storage can give homeowners a leg up during grid outages on households without a backup power source or those dependent on gasoline generators.

As an independent, objective expert in the nuances of the rooftop solar industry, EnergySage offers free tools for consumers to obtain easy-to-compare solar installation quotes.

Texas A&M's findings reveal why an increasing number of homeowners are preparing for weather-induced grid outages with the assistance of EnergySage.

The university reported that power outages have risen by 20% since 2019. Texas, California, and Louisiana, respectively, accounted for the most major power outages between 2000 and 2023, according to a Power System Vulnerability Index created using over 179 million data points.

Why is this important?

As EnergySage explains, power outages aren't just dangerous for people who rely on medical equipment needing refrigeration or electricity. During an outage, the average family loses $200 in groceries because of spoilage, and they may need to shell out upward of $25,000 on hotel stays, damaged electronics, and other repairs in the event of water-related property damage.

Dr. Ali Mostafavi, the director of the Urban Resilience AI Lab that used machine learning to develop the vulnerability index, said in the Texas A&M release that the grid failure situation was more dire than they originally suspected.

""We knew that the state of power system vulnerability nationwide is exacerbating. But the magnitude of that was shocking, and greater than we hypothesized,"" Dr. Mostafavi said.

What can be done about this?

Installing solar panels and pairing them with battery storage won't only boost your family's ability to manage whatever climate-related event comes its way.

Along with upgrading to energy-efficient technology, solar and battery storage will also help you significantly reduce your energy bills while slashing dirty fuel-produced heat-trapping pollution responsible for warming the climate and subsequently supercharging extreme weather.

Whether used for everyday power or as a backup energy source, solar panels also improve comfort and peace of mind because they're quieter than gas generators and don't introduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

On average, EnergySage's free services save homeowners $10,000 on solar installations. Now is also the time to connect with EnergySage to maximize your savings, as solar projects must be underway by Dec. 31 to qualify for federal tax incentives. Its state-by-state mapping tool can help you discover which area-specific savings may also be available.

""Shredding high-voltage storage systems discards valuable resources,"" the outlet stated. ""The team sees disassembly and reuse as a better option.

""The process preserves raw materials and allows non-reusable cells to be passed on to recyclers, who can still recover lithium, cobalt, and other critical elements.""

The resulting products will be used to enable energy storage for homes, businesses, and utilities.

IE noted that used batteries will increase tenfold in the European Union by 2030. For the units to be fully repurposed, they must be broken down to their individual components. That way, failed or damaged cells can be replaced or repaired.

The plant will compile data about disassembly and recovery so it can improve processes.

Artificial intelligence will support the breakdown method, evaluating whether cells can be reused or are at the end of their lifespans. This will also reduce risks to workers and make the system scalable, IE reported.

Keeping these resources in circulation after they have outlived their usefulness in automobiles reduces the risk of toxins leaching into groundwater and soil and minimizes resource depletion.

Battery technology is always evolving, and developments make EVs and other machines more affordable and efficient. Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an electric one can save you $1,500 every year on fuel and maintenance. It will also produce only about one-quarter of the heat-trapping gases that are driving rising global temperatures and all the consequences of dirty energy use.

Battery storage also makes daily living easier for humans, helping individuals, companies, and cities reduce reliance on the electric grid, which is still powered mostly by dirty energy sources, saving money and curbing pollution. This has a profound effect on people's well-being, lowering risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and more while protecting vulnerable people and communities.

""Solar is not only about generation anymore; it is about creating a local industry,"" Tayfun Hiz, a researcher at the Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications of Middle East Technical University in Ankara, told Xinhua recently.
Without these steps, it may be difficult to use all the renewable power being built,"" she told Xinhua.
The Turkish government aims to reach around 120 gigawatts of combined solar and wind capacity by 2035, while continuing to develop hydropower, geothermal and biomass.
Saglam warned that without proper grid infrastructure, renewable energy potential in Türkiye cannot be fully realized.","ANKARA, Sept. 29 (Xinhua) -- As renewable energy plays an increasingly important role in Türkiye's installed power capacity, experts have highlighted both the rapid growth of solar energy and the urgent need to modernize the grid to ensure a stable green transition.

""Solar is not only about generation anymore; it is about creating a local industry,"" Tayfun Hiz, a researcher at the Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications of Middle East Technical University in Ankara, told Xinhua recently.

""Türkiye is already building panels, inverters and related technologies domestically. If we align research, manufacturing and policy, solar can become a driver of exports as well as clean energy at home,"" he added.

Muhdan Saglam, director of Ankara-based think tank the Center for Energy and Climate Change Studies at the Economic Policy Research Foundation, emphasized the next phase of the energy transition: ""Türkiye has shown it can build renewable power quickly, but the real challenge now is to integrate these resources smoothly into the system.""

""To solve this, Türkiye will need to invest in stronger power lines, storage systems such as batteries, and smarter electricity markets. Without these steps, it may be difficult to use all the renewable power being built,"" she told Xinhua.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced at the UN Climate Summit 2025 held Wednesday in New York that more than 60 percent of Türkiye's installed electricity capacity now comes from renewable sources, including hydropower, wind and solar.

He outlined new measures including an emissions trading system and green finance tools. ""In line with our net-zero emissions target for 2053, we will continue to transform key sectors,"" Erdogan added.

The renewable expansion also supports Türkiye's goal of reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and enhancing energy security through sun, wind and water resources.

Official data showed that Türkiye's solar power has doubled since 2021, reaching over 21 gigawatts of capacity by early 2025, while wind power has steadily expanded and hydropower remains the backbone with over 32 gigawatts of capacity.

The Turkish government aims to reach around 120 gigawatts of combined solar and wind capacity by 2035, while continuing to develop hydropower, geothermal and biomass.

Saglam warned that without proper grid infrastructure, renewable energy potential in Türkiye cannot be fully realized.

Citing the massive blackout in the Iberian Peninsula in late April as an example of grid vulnerability, Saglam stressed that ""necessary investments have to be made to support the grid.""

Phasing out coal by 2035 at the latest would be essential for Türkiye to meet its 2053 climate neutrality goal, she said, adding that the coming years will reveal whether Türkiye can turn its ambitious plans into lasting change, combining climate action with energy security and economic benefits. ■",,N,,2025-09-29 11:02:35.071581

We are still ignoring the important role of ventilation in the full HVAC&R cycle.","As climate change pushes temperatures ever higher in the Middle East, the HVAC&R industry is being asked to provide more cooling while simultaneously consuming less energy. It’s a problem the industry has had to confront across the world, but the high ambient temperatures of the Middle East make it especially difficult to balance cooling and energy consumption.

It’s this challenge that Eurovent Middle East, an industry association of HVAC&R manufacturers and local service providers, is addressing at its upcoming HVACR Next Generation congress, which is being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on October 28. Indoor air quality (IAQ), ventilation and training are all major focus points of the program, as are natural refrigerants. In addition to technical challenges and best practices, another goal of the event is to show that sustainability is good for business, according to Markus Lattner, Managing Director of Eurovent Middle East.

“There is a clear business case to be made to rely on high-quality, high-energy-efficient systems designed and operated by trained and qualified personnel,” Lattner said.

NaturalRefrigerants.com spoke with Lattner to learn more about the HVACR Next Generation congress and Eurovent Middle East’s goals for the event. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

The HVACR Next Generation congress is a relatively new event in its second edition. What is its goal and format?

Markus Lattner: There are several major issues the industry and region is facing that need to be brought to the attention of a wider audience within our ecosystem. Contrary to many of the commercial conferences, we can address these issues free from commercial interest and influence. We do not allow commercial content and sponsoring does not automatically entitle you to a presentation. This ensures that we can provide a truly relevant and engaging agenda.

One of the key topics on the agenda is the refrigerant transition in high ambient temperature, or HAT, countries. Given this, what presence will natural refrigerants have on the agenda?

ML: It is clear that the region will have to adapt to a changing refrigerant landscape in the coming decades, and the top priority lies in decarbonizing the building sector. Natural refrigerants will undoubtedly have to play a major part in this transition, and it is essential that we educate the market on their potential and address prejudices and misinformation as to their applicability in HAT conditions.

We want to motivate investors and end users to switch to low-GWP solutions at an early stage. We will discuss essential steps to be taken if we want to see this transition be successful from the legal environment to qualification requirements and the adoption of relevant international safety standards. This aspect will form a major part of the conference.

Training is an issue in the HVAC&R industry, both in general and with regard to the transition to natural refrigerants. Will training be a topic of discussion at the event?

ML: We launched our HVAC&R Leadership Academy two years ago to provide certified technical training, and we are seeing an increased interest in f-gas certification, which is a vital first step. Qualification across the value chain from planning to installation, operation and maintenance forms the greatest savings potential when it comes to energy consumption and carbon emissions. It is about time that we bring more skill requirements to the industry in the region.

“Natural refrigerants will undoubtedly have to play a major part in this transition, and it is essential that we educate the market on their potential and address prejudices and misinformation as to their applicability in HAT conditions.”

Markus Lattner, Managing Director of Eurovent Middle East

In addition to high-ambient temperatures, are there other unique challenges facing the HVAC&R industry in the Middle East?

ML: Our other major focal point is ventilation. We are still ignoring the important role of ventilation in the full HVAC&R cycle. After all, the best chiller on the roof is useless if the cooling load isn’t delivered equally and fully to the building. Add into this its effect on IAQ, the role it plays in keeping buildings healthy and its energy imprint, which is estimated to be between 40% to 50% of the total HVAC-related energy costs, and it is clear that we need to bring more scrutiny to the planning and design of ventilation systems.

We also will highlight that sustainability, aside from its environmental impact, is directly related to lower total cost of ownership. There is a clear business case to be made to rely on high-quality, high-energy-efficient systems designed and operated by trained and qualified personnel.

Mike Jacobs, a senior energy manager at UCS, uncovered these additional costs by analyzing last year’s filings from utilities in seven PJM states and identifying 130 projects that will connect private data centers directly to the high-voltage transmission system.
Over 95% of the projects identified passed all of their transmission connection costs onto local people’s electricity bills, totaling $4.3 billion in costs previously undistinguished from other, more typical expenses to upgrade and maintain the electricity grid.
“People deserve to understand the full extent of how data centers in their communities may affect their lives and wallets.
This is a clear case of the public unknowingly subsidizing private companies’ profits.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (September 15, 2025)—A new analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reveals how millions of people across Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia are footing the bill for an additional $4.3 billion in electricity infrastructure projects approved in 2024 solely to connect wealthy private companies’ data centers.

This $4.3 billion was previously obscured through opaque utility filings and is on top of an estimated $9.3 billion in data center electricity costs to be paid between June 2025 and June 2026 by the 65 million people who are customers supplied by PJM, the regional utility operator spanning 13 Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley states plus the District of Columbia.

Mike Jacobs, a senior energy manager at UCS, uncovered these additional costs by analyzing last year’s filings from utilities in seven PJM states and identifying 130 projects that will connect private data centers directly to the high-voltage transmission system. Over 95% of the projects identified passed all of their transmission connection costs onto local people’s electricity bills, totaling $4.3 billion in costs previously undistinguished from other, more typical expenses to upgrade and maintain the electricity grid.

Jacobs’ seven state analysis found household electricity bills subsidizing the following in direct data center transmission costs approved in 2024:

Illinois: $239 million

Maryland: $107.5 million

New Jersey: $14.5 million

Ohio: $1.3 billion

Pennsylvania: $491.7 million

Virginia: $1.9 billion

West Virginia: $215.8 million

“The big tech companies rushing to build out massive data centers are worth trillions of dollars, yet they’re successfully exploiting an outdated regulatory process to pawn billions of dollars of costs off on families who may never even use their products,” said Jacobs. “People deserve to understand the full extent of how data centers in their communities may affect their lives and wallets. This is a clear case of the public unknowingly subsidizing private companies’ profits. Utilities and regulators must do more to protect people from this outrageous practice that is already driving up household electricity bills for millions of people across the country.”

There are several ways state and federal regulators can reverse this subsidy, Jacobs explains, and these solutions could save people billions of dollars as data centers are projected to increase U.S. energy demand by 130% by 2030, potentially repeating these cost shifts in many more states.",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:10.694594

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”",http://d3i5p6znmm9yua.cloudfront.net/360_Tiffin_Live/0/0/0/0/753/661/753661_1,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:59.429587

The comprehensive funding package forms a central component of the ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa’ campaign, an ambitious initiative co-hosted with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that seeks to mobilize unprecedented levels of public and private investment in clean energy infrastructure across the African continent. This coordinated effort aims not only to expand renewable energy generation capacity but also to address the pressing challenge of energy access that continues to affect hundreds of millions of African citizens.

The Strategic Vision: Powering Africa’s Future Through Clean Energy

“The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world,” President von der Leyen emphasized in her address. “A clean energy transition on the continent will create jobs, stability, growth and the delivery of our global climate goals. The European Union, with the Global Gateway investment plan, is fully committed to supporting Africa on its clean energy path.”

This statement encapsulates the multifaceted rationale behind the EU’s substantial investment commitment. The initiative recognizes that Africa’s energy transition carries implications far beyond the continent’s borders, influencing global climate trajectories, international supply chain resilience, migration patterns, and geopolitical stability. By supporting Africa’s renewable energy development, the European Union positions itself as a key partner in addressing interconnected challenges of development, security, and environmental sustainability.

Africa’s Energy Paradox: Immense Potential Meets Pressing Need

The African continent presents a striking paradox in the global energy landscape. Blessed with extraordinary renewable energy resources—abundant sunshine across vast territories, strong wind corridors along coastal regions, significant hydropower potential from mighty river systems, and substantial geothermal capacity in the East African Rift Valley—Africa theoretically possesses the natural endowments to become a renewable energy powerhouse. Solar irradiation levels across much of Africa exceed those found in most other regions globally, making solar photovoltaic installations particularly economically attractive.

Yet despite these abundant natural resources, approximately 600 million Africans currently live without access to electricity—representing roughly 43% of the continent’s population. This energy poverty constrains economic development, limits educational opportunities, hampers healthcare delivery, and perpetuates cycles of underdevelopment. In rural areas particularly, lack of electricity access affects fundamental aspects of daily life, from food preservation and water pumping to communication and productive economic activities.

The consequences of this energy deficit extend beyond mere inconvenience. Without reliable electricity, small businesses cannot operate modern equipment, students struggle to study after dark, healthcare facilities cannot refrigerate vaccines or power critical medical equipment, and communities remain isolated from the digital economy transforming much of the world. Addressing this energy access challenge while simultaneously pursuing climate-friendly development pathways represents one of the defining development challenges of the 21st century.

The Development and Strategic Imperative

The urgency of supporting Africa’s clean energy transition stems from both developmental and strategic considerations. From a development perspective, modern energy access serves as a fundamental prerequisite for poverty reduction, economic diversification, and human development progress. The correlation between energy access and development indicators like life expectancy, education levels, and income is well-established in development economics research.

Strategically, how Africa meets its growing energy needs will profoundly influence global climate outcomes. With Africa’s population projected to reach approximately 2.5 billion by 2050—representing a doubling from current levels—and with legitimate aspirations for economic development and improved living standards, the continent’s energy consumption will inevitably increase substantially. Whether this increased energy demand is met through fossil fuels or renewable sources will significantly impact global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories and the feasibility of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Investing in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power across Africa is described in the EU announcement as “not just a moral and development imperative” but also “a strategic choice that strengthens supply chains, creates up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, and makes energy systems more resilient.” This job creation potential is particularly significant given Africa’s youth demographic profile, with the continent possessing the world’s youngest population and facing substantial youth employment challenges.

The reference to supply chain strengthening acknowledges the growing importance of critical minerals for renewable energy technologies. Africa possesses substantial reserves of minerals essential for batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and other clean energy technologies, including cobalt, lithium, copper, and rare earth elements. Developing renewable energy industries within Africa could create opportunities for value-added processing and manufacturing, moving beyond simple raw material extraction toward more sophisticated and economically beneficial industrial activities.

The Global Gateway: Europe’s Infrastructure Investment Framework

The announced package operates within the framework of the EU’s Global Gateway investment strategy, an ambitious initiative launched to mobilize €300 billion in infrastructure investments globally between 2021 and 2027. Global Gateway represents the European Union’s strategic response to infrastructure financing needs in developing and emerging economies, emphasizing sustainable, high-quality investments that adhere to international standards for environmental protection, labor rights, transparency, and governance.

The strategy explicitly positions itself as offering an alternative model to some other international infrastructure investment approaches, emphasizing partnership principles, local ownership, and sustainability considerations. In the African context, Global Gateway focuses particularly on digital connectivity, health systems, education, renewable energy, and transport infrastructure—sectors identified as critical for sustainable development and economic transformation.

Through this framework, the EU commits to helping “accelerate this transition, delivering major investments in generation, transmission, and cross-border electricity trade, while building stable international partnerships.” This comprehensive approach recognizes that expanding renewable energy generation capacity alone is insufficient; investments must also address transmission infrastructure to move electricity from generation sites to population centers, and regional interconnection to enable electricity trade and enhance system reliability.

Detailed Breakdown: Where the €545 Million Will Be Deployed

The newly announced package distributes resources across multiple African nations and regional initiatives, targeting both large-scale infrastructure projects and community-level electrification efforts. This diversified approach reflects recognition that Africa’s energy challenge requires solutions at multiple scales, from major transmission lines enabling regional power trade to decentralized mini-grids bringing electricity to remote villages.

Côte d’Ivoire: Strengthening Regional Energy Backbone (€359.4 million)

The largest single allocation within the package directs €359.4 million toward construction of a high-voltage transmission line known as ‘Dorsale Est’ (Eastern Backbone) in Côte d’Ivoire. This substantial infrastructure project aims to enhance regional energy distribution capacity, enabling more efficient power flow across the country and potentially facilitating electricity trade with neighboring nations.

Côte d’Ivoire has emerged as West Africa’s fastest-growing economy in recent years and serves as a regional economic hub. The country has achieved relatively high electrification rates compared to regional averages, with approximately 70% of the population having electricity access. However, the quality and reliability of supply require improvement, and transmission infrastructure needs upgrading to accommodate increasing demand and integration of new renewable generation capacity.

High-voltage transmission lines are critical infrastructure for modern power systems, enabling efficient long-distance electricity transport with minimal losses. By strengthening this transmission backbone, the project will facilitate integration of renewable energy sources that may be located far from major consumption centers—such as solar installations in northern regions or potential wind farms in coastal areas—and enhance grid stability and reliability.

Cameroon: Bringing Power to Rural Communities (€59.1 million)

The second-largest country allocation targets rural electrification in Cameroon, with €59.1 million dedicated to bringing electricity access to 687 communities, potentially benefiting more than 2.5 million people. This represents a significant step toward addressing Cameroon’s substantial rural-urban electricity access gap, where rural electrification rates lag far behind urban areas.

Rural electrification projects face distinct challenges compared to urban grid extension, including dispersed populations, difficult terrain, long distances from existing grid infrastructure, and limited ability of rural populations to pay cost-reflective electricity tariffs. These challenges often require innovative approaches such as mini-grids powered by solar or small hydropower installations, rather than traditional grid extension strategies.

The impact of rural electrification extends well beyond household lighting. Electricity access enables irrigation pumping for agriculture, refrigeration for food preservation and small businesses, power for processing agricultural products, communication technologies connecting rural areas to markets and information, and improved healthcare and education services. Studies consistently demonstrate that rural electrification catalyzes broader economic development when accompanied by complementary investments in productive uses of electricity.

Republic of Congo: Diversifying Renewable Energy Sources (€3.5 million)

A more modest allocation of €3.5 million for the Republic of Congo focuses on expanding access to diverse renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydropower technologies. While smaller in absolute terms, this investment could support feasibility studies, pilot projects, technical assistance, and policy development that lay groundwork for larger future investments.

The Republic of Congo possesses significant hydropower potential from the Congo River basin, one of the world’s most powerful river systems. However, developing this potential requires substantial investment in generation facilities and transmission infrastructure. Meanwhile, solar and wind technologies offer opportunities for more distributed generation that can provide electricity access more quickly and flexibly than large-scale hydropower projects.

Lesotho: Unlocking Wind and Hydropower Potential (€25.9 million)

The mountain kingdom of Lesotho receives €25.9 million through the Renewable Lesotho programme, specifically targeting development of wind and hydropower resources. Lesotho’s mountainous topography and high elevation create favorable conditions for both wind energy generation and hydroelectric installations, though the country currently remains heavily dependent on imported electricity from neighboring South Africa.

Lesotho faces unique energy challenges stemming from its geography—entirely surrounded by South Africa, with rugged terrain complicating infrastructure development, and a small population of approximately 2 million people that limits economies of scale. However, these same geographical characteristics provide renewable energy advantages. The highlands experience strong, consistent winds suitable for wind power generation, while steep elevation changes and reliable water flows create hydropower opportunities.

Developing domestic renewable energy generation could reduce Lesotho’s electricity import dependence, keep energy expenditure within the national economy, and potentially position the country to export renewable electricity to South Africa’s much larger market. The Renewable Lesotho programme appears designed to conduct necessary assessments, develop project pipelines, and attract additional financing for specific generation projects.

Ghana: Planning Large-Scale Solar Development (€2 million)

Ghana receives €2 million designated for laying groundwork for a large-scale solar park and facilitating regional energy trade. Though modest in size, this funding likely supports preliminary activities essential for major renewable energy projects—site assessments, grid integration studies, environmental and social impact assessments, regulatory approvals, and engagement with potential investors and off-takers.

Ghana has established itself as one of West Africa’s more stable and prosperous nations, with relatively strong governance institutions and a growing economy. The country has set ambitious renewable energy targets and seeks to diversify its electricity generation mix, which historically relied heavily on hydropower and thermal generation. Large-scale solar parks represent attractive options given Ghana’s location near the equator and consistently high solar irradiation levels.

Regional energy trade represents another strategic dimension of this investment. West African nations have long recognized benefits of regional electricity market integration, which can enhance supply reliability, optimize generation resource utilization, and provide economic efficiencies through trade. Ghana’s participation in the West African Power Pool positions it to both import and export electricity, and developing additional generation capacity could enable the country to become a net exporter to neighbors with electricity deficits.

Central Africa: Strengthening Regional Energy Cooperation (€3.3 million)

The package allocates €3.3 million across three initiatives supporting the Central African Power Pool (CAPP), a regional organization working to develop integrated electricity markets and infrastructure across Central African nations. These investments include:

Technical Assistance to CAPP (€1.6 million): Supporting the institutional development, planning capabilities, and operational effectiveness of this regional power pool organization. Effective regional electricity market operation requires sophisticated planning, coordination mechanisms, regulatory frameworks, and technical standards—all areas where technical assistance can build capacity.

Research and Infrastructure Funding Facility (€0.5 million): Creating a funding mechanism to support studies and small-scale infrastructure investments advancing regional energy integration. This facility could finance grid interconnection studies, renewable energy resource assessments, and pilot projects demonstrating innovative approaches.

Friendship Loop Feasibility Study (€1.2 million): Examining the technical and economic feasibility of a cross-border transmission line—dubbed the ‘Boucle de l’Amitié’ (Friendship Loop)—that would connect Pointe Noire, Brazzaville, and Kinshasa. These cities represent major population and economic centers across the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, yet electricity interconnections remain limited. A transmission link could enable power sharing, improve supply reliability, and facilitate integration of new generation capacity.

Madagascar: Expanding Rural Electrification (€33.2 million)

Madagascar receives €33.2 million focused on expanding electrification through mini-grids in rural areas. The island nation faces particularly acute energy access challenges, with electrification rates among the lowest globally—only about 15% of the population has electricity access, and rural access rates drop below 5%.

Madagascar’s geography—an island nation with dispersed rural populations, challenging terrain, and biodiversity conservation priorities—makes traditional grid extension economically prohibitive for many communities. Mini-grids powered by solar panels, small wind turbines, or micro-hydropower installations offer more practical solutions for bringing electricity to isolated communities.

These decentralized energy systems can be deployed relatively quickly, scaled to match community needs, and operated independently of national grid infrastructure. When properly designed and managed, mini-grids can provide reliable electricity at costs competitive with diesel generators while avoiding fossil fuel dependence. The EU investment will likely support both the physical installation of mini-grid systems and the development of sustainable business models ensuring their long-term operation and maintenance.

Mozambique: Encouraging Private Sector Engagement (€13 million)

Mozambique’s allocation of €13 million emphasizes supporting a low-emission energy transition while particularly encouraging private sector involvement. This reflects recognition that public financing alone cannot meet the scale of investment required for comprehensive energy system transformation, and that mobilizing private capital is essential for sustainable energy sector development.

Mozambique possesses substantial renewable energy potential, including significant solar resources, hydropower potential from major river systems, wind resources along its extensive coastline, and potentially exploitable natural gas reserves that could serve as a transition fuel. The country has attracted interest from international renewable energy developers, though project development faces challenges including limited grid infrastructure, regulatory uncertainties, and financing constraints.

EU support could address these barriers through various mechanisms: providing concessional financing that improves project economics, offering guarantees that reduce investor risk, supporting regulatory reforms that create clearer frameworks for private investment, and funding grid infrastructure that enables private generation projects to connect and deliver power to markets.

Somalia: Building Resilience Through Renewable Energy (€45.5 million)

Somalia receives a substantial €45.5 million allocation with multiple interconnected objectives: increasing access to affordable renewable energy, advancing circular economy practices, and building climate-resilient agri-food systems. This integrated approach recognizes the multiple challenges facing Somalia and the interconnections between energy access, agricultural development, climate adaptation, and economic recovery.

Somalia faces extraordinary development challenges stemming from decades of conflict, weak state institutions, and vulnerability to climate shocks including recurring droughts and occasional flooding. Energy access remains extremely limited, with most electricity generation coming from expensive imported diesel fuel powering small-scale generators. This results in some of the world’s highest electricity costs—often exceeding $1 per kilowatt-hour—which constrains economic activity and household wellbeing.

Renewable energy deployment, particularly solar systems, could dramatically reduce energy costs while avoiding continued fossil fuel dependence. The reference to circular economy practices suggests attention to sustainable resource management, waste reduction, and recycling—principles that can be integrated into energy system development through careful planning of equipment lifecycles, local manufacturing or assembly where feasible, and proper management of end-of-life solar panels and batteries.

The connection to climate-resilient agri-food systems acknowledges that Somalia’s economy depends heavily on agriculture and pastoralism, sectors highly vulnerable to climate variability. Renewable energy can support agricultural adaptation through solar-powered irrigation, cold storage facilities for produce and vaccines, processing equipment that adds value to agricultural products, and communication systems enabling farmers to access weather information and market prices.

The Scaling Up Renewables in Africa Campaign: A Collaborative Approach

The €545 million EU package represents one component of the broader ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa’ campaign, an innovative multi-stakeholder initiative designed to mobilize commitments and action far beyond what any single actor could achieve alone. The campaign brings together governments, international organizations, private sector entities, and civil society in a coordinated effort to accelerate Africa’s renewable energy transition.

The involvement of Global Citizen, an international advocacy organization with expertise in mobilizing public engagement and private sector commitments around development goals, adds a grassroots dimension to the campaign. Global Citizen has pioneered approaches that combine public advocacy, major music and cultural events, and engagement with political and business leaders to drive action on global challenges ranging from poverty and hunger to education and climate change.

The International Energy Agency provides critical technical and analytical support, bringing its extensive expertise in energy markets, technologies, and policies. The IEA’s participation lends credibility and technical rigor to the campaign while helping ensure that initiatives align with best practices in energy system planning and development.

The campaign structure encourages diverse actors—governments, financial institutions, private companies, and philanthropists—to make concrete pledges of capital, expertise, or technical assistance. This model recognizes that comprehensive energy system transformation requires contributions from multiple sources: public financing to support enabling infrastructure and reduce project risks, private capital to fund commercially viable generation projects, philanthropic resources to support community-level initiatives and capacity building, and technical expertise to navigate complex planning, regulatory, and implementation challenges.

Momentum Toward Global Climate Goals

The campaign explicitly maintains momentum toward the ambitious targets established at COP28—the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Dubai—which called for tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling energy efficiency improvements by 2030. These targets reflect scientific consensus regarding the pace of clean energy deployment needed to limit global temperature increases and avoid the most severe climate change impacts.

Africa’s energy transition plays a crucial role in achieving these global targets. While the continent currently accounts for a relatively small share of global greenhouse gas emissions—reflecting low historical industrialization and energy consumption—Africa’s development trajectory over coming decades will significantly influence global emissions pathways. Supporting clean energy development now can help African nations achieve development goals while avoiding the high-carbon pathways that characterized industrialization in other regions.

The connection to COP28 commitments also positions the Africa renewable energy campaign within broader international climate negotiations and accountability frameworks. By linking African energy investments to global climate targets, the initiative emphasizes shared responsibility for climate action and the importance of developed nations supporting clean energy transitions in developing countries—consistent with principles of climate justice and differentiated responsibilities embodied in international climate agreements.

Looking Ahead: Upcoming Forums and the G20 Summit

The campaign’s strategic timeline builds momentum through a series of high-profile events designed to maintain attention, generate additional commitments, and translate pledges into concrete action. In early October, the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels will convene governments, financial institutions, and private sector leaders to provide additional support for Africa’s clean energy transition. This forum offers opportunities for announcing new investment commitments, establishing partnerships between European and African entities, and addressing technical and policy challenges impeding project development.

The campaign culminates with a high-level event connected to the G20 Summit in South Africa on November 22-23, 2025. The G20 represents the world’s major economies and accounts for approximately 85% of global GDP and two-thirds of the world population. Holding the summit in an African nation—South Africa—provides unique opportunities to center African development priorities, including energy access and climate change, in discussions among the world’s most powerful governments and economic institutions.

South Africa’s hosting of the G20 Summit carries particular significance given the country’s own energy transition challenges and opportunities. South Africa’s electricity system has historically relied heavily on coal-fired generation, but the nation has committed to transitioning toward renewable energy and has attracted substantial international support for this transition, including through the Just Energy Transition Partnership announced at COP26. South Africa’s experience navigating the complexities of energy transition—including managing social and economic impacts on coal-dependent communities and workers—provides relevant lessons for other African nations.

The G20 context also enables engagement with major emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil—countries that increasingly influence development finance, technology transfer, and trade patterns affecting African nations. Securing commitments from this diverse group of global powers could mobilize resources and political will far beyond what European contributions alone could achieve.

The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities

While the €545 million EU package and the broader Scaling Up Renewables campaign represent significant commitments, successfully transforming Africa’s energy landscape will require addressing substantial challenges that extend beyond financing alone. Technical challenges include integrating variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind into electricity grids designed for predictable, dispatchable generation; developing adequate transmission infrastructure to connect generation sites with consumption centers; building local technical capacity for operating and maintaining modern energy systems; and ensuring cybersecurity for increasingly digitized grid management systems.

Regulatory and institutional challenges may prove equally important. Many African nations require reforms to electricity sector regulations that currently inhibit private investment, updates to grid codes and technical standards that facilitate renewable energy integration, strengthening of regulatory agencies that can effectively oversee liberalized electricity markets, and development of clear, stable policy frameworks that provide investors with confidence for long-term commitments.

Social and economic dimensions of energy transition also demand attention. Ensuring that energy access reaches poor and marginalized communities, not just economically advantaged populations, requires careful attention to affordability and deliberate targeting of underserved areas. Managing impacts on existing energy sector workers and fossil fuel-dependent communities necessitates just transition strategies that provide retraining, alternative employment opportunities, and social protection. Building local supply chains and manufacturing capabilities can maximize employment benefits and technology transfer, though this requires coordinated industrial policy alongside energy sector development.

Despite these challenges, the opportunities are immense. Successfully developing Africa’s renewable energy potential could position the continent as a major clean energy producer and exporter, particularly for green hydrogen and electricity exports to Europe via undersea cables. The job creation potential—up to 38 million positions by 2030 according to the EU announcement—could transform employment prospects for Africa’s young and growing population. Enhanced energy access would catalyze economic development across sectors from manufacturing and services to agriculture and digital economy participation.

Conclusion: A Defining Partnership for Sustainable Development

The European Commission’s €545 million investment package, announced by President von der Leyen at the Global Citizen Festival, represents far more than a financial commitment. It embodies a vision of partnership between Europe and Africa grounded in shared interests—climate stability, sustainable development, economic opportunity, and regional security—rather than outdated models of aid dependency or resource extraction.

By supporting Africa’s renewable energy transition through the Global Gateway framework and the Scaling Up Renewables campaign, the European Union positions itself as a committed partner in one of the 21st century’s defining development challenges. The success of these initiatives will be measured not simply in megawatts of generation capacity installed or kilometers of transmission lines constructed, but in lives transformed through energy access, jobs created in emerging green economies, and progress toward global climate goals that protect the planet for future generations.

As President von der Leyen emphasized, “The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world.” Through this substantial investment and the collaborative campaign it supports, Europe signals its commitment to ensuring that Africa has the resources, partnerships, and support needed to make choices that advance both continental development and global sustainability. The coming months, as the campaign builds toward the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, will reveal whether this vision can mobilize the comprehensive action—political, financial, and technical—required to realize Africa’s renewable energy potential and deliver on the promise of a clean energy future for all.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is giving a group of its clients front-row access to the energy transition that’s underway in the Gulf states, as the region’s efforts to pivot away from fossil-fuel dependence generate growing investor interest.

“It’s a very compelling story,” said Hannah Lee, Asia-Pacific equity thematic and head of sustainable investing research at JPMorgan Securities. That applies “both for their own electricity generation, but also for the potential to export clean energy at some point in the future.”

JPMorgan will be taking a group of institutional clients, some with an emerging markets and Asia focus, to Saudi Arabia next month. The trip will serve to raise investor awareness around the energy transformation that’s underway across many of the Gulf states, Lee said.

For now, the Middle East remains a bastion of fossil-fuel dominance. It’s home to about 30% of global oil production, and is coming to the clean-energy transition later than many other major economies, including the US, India and China. But the low base from which the Middle East is starting underpins the opportunity to generate returns from early green investments, according to Lee.

“Our entire renewable energy complex of analysts” has been following the build-out in the Middle East, she said. That analysis, which has covered “batteries and renewables and transformers and everything,” has identified “interesting new commitments out of some of the Middle Eastern, Gulf states on renewable energy and energy transition, of which Saudi Arabia is very notable.”

Gulf state efforts to explore clean energy gathered pace after Dubai hosted the annual United Nations climate change conference in 2023, also known as COP28, according to JPMorgan.

This year, the region is expected to spend $10 billion on renewable and nuclear power generation. That’s still less than a tenth of its projected investment in supplying oil and gas, according to the International Energy Agency. In the coming decade, however, solar photo-voltaic capacity in the Middle East and North Africa is expected to increase tenfold, the IEA estimates.

JPMorgan is drawing investors’ attention to clean-energy opportunities in the Middle East at a time when capital previously destined for the US looks for other destinations. That’s amid growing evidence that a number of institutional investors have been put off by President Donald Trump’s escalating attacks on green energy.

Saudi Arabia has set a target of 130 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity by 2030, and will rely on renewables for half the electricity it generates. Abu Dhabi aims to produce 60% of its electricity from renewables and nuclear by 2035. Both sets of targets will require significant investments.

Data provider Kpler estimates that Saudi Arabia is installing 12.8 gigawatts in renewable energy capacity this year. Power demand from data centers and water desalination are further expected to drive renewables growth in Saudi Arabia. As of 2024, the Saudi Water Authority reported that 20% of the energy used in its new desalination plants came from renewable sources, primarily solar power, the Kpler report stated.

However, the stock market has yet to reward some of the biggest players in the region, with the share price of Saudi Arabian utility Acwa Power Co. down by roughly half this year.

Fossil-fuel behemoth Saudi Aramco, meanwhile, has lost about 13% of its market value in the same period, as excess supply drives down oil prices. The company’s importance to the Saudi economy means its share price losses have left a dent on the kingdom’s main stock index, which is down about 7% this year. Dubai’s benchmark equity index, meanwhile, is up about 14%.

Investor interest in the Gulf states has picked up more broadly of late, as the region’s low taxes and light-touch regulations lure hedge funds, private equity firms and wealthy individuals. At the same time, Middle Eastern efforts to dedicate capital to data centers is laying the foundations for a surge in energy demand. Deals to date include a $3 billion agreement backed by Qatar Investment Authority to finance and invest in data centers.

Lee says JPMorgan also expects the region to benefit from growing trade and investment ties with China, as the world’s biggest clean-tech economy steps up exports to developing nations. Chinese companies have sharply increased foreign investment plans in recent years, with more than 360 manufacturing projects announced since 2022.

The Silk Road Fund and various Chinese firms have already signed billions of dollars worth of investments in Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom achieve its renewables targets under Vision 2030.

Saudi Arabia’s abundant sunshine combined with its ability to pump capital into projects it decides to back has already helped it achieve some of the world’s lowest average costs of producing electricity (known as levelized costs of electricity, or LCOE), according to Norway-based energy research firm Rystad Energy.

“It’s quite an interesting trend and plays into the increased South-South trade corporation that we’ve seen kind of growing over the last couple of years,” Lee said.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/in/deni_638947418339646341.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:02:59.351447

The second-term Trump administration is expected to continue priorities such as immigration enforcement and might try to focus cuts on areas that have already been slashed.","A fight between Republicans and Democrats in the US could lead to an October 1 federal government shutdown.

Democrats are trying to leverage the must-pass bill to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies; the Trump administration is tying a shutdown to potential mass federal worker layoffs.

The current battle focuses on expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that Democrats say will hurt the ability of millions of enrolees to afford insurance. Democrats have also said they want to reverse Medicaid cuts that Trump signed into law this summer.

Republicans are seeking a bill to temporarily extend federal spending at current levels without any add-ons.

If the government shuts down, President Donald Trump and his administration – which has already defied norms on executive power – likely will seek to exert more power.

Trump’s Office of Management and Budget under Russell Vought has moved with more executive authority over spending, which is typically left to Congress. The administration took steps to cancel foreign aid and asserted power to withhold billions in domestic spending.

“I would expect this shutdown to look different than any other shutdown,” said Joshua Sewell, Taxpayers for Common Sense director of research and policy. He said he expects that the Trump team’s actions would be guided by what they believe achieves the most for them politically.

Trump could use a shutdown to dismantle government functions, wrote Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit focused on improving the federal government.

If lawmakers can’t reach a deal, Stier wrote, Trump and Vought “will have enormous latitude to determine which services, programmes and employees can be sidelined – decisions that could go far beyond what has occurred during past shutdowns”.

Beyond the Antideficiency Act, which says the government cannot spend money or incur debts without Congress’s authority, the shutdown process has historically been guided by traditions, not laws.

In recent past shutdowns, hundreds of thousands of employees were furloughed, but the shutdowns did not result in mass permanent layoffs or significant reorganisations. Under federal law, federal workers also receive back pay for their time on furlough.

Trump and his congressional allies would be in charge of the government amid a shutdown. What could Trump do on his own?

OMB told agencies to ‘consider’ layoff notices

The Trump administration has already reduced the workforce by about 200,000, a number that could grow to 300,000 by the end of the year, Stier wrote. The administration gutted some agencies and programmes, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Voice of America.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided an email, first published by Politico, that it sent to agency heads that said agencies should consider sending “reduction in force” notices to employees whose programmes are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” or lack mandatory funding or another source of funding, such as the tax-and-spending legislation, HR1 (Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”), which became law in July.

Rachel Greszler, a workforce expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the administration hasn’t mandated layoffs, but directed agencies to “consider” issuing such notices “as a way to let federal employees know which of their jobs could be on the line if Congress reduces their agency’s funding”.

This signals to Democrats that healthcare funding demands could backfire, she said, potentially causing further reductions in the size of the federal government.

Several questions remain, including how many employees could face layoffs and when. The memo says once fiscal year 2026 appropriations are enacted, agencies should revise their plans to reduce staff.

“I believe this memo indicates OMB will pursue a dual path of shutdown-related furloughs and a separate process of mass layoffs,” Sewell said. Whether the layoffs happen before or after funding is restored “is an open question”, Sewell said. “This certainly indicates the administration wants to cut these agencies and programmes at any opportunity either now or in the future.”

Experts offered mixed opinions about whether layoffs would hold up in court. Any such process must follow the rules, such as a 60-day written notice.

“A shutdown provides no new legal authority to engage in widespread firings,” said Sam Berger, who works for the liberal Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities and who worked at OMB during the Biden and Obama administrations.

Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader from New York, said the memo is an “attempt at intimidation” and predicted such firings would be reversed.

Social Security cheques and other mandatory spending will continue

Mandatory spending – ongoing spending that does not require periodic extensions from Congress – generally continues during a shutdown. This means Americans would still receive Social Security cheques and be able to use Medicare and Medicaid.

In previous shutdowns, border protection, medical care in hospitals, air traffic control, law enforcement and power grid maintenance were deemed essential and remained active during the shutdown.

Even continued services can be disrupted. During the 2018-19 shutdown, holiday travellers faced delays as many unpaid TSA staff and air traffic controllers didn’t come to work.

Administrations have a lot of leeway to define “essential” workers. During the 2013 shutdown, the Obama administration closed national parks. In 2018, the Trump administration kept many national parks open with limited services using previously paid park entrance fees to cover personnel costs; the Government Accountability Office concluded that this violated federal law.

The second-term Trump administration is expected to continue priorities such as immigration enforcement and might try to focus cuts on areas that have already been slashed. Trump campaigned on a promise to abolish the Education Department, and his administration has shrunk the Environmental Protection Agency.

There have been four shutdowns in recent decades that lasted more than one business day, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25240548052490-1756478286.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-29 10:04:22.506760

Meanwhile, on the supply side, veteran uranium supplier Centrus Energy (LEU -2.19%) has seen its shares soar 450%.
The question now is: Is it too late to buy into Centrus stock?
Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?
The problem is, at its present market capitalization of more than $5 billion, Centrus stock is selling for 47 times free cash flow and 48 times earnings.","In case you haven't noticed, nuclear energy stocks are having a moment in 2025. Four months ago, President Trump signed a series of executive orders designed to accelerate the development of nuclear power stations and secure access to supplies of nuclear fuel in the United States.

Investors in nuclear stocks have been quick to respond to the news. Over the past 12 months, shares of start-ups developing small and micro nuclear reactor plants are on the rise. For example, names like NuScale Power and Nano Nuclear Energy are up 246% and 267%.

Meanwhile, on the supply side, veteran uranium supplier Centrus Energy (LEU -2.19%) has seen its shares soar 450%. Does it still have room to run?

Right place, right time

And what lies behind Centrus's amazing rise -- I mean, in addition to the well-timed support from the President?

Well, there's Russia's war in Ukraine, for one thing. The United States imports 99% of the uranium used in American nuclear power plants, and 27% of that comes from Russia. ""Thanks"" to the war, however, the U.S. government has passed laws banning imports of Russian-sourced uranium, effective in 2028, and that means Centrus' role as a buyer and reseller of imported uranium is only going to get more important over time.

Centrus is further cementing its centrality by developing the capacity to enrich uranium domestically, such that the U.S. won't need to import so much uranium from abroad -- even from friendly suppliers such as France's Orano or from the British-Dutch-German company Urenco.

Alongside Urenco, which operates an enrichment facility in New Mexico, Centrus is the only other company licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to produce low enriched uranium (LEU) in the U.S. (Centrus also possesses a license to produce high-assay enriched uranium, or HALEU, for next-generation nuclear reactors.)

The second part of the puzzle is the artificial intelligence revolution, which is driving up electricity demand to levels where only the rapid building of new nuclear power plants can provide the amounts of power needed. This is why everyone -- from Microsoft to Alphabet to Amazon -- has been inking electricity supply agreements with nuclear power companies lately.

It also speaks clearly to a trend of rising demand for enriched uranium fuel -- which is what Centrus aims to supply.

And yet, this is a story that's been developing for more than a year now -- ever since Constellation Energy Group (CEG 1.59%) announced last year that it would need to reopen Three Mile Island in order to provide the kind of power levels that Microsoft needs. By this point, it's hardly a secret that Centrus is sitting in the proverbial catbird's seat, and likely to profit handsomely as this new nuclear story plays out.

This is the reason Centrus stock is up 450% over the past year. The question now is: Is it too late to buy into Centrus stock? I fear it may be.

Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?

Don't get me wrong -- I'm totally on board with the idea that Centrus will perform well as a business as old reactors ramp their power output, and new reactors -- including new types of small reactors from NuScale, Nano Nuclear, and others -- come online. I'll even acknowledge that Centrus is doing just fine already today.

Centrus recorded a profit of $105 million over the past 12 months -- and these are high-quality profits, resulting in the generation of $107 million in positive free cash flow. The company's balance sheet is also flush, with $400 million more cash than debt in the bank. The problem is, at its present market capitalization of more than $5 billion, Centrus stock is selling for 47 times free cash flow and 48 times earnings.

Those valuations might be defensible if Centrus were growing rapidly today. However, most analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast relatively flat profit growth for the next several years, with earnings only really taking off in 2030 and after, once new reactor types start going online.

While it's possible the stock's valuation will prove justifiable in those years, it's also possible something will happen over the next half-decade to upset this nuclear apple cart, and make Centrus stock look less attractive than investors currently hope for.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835039/nuclear-power-plant-next-to-a-pond-glowing-red-at-sunset.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:14.617123

This announcement, made at the Global Citizen Festival, is an important milestone in the ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa' campaign, co-hosted with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa.

This campaign raises global awareness and mobilises public and private investments for clean energy generation and access across Africa.

President von der Leyen: “The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world. A clean energy transition on the continent will create jobs, stability, growth and the delivery of our global climate goals. The European Union, with the Global Gateway investment plan, is fully committed to supporting Africa on its clean energy path.”

Africa's renewable energy potential is huge, yet nearly 600 million people still live without access to electricity. How this clean energy transition unfolds will play a big role in shaping future development, regional stability, and progress on climate change.

Investing now in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power is not just a moral and development imperative, it is also a strategic choice that strengthens supply chains, creates up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, and makes energy systems more resilient. Through the Global Gateway investment strategy, the European Union is helping accelerate this transition, delivering major investments in generation, transmission, and cross-border electricity trade, while building stable international partnerships.

The €545 million package expands the EU and Team Europe's clean energy efforts in Africa, with new projects supporting electrification, modernize power grids, and improve access to renewables.

Countries with the projects announced include Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Ghana, Central Africa. Madagascar, Mozambique, and Somalia. The ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa' campaign is carried out with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen and relies on the policy support of the International Energy Agency. It aims to drive new commitments on policy and finance from governments, financial institutions, the private sector and philanthropists. They are encouraged to pledge capital or provide support such as expertise and technical assistance.

TRANSCRIPT

Welcome to 20/25 Talks, where we're following our democracy in historic times.

The Republican Party, especially, has kind of used Charlie Kirk as a symbol to suppress free speech, whether it's late-night TV show hosts or J.D. Vance encouraging people to report people who said things.

Arkansas high school senior Ariana Minkle says they're watching teachers get fired for online comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Minkle and some of her peers host a youth podcast on community radio in Little Rock, and she says they're concerned to see political speech censored.

Michigan authorities identified the gunman, who they say rammed a pickup into a packed Mormon church and opened fire, killing two.

They haven't said what the motive of 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, a Narock war vet, was.

President Donald Trump meets with congressional leaders today in a last-ditch bid to avoid a government shutdown.

Tomorrow, he plans to address an unusual gathering of high-ranking military officers.

That meeting is being described as a pep rally for the services.

Domestic violence shelters say funding cuts and confusion about policy changes will put the lives of survivors and their children at real and immediate risk.

The White House now says shelters can't use federal funds to take in undocumented migrants or offer specific protections to trans individuals.

Krista Colon leads the California partnership to end domestic violence.

If I offer a night of shelter to someone who may be undocumented, is my entire funding at risk?

If I sex an individual's pronouns, am I now going to be a target?

Funding levels have never been enough, but federal funding is a cornerstone for programs nationwide.

Tomorrow is the last day to qualify for federal tax credits of up to $7,500 on new electric vehicles, ended in the Republican budget mega-bill.

Critics argue that will undermine clean energy jobs, but Ohio GOP Senator Bernie Marino says the government shouldn't be picking car market winners and losers. - That's not about what kind of car I like or I don't like.

What it's about is letting the marketplace choose.

So get rid of all the incentives, get rid of all the mandates. - Advocates for seniors are warning about the phase out of paper Social Security checks that starts tomorrow.

More than half a million Americans will be forced to use direct deposit or prepaid debit cards.

Maria Friess with the National Committee to preserve Social Security and Medicare says that could be tough for some rural and low-income seniors.

""They may or may not read the material that comes in with their checks.

They may or may not understand the material.

And they may not have any idea that this is coming.""

The administration says it'll improve security.

Critics argue it risks payment delays for folks without bank accounts and gives a windfall to some payment companies.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has ended his re-election campaign amid extensive accusations of corruption.

Adams was running far behind Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani.

There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.” The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well.
California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.
The report forecast US storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.","The United States had a record quarter for battery energy storage deployment from April to June, adding 5.6 GW of installations, according to a report released by the ACP and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage led the way, adding 4.9 GW in the quarter and growing 62% year-over-year. This is enough to power 3.7 million US homes during average peak-demand hours, said the ACP.

California, Texas, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of storage in the quarter, said the report. Wood Mackenzie forecast that Florida and Georgia will be major growth markets, ahead, due to aggressive procurement by vertically integrated utilities. For example, Georgia Power just issued a request for proposals for 500 MW of grid-scale storage.

However, supply challenges may hamper utility-scale growth, said Allison Weis, global head of storage at Wood Mackenzie. Weiss commented, “After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC [investment tax credit]. While domestic cell supply is ramping up, supply chain shortages are possible although developers are continuing to consider supply from China to fill in any gaps. A rush to start construction under the more-certain near-term regulatory framework uplifts the near-term forecast. Projects that have not met certain milestones by the end of 2025 are at risk of exposure to changing regulations. There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.”

The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well. It added 608 MW in the quarter, representing a 132% increase year-on-year. Most of the growth was driven by California, Arizona, and Illinois, as attachment rates hit new highs and higher-capacity systems gained market share.

Batteries are included at an increased rate in quoted residential solar projects, said a report from EnergySage. Outside of Hawaii, which has a 100% battery attachment rate, California led the way among top-10 solar state markets, with 79% of quoted projects including batteries. This was followed by Texas (61%), Arizona (47%), Utah (44%), Florida (43%), and Illinois (25%).

“Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets like California and Puerto Rico, and continued ITC access through third-party ownership,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

The community-scale, commercial and industrial segment expanded 11% in Q2, adding 38 MW. California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.

The report forecast US storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.

However, the report warns US utility-scale storage installations could drop 10%, year-over-year, in 2027, largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern regulations on battery cell sourcing.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BESS.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:42.228073

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Therefore, accelerating renewable energy integration in the power system and electrification of the transport and industry sectors are crucial.
Currently, global markets demand products with smaller carbon footprints, while data centres and electric vehicles (EVs) seek clean electricity.
Notably, this policy applies exclusively to data centres, reflecting the government’s strong commitment to supporting the industry’s growth.
By advancing its energy transition, Thailand can gain a competitive edge in attracting clean investment for data centres.","Thailand updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in 2022, in which it committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 30% below a business-as-usual level, which is about 388 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), by 2030. With adequate international support, Thailand will aim for a 40% reduction, or 333 MtCO2. To meet carbon neutrality by 2050, Thailand will need to reduce its GHG emissions by 73-83% compared to 2015 levels.

Given that the energy sector accounted for about 69% of total emissions in 2019, decarbonising it will be indispensable to cut emissions. Within the energy sector, the power and transport sectors took up to 68% of total emissions in 2022. Therefore, accelerating renewable energy integration in the power system and electrification of the transport and industry sectors are crucial.

The draft RPDP sets ambitious emission reduction targets for the power sector, which reduce CO2 emissions by 18% in 2030 and 38% in 2037, compared to the previous plan. Under this pathway, emissions are projected to fall from 95.5 to 77.7 MtCO2 in 2030, and from 99.7 to 61.8 MtCO2 in 2037.

Achieving these targets will be particularly important given the country’s export-oriented manufacturing strategy, rising demand from data centres and EV adoption. Currently, global markets demand products with smaller carbon footprints, while data centres and electric vehicles (EVs) seek clean electricity. Aligning with international governance frameworks is imperative to maintaining Thailand’s global competitiveness in this era of growth.

Thailand is positioning itself as a regional green manufacturing hub, with a strong focus on electric vehicles. Under its 30@30 policy, unveiled in 2021, the government aims for zero-emission vehicles to make up at least 30% of total auto production by 2030. That target could drive exponential growth in EV adoption over the coming years.

The country is on the right track to promote a rapid EV adoption, which will help attract foreign investment, build new skills, and leverage its long-standing auto industry expertise. But, to fully realise the climate benefits of transport electrification, the power system must evolve in parallel with EV adoption, ensuring that clean energy supplies the rising demand for charging.

According to the RPDP, EVs are likely to account for about 68 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity demand by 2037, or roughly 20% of total consumption. The plan also assumes a 40% reduction in peak demand from EV charging through demand-response incentives and vehicle-to-grid integration. Ember’s analysis suggests the projection underestimates the real impact. Adjusting to a more realistic scenario, with peak demand rising to 50% of the normal peak pattern starting in 2026, the forecast adds an extra 3,355 megawatts (MW) above the RPDP baseline – lifting total peak demand to 57,901 MW by 2037.

The EV boom presents a double-edged sword: it risks straining the grid while accelerating the decarbonisation of road transport. Ensuring that clean energy powers EV charging will be crucial.

Thailand is looking to create a booming market for data centres, which is expected to grow at an annual rate of 7.5%-8.5% between 2025 and 2027 due to rising internet and digital payment usage, widespread cloud adoption, and AI integration across sectors.

The country’s “Cloud First” policy is a government initiative to speed up cloud computing adoption in both public and private sectors. The favourable policy has, so far, attracted $2.8 billion from major investors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, TikTok, Huawei, ST Telemedia and NTT. Google also announced a $1 billion investment in data centres last year to meet growing cloud demand and support AI adoption in ASEAN. The country also benefits from strategic connectivity to China and India, alongside growing links to other markets through an expanding submarine cable network.

Thailand’s electricity demand for data centres is forecast to grow at 8% CAGR from 2025 to 2027 and reach 6 TWh by 2030, or 2.2 % of total electricity demand. Our cost-optimal pathway factors this additional demand from data centres with the assumption of the growth rate to remain constant throughout the whole timeframe, adding about 10 TWh of electricity demand in 2037.

To ensure clean energy meets this demand, in late 2024, the Thai government approved a direct power purchase pilot project. This enables investors in data centres of at least 50 MW to purchase electricity directly from renewable energy generators under a direct power purchase agreement (DPPA). The total procurement capacity of the Pilot Project is expected to be 2,000 MW.

For the first time in the country, the single-buyer system is being relaxed to ease the monopoly over electricity trading and transmission access. Notably, this policy applies exclusively to data centres, reflecting the government’s strong commitment to supporting the industry’s growth.

This incentive paves the way for hyperscale data centre companies to invest in Thailand, as many have pledged to 100% use of renewable energy in data centres. For instance, Microsoft is committed to having 100% of its electricity consumption matched hourly by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030, Amazon set a goal to supply all of the electricity consumed with 100% renewable energy by 2030, but already achieved it 7 years earlier. Google’s next major target is to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

Malaysia and Indonesia are considering adding more gas capacity or delaying fossil fuel phase-outs to meet rising data centre demand – an approach that runs counter to the renewable energy commitments of major data centre investors. By advancing its energy transition, Thailand can gain a competitive edge in attracting clean investment for data centres.

“The EEA has criticised the quality of our waterways, waste management, and our high volume of fossil fuel usage – all problems which have worsened as a result of government policies.

“85% of our protected habitats are now considered to have an unfavourable status, while one third of our protected species have received the same label – horrifically, over half of native plant species are in decline and more than 50 bird species are of high conservation concern.

“We cannot afford to lose any more species than we already have – the knock-on effect of biodiversity loss is catastrophic for all facets of life.

“Today, I’m visiting the site of August’s fish kill in the River Blackwater, County Cork, where up to 42,000 fish died as a result of an unknown pollutant – this event is emblematic of the government’s approach towards environmental protection.

“Last week, a multi-agency report said the cause of the fish kill cannot be identified – I’m meeting local anglers today to assess the effects of the kill on the local community.

“Meanwhile, Ireland’s nitrate derogation has resulted in the nitrate levels in our rivers jumping by a staggering 16 percent in the first six months of this year – this is disastrous for our water quality and biodiversity.

“Despite our awareness of this issue, the government refuses to plan for any alternative future without the derogation, leaving farmers and rural communities in complete uncertainty.

“Ireland’s transition from a linear to a circular economy has never been taken seriously by the State – our plastic recycling rates, for example, are shockingly low at 30%, lagging behind the EU target of 50% – this is a direct result of poor policy decisions, a lack of enforcement, and chronic underfunding.

“It is the opinion of the Environmental Protection Agency that it is already too late for us to meet our 2025 EU recycling targets – lessons must be learned from these failings.

“Environmental policy must be front-footed to preserve nature in Ireland – Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have been playing catch-up for years now, allowing the health of our countryside and waterways to degrade at an alarming rate.

“The government must comply with the EEA’s report and introduce urgent, large-scale measures that go beyond the weak plans and policies that have left us in this mess.

“The average EU spending per country on environmental protection measures in the last five years was 2.2% of GDP, but Ireland’s expenditure was just 0.9% – Budget ‘26 must allocate greater funding towards environmental initiatives to ensure this disaster does not become irreversible.

Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high.
“More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.” Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation.
Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump’s megabill.","“For nine months, we watched this Administration and congressional Republicans do everything to stifle clean energy, and clean energy is the fastest growing and the cheapest source of electricity,” Rep. Mike Levin (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner.

“Republicans are blocking the only sources of energy that can be built fast enough to meet growing demand and cheaply enough to actually keep energy bills in check,” he added, pointing to expiring clean energy tax credits.

Following the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Democrats not only leaned into the cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicaid, but have also highlighted the GOP’s aggressive phasing out of clean energy tax credits from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Trump’s multitrillion-dollar spending plan extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The massive piece of legislation, passed through a process called reconciliation, not only extends the lower individual tax rates that were part of the 2017 law but also makes them permanent.

The cost of electricity has continued to soar for most Americans and is shaping up to be a campaign issue for the 2025 and 2026 elections. In the New Jersey governor’s election this November, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) and Republican Jack Ciattarelli have both shifted their focus as electricity bills are at the top of voters’ minds in the state.

“Day One as governor, I’m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills,” said Sherrill in her first TV ad of the general election.

Ciattarelli pledged to “lower electricity bills” in a campaign ad and has worked to tie Sherrill to the current Democratic governor on electricity prices as he looks to an “all of the above approach.”

The New Jersey gubernatorial race is not the only place where energy prices are being made a center point. Just this week, Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) announced a rebate program for utility bill payments as part of his latest effort to lower energy costs for Marylanders. He’s up for reelection in 2026.

Levin and Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) launched a “cheap energy agenda” aiming to address rising energy bills by restoring tax credits for cheap energy, building out a modernized electricity grid, connecting cheap energy to the grid, developing cheap, clean energy, protecting consumers, and involving communities in energy projects.

Levin said his legislation is a direct result of concerns brought to him by his constituents.

“I think there’s a great deal of frustration that you have people in my district and districts all across the country who are really struggling to make ends meet, costs are very high across the board, and electricity bills are going up and up and up, and others that want to do energy efficiency upgrades are finding those upgrades to be extremely expensive without these credits,” Levin told the Washington Examiner.

Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high.

“Americans want lower costs, and rising energy bills will be a regular, unavoidable reminder to voters that House Republicans have failed miserably at fulfilling their central campaign promise,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Viet Shelton told the Washington Examiner. “Broken promises and working families facing bigger and bigger bills because of the Big, Ugly Law — these will be the leading reasons Republicans will lose their majority next year.”

Rep. Josh Riley (D-NY) has also been highlighting high electricity prices. He introduced the Keep the Lights Local Act, which aims to cut costs.

“Utility bills in Upstate New York haven’t been this high in a decade,” Riley wrote on social media. “More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.”

Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation. For the year ending in August, electricity shot up 6.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index.

The Trump administration has blamed Biden-era green energy initiatives and the accelerated phaseout of traditional fossil fuels such as coal. Trump called increased reliance on wind and solar energy production “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!”

In an interview with the Washington Examiner in August, Energy Secretary Chris Wright backed up Trump’s assessment.

“If you take a grid or a system and grow the renewables penetration, you will raise the price of it,” Wright said. “The president’s 100% correct in that.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is seeking to hold or flip House seats in New York and California, said higher utility rates are the result of blue state leadership.

“Utility rates in blue states are the direct result of the failed leadership, misplaced priorities, reckless spending, and radical policies of governors like [Gavin] Newsom and [Kathy] Hochul,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told the Washington Examiner. “No false attack changes the fact that liberal wish lists in Albany and Sacramento have driven up prices for their constituents while Republicans are left cleaning up their mess.”

A September analysis by Inside Climate News found the average household price of electricity in the United States rose by 9.5% this year, with the highest spikes found in Missouri (38.3% increase), North Dakota (33.6%), New Jersey (28.6%), Iowa (27.5%), and Montana (25.3%)

The blame game comes as the cost of living is a persistent issue for voters across the nation, specifically, concerns about the rising cost of energy.

According to left-wing think tank Data for Progress, 60% of voters reported paying more for electric bills than last year. A PowerLines poll conducted with Ipsos shows that “three out of four Americans, across party lines, say they are worried about rising utility bills.” The Energy Information Administration estimated that average residential electricity prices in the U.S. will jump from $0.1648 per kilowatt-hour in 2024 to around $0.1790 per kilowatt-hour next year.

HALEY STEVENS TO FILE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST RFK JR.

As prices continue to rise, clean energy advocates insist that renewables are not to blame, arguing that some states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power. EIA data compiled by American Clean Power show that the top 10 states with the largest share of renewables in their energy makeup have seen significantly smaller electricity price hikes over the last year than the national average (a roughly 2.5% increase).

Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump’s megabill. From the onset, Democrats labeled the bill the “big, ugly law,” as they held hundreds of events across the country to say that Medicaid cost savings would kick millions of people off their healthcare. Democrats plan to stick to their plan of slamming the bill, even though the tightening of Medicaid eligibility won’t kick in until after the 2026 elections.

The potential buyer couldn’t immediately be determined, the report said.

Occidental, which is backed by Warren Buffett, has been divesting assets in an effort to reduce debt. The divestment is likely to be announced in the coming weeks, the report said.

The Houston-based firm previously helped drive a consolidation in US oil and gas that includes its takeover of Anadarko Petroleum Corp. in 2019 and the $10.8 billion acquisition of CrownRock LP last year. Occidental has embarked on a divestiture program since the CrownRock transaction.

Shares of energy companies including Occidental, Chevron, ExxonMobil and Diamondback Energy rose last week after President Donald Trump said the US was open to imposing more tariffs on Russia and called on European countries to stop buying Russian oil.

Occidental has a diverse international footprint in oil and gas, according to Bloomberg Intelligence. Even so, its onshore assets are still expected to provide most of its profit and free cash flow.

Occidental subsidiary 1PointFive this month formed a 50-50 joint venture with Enbridge Inc. to develop the Pelican Sequestration Hub and related transportation infrastructure in Louisiana.

Among the emerging technologies, lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) batteries are drawing growing attention as a next-generation solution. Forecasts indicate that the LMFP market will expand from USD 1.85 billion in 2025 to USD 6.79 billion by 2034, advancing at a robust CAGR of 15.55 percent. This surge is being fueled by the automotive sector’s demand for high-quality batteries, accelerating investments in battery manufacturing, and government support for energy infrastructure worldwide.

LMFP batteries represent a significant step forward in battery technology. By introducing manganese to the traditional lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, these batteries achieve improved energy density and extended performance. Available in prismatic, cylindrical, and pouch formats, LMFP batteries are versatile enough to serve passenger and commercial electric vehicles, energy storage systems, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. Their combination of safety, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability is driving adoption across multiple industries.

In 2025, Asia-Pacific dominated the market, reflecting its leadership in both electric vehicle adoption and battery manufacturing. China, in particular, continues to play a decisive role, supported by abundant raw material resources, rapid expansion of lithium mining, and a robust ecosystem of manufacturers including BYD, CALB, and CATL. The region’s influence was highlighted by BYD’s launch of its second-generation LMFP blade battery in 2024, designed to enhance the driving range of light-duty vehicles. Looking ahead, Europe is set to record the fastest growth rate. Countries such as Germany, France, and Italy are ramping up production of commercial EVs and supporting domestic battery manufacturing through major government-backed initiatives. The recent announcement by Verkor to establish a new battery plant in Dunkirk underlines the region’s determination to compete globally.

The automotive sector remains the cornerstone of LMFP battery demand. Electric vehicles account for the largest share of adoption, as carmakers increasingly rely on LMFP chemistry to extend driving range and improve performance without compromising on safety. At the same time, the energy storage sector is rapidly emerging as a major growth driver. Utilities and grid operators are turning to LMFP batteries for backup power and load balancing, recognizing their reliability in managing fluctuating renewable energy supply. This dual role in both mobility and energy infrastructure positions LMFP batteries as a critical enabler of a more sustainable future.

From a technological perspective, the market reflects both tradition and innovation. Conventional cathode synthesis methods continue to dominate due to their scalability and cost efficiency.

These initiatives not only reduce reliance on imports but also ensure that local industries can compete on the global stage.

The distribution landscape reflects this momentum. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) dominate sales channels, as automakers prefer to secure batteries directly from trusted partners, ensuring quality and after-sales support. At the same time, the aftermarket is becoming increasingly important, offering replacement and low-cost solutions for consumers and smaller businesses. The rise of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart as distributors of LMFP batteries further illustrates how diversified the sales ecosystem has become.

Challenges remain, particularly around scaling up production and balancing costs with performance. Yet the pace of innovation and investment suggests that LMFP batteries are set to move from niche to mainstream far faster than earlier technologies. Their unique blend of safety, affordability, and energy performance positions them as a compelling alternative in a market hungry for solutions that can support both mobility and energy storage needs.

As the world accelerates toward electrification, LMFP batteries are poised to play a defining role. They embody the convergence of science, industry, and policy, standing at the intersection of consumer demand for greener mobility and society’s broader push toward sustainable energy.

The DOE report was written by five contrarian researchers whose work has long been perceived as being outside the vast body of climate science, which has shown for years that the burning of fossil fuels is driving global temperatures higher.

Since the report’s release, there has been push back from the science community about how the report’s assertions conflict with decades of research and hundreds of studies. Among the critics are dozens of researchers whose work was cited by the DOE authors, and a new assessment by the National Academies that directly contradicts the government’s assertions by showing how greenhouse gases are endangering human health.

On Wednesday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the report’s findings were taken straight from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other comprehensive climate reports written by hundreds of scientists, but “just in a format that’s easier or accessible, easier for people to read.”

“There’s nothing different in the science in our report and the science in the IPCC reports or even in the National Academy report,” Wright said at an event hosted by The New York Times during Climate Week in New York. “If you’re honest and sober about climate change, to politicians, to the media, that’s a bit of a threat. It kind of gets in the way of a political movement.”

Indeed, failure to land a deal on a stopgap funding measure before Wednesday would force a shutdown with sweeping implications for federal programs.

It would trigger lapses in authorizations for myriad energy and environment programs, halt most agency work, restrict disaster relief during hurricane season and prompt the White House to carry out its threat to permanently lay off thousands of federal workers.

Before last week’s recess, Senate Republicans rejected a Democratic funding proposal that would have extended government funding while adding more than $1 trillion in new health care spending and imposing guardrails on the White House’s spending moves.

Then, Senate Democrats blocked passage of Republicans’ “clean” funding extension, which had already passed out of the House. Democrats balked at the bill because it did not include their priorities and was not the result of bipartisan negotiations.

This week, Congress may look to pick up where the Senate left off. Thune is expected to put the Republican continuing resolution up for a vote again and dare Democrats to oppose it a second time before the funding deadline.

“The president wants to talk with [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)] about that and say, ‘Don’t do that,’” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Sunday.

House and Senate leaders doubled down on their party’s negotiating stances in television interviews Sunday, appearing to leave little room for compromise. Republican and Democratic leaders have been preemptively blaming each other for the potential funding lapse.

While they welcomed the meeting with Trump, Democrats expressed skepticism that it could be fruitful. A similar meeting between Trump and Democratic leaders in 2018 quickly spiraled out of control.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” Schumer said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “But my hope is it will be a serious negotiation.”

House Republicans are holding a conference-wide call Monday morning, according to POLITICO, and House Democrats have plans to meet on their own Monday evening in Washington. Jeffries has called on Democrats to be on Capitol Hill this week even though Johnson canceled votes.

House GOP leaders have discussed potentially not bringing the House back into session at all this week if there is a shutdown Wednesday, POLITICO reported.

Jeffries said in a “dear colleague” letter last week that “Democrats will be in town and prepared to get the job done.”

This study is the first of its kind in the region and will undertake a feasibility assessment of the area’s geology to host energy storage technologies, allowing for the decarbonisation of adjacent gas-fired peaking power plants (those that only run when there is high demand) such as that at Knapton.

The Knapton, Vale of Pickering and North Yorkshire area hosts a fantastic diversity of geology that may be used for storing hydrogen. The region contains numerous depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs that may have potential for repurposing, alongside other porous rock aquifers, salt deposits and rocks that may support lined rock shafts. The study will generate an understanding of what is possible for hydrogen storage at scale in the local area, supporting the area’s local economy and the UK’s energy security.

Keith Owen, Head of Energy Futures at Northern Gas Networks said: As more renewables come online, energy storage will be critical to UK energy security and to clean power. Understanding the full potential for storing hydrogen at scale through Knapton H2 Storage will give us key insights into how we can deliver technologies to provide clean resilience on the days where the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.

Chris McClane, Energy Transition Interface Manager at Centrica said: “Centrica’s Knapton site is being redeveloped as a clean energy hub for solar generation, green hydrogen production, and battery storage. We’re also exploring hydrogen storage as it offers a reliable, flexible solution to support the energy system of the future that will require diverse fuel supplies ready for when the sun doesn’t shine and wind doesn’t blow. This project will advance the readiness of hydrogen storage technologies by unlocking a replica model to realise its potential at scale to supply hydrogen-to-power generation.”

Edward Hough, Research lead, Underground Energy Storage at the British Geological Survey said: “The natural geology of the area around Knapton will play an important role in supporting the use of hydrogen in the region. Storing hydrogen gives flexibility to the energy system, allowing excess hydrogen to be stored for use during periods when demand exceeds supply. In this project, BGS will build on its extensive laboratory and mapping programmes to help identify areas of the underground geology that may represent future exploration targets for hydrogen storage in bedrock.”

The federal government had come a long way from the heckuva-job-Brownie days of George W. Bush and Michael Brown, the unqualified head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) who mangled the Hurricane Katrina disaster response in New Orleans and on the Gulf Coast.

Yet 20 years and another unqualified FEMA leader later, despite reforms intended to guard against future agency heads joking (or not) about the hurricane season, America’s disaster response has devolved into something more akin to the pre-FEMA era’s improvisions. After two decades of major disasters in the 1960s and ’70s like the Hilo, Hawaii, tsunami, the Alaska earthquake (the worst in American history), and major hurricanes including Agnes, the National Governors Association called for a reorganization of the country’s decentralized emergency preparedness and disaster response systems in 1977. FEMA debuted two years later.

The Trump administration’s zeal to stamp out a flawed but essential agency has been interrupted by the mind-numbing display of bureaucratic micromanaging: the federal response to the Central Texas flash floods in July that killed 135 people, among them children vacationing in summer camps. “As sad as that is, unfortunately, that is typically what moves the needle in terms of disaster policy throughout history,” says Jeff Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “It’s not the data forecasting what’s going to happen. It’s the lives lost when it does happen—and this happened in a red state.”

The requirement that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sign off on agency expenses above $100,000 compromised FEMA disaster hotline availability and search and rescue missions so severely that FEMA’s head of urban search and rescue resigned in frustration.

None of those facts made it into an August DHS press release that offered an upbeat, wholly unsubstantiated perspective on the agency, declaring that after 200 days, “FEMA is 100% faster in getting boots-on-the-ground to respond to disasters.” Nim Kidd, the head of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, claimed, “I’ve been doing this for more than 30 years, and I can say with confidence that this was the fastest and most effective federal support Texas has ever received.”

Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order that “empowers State, local, and individual preparedness and injects common sense into infrastructure prioritization and strategic investments through risk-informed decisions that make our infrastructure, communities, and economy resilient to global and dynamic threats and hazards.” An administration “review council” will consider what comes next for the emasculated agency, with a final report due in November.

Only the federal government can come up with billions of dollars in the direst catastrophes.

But common sense isn’t so common. Only the federal government can come up with the billions of dollars and assets to backstop the 50 states, local governments, territories, and tribal lands in the direst catastrophes. In an era when storms and wildfires are more frequent, stronger, and more expensive to respond to and recover from, shifting more of that burden onto states and localities after a jumble of executive orders, layoffs, firings, and delaying or withholding funds displays an obsession with cost-cutting by any means necessary and no concern with the ability of states to deal with catastrophes.

One long-held fallacy that cratered FEMA’s public image is the misguided belief that the federal government parachutes in with fists full of dollars to backstop local efforts as soon as the rains end or the last embers flicker out. It’s led to “Where’s FEMA?” outbursts by angry, despondent survivors who aren’t aware of officials scrambling, or have been taken in by mis/disinformation that compounds their agonies.

After a disaster, local and state officials are the first ones on the ground in many cases, not FEMA. The amount of financial assistance that a community might receive depends on the scope of devastation. A small storm or fire that affects few properties, with no loss of life, particularly in areas that are susceptible to severe storms and wildfires, is usually handled by municipalities and states.

Even broader damage might still not reach the federal threshold for a disaster declaration. The federal government has been selective in how it responds. The National Emergency Management Association reports that in fiscal year 2023 there were nearly 25,000 disasters in the United States; of those, only 60 received a federal disaster declaration.

Under the 1988 Stafford Act, the president approves major disaster declarations for cataclysmic situations that are beyond the capabilities of local and state officials, and emergency declarations for smaller upheavals where federal assistance can help stave off more serious consequences.

“The issue that it often comes down to is who is going to pay for those resources?” says Samantha Montano, a Massachusetts Maritime Academy associate professor of emergency management. “That’s why that declaration is so important, because it comes with money.”

FEMA has historically paid most of the costs for major disasters. Urging states to improve how they gear up for seasonal upheavals like tornadoes, hurricanes, and wildfires is not new. Having states budget for disasters as they might for education or health care has had support from Democrats and Republicans. One such proposal, a state disaster deductible proposed by Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator during the Obama years, evaporated under the first Trump administration.

But swerving from dependence on Washington after a catastrophe to deep budget cuts and homegrown self-reliance in just a few months produced the horror show that played out on the ground in Texas Hill Country.

PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED A MAJOR DISASTER declaration for North Carolina after Tropical Storm Helene on September 28, 2024. The day before, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) approved the deployment of an eight-member volunteer urban search and rescue team to assist local officials in western North Carolina under the auspices of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). The mayor of Norwalk agreed to send a volunteer from the city’s fire department, a hazmat command and communications unit, along with a fire department utility truck and an ATV for the mission.

EMAC, a national mutual aid framework overseen by the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA), provides disaster relief in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands, with people and equipment, but not funding. States providing assistance can seek reimbursement or send aid at no cost to a receiving state; but that is not linked to a state’s request for a federal declaration or funding. Connecticut and the other New England states also have reciprocal disaster assistance relationships with Canada’s eastern provinces through the International Emergency Management Assistance Compact.

With fewer natural disasters, Connecticut sends more assistance than it receives. “When we put in a bid to help another state, we up front say this is what it’s going to cost, so we know what resources are going to get reimbursed if we send them,” says William Turner, the state’s emergency management director. “[EMAC] is really the mechanism that allows all of us to respond and recover before we have to get FEMA pulled in. We’ve got that piece pretty well figured out. We just need to understand where FEMA is going to end up when the dust settles.”

In New Orleans, local residents have stepped into the city’s disaster preparedness void.

EMAC isn’t safe from a disintegrating FEMA. The mutual aid system runs exclusively on National Incident Management System funding provided through DHS and FEMA. However, in early September, FEMA failed to sign off on EMAC’s annual $2 million grant. Lynn Budd, NEMA’s president, told the national news outlet NOTUS that the episode “certainly flies in the face of the idea that states need to take on more responsibility.” The system finally received its monies, but this snafu raises critical questions about how EMAC can remain effective and navigate the volatile federal environment.

“EMAC works well, as long as there is trust and security among the states that there is going to be funding to pay for those resources,” Montano says. “Once you lose assurance that there is going to be funding for those resources, that can break apart very quickly, not because other states don’t want to help each other, but because the funding isn’t there to do it.”

Before Helene, North Carolina was fairly well off, with a healthy $5 billion in its reserve fund for disasters. Today, about $1 billion has gone to disaster relief, with that account now down to about $3.5 billion. State officials have estimated the total cost of Helene at $60 billion. The proposed state budget for fiscal year 2026 is nearly $34 billion. FEMA has reimbursed about $1 billion.

Trying to work around bureaucratic inertia can backfire. Henderson County in western North Carolina decided not to wait for FEMA funds for debris removal and spent $20 million up front, thinking that the federal payout would be speedier. Across the border, Tennessee took another tack, setting up a Helene Emergency Assistance Loan Program. The $100 million loan fund provides no-interest loans to eligible counties for hauling debris, as well as water and wastewater infrastructure repairs.

Even wealthy states that see frequent natural disasters don’t have the fiscal wherewithal to absorb the multibillions of a major catastrophe. Florida relies heavily on the federal government for response assistance and dollars. In the wildfire sector, California and Washington have devised budgetary formulas based on past disaster costs to allocate funds to disaster accounts. Montana moves a portion of excess general funds once every two years into a wildfire suppression fund. But though those steps have to be taken, particularly now, they don’t deliver enough money.

For some states, moving from “what if” to the “when” in state disaster budgeting is a radical paradigm shift. Historically less-prepared states have had to step up recovery and resilience programs. After several years of federal disaster declarations, an extreme rainfall event in 2015, and Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018, South Carolina created an office of resilience. Focusing on coastal and riverine areas, the state encourages strategies to manage waterways and mitigate flooding across communities, recognizing that if a downstream area has strong building codes, storm plans, and public awareness of risks, those efforts may not matter much if an upstream town doesn’t make comparable investments.

Being proactive is critical, says Peter Muller of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Managing Fiscal Risks project. “They’re trying to put money aside for costs they know they’re going to have, officially, before it happens, so that you don’t have to go and suddenly scramble and pull money from other priorities when a disaster does happen.”

Local residents also have stepped in to fill disaster preparedness gaps. Imagine Water Works, a New Orleans climate and disaster relief group, set up community power stations in neighborhoods after Hurricane Zeta in 2020, when three hurricanes and two tropical storms hit the state, the most in any calendar year. Residents were able to charge devices at homes and businesses that still had or regained power.

With the pandemic raging, residents were also able to pick up hand sanitizer, masks, and other COVID-19 supplies. The group asked fire stations to host charging stations and help people get oxygen for medical devices. They reached out to the city again the following year, and by the third year New Orleans officials began to duplicate their efforts. Fire stations also offer cooling facilities now.

With a robust network of indigenous and LGBTQ people, the group also has locations in Houma and southwest Louisiana as well as other local groups across the Deep South. “My relationship is very good with government. Folks who work in that space will contact me directly and ask for help spreading messages to folks, and we have a large social media presence, and we’re trusted,” says Klie Kliebert, the group’s executive director.

TO MARK THE KATRINA ANNIVERSARY, a group of past and present FEMA employees demanded that Congress wake up to the threat posed by dumping the agency leadership reforms that came out of the 2005 debacle. Some employees were suspended. Restoring FEMA’s independence has support in Congress, but saving FEMA, much less any of the dozens of vital agencies that have been rocketed into oblivion by the Trump administration, hasn’t prioritized faster action.

President Trump’s assault on disaster assistance has had one unifying effect, ginning up varying degrees of outrage and disbelief from every corner of the country. In the short term at least, there’s been the faintest glimmer of off-camera comity between Texas and California, two of the most disaster-prone states in the country, despite the cold civil war over redistricting: In mid-July, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sent a three-member human remains detection team to Texas, which boosted urban search and rescue personnel in Texas to 42 people.

Twenty states have sued FEMA and DHS to restore funding that had already been allocated under incentivized mitigation programs like Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC), enacted under the first Trump administration. This second time around, FEMA canceled BRIC. A federal judge ordered the White House to halt any reallocation of $4 billion in BRIC funds.

2025 has been a quiet season on the hurricane front—so far. Escaping the threat posed by Hurricane Erin, which steered off into the open Atlantic away from coasts, appears to have dampened any urgency in Washington surrounding this mess. What happens next will signal whether the states can hang together and demand an end to whims disguised as policy or whether federalism is as moribund as the rest of America’s democratic systems. It may take another massive calamity to field-test that proposition.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23597/download/OCT25%20Gurley.jpg?cb=e58d652a1a0ea9dd369144bbb979e0ec&w=1024,N,,2025-09-29 06:57:55.146929

Beyond scaling capacity, fuel cells also provide operational flexibility.
Bridging the gap with fuel cells Fuel cells provide utilities with a proven, flexible solution to meet growing electricity demand.
By integrating fuel cells into their energy strategy, utilities can capture new growth, retain high-value customers and ensure economic development remains in their regions.","The power industry is at the center of America’s economic growth story. Access to power has become a decisive factor in economic growth. For data centers, manufacturers and other large-load customers, the grid is now a gating factor in site selection for new facilities - and they can’t wait for years for infrastructure to catch up. With interconnection queues stretching upwards of five years in parts of the country, utilities must adopt new and agile strategies that deliver power on accelerated timelines.

Fuel cells offer a flexible and responsive approach to meeting electricity demand that is growing at rates not seen since the 1950s. Their modular design allows for rapid deployment close to the load, helping utilities address immediate capacity needs and support large customers.

By integrating fuel cells into their strategy, utilities can bridge power gaps and position themselves to capture new growth, rather than risk losing business opportunities because new prospective customers have to migrate to regions with more accessible electricity.

Power that keeps pace with demand

For utilities, the challenge isn’t just adding capacity — it’s adding it fast enough to keep pace with customers. Failure to deliver on accelerated timelines can mean losing major customers, and the economic development they bring, to other regions.

“The market has flipped in just a few years,” said Scott Dayer, director of utility and IPP origination at Bloom Energy. “Electrification was already accelerating, and now compute demand is surging on top of that. Together, they’ve turned a system that for years had surplus into one where the real challenge is adding capacity fast enough to keep up with large, hard-to-forecast loads.”

Fuel cells give utilities a way to meet that need without waiting for new transmission lines, substations or conventional generation. They are also a faster alternative to constructing traditional forms of colocated generation like gas engines and turbines, where a customer installs and manages its own onsite power.

Bloom Energy, for example, can deliver up to 50MW in as little as 90 days. With 1 GW of annual production capacity today and 2 GW expected by the end of 2026, Bloom can support utilities in bringing hundreds of MW online in under six months.

For utilities, this capability provides a critical bridge. Fuel cells can serve large-load customers immediately while infrastructure upgrades progress. Plus, unlike gas turbines or reciprocating engines, fuel cells operate quietly, have a smaller footprint and carry a significantly lower emissions profile, making permitting easier and deployments more acceptable to neighboring communities.Crucially, fuel cells deliver firm 24/7 power, ensuring utilities can reliably meet customer demand as projects come online.

Power that scales with demand

Fuel cells offer scalable power that can be deployed at customer sites or at distribution substations, giving utilities maximum flexibility to match load growth over time. For example, Bloom’s skid-mounted “copy-and-paste” modular architecture enables rapid deployment at any scale — from hundreds of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts — without introducing scaling risk.

This flexibility is especially valuable for large-load customers such as colocation data centers, where demand can expand quickly as new tenants move in after construction is complete. The compact, skid-mounted design of fuel cell systems allows utilities to scale power efficiently. For example, a 20,000-square-foot ground mount can provide 30 MW of power. The same footprint, with a four-unit-tall install configuration, can deliver 100 MW.

Case in Point: AEP Delivers for AWS with Bloom Fuel Cells

American Electric Power (AEP) will be utilizing Bloom Energy Server systems to provide immediate, reliable power to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cologix data centers in Central Ohio. The fuel cells will enable the customer to begin operations quickly while AEP continues to permit and build out traditional transmission solutions over a multi-year timeline. Under these long-term agreements, the customers cover the full project costs, protecting utility ratepayers and ensuring the region retains economic development that might otherwise migrate elsewhere.

Beyond scaling capacity, fuel cells also provide operational flexibility. They can integrate with microgrids, distributed energy resources (DERs) or other grid assets, allowing utilities to optimize energy delivery, improve resilience and respond to shifting demand patterns in real time.

Power that moves with demand

One of the unique advantages of fuel cells is their mobility. Mounted on skids, crews can relocate them after infrastructure upgrades are complete, allowing utilities to optimize deployment as demand shifts. “Equipment can be redeployed as transmission constraints change, so utilities maintain flexibility and avoid overcommitting to one location or site,” Dayer said.

This modular design enables rapid redeployment to meet evolving load requirements, allowing utilities to position capacity where it’s needed most and respond to changing market dynamics efficiently.

Bridging the gap with fuel cells

Fuel cells provide utilities with a proven, flexible solution to meet growing electricity demand. Bloom Energy’s Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Energy Server® power systems can be deployed behind or in front of the meter, or grid-parallel, in a variety of configurations and contracting models, offering utilities the ability to respond to evolving customer needs with speed and reliability.

With a 17-year record of proven reliability, over 1.5 GW of deployed capacity, Bloom’s modular architecture enables rapid, scalable deployment while delivering high efficiency and firm 24/7 power. By integrating fuel cells into their energy strategy, utilities can capture new growth, retain high-value customers and ensure economic development remains in their regions.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/n1MbtebkFObJvYKXM0nv7ihemeOlTIfWxqBTbOWKRSg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQwNDEzMjAwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-29 09:02:02.799757

On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.
“It’s clear that states are taking some of their cues from the federal government,” said Nelson Falkenburg, siting policy manager at Clean Tomorrow and one of the report’s authors.
Of the roughly 300 siting bills introduced in the first half of the year, just under 40 were signed into law.
Stitt also publicly broke with Trump earlier this year on federal efforts to roll back clean energy tax credits, and on the administration’s attacks against wind energy.","This hasn’t been a kind year for developers looking to break ground on renewable energy projects.

On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July with exclusively Republican support, accelerated the phaseout of tax credits promised under the Inflation Reduction Act for wind and solar projects. Subsequent guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department further constrained eligibility rules.

And as bipartisan permitting reform takes center stage in Congress, critics have expressed doubt over whether a technology-neutral bill would still benefit renewable energy development under the current administration.

During a House committee hearing for the SPEED Act on Sept. 10, multiple Democrats expressed concern about their ability to engage in good-faith negotiations with Republicans to accelerate permitting amid the GOP’s attacks on wind and solar. Environmental groups, too, have cautioned that federal efforts to reform permitting could offer little benefit for renewables.

According to a report from the think tank Clean Tomorrow, the battle over renewable development has spread beyond Congress and the Trump administration—with siting policy at the state level now serving as one of the primary battlegrounds for those seeking to curtail the deployment of new clean energy projects.

“It’s clear that states are taking some of their cues from the federal government,” said Nelson Falkenburg, siting policy manager at Clean Tomorrow and one of the report’s authors.

The report’s authors assessed the expected impact of more than 300 state-level siting bills based on factors including their effect on permitting timelines, the predictability and uniformity of siting decisions and whether the bill incentivizes development. Falkenburg said they also used criteria from Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, when possible, to determine if a policy is restrictive.

According to Clean Tomorrow’s report, from January through June of this year, 148 siting-related bills were introduced across 47 states, seeking to make siting and permitting more restrictive.

That significantly outnumbers bills that would have a neutral impact (89) and those that would be more permissive (68).

Restrictive policies would hinder the development of renewable energy, while permissive policies would facilitate it. Bills that the authors deemed to have a neutral effect are those whose impact on project deployment was negligible or ambiguous, Falkenburg said.

The pushback against renewables, like recent actions at the federal level, is largely driven by the GOP.

Republican state lawmakers introduced nearly twice as many siting bills as Democrats, with an overwhelming number of those likely to restrict renewable development—nine restrictive bills for every one permissive proposal, according to Clean Tomorrow’s analysis.

“There’s a huge subset of these bills that legislators are introducing because they have constituents who are upset about renewable energy or they’re trying to score political points,” Falkenburg said.

“There are some that are purely messaging, and there are others that have real traction and are advancing quickly through their state legislatures.”

A Republican senator in Illinois, for example, introduced SB 160, which would have given local governments the authority to ban or restrict wind and solar projects. That effort had little chance of passing through the state’s Democrat-controlled legislature.

But other anti-renewable bills across the country advanced further through the legislative process. Arizona’s SB 1150, which included a slew of restrictive measures against wind farms, narrowly passed in the state House before stalling in the Senate.

If that bill had passed, Clean Tomorrow’s report says, it would have been the most restrictive wind development law in the U.S.

Thankfully for the renewable industry, the vast majority of those efforts haven’t been successful. Of the roughly 300 siting bills introduced in the first half of the year, just under 40 were signed into law.

Clean Tomorrow’s analysis found that over half of those are expected to have no meaningful impact on the pace of clean energy deployment, with a balance of wins (10 bills) and losses (7 bills) for the renewable industry in the remainder.

One reason the industry avoided some of the worst attacks, according to Falkenburg, is that there was less uniformity in Republicans’ views on renewable energy at the state level when compared to the federal level.

“There’s plenty of nuance in red states, and differences between folks who … have taken on the message from the federal government that clean energy is bad,” Falkenburg said.

“And then there’s plenty of other Republican legislators who are supportive of the industry—but mostly quietly behind closed doors and working to maintain renewable energy production in their states.”

Oklahoma serves as a prime example of that dynamic. The state’s attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has publicly denounced wind energy as a “Green Energy Scam,” and the Republican-controlled legislature passed three bills that would have had a restrictive impact on the deployment of renewable technologies.

Yet Governor Kevin Stitt, also a Republican, vetoed two of those bills—although the GOP-led legislature overrode one of those vetoes—and has been “unabashedly pro-renewables,” according to Clean Tomorrow’s report.

Stitt also publicly broke with Trump earlier this year on federal efforts to roll back clean energy tax credits, and on the administration’s attacks against wind energy.

Clean Tomorrow’s report also points to unlikely alliances in the private sector and local communities as one of the forces pushing back against some of the more egregious attacks on renewables.

For example, the report highlights the role played by a coalition of the renewable industry, business groups and oil and gas interests in Louisiana in defeating HB 615, which would have dealt a significant blow to the state’s emerging solar industry.

Those efforts were mirrored in other states, such as Texas and Oklahoma, where chambers of commerce partnered with ranchers, and the energy sector joined forces with tech companies to oppose some of the more restrictive bills in those states.

In Falkenburg’s eyes, the wrangling over renewable energy siting is likely to intensify in the coming months, with significant potential for states to use siting and permitting to counter anti-renewable actions at the federal level.

“We’re expecting to see a lot of governors introduce executive orders and emergency actions in the next few months to try to mitigate or blunt the impact of the recent federal actions,” Falkenburg said. “And we expect in the legislature in 2026, more states will use this to reform their siting and permitting processes to deploy more energy, more renewable energy projects.”

Some of those actions are already taking root. In May, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed the Renewable Energy Certainty Act into law, which aims to standardize siting requirements for solar farms and energy storage devices, and preempts restrictive local zoning rules that prohibit these projects, according to environmental law firm Beveridge & Diamond.

And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order in late August, fast-tracking the permitting process for energy projects racing to begin construction before federal tax credits expire due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s rollbacks.

According to Falkenburg, such state-level initiatives are going to become increasingly important in the face of the Trump administration’s growing attacks on wind and solar.

“For the renewable energy industry and climate advocates, the lesson here is really stark,” Falkenburg said. “State-level siting policy is a critical and contentious arena for the clean energy transition.”

“As the federal government abdicates its role in energy policy, the future of America’s clean energy economy depends increasingly on the outcomes of state-by-state political battles over where and how clean energy projects can be built.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2203448622-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 05:59:20.414854

Many executives expressed growing frustration over the obstacles posed by the chaotic trade policies of the Trump administration upon its return to the White House, as well as frequent changes in regulatory guidelines.

For the North American oil and gas industry, which fully supported 'Trump's MAGA-ism,' Trump’s presidency did not make the 'American oil industry great again' as he had promised. Measured by 'production,' U.S. oil output did reach new highs; however, measured by 'business sentiment/profitability/investment willingness,' the industry did not exhibit the strong expansion that Trump had promised, with executive sentiment remaining subdued.

MAGA, short for 'Make America Great Again,' refers both to the core tone of all policies under the Trump-led U.S. government and is also used by some mainstream media to refer to Trump himself and his fervent supporters among U.S. voters.

Making the American oil industry 'great again' essentially equates to 'high production + strong business sentiment + robust investment.' Currently, it is closer to 'high production, low sentiment'—output is impressive, but the central price of U.S. oil, along with policies/tariffs/uncertainty, is suppressing capital expenditure and sentiment. Overall, the entire U.S. oil industry appears more like 'increasing output while suffering internally,' rather than becoming 'great again.'

The Trump administration’s imposition of high steel and aluminum tariffs globally (up to 50% on steel and aluminum) drove up costs for OCTG (oil country tubular goods), pipelines, fracking equipment, and construction, repeatedly cited in the survey report by oil and gas executives as a source of 'rising costs and policy volatility.' On one hand, traditional U.S. energy companies complain about increased costs due to steel tariffs and policy flip-flopping causing 'chaos'; on the other hand, OPEC+ responded to U.S. calls for lower oil prices by ramping up production, thereby capping price elasticity—a development highly unfavorable for profitability in the U.S. oil industry, particularly in shale oil.

Overall, the rapid, concentrated, and directionally inconsistent policy/rule changes under the Trump administration across key areas such as methane regulation, RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard), offshore and public land development, LNG (liquefied natural gas) approvals, carbon emission standards, NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) procedures, and offshore financial guarantees have made compliance and capital planning difficult to stabilize. These factors collectively fueled collective grievances among executives in the U.S. oil and gas sector—one of Trump’s core constituencies—in the Dallas Fed survey, regarding 'heightened uncertainty and declining investment willingness.'

Collapse of the U.S. shale oil industry

The Dallas Fed's survey, conducted from September 10 to 18, gauged the latest sentiment of 139 oil and gas executives across the most crucial oil and gas regions in the U.S.—Texas, northern Louisiana, and southern New Mexico. The total energy production (primarily oil) from these regions even surpasses that of some of the world’s largest oil-producing nations.

""The U.S. shale sector has already begun to collapse,"" one executive said in the survey. ""Once the most dynamic energy engine in the world, it has now been gutted by political hostility and economic ignorance under the Trump administration.""

""We have entered what might be called the 'shale twilight zone' for this segment of the industry,"" another oil and gas executive commented. ""The U.S. isn't running out of oil, but she (the Statue of Liberty) is certainly running out of oil priced at $60 a barrel.""

""A vibrant oilfield services sector will be critical if the U.S. needs to ramp up production. Right now, we are bleeding,"" an executive from a publicly traded oilfield support services company stated.

Criticism of Trump’s policies is not new, but Wall Street analysts widely noted that the latest commentary represented a significant escalation in tone, with executives describing the U.S. President’s sudden shifts and frequent adjustments on steel tariffs and energy policy as ""kneecapping"" an industry he had promised to support.

The survey also found that executives in the U.S. oil and gas industry now expect West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices to remain significantly lower than previously anticipated, forecasting a price of around $63 per barrel by the end of 2025 and staying within the $60 range through 2027; earlier in the second quarter, these executives had predicted WTI would close the year near $68 per barrel and re-enter the optimistic $70 range within two years.

Crude oil futures surged last week due to ongoing attacks by Ukraine on Russian oil infrastructure, undoubtedly adding a rising geopolitical risk premium for long-term buyers of Russian oil such as India and China, along with potential further sanctions from the EU and the U.S.

The cumulative impact of drone strikes became evident as Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced on Thursday that Russia will impose a partial ban on diesel exports until the end of the year while extending its existing ban on gasoline exports. This move represents a significant obstacle to oil and gas trade for the two major economies, India and China.

President Trump has been consistently and cautiously pressuring U.S. allies to reduce any oil imports from Russia to push President Putin to the negotiating table. Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, remarked, ""We may see reductions in Russian imports by India and Turkey.""

NATO's warning against further airspace violations has heightened tensions and increased the likelihood of additional sanctions on Russia's oil industry.

Additionally, according to the national news agency, plans to resume crude oil exports from Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region last Saturday could sustain expectations of oversupply, potentially driving Brent crude prices into a pronounced downward trajectory.

According to reports citing people familiar with the matter, Iraq is in negotiations with one of the most influential giants in the crude oil transportation sector – commodity trading giant Vitol. Once crude oil exports from the country’s Kurdistan region resume after a two-year halt, Vitol will handle the crude sales. This news is evidently negative for the Brent crude price, the international crude benchmark that has been weak for much of this year. The resumption of Kurdish oil exports is expected to intensify expectations of an “oversupplied crude oil market,” potentially pushing the recently rebounding Brent crude price back into a downtrend.

As of last week’s close, the front-month WTI crude contract for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) rose +5.3% to $65.72 per barrel, while the front-month Brent crude contract for November on the Intercontinental Exchange rose +5.2% to $70.13 per barrel. This marks the largest weekly gain for both benchmark crude prices since the week of June 13. Meanwhile, the front-month natural gas contract for October on Nymex rose +0.5% to $3.206 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).

On Friday, Nymex crude, Brent crude, and U.S. natural gas futures rose by 1.1%, 1%, and 0.3%, respectively. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), representing the energy stock benchmark ETF, gained +3.9% last week but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 index year-to-date.

Goldman Sachs has emerged as a 'big short' on crude oil: the global oversupply situation is set to worsen, with Brent crude possibly falling below $50 per barrel by 2026.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global crude markets are on the verge of significant oversupply due to OPEC's production increases and expectations that North American shale producers will ramp up output under the Trump administration. The return of Kurdish crude will only exacerbate this surplus. Previous reports indicated that pipeline resumption is initially expected to bring about 230,000 barrels per day to the international market, with the potential for this figure to increase further.

If Kurdish pipelines resume operations as planned, it would marginally weigh on Brent crude prices. An estimated ~230,000 barrels per day are expected to enter the market during the initial phase of Kurdish resumption, potentially rising to as much as 1 million barrels per day later. The IEA assesses that supply dynamics already point toward an oversupply situation in 2025, with the surplus likely to widen further in 2026. The return of Kurdish oil will undoubtedly exacerbate this backdrop of market oversupply.

In its latest commodities research report, Goldman Sachs maintained its forecast for Brent crude and WTI crude prices in 2025, while projecting average prices of $56 and $52 per barrel, respectively, for 2026. However, Goldman Sachs noted that due to the negative impact of increasing global crude oil oversupply, there is a probability that Brent crude futures could fall below the $50-per-barrel threshold by the end of 2026.

The U.S.-based financial institution stated that between Q4 2025 and Q4 2026, the global crude oil market is expected to experience an average daily surplus of 1.8 million barrels, leading to a significant buildup of nearly 800 million barrels in global oil inventories during this period. The report specifically highlighted that inventory increases among OECD member countries will account for one-third of the global total, reaching approximately 270 million barrels. Goldman Sachs added that with worsening oversupply and inventory pressures in 2026, Brent crude prices are likely to fall below current futures market expectations.",https://newsfile.futunn.com/news-thumbnail/20240704/public/1720075538223258302092-news-thumbnail/20240704/public/17200755382238178651278.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 08:01:10.352592

NOAA is using ocean robots to collect hurricane data

Forecasting hurricanes requires a lot of data. To predict when a hurricane will arrive, how strong it will be and where it's headed, meteorologists use sophisticated computer models that interpret measurements from the ocean and atmosphere.

Now, NOAA has another tool in its toolbox for collecting critical ocean information. In collaboration with the University of Southern Mississippi and robotics company Oshen, the agency has launched five small uncrewed surface vehicles.

The craft, called C-Stars, debuted on Aug. 31 by collecting critical weather and marine data off the coast of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

""Understanding weather conditions where the ocean surface meets the lower atmosphere is key to predicting hurricane intensity,"" said Greg Foltz, oceanographer and a lead principal investigator at NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory.

""If these miniature uncrewed surface vehicles prove reliable, they could become a critical piece of NOAA's hurricane observing system in the future,"" Foltz added.

NOAA

The C-Stars are currently in a line extending from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Bermuda. The robots can be relocated to various oceanic regions to monitor different weather and marine conditions.

The C-Stars are wind-propelled with solar-powered sensors but are also equipped with electric motor thrusters for when the winds are weak.

The vehicles can operate individually or in fleets when covering a larger area. The C-Stars collect and transmit real-time data via satellite, including wind speed and direction, sea surface and air temperatures, air pressure and relative humidity.

""Although C-Stars have navigated storms with towering 24-foot waves, hurricanes are a whole new level of challenge -- but if it works, the long-term potential is huge,"" said Anahita Laverack, CEO for Oshen.

The C-Stars also collect wave condition information and can capture high-resolution images and videos, which can be retrieved when the craft returns to port.

""If these miniature uncrewed surface vehicles prove reliable, they could become a critical piece of NOAA's hurricane observing system in the future,"" Foltz added.

""We believe that these new, small USVs can move the needle in how we observe and understand hurricanes, while keeping budgets under control,"" Laverack added.

Lavarack told ABC News that the C-Stars are smaller, lighter, and cheaper to make and deploy than larger platforms, like the Saildrone that NOAA has used during previous hurricane seasons.

""Our size and platform cost allow us to field a constellation of many small robot C-Stars. In the future this could mean say 20 datapoints instead of just one within each hurricane, giving a richer understanding of the event,"" stated Laverack.

""We are excited by the role that C-Stars could play in improving hurricane forecasts, which have direct consequences for millions of people along the Gulf Coast,"" said Leila Hamdan, associate vice president for research and professor in the School of Ocean Science and Engineering at the University of Southern Mississippi.

If not, they’ll have to put those customers on hold — and California could lose hundreds of megawatts of cost-effective grid relief.
First, under DSGS, customers can be paid for sending power to the grid from their home batteries that have been charged up by rooftop solar, he said.
Most other VPPs in California only allow homes to reduce their consumption from the grid to zero, not to send power back to the grid.
As Sunrun CEO Mary Powell pointed out in a LinkedIn post, that’s more capacity than many of the state’s fossil-gas power plants provide.","California lawmakers managed to pass a slate of bills aimed at controlling the state’s high and rising electricity costs in the final days of the legislative session this month. But the last-minute negotiations left one key money-saving measure on the cutting-room floor — continued funding for what might be the world’s largest virtual power plant.

Now, companies like Sunrun and Tesla that have enrolled tens of thousands of customers in that VPP program don’t know if they can pay them to participate next year, because it’s unclear if any other state funding can be cobbled together. If not, they’ll have to put those customers on hold — and California could lose hundreds of megawatts of cost-effective grid relief.

Lawmakers ​“are consistently undervaluing what distributed solar and storage can deliver for the system,” said Kate Unger, senior policy advisor for the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group that supports the program. ​“We find this to be very shortsighted and frustrating, because DSGS is a cost-saving measure.”

DSGS stands for the Demand Side Grid Support program, which pays utility customers to help relieve costly peaks in electricity demand during extreme events like heat waves. They do this by cutting their own power consumption with devices like smart thermostats or by feeding extra power to the grid from backup batteries that have been charged by rooftop solar. Customers have already installed and paid for those systems, so making use of them is cheaper than building new power plants or grid infrastructure to manage those peaks.

DSGS has grown quickly since its 2022 launch to more than 1 gigawatt of grid-relief capacity, Unger said, about 700 megawatts of that from batteries in homes and businesses, which can be deployed rapidly. That’s much bigger than other similar programs in the state.

Backers say that’s because DSGS, which is administered by the California Energy Commission, is far less onerous for participants than VPP programs run by the state’s utilities.

It’s also more cost-effective, according to an August analysis from consultancy The Brattle Group. That report, which was commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla, found that solar-charged batteries in DSGS could deliver between tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in net savings to all California utility customers over the next four years. Those projected savings are predicated on the program nearly doubling its current capacity, which is a credible goal given that California residents are adding backup batteries in increasing numbers.

But instead of expanding its funding to achieve that growth, state lawmakers cut it this year in the face of budget shortfalls, just like they did last year. A provision that lawmakers inserted in August into a bill reauthorizing the state’s greenhouse-gas cap-and-trade program would have provided DSGS with a stable funding stream into the middle of next decade, but it was stripped from the bill that emerged from closed-door negotiations between Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and legislative leaders days before it was passed. That leaves DSGS with a dwindling pool of previously committed funding that is very likely to be depleted this year.

The remaining budget currently stands at about $64 million, according to the program administrator. DSGS would need at least $75 million more to continue operating in 2026, according to a letter sent to California lawmakers in August by dozens of companies, trade groups, and advocacy organizations.

DSGS backers are hoping the program might be able to secure a slice of the $1 billion in reserves to be disbursed annually from the state’s newly reauthorized cap-and-trade program. But Unger warned that competition for that money will be fierce — and lawmakers won’t make decisions on that spending until next year.

Without new funding, companies that have been active in DSGS will likely have to tell their customers they won’t be able to participate in 2026, said Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. ​“How do you put your customers in a program if you don’t know they’ll get paid?”

Why DSGS is better than California’s other VPPs

The failure to fund DSGS is particularly frustrating, Heavner said, because it’s the rare example of a successful virtual-power-plant program in the state. Though California has ostensibly prioritized VPPs, it has little else to show for its efforts.

For more than a decade, the state has required its major utilities to incorporate rooftop solar systems, backup batteries, smart thermostats, and other distributed energy resources (DERs) into their grid operations and planning. But utilities have done very little to actually tap these devices beyond launching pilot projects (and terminating many of them), even as the number of DERs in the state has grown dramatically. A June progress report from the California Energy Commission found the state has barely expanded its demand-side capacity over the past two years, and remains far from hitting its goal of 7 gigawatts by 2030.

“California is really excellent at deploying DERs, but really lags in DER utilization,” said Gabriela Olmedo, regulatory affairs specialist at EnergyHub, a company that manages demand-side resources and virtual power plants in the U.S. and Canada. Many of those programs have grown to play a significant role in reducing stress on utility grids during peak demand, she said, including a large-scale initiative in neighboring Arizona. But California’s ​“fractured, overlapping, and confusing load-flexibility programs really preclude scale,” she said.

DSGS, one of many programs created in response to California’s grid emergencies in 2020 and 2022, has broken that pattern, said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid-edge research for analytics firm Wood Mackenzie and lead author of a recently released report on virtual power plants. In particular, DSGS has avoided the types of problems that have limited customer participation in other VPP programs, he said.

First, under DSGS, customers can be paid for sending power to the grid from their home batteries that have been charged up by rooftop solar, he said. Most other VPPs in California only allow homes to reduce their consumption from the grid to zero, not to send power back to the grid. That’s a legacy of these programs’ genesis as traditional demand-response offerings that reward customers for reducing power use.

DSGS is also superior to the Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP), the other large-scale VPP program created as a response to California’s grid emergencies, Heavner said. One of the biggest differences is that ELRP is triggered only during specified grid alerts, warnings, or emergency declarations by the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s energy markets. Those emergencies are relatively rare, so participants are idle most of the time.

DSGS, by contrast, is triggered whenever wholesale prices on the state’s transmission grid exceed a threshold of $200 per megawatt-hour, so it plays a more active role in suppressing the price spikes that drive up costs for utilities and customers, Heavner said.

DSGS is also open to customers of all utilities in the state, unlike ELRP and most of the state’s other VPP programs, which are managed separately by each of California’s three large investor-owned utilities. Companies that have participated in both sets of programs say it’s easier to sign up customers and get them paid promptly under DSGS than under utility-managed efforts.

Killing California’s most promising VPP right as it’s getting big

A set of laws passed this year instructs state regulators to develop new VPP plans and programs, which could augment the current limited options. But ​“it will take years to establish that,” Heavner said. Meanwhile, ​“companies that have invested in dynamic grid response are left holding the bag right now.”

California may miss out on big money-saving opportunities as a result, he said. A 2024 analysis from The Brattle Group found that VPPs could shave more than 15% of the state’s peak demand by 2035, saving utility customers about $550 million each year.

The loss of funding for DSGS is particularly galling given the scale it has achieved, Heavner said. In a July test of the DSGS and ELRP programs, California’s three major utilities were able to dispatch about 540 megawatts of power from Sunrun and Tesla batteries, in what utility Pacific Gas & Electric described as ​“the largest test of its kind ever done in California — and maybe the world.”

Most of those batteries were enrolled in the DSGS program. Sunrun batteries alone accounted for at least 360 megawatts of capacity. As Sunrun CEO Mary Powell pointed out in a LinkedIn post, that’s more capacity than many of the state’s fossil-gas power plants provide.

Sunrun had enrolled more than 56,000 customers with solar-battery systems to participate in California VPP programs as of May, the majority of them in DSGS. The company offered participants up to $150 per battery enrolled in the 2025 season.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/solar-ca-homes-neighborhood.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=eff1726590319d11b9d913c0e3c78e9a,N,,2025-09-29 09:02:06.867769

While outright ownership has traditionally been the go-to, Emily Walker, director of insights at EnergySage, explains that third-party ownership options such as leases and power purchase agreements may become more popular.

If you lease your solar panels instead of buying them, the company that owns the system can still get the 30% tax credit for a couple of more years. That means leased solar projects have until mid-2026 to start or until the end of 2027 to be finished.

""That extra time is consequential for installers,"" Walker said. ""It allows them to continue developing residential projects with the tax credit, even as the credit for purchased systems disappears. For some homeowners, that will make TPO [third-party ownership] the most accessible entry point into solar.""

Going solar remains one of the best ways to cut utility bills and slash the pollution fueling Earth's overheating.

EnergySage makes it simple with free tools to compare quotes and get estimates, helping homeowners see what works best for their budget.

Solar panels don't just clean up the grid. They also put money back into people's pockets over time. With EnergySage's marketplace, the average homeowner can save up to $10,000 on solar installations. Its mapping tool also breaks down the average cost of systems and available incentives by state, so you know exactly what savings might be on the table where you live.

Pairing solar with efficient home appliances such as heat pumps can drive utility bills even lower. EnergySage even has a free comparison tool for heat pumps, making it easier to find the right option and installer for your home.

EnergySage emphasizes that while the policy changes may complicate the math for owned systems, TPO options will still allow families to tap into clean energy.

Whether you buy or lease, going solar sooner rather than later could mean significant savings for your household and a healthier planet.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/solar-leasingimage-rectYAfove5uLJ1pt-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 06:58:08.321890

Analysts, however, express concerns that any increase in deliveries might be due to a rush by U.S. consumers to purchase electric vehicles before the expiration of tax credits, rather than a sign of Tesla's robust performance. The U.S. EV tax credit policy is set to expire at the end of September, adding pressure on Tesla, which has yet to launch its promised affordable electric car.

Recently, Tesla's stock experienced volatility after a seven-day upward streak, impacted by disappointing European sales data showing an 8-month decline.

The EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan’s (EVIDP) approval means the Commonwealth will have allocated nearly $55 million to expand its EV network through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to-date.
They represent an investment of $31.6 million in obligated NEVI federal formula funds.
“We look forward to having nearly 50 NEVI funded fast charging stations up and running in the Commonwealth next year.

The EV Infrastructure Deployment Plan’s (EVIDP) approval means the Commonwealth will have allocated nearly $55 million to expand its EV network through the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program to-date.

“When Washington makes Kentucky a promise, I’m going to do everything I can to make sure they keep it,” said Gov. Andy Beshear. “I’m glad to see these dollars returned to the commonwealth, and these investments to expand our state’s EV network will help Kentucky continue building on its status as a global automotive leader.”

Last month, Gov. Beshear joined 19 other states and the District of Columbia to challenge the Trump administration’s decision to freeze $32 million in NEVI funding. In total, Kentucky expects to receive nearly $70 million in NEVI funding, the remaining $14.8 million in NEVI funds is anticipated to be available later this year.

Federal approval of Kentucky’s latest (EVIDP) allows new funds to support Phase 2 and Phase 3 of Kentucky’s EV plan, which will expand charging infrastructure along other priority corridors, in communities, and at destination sites statewide.

The plan was developed by the Kentucky Transportation Cabinet (KYTC) in cooperation with the Energy and Environment Cabinet (EEC) and the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA).

Kentucky has awarded 46 fast-charging stations statewide with five stations open and three additional stations under construction. The five active stations are in Berea, Grayson, Hazard, Richmond, and Sparta. All of the awarded stations are expected to open in 2026. They represent an investment of $31.6 million in obligated NEVI federal formula funds.

“Accessible fast-charging stations across the Commonwealth will make a real difference for Kentuckians and visitors alike,” said KYTC Secretary Jim Gray. “We look forward to having nearly 50 NEVI funded fast charging stations up and running in the Commonwealth next year. Kentucky is leading the charge on the EV front.”

Kentucky is a leader in automotive production and is the EV battery production capital of the United States, helping create thousands of high-quality jobs for Kentuckians. Kentucky touts $13.5 billion in EV-related investments in the state with the creation of nearly 10,200 full-time jobs statewide.

The 46 awarded sites are along the state’s interstates and parkways. Each station must have at least four charging ports of 150 kilowatts or more, be accessible to the public 24 hours a day/seven days a week, and work with most EV models.

KYTC does not develop, own, operate or maintain the charging stations. Each developer must fund at least 20% of the construction and operational costs and is required to maintain and operate the charging station for at least five years.

Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 2 percent, though Biden carried it by 4 percent in his 2020 victory.
In order to stand out among so many candidates, O’Rourke said she will emphasize affordability and her personal story.
After graduating from Cornell, O’Rourke worked as a Senior Environmental Advisor for the United States Agency for International Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 2013.
While at Cornell, O’Rourke said she and her family utilized the Women, Infants, and Children program, Medicaid and the Headstart program.","In her own words, Cornell alumna and ecologist Megan O’Rourke, Ph.D. ’09 is running for Congress because she “has a backbone.”

A Blairstown, New Jersey native, O’Rourke is emphasizing her working-class background in an effort to contrast her personal story with other candidates in the race. She’s also made affordability and opposition to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill a centerpiece of her campaign.

O’Rourke has joined a primary field in New Jersey’s 7th district so crowded with competitors that national Republicans have called it a “clown car.”

The district, expected to be one of the most competitive of the 2026 midterms, is currently held by a Republican, Tom Kean Jr., but votes regularly for both parties. Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 2 percent, though Biden carried it by 4 percent in his 2020 victory.

Candidates for the Democratic primary include fighter pilot Rebecca Bennett, Biden Small Business Administration official Michael Roth and magazine executive Brian Varela, among others.

In order to stand out among so many candidates, O’Rourke said she will emphasize affordability and her personal story.

“Growing up poor, issues with food security were troubles in our family. We often relied on our church's food pantry,” O’Rourke said. Her family’s struggles, along with her love for nature, compelled O’Rourke to pursue an “intersection of environment and food” in her career.

After graduating from Cornell, O’Rourke worked as a Senior Environmental Advisor for the United States Agency for International Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 2013.

Eventually, she decided to work for the federal government once again, this time as a program leader for climate in the Department of Agriculture, where she managed grants on sustainability that the department awarded to universities.

In July, she resigned from her position in protest of the Trump administration’s decisions to cut many of the same grants she had worked on only a year before. Since then, she has been running for Congress full-time.

O’Rourke said her decision to run this August was in part because she believed “there was some weakness” in the field, and that the candidates already in the race didn’t have the “strength” it took to defeat incumbent congressman Kean.

“People don’t have to doubt whether or not I have sacrificed,” O’Rourke said, referring to her decision to leave the Trump administration. “People don’t have to doubt whether or not I have the backbone.”

O’Rourke has lived in Blairstown, New Jersey, since she was born, moving only for college. She attended SUNY Stony Brook University before getting her master’s at Iowa State University and her doctorate in Agricultural Ecology from Cornell in 2009.

Attending graduate school at Cornell while raising a family made O’Rourke “stand out,” she says, especially on a graduate student’s stipend, which she estimated was around $25k.

While at Cornell, O’Rourke said she and her family utilized the Women, Infants, and Children program, Medicaid and the Headstart program. She also started a community garden in Slaterville Springs, where she lived, to make some extra money.

“It was really hard, but we buckled down, because from a young age — for whatever reason — I wanted to do a Ph.D.,” O’Rourke said.

Though O’Rourke’s platform centers around affordability, during an interview with The Sun, she did not outline any specific priorities or policy proposals to combat the cost-of-living crisis that a majority of New Jersey voters say is their top issue. A review of her campaign website found that O’Rourke does not specify any policies to address affordability.

O’Rourke was also noncommittal on her stances regarding accepting corporate PAC money, whether she would vote for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, sending aid to Ukraine and Taiwan or a position on the Israel-Gaza war.

“We need to look at the conflicts as they come, because [between] right now and 2026, they are going to be completely different,” O’Rourke said. “I’m not going to be pinned down on every controversial vote, but the principles I will bring to the table are that we need to be proactive, we need to take a multilateral approach.”

However, O’Rourke did emphasize a few issues she would take a side on.

By Michele N. Siekerka, NJBIA President and CEO On Sep 29, 2025

A new state law, which NJBIA helped push to the legislative finish line, is making the largest investment in manufacturing in this state’s history.

Manufacturers are the engine that drives New Jersey’s economy – a $58 billion industry that produces everything from pharmaceuticals and chemicals to food products and the advanced technologies that support supply chains and catalyze innovation.

“Made in NJ Manufacturing Day” on Oct. 3, presented by NJBIA’s partners at the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program (NJMEP), will showcase these fantastic companies and their products at the largest gathering of its kind in the state. Hundreds of manufacturers, business leaders, students, and elected officials – including the two candidates running in the Nov. 4 election to be New Jersey’s next governor – will be there.

Look for our manufacturers to have an extra spring in their step about their Jersey-made products because a new state law is now making the largest investment in manufacturing in this state’s history. The “Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program,” which NJBIA was proud to help push across the legislative finish line, provides $500 million in tax incentives to spur investments, create jobs, and position our state as a national manufacturing leader.

The tax credits will attract global investment in a wide range of manufacturing activities, including advanced manufacturing, food and beverage production, life sciences, and clean energy component manufacturing, which includes nuclear, solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen. Amid the economic uncertainty caused by federal tariffs and supply challenges, this economic boost couldn’t have come at a better time for New Jersey.

Beyond incentivizing manufacturing investments, the program will also boost workforce development efforts to fill thousands of new positions from the machine operators and assemblers on the factory floors to the engineers and scientists whose cutting-edge research drives innovation in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and other advanced materials.

The NJEDA’s website has the details about the program, but here are the basics: tax credits for companies that make, acquire or lease investments of $10 million or more at a New Jersey manufacturing facility and successfully create at least 20 new full-time jobs that pay at least 120% of the median salary of manufacturing workers in that county.

Importantly, funding for the program comes from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority’s existing Aspire and Emerge tax credit programs. No new money is involved.

The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program is the one bright spot for the industry in a FY26 state budget that unfortunately zeroed out the Manufacturing Voucher Program geared toward smaller manufacturers and cut funding for NJMEP in half. Nevertheless, the new tax credits, coupled with the pro-manufacturing tax changes made on the federal level, make this an exciting opportunity to grow manufacturing businesses in New Jersey.

No, not the fear of water, but lab work centered on better battery science.

Hydrophobicity — when materials naturally repel water — has been one of the obstacles to implementing promising, safe, and low-cost water-based batteries that could be more widely used for grid storage and powering electric vehicles, according to the university's news release.

The key components of these batteries are common and not flammable, making them an attractive alternative to the lithium-ion batteries that use expensive and combustible parts. But how to solve the hydrophobicity issue …

The Tohoku researchers have developed an electrode material that works well with a water-based electrolyte, eliminating the problem. They say their new organic redox polymer could also help enable recycling, another long-standing hurdle for batteries of this type.

""By combining high charge storage capacity with recyclability, we can open new directions for sustainable battery research,"" associate professor Kouki Oka said in the release.

Their solution involved combining some components with the right attributes.

P-dihydroxybenzene is an organic molecule that has high charge storage capacity. Through a condensation reaction, the team ""introduced"" the molecule into a polyamine, ""which is water-soluble due to its positive charge,"" according to the release.

The combo tackles the hydrophobicity issue. It can also be broken back down into its component parts in water. A rendering provided with the release shows a circular process, from battery production through use and recycling.

""This study provides a design strategy for making hydrophobic redox molecules compatible with aqueous systems,"" Oka said.

Experts in Korea, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and elsewhere are also developing innovative water-based batteries.

It's important to note that common lithium-ion packs are generally high-performing, safe, and reliable. Gas-powered cars are more likely to catch fire than EVs powered by the existing battery type, according to reports. Recurrent has also reported that Goldman Sachs said battery prices could fall 50% by next year, compared to 2023 prices, due to cheaper chemistries, better performance, and more recycling.

Through August, global 2025 EV sales grew 25% compared to the prior year, though that 12.5 million total includes plug-in hybrids, according to Ars Technica. Sales are growing more slowly in the United States as federal policy changes have nixed up to $7,500 in tax breaks for the cleaner rides beginning Oct. 1. But certain states are continuing to offer their own perks. And EV owners continue to enjoy about $1,500 a year in gas and maintenance savings.

What's more, less-expensive EV options are on the way. Ford is retiring two popular gas-guzzlers in favor of a $30,000 electric pickup set to debut in the coming years, for example.

Each EV that replaces a gas-powered car prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution, per government data. And the tailpipe exhaust is among the gases linked by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to greater risks for the extreme weather that's compromising human health and safety as well as impacting insurance coverage and pricing.

Not anymore.

District Reeve Rick Lemire said the windmill image, which sits alongside other Alberta icons on the logo — a wild rose, wheat, a pumpjack and cattle will soon be erased.

""It's not us anymore,"" Lemire said in an interview.

There are few places where the wind blows as hard and as often as it does in Pincher Creek, Alta., where clusters of windmills tower over farmland, with mountains in the distance.

But in a few short years, new rules and changing attitudes have delivered a sharp pivot away from wind projects.

The biggest push has come from Premier Danielle Smith's government, which put a short-term moratorium on renewable energy projects in 2023 before introducing new rules on where they can go.

Regulations forbid renewable energy developments within a 35-kilometre buffer zone from the Rocky Mountains, which applies to Pincher Creek, mainly on the grounds of preserving jaw-dropping Prairie viewscapes. The restrictions only apply to renewable energy projects.

Rohit Sandhu, spokesperson for Alberta's department of affordability and utilities, said exemptions are available for wind projects currently in the buffer zone and the Alberta Utilities Commission can approve new projects on a case-by-case basis.

The commission declined to comment on the matter.

The district has more than 255 turbines producing nearly 511 megawatts of energy, says a third-party report commissioned last year by the town and district.

The issue is also about money.

Lemire said stopping renewable development means lost revenue down the line if companies can't repower their wind farms once existing ones reach the end of their life.

About 30 per cent of the district's budget relies on revenues from renewable electricity generation, says analysis by the Pembina Institute think tank, and landowners also collect a percentage of revenue generated by each turbine.

Despite the potential profit lost, Lemire said he believes residents are willing to take the hit.

""We're starting to slide,"" he said of the district's renewable energy revenues. ""We're coming down — we understand that. Administration knows that.""

Lemire said residents soured on wind projects years before the moratorium took effect, because they found new transmission lines connecting turbines to the grid to be unsightly.

But he said if the aging turbines are allowed to be replaced by fewer yet more efficient models, everyone wins.

Wayne Oliver, an intergeneration supervisor at TransAlta Corp. and a town councillor in Pincher Creek, agreed. Repowered wind farms, he said, would also likely have fewer turbines that produce the same amount of electricity and continue to provide revenues to the district.

While residents aren't keen on new turbines, Oliver said, they're on board with an improved status quo.

""The people that live around that Castle River wind farm with 60 turbines, when they hear that six or seven turbines can replace that, they get excited,"" he said.

A spokesperson for TransAlta said it's continuously assessing the future of existing facilities but couldn't comment on specific sites.

Regulations 'popped a bubble'

Oliver, a resident of Pincher Creek for over 30 years, said he finds it remarkable how quickly times have changed in a few years.

""It popped a bubble,"" Oliver said of the renewable moratorium. ""It just shows you the power of government policy to change the direction of society.""

Will Noel, a senior analyst at the Pembina Institute, said what the industry needs is certainty. Noel wrote in a recent report that about 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy projects were cancelled in 2024.

He said modernization and consolidation can work.

""This is a great middle ground,"" Noel said. ""We'll get rid of 40 turbines and put up 10 new ones — that's a quarter of the turbines you have to look at, and you're getting the same kind of power.""

Lemire said while you never say never on once again going big on wind, the district's gusty love affair has likely peaked.

""We all agree that windmills are enough. That may change ... it can switch,"" said Lemire, who is running for re-election this fall.",https://i.cbc.ca/1.7645990.1759088978!/cpImage/httpImage/image.jpg_gen/derivatives/16x9_1180/nwt-renewable-energy-20221208.jpg?im=Resize%3D620,N,,2025-09-28 23:58:41.822031

The artificial intelligence boom is reshaping global energy demands in profound ways, with data centers at the epicenter of this transformation. As companies race to deploy advanced AI models, the electricity required to power these operations is skyrocketing. According to a recent report from the International Energy Agency, AI could drive a surge in electricity demand from data centers, potentially doubling or tripling current levels by 2030. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a fundamental shift that challenges existing power infrastructures worldwide.

In the United States alone, projections indicate that data centers could consume up to 8% of the nation’s electricity by the end of the decade, up from about 2.5% today. Industry insiders point to the voracious appetite of AI training and inference processes, which require immense computational power. For instance, training a single large language model can consume as much electricity as thousands of households over several months, highlighting the scale of the issue.

Nuclear and Renewable Energy as Potential Solutions

To meet this burgeoning demand, tech giants are exploring unconventional energy sources. Small modular nuclear reactors are gaining traction as a reliable, low-carbon option, with companies like Microsoft partnering with nuclear firms to revive plants and secure dedicated power supplies. A commentary from the IEA notes that while renewables like solar and wind offer promise, their intermittency poses challenges for the always-on needs of data centers.

Grid constraints are exacerbating the problem, particularly in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, home to a cluster of data centers. Utilities are struggling to keep pace, leading to delays in new connections and rising costs. Posts on X from industry figures, such as investors highlighting AI’s power bottlenecks, underscore a growing consensus that energy scarcity could become the next big hurdle after chip shortages.

Global Implications and Economic Pressures

Internationally, the energy crunch is even more acute. In China, rapid data center expansion is outpacing power generation, prompting massive investments in new capacity. Meanwhile, in Europe, stringent environmental regulations are clashing with AI ambitions, forcing a reevaluation of energy policies. The Dallas News recently detailed how data centers’ insatiable power needs might lead to shortages, with experts warning that there simply may not be enough electricity to go around without significant infrastructure upgrades.

Economic ramifications are already evident. Electricity prices in key U.S. markets have risen by over 30% in the past three years, driven partly by AI-related demand. Bloomberg’s analysis in a recent article suggests creating a market for compute resources, akin to oil futures, to better allocate energy and spur investment.

Innovative Strategies and Future Outlook

Forward-thinking solutions are emerging, including on-site power generation and advanced cooling technologies to reduce consumption. For example, some firms are turning to geothermal and hydroelectric sources for sustainable alternatives, as outlined in reports from RCR Wireless News. Yet, challenges persist, with heatwaves and AI growth pushing global gas demand higher, according to the World Economic Forum.

Looking ahead, the integration of AI into energy management itself could provide relief. Smart grids powered by AI algorithms might optimize distribution and predict demand spikes, transforming the sector. However, without coordinated policy efforts and massive capital inflows—estimated at trillions of dollars—the AI revolution risks stalling amid energy constraints. Industry leaders must navigate this delicate balance to ensure technological progress doesn’t come at the expense of reliable power supplies.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-f4cf9881-0604-416c-9ec1-968ab184d4c2.jpeg,N,,2025-09-28 23:58:45.476449

The EPA is doing everything it can to revitalize the coal sector in the United States

During his first term, Donald Trump stated that he would “drill baby, drill”. At the time, what he meant by that was a mystery. However, once he began his second term, the meaning behind that statement became clearer. Trump wants to revitalize the coal sector, particularly in the United States. His administration, led by his EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, has now stated that they will roll back the coal-ash rules implemented by the Obama administration.

In 2015, the Obama administration finalized long-sought federal rules for disposing of coal ash, which is a byproduct of incineration at coal-fired power plants. That rule aimed to prevent contamination of groundwater and surface water by establishing technical guidelines for power plants’ coal ash disposal. During his first term, the Trump administration did little to enforce those rules, and now plans to remove the regulatory barriers that the rule imposes.

Utility companies were ordered to report coal ash contamination in groundwater to the EPA by February 2026. As well as install groundwater monitoring systems by May 2028. They were also required to begin drafting remediation plans if contamination was found.

The EPA has shifted its stance to allow for more state involvement

On July 19, the Trump-led EPA announced it would extend the deadline for utility companies to address the rules by at least one more year. The EPA stated that it aims to put more power in the different states’ hands, as opposed to keeping the rules tightly wound up by the federal government. Which has not gone down well with environmentalists.

“Trump tried and failed to bail out the coal industry during his first term in office. Given the realities of the market, whatever he tries to do this time should fail as well.… Instead of trying to prop up the fuels of the last century, this administration should be working to build the grid needed for the 21st century.” – Christy Walsh, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council

A court has intervened in the Duke coal-ash cleanup, which only strengthens the stance being championed by the current administration. The EPA released a statement on the matter.

“Due to the receipt of adverse comment, the EPA is withdrawing the direct final rule titled “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; CCR Management Unit Deadline Extension Rule,” which published on July 22, 2025 (90 FR 34358).” – United States Environmental Protection Agency

Today, energy policy is investment policy, and Indonesia risks being left behind.

Clean energy is no longer just about meeting climate targets. For many companies, it has become a make-or-break factor when deciding where to expand, build and invest.

Companies in sectors like manufacturing, textiles, food processing and technology have set ambitious decarbonization goals, many targeting net-zero emissions before 2050. To meet their goals, they need to power their operations with clean energy. In practice, that means locating in countries where renewable power is available, affordable and accessible through the central grid or via clear purchasing pathways.

Indonesia has taken important steps to expand its renewable energy supply, with 76 percent of new capacity additions within the Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik 2025 (RUPTL 2025), or Indonesia’s Electricity Supply Business Plan, coming from renewables.

Nonetheless, corporate buyers are seeking a more diversified menu of procurement options. Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are currently the most viable option for corporate procurement in Indonesia. But while useful, RECs do not support the large-scale, long-term investments businesses are planning. Companies are looking for structural solutions to source renewables locally, such as Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) and the joint utilization of transmission and distribution networks, known globally as power wheeling.

A recent paper by Climate Group’s RE100 campaign, Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) explained how shared use of Indonesia’s transmission and distribution network would allow different stakeholders to deliver electricity from generation sources to load centers. These mechanisms would allow companies to contract clean electricity directly and at scale from renewables-rich areas to business hubs, through state electricity company PLN’s grid.

Other countries in the region are already moving faster – with both Vietnam and Malaysia introducing schemes that allow third parties to supply or buy electricity through the existing grid network. Thailand has enabled eligible customers to purchase both energy and RECs from large renewable energy projects by rolling out the second phase of its Utility Green Tariff (UGT2). These policies give companies flexible and transparent pathways to scale their clean energy use, and they are attracting investment.

Indonesia risks falling behind. While Vietnam sourced over 14 percent of its electricity from solar in 2023, Indonesia’s share of solar and wind remains below 3 percent. An estimated Rp 278 trillion (US$16.64) in annual investment is needed if its targets for added renewable capacity are to be met.

The priority therefore is delivering on this plan. With the country’s sovereign wealth fund Danantara launched earlier this year, Indonesia has a timely opportunity to turn capital, policy alignment and partnerships into renewable energy projects. Fossil fuels still account for a significant share of Indonesia’s capacity, and policymakers have sent mixed signals on coal drawdown. While recent geothermal announcements are promising, Indonesia will need a decisive push to match its renewable commitments with bankable projects that draw the investment that is required.

Other Indonesian business leaders share this sense of urgency. Some 88 percent said they want most of the country’s energy supply sourced from renewables within the next ten years. A majority said they would consider relocating operations and contracting supply chains to other countries if Indonesia cannot deliver adequate renewable supplies.

This should set off alarm bells. Sectors like textiles and light manufacturing are already major employers in Indonesia, and many of these companies are under pressure from their customers to clean up supply chains. Global tech firms looking to build data centers are clear in their message: renewable energy access is a key part of site selection.

There is an economic prize waiting for those moving faster on renewable energy. Research shows that meeting clean energy targets will create jobs, boost wages and improve resilience to global fuel price shocks, as shown in ACEC’s May 2025 publication Asia’s Clean Energy Breakthrough. Renewables also reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets, providing more stable pricing for both industry and consumers.

All of this is especially relevant for Indonesia, which has set a target of eight percent annual gross domestic product growth by 2029. Unlocking clean energy investment can be a key enabler of that growth as it’ll attract capital, lower energy costs, improve energy security and fulfill a government promise to create 19 million jobs.

Indonesia still has time to lead the charge on the regional energy transition, but the window is closing. If the country can move quickly, it will be well positioned to compete with its neighbors on energy, and in every sector of the economy that depends on it.

The companies are ready. The demand is real. It is now time for policy to catch up.

Gonzales resident Connie Thompson, who grew up in Gentilly, said she had always been curious about the seawall’s history. Thompson asked about the seawall’s construction and history, along with the scope of the wall: “I always wonder why the seawall was built around Lake Pontchartrain only on the New Orleans side? The year it was built? Was it to put people to work?”

The northshore has a similar, although smaller, seawall. The Mandeville concrete seawall was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project. The story of the New Orleans seawall is a bit of a deeper dive.

Kristi Trail, executive director of Pontchartrain Conservancy, reached back into the early days of European settlers and south Louisiana’s alluvial flood plain to begin to describe the seawall’s importance.

A growing city looks outward

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the city began expanding, looking for ways to grow outward, Trail said. Back then, what is now the Lakeview, Gentilly and City Park neighborhoods were all swamps. By the late 1800s, the Lakefront was in constant use for commerce and recreation. Fishing camps were set up with elevated walkways and structures, but had to maneuver around Lake Pontchartrain’s tidal pattern. The Port Pontchartrain lighthouse, which still stands today, was floating out on the water, unconnected to land, Trail said.

Mechanical engineer Albert Baldwin Wood, whose impact on New Orleans drainage cannot be overstated, opened up new possibilities with his screw pump invention, patent filed in 1913. The screw pump could pump massive amounts of water, allowing for quick drainage of swampland — although this mass draining would eventually cause subsidence issues.

In the 1920s, the Orleans Levee Board began a huge project of reclaiming land from the lake. The lakefront development used clam shells from the lake to mix with sediment dredged from the lake bottom for this new land. In 1930, the Orleans Levee Board started what would be about a 21/2-year project to build an 8-foot-high concrete seawall, according to the Lakefront Management Authority. The seawall was set into place to halt shoreline erosion and offer flood protection for the newly created area.

“The mud they are pumping in from the lake to fill in all that area, from Allen Toussaint to the seawall, it’s just mud, and it’s so soft to build on,” Trail said. “So this is when the clamshell dredging began in the lake.”

Those clams were taken out of the lake to mix in with those soft soils in the neighborhoods, Trail said. “Those neighborhoods are all built on reclaimed land, as a result of the sea wall going in, which allowed those neighborhoods to be built,” she said.

Dredging lake environment

The project indirectly led to Trail’s current job — large-scale clam dredging led to massive environmental lake degradation. In the wake of this degradation, environmental advocacy groups popped up to defend the lake, one of which became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Since clamshell dredging was banned in 1990, the lake has started to bounce back. As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.

“It’s solid concrete installation techniques. …I would bet it’s probably sunk a pretty good bit over time, but I don’t have the data on that,” Trail said. “We’re out there every day, we see it. It’s still there. It’s still doing its job.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/86/c86fa899-225e-5e0d-9a9b-e62df2d7fc3d/68d5c14feb11b.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-29 00:59:33.549273

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 28, 2025 (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone (a financial company separate from from BlackRock) has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

“EV sales just hit a new record in the U.S.: This month, they’re on track to make up 12.2% of new car sales, according to J.D. Power and Associates,” reports Fast Company. “Meanwhile, gas car sales dropped compared to the same month last year.”

The electric vehicle tax credit was created by President George W. Bush, who initiated a tax credit program for fuel-efficient vehicles in 2005 and expanded it in 2008 to include plug-in vehicles with the goals of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and lowering emissions.

As of late, the incentives have created some anxiety for dealers, who report that the IRS has been slow to pay for the tax credits since mid-September.

“The delays began in earnest in mid-September, according to accounts shared with CNBC from three dealers in different parts of the country,” according to CNBC. “Auto analysts and two national trade associations also confirmed to CNBC dealership reports of delays. The dealerships say it forces them into a tough choice: carry the cost to keep offering the credit, or pull back and risk losing vehicle sales.”

Some analysts expect EV sales to fall off significantly for the rest of the year.

“Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, said once the federal tax credit ends, EV sales are ‘going to crater. It’s going to be quite the whipsaw effect. You’ve got the rush to the dealership to take advantage of these incentives now ... but what’s going to happen in the next three to six months? There’ll be almost no buyers.’” according to the Detroit Free Press.

Brauer said EVs comprise about 8% of the total U.S. new vehicle market share, he expects that to drop to 1% to 3% by year's end and settle in at 4% of total market share by early next year.

But not all analysts agree.

“In a recent survey with Morning Consult, analysts at Cox Automotive found that 65% of respondents who were in the market for a new EV said they would still consider an EV without the tax credit,” according to Fast Company. “Even though the end of the incentive has spurred sales, the tax credit generally hasn’t been the deciding factor for most buyers, says Loren McDonald, who runs an EV data and analysis firm called Chargeonomics.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/09/28/ev-charger_ipDJ3BJ.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 19:00:35.414802

Disruptions and disparity India’s green economy is under pressure from international economic headwinds, but remains a priority for energy security, job creation, and long-term competitiveness.
Green economy trade-offs As India strives to balance economic growth, social equity and environmental returns, there are many green economy trade-offs.
To navigate through these trade-offs, disruptions, disparities and the pressure on achieving green growth, an assessment of landscapes is crucial.
A shared comprehensive understanding of the landscape needs to be integrated into the green economy transition.","India stands at a crossroads requiring a leap beyond traditional growth models to adopt a greener, more resilient economic future. India’s bioeconomy grew dramatically from $10 billion in 2014 to $165.7 billion in 2024, expanding 16 times over the 10 years and accounting for 4.25% of the country’s GDP. This growth has been bolstered by over 10,000 bio-economy start-ups.

The industrial bioeconomy — comprising biofuels and bioplastics — accounts for the largest share at approximately 47%, followed by pharmaceuticals at 35%, with emerging areas such as research and IT (including clinical trials and bioinformatics) also expanding rapidly. India has also achieved major milestones, with the government ensuring 20% ethanol blending in petrol and the country being the world’s third-largest pharmaceutical producer by volume.

According to the India Bioeconomy Report, the bioeconomy is expected to create 35 million jobs by 2030. The growth in consumer spending in rural India is surpassing that of urban areas, with 9.2% rural per capita spending growth vs 8.3% urban (August 2023 to July 2024), suggesting improving rural purchasing capacity and evolving consumption patterns. Hence, the green economy is no longer distant, utopian, or abstract, but inevitable, imminent, and an undercurrent under way. Given India’s climate vulnerabilities and global market shifts — such as carbon border taxes and rising demand for sustainable goods — the transition is a necessity for sustained jobs, environmental returns, competitiveness, and social wellbeing. As it expands, there is a need for recognition that rural communities vulnerable due to poverty and climate risks are no longer just beneficiaries but climate frontline leaders.

Disruptions and disparity

India’s green economy is under pressure from international economic headwinds, but remains a priority for energy security, job creation, and long-term competitiveness. Although the global economy is expected to slow down at 2.5%, India’s GDP is expected to grow at 5.9%. Climate disruptions also directly impact inflation, further worsening the rural bioeconomy context, especially pressures from losses in agriculture, fluctuations in energy demand, and disrupted supply chains. There is a huge hidden disparity that also needs attention. The BioE3 policy was rolled out in 2024 to promote the bioeconomy, but regulatory frameworks remain fragmented, and it remains a very urban-centric, industrial-scale economy.

Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh contribute more than two-thirds of the total bioeconomy value, while the eastern and northeastern regions together account for less than 6%. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which are rich in agriculture, forest biomass, mineral-rich and non-timber forest products, have a huge potential for tribal-led bioeconomy models. In Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest sugarcane producer, opportunities in ethanol, biofuels, and biomass power are emerging in the State. Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal have had a low industrial bioeconomy footprint probably due to discouraged investment by the Freight Equalisation Policy, but they are abundant in agri-waste and forest produce, which needs to be tapped.

Despite a projected addition of 35 million green jobs by 2047, women held only 11% of jobs in India’s rooftop solar sector, even as renewable capacity surged 250% between 2015 and 2021. Women’s representation in key roles remains particularly low: 1% in operations and maintenance, and 3% in construction and commissioning. There is a green economic rural-urban divide where the urban areas attract green investments, EV infrastructure, solar rooftops, and green jobs, whereas the rural regions lack access to clean energy, water-saving irrigation, and sustainable livelihoods, with slower, inequitable technology adoption. A huge digital divide furthers the disparity as tech-driven solutions such as smart grids and measurement, reporting, and verification for carbon markets are not inclusive of landscapes and communities with low digital access. Even in the waste management sector, urban areas account for nearly 75% of the country’s total solid waste, due to higher consumption, packaging, and commercial activity, whereas rural waste is now consuming more, seeing penetration of plastics, e-waste, and so on, along with biowaste, but is unsegregated and often burnt or dumped. With 500 million tonnes of crop residues, 3,500-plus medicinal plant species, largely sourced from forest-fringe rural areas, 7,50,000-plus rural haats and agri-mandis, MGNREGA-supported green infrastructure, the rural is still under-represented in the bioeconomy boom.

Green economy trade-offs

As India strives to balance economic growth, social equity and environmental returns, there are many green economy trade-offs. One of the biggest trade-offs is promoting renewable energy, but also subsidising fossil fuels to up to potentially 40%. Also, while promoting renewable energy solutions such as solar pumps, do we check the promotion of groundwater extraction? Massive industrial expansion in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as steel, cement, power, and utilities — which together account for 23.2% of India’s GHG emissions —puts significant pressure on the upfront investment in green technologies, with unit costs exceeding those of traditional options by more than four times(10). As much as 85% of global clean energy investment flows to advanced economies, while India and other developing markets receive only 15%.

A rapid green shift — if not carefully managed — can disproportionately affect rural areas, vulnerable groups such as coal sector workers, MSMEs, and small-scale manufacturers reliant on traditional energy. With agriculture supporting 58% of rural livelihoods, seasonal as well as climate variations often impact income stability and over-dependence on public system or markets.

A woman from Belkhedi, Madhya Pradesh, painfully shares how markets do offer economic opportunities, especially during festivals such as Holi, but exploit or even at times disturb local resources by introducing synthetic materials into their ecosystem. A just transition demands targeted skill-building for workforce readiness, reskilling programs, and local bioeconomic diversification to avoid adverse social and environmental impacts.

Road transport dominates the nation’s freight and passenger movement, and food miles now account for nearly 3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, which is a trade-off between emissions and food security. For instance, Bijapur and Sukma in Chhattisgarh still get food transported from more than 400 km away and have one of the highest percentages of malnourished children under five years of age.

Biodiversity underpins India’s economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism, directly supporting over 200 million livelihoods and contributing resources worth billions annually. There are competing agendas of crop diversification versus an ecosystem of policy and market incentives, almost like working for the promotion of monocropping, especially for wheat and paddy. India’s aggressive push for ethanol blending has brought the maize trade-off between ethanol and animal feed. There is a need to adopt a deep dive into sector-wise localised approach that takes into consideration the cross-overs of benefits as well as losses between different strategies, conflicting policies, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and a focus on both local realities and global opportunities.

Landscape approach to green economy

What is required is a commitment to a growth model that puts sustainability, climate action, and social inclusion at the heart of development, with measures to address these regional disparities, integration in less-developed, high-potential states, and the need for the creation of robust green economy ecosystems. To navigate through these trade-offs, disruptions, disparities and the pressure on achieving green growth, an assessment of landscapes is crucial. Landscapes are to be viewed as an integrated, interconnected and interactive system of many parameters such as landforms, land cover, water resources, flora-fauna, energy systems, local markets, local institutions and communities together. A shared comprehensive understanding of the landscape needs to be integrated into the green economy transition. This method allows us to assess and improve ecological functions — such as air and water quality, habitat support, and climate regulation— while also boosting human benefits such as health, food and water security, recreation, and livelihoods. These efforts help us stay within the ecological ceiling, ensuring landscapes can continue to regenerate. A defining feature could be the shift to truly participatory pathways of landscape assessment right from nano (village level) to macro (landscape level).

First, leveraging the 2.5 lakh Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), 12 million women-led institutions, and 0 million local authorities at every stage, from design to monitoring of this transition. Promotion of circularity, green energy and bioeconomy, with gender mainstreaming through targeted policies for leadership and technical roles for women, inclusive governance, stakeholder collaboration, and investments in green infrastructure and nature-based solutions generate multiple returns over time.

For instance, a woman from Kulgaon village in Chhattisgarh aspires to start an enterprise of cold-pressed oil extraction from Tori seeds for supplying to her village for better health, better availability of raw materials, promoting local production and local consumption. A supportive ecosystem for such aspirations can be co-created with shift in the metrics from not just decreased poverty and job creation, but also to improved social and environmental returns. Landscape-driven planning, ownership and clarity, integrating ecosystem valuation into policy and economic strategies, will help in setting the right direction and course. Many low-hanging fruits can be targeted with pivots such as green budgeting, clearer enforcement roles, targeted fiscal incentives, green government procurement, deeper involvement of gram panchayats, local authorities and CBOs, prioritising skills, gender inclusion, and local capacity building in greening all sectors.

Addressing the bottlenecks, such as improved waste management at all levels with SOPs for enforcement, financing cum O&M ecosystem for decentralised renewables, policy coordination between departments for responding to aspirations of communities, and greening the R&D spend, will also ensure a push for many sectors with bio-economy potential. With such models, India can not only achieve its climate and sustainable development goals but also unlock new engines of growth, resilience, and wellbeing for its landscapes and all its citizens.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/9uahbn/article70106598.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_Govt-tightens-n_G1LE_2_1_64EN9606.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 17:59:46.852102

""As we phase out coal, we continue to expand wind and solar resources and add more energy storage to our portfolio,"" CPS Energy stated.","Advocates are calling out San Antonio-based CPS Energy for its affordability and clean energy efforts. The criticism followed a recent study that gave the local utility a ""C"" grade, which is a major jump from the company's 2021 ""F"" score.

The Sierra Club, America's largest grassroots environmental organization, released on Monday, September 22, its annual Dirty Truth report, which evaluates and scores utilities for their plans to transition to clean energy. The Dirty Truth report focuses on three metrics to gauge impacts on affordability and public health due to fossil fuel pollution: Utility efforts to retire coal plants by 2030; not build new gas plants through 2035; and build clean energy to replace fossil generation and serve new load by 2035.

CPS Energy's ranking

According to the report, CPS Energy scored a ""C"" due to the company making some investments in additional solar and battery storage and its closure of one coal unit. However, the Sierra Club noted the company is doubling down on gas as part of its current and future portfolio. Over the years, the Dirty Truth has given CPS Energy the following grades: ""C"" in 2025, 2024 and 2023; ""D"" in 2022 and ""F"" in 2021.

Public Citizen, an American non-profit, progressive consumer rights advocacy group, reviewed the Dirty Truth report and demanded that CPS Energy ""make better plans and additional investments in clean energy rather than continuing its reliance on fossil fuels to meet increasing customer demand.""

""CPS Energy should prioritize its customers' pocketbooks at a time when so many San Antonians are enduring an affordability crisis,"" DeeDee Belmares, who is based in San Antonio as a clean energy advocate for the Texas office of Public Citizen, stated in a release. ""Embracing wind, solar and battery storage can offer the savings and reliability residents need. The old way of doing things - burning gas and coal - delivers higher costs and dirty air.""

Belmares commended CPS Energy for approving a plan in 2023 to phase out and shut down a coal plant by 2028. But, Belmares added, the company took a step backward after it acquired four power plant facilities in Southeast Texas. CPS Energy acquired Missouri-based PROENERGY natural gas plants in Harris, Brazoria and Galveston counties.

All four facilities are in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas network. Together, the plants provide an electric capacity of approximately 1,632 megawatts, which can power approximately 325,000 to 408,000 average homes per year, depending on the time of day and energy use.

CPS Energy responds to the report

CPS Energy told MySA the company remains ""committed to delivering reliable, affordable energy that keeps pace with San Antonio's growth, while investing in resources that reduce emissions and strengthen long-term sustainability.""

""As we phase out coal, we continue to expand wind and solar resources and add more energy storage to our portfolio,"" CPS Energy stated. ""Natural gas remains an essential part of our generation mix as it is cost-effective, produces fewer carbon emissions than coal, and helps us transition away from older and less efficient units while maintaining reliability and affordability for our customers. Our upcoming generation plan refresh will take into account how our community can continue to benefit from a diverse and sustainable energy portfolio.""

Texas utilities deliver mixed results

Other Texas utilities were scored in the Dirt Truth report. The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) got another ""F,"" the lowest score of all utilities in Texas. LCRA has received an ""F"" score for years due to the company keeping the Fayette coal plant open east of Austin, near La Grange, and planning for zero investment in affordable renewables, according to the Sierra Club. LCRA sells its power wholesale to 29 cities and four rural electric cooperatives across Texas.

Xcel Texas has maintained its ""B"" grade, largely due to ""forward-looking plans to retire the expensive, dirty, and water-guzzling Tolk coal plant in the Panhandle as the Ogallala Aquifer continues to dwindle,"" the Sierra Club stated.

For this year, all the utilities studied scored 15/100, earning an ""F,"" worsening their overall score by 3 points since the organization's first report in 2021. The Sierra Club studied 50 parent companies that own the most fossil fuel generation, comprised of 75 operating companies, which collectively own half of all remaining coal and gas generation in the U.S.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/15f58_lG9fZ9blGjalhHhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mysa_hearst_708/ee54783045eb4ea04855b6004a84e083,N,,2025-09-28 23:58:48.244108

“You pay extra for the EV decal on the vehicle, so you kind of want some sort of benefit to it,” Seyat Nuriyeva, a Tesla driver affected by the change, said.

“Now that they’re taking it away, it’s kind of like, well, what’s the point in paying extra for the plate now?” she said.

These express lanes on I-85 through Gwinnett County were once HOV lanes. However, since becoming toll lanes, the state allowed drivers of electric and alternative fuel cars to use them free of charge.

The state tollway authority reports that nearly 40,000 trips are made daily on I-85’s express lanes, and nearly 17,000 on the express lane extension, with roughly 20% of those trips being toll-exempt.

The change is likely to put more electric and alternative fuel vehicles in the main travel lanes, potentially causing greater congestion.

Startup NatPower reported that it is investing more than $1.1 billion into a giant 32-acre battery energy storage facility near Middlesbrough that will store renewable energy for later use, allowing more clean power to supplement the grid.

The Teesside Gigapark will be located at the energy and utility service Sembcorp Utilities' site. It will be the largest and longest-duration storage facility of its kind once completed in 2028, Interesting Engineering and NatPower reported.

""The Teesside Gigapark is more than a storage project. It combines large-scale batteries with industrial electrification … setting a new standard for the U.K. energy sector,"" IE's Sujita Sinha wrote.

NatPower touts the privately funded project as a money-saving grid support that could conserve $4.1 billion in efficiencies annually by saving typically wasted renewable energy. It will use lithium-ion batteries that can store electricity for four hours, per IE.

Holding the cleaner power is crucial for using it during peak demand times, such as early evening hours when the sun goes down, but power use remains high. NatPower plans for the Teesside facility to eventually be able to provide electricity over an impressive eight hours, IE's report added.

Battery storage is being developed in the United States, too. In Texas, Tesla Megapacks are key grid contributors. A nearly 5,000-acre solar panel/battery storage facility is operational near Las Vegas.

It's a concept that can be realized at home, as well. Rooftop solar panels combined with batteries can generate and store free solar energy that can reduce or eliminate your utility bill. EnergySage is a free resource that can help you secure tax incentives while they last, compare quotes, and find a timely professional installer. It's advice that can save you up to $10,000 if you buy the panels before rebates expire at the end of the year due to federal policy changes.

The cleaner energy, at homes and at larger facilities, also limits planet-warming pollution produced when dirty fuels are burned to generate power. Air pollution impacts nearly everyone on the planet, according to the World Health Organization. And Earth's overheating is even hurting academic performance, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At Teesside, NatPower officials have some interesting plans for the battery project. Around 200 construction jobs will be created. Looking forward, officials intend to work with colleges and environmental groups on training programs for future clean-energy jobs. A focus of the project will be powering ships at a nearby port, allowing the vessels to turn off dirty diesel engines, all according to IE.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tYpVk4nl0kLnJ9EZ_XvLvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/b2819a6d614aa2d36f8e4b9e95dc7438,N,,2025-09-28 17:59:52.180475

For households and communities, the shift to renewable energy will mean lower electricity bills, greater energy independence, and new job opportunities.","A diverse group of government leaders, private sector executives, financiers, and civil society representatives came together in New York for the High-Level Session on Renewable Energy Abundance, one of the flagship events of Climate Week NYC and the official opening of the Global Renewables Summit. The session was held at a pivotal moment in the global energy transition, just days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, where countries are expected to present their updated national climate action plans (NDCs).

The gathering highlighted the collective commitment of governments and industry to accelerate the development of zero-emissions infrastructure, which will reshape economies and societies worldwide. Participants stressed that renewable energy technologies are no longer a distant vision but are already reducing costs for businesses and communities while creating opportunities for innovation, competitiveness, and long-term resilience.

Key leaders who addressed the event included Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; William Ruto, President of Kenya; Philip Davis, Prime Minister of the Bahamas; Chris Bowen, Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy; Andrew Forrest, Founder and Executive Chairman of Fortescue; Bruce Douglas, CEO and Founder of the Global Renewables Alliance; and Mike Rann, Chair of the Board of Climate Group.

Ursula von der Leyen noted that 2024 saw nearly two trillion dollars invested in clean energy, with spending on renewables now outpacing fossil fuels by a factor of two to one. She underlined that while the economic case for renewables is strong, momentum alone is insufficient, and decisive action is required. She called on governments to create enabling regulatory environments and on businesses and investors to commit their capital, innovation, and technology to areas where the impact would be greatest. According to her, renewable energy is not only about climate mitigation but also about energy security and economic prosperity.

Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas emphasised the need to frame renewable energy as a driver of prosperity rather than sacrifice. He argued that the narrative around clean energy should highlight opportunities, not constraints, and stressed that every solar panel installed, every regulation reformed, and every upgraded grid contributes to a more abundant and secure energy future. He urged global leaders to focus on progress over perfection, noting that collaboration strengthens the chances of success.

The session also explored how the global economy is shifting from an era of energy scarcity to one defined by abundance. Leaders discussed how renewable energy and electrification will serve as the foundation for prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness in the years ahead. They agreed that a clean energy system can simultaneously deliver affordability, security, and sustainability, creating widespread economic and social benefits.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), noted that investments in renewables have grown steadily by 14 percent annually since 2018 despite global challenges such as pandemics and inflation. However, he pointed out that emerging markets and developing economies still receive less than 10 percent of energy transition financing, despite accounting for a third of global GDP. He urged global leaders to place equity and inclusivity at the core of the transition as the world moves toward the target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030, as agreed under the UAE Consensus.

Bruce Douglas, CEO of the Global Renewables Alliance, reinforced that phasing out fossil fuels while building renewable energy abundance is the only path to long-term prosperity, stability, and security. He urged immediate collective action to accelerate this transformation. Similarly, Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago, President-Designate of COP30, highlighted the growing integration of renewables with broader agendas such as energy justice, independence, and affordability, stressing how simpler technologies and scalable infrastructure can drive economic growth.

For households and communities, the shift to renewable energy will mean lower electricity bills, greater energy independence, and new job opportunities.

The Department of Energy still has an Office of Fusion Energy Science, but the Chinese equivalent is out-spending it at a ratio of 2:1.
The Chinese government has made fusion power a national priority and last month launched the state-owned China Fusion Energy Co (CFEC) with $US2.1 billion in capital.
So he's hardly likely to back fusion energy to replace coal and oil and help stop global warming.
If China beats the US to fusion energy, its supremacy will be assured.","Late last week, US President Donald Trump used separate social media posts to announce several new tariffs, described later as the ""bonfire of the bathroom vanities.""

That's because there's a new 50 per cent tariff on imports of kitchen and bathroom cabinets, plus 100 per cent on pharmaceuticals, 30 per cent on upholstered furniture, and 25 per cent on heavy trucks.

In truth, it's the bonfire of the 80-year-old global trading and financial system and America's leadership of it, along with global economics, technology and science.

A monumental deal

On the same day as Trump took aim at America's foot with those new tariffs, something else happened that was potentially much more momentous for global geopolitics: the Italian energy giant, Eni, agreed to buy $1 billion worth of electricity generated from nuclear fusion by the US company Commonwealth Fusions Systems (CFS).

Eni — not an American power company — will take electricity from the Commonwealth's Virginia-based ""Arc"" facility, which is due to start construction in 2027 or 2028 and deliver grid electricity in the early 2030s.

This is the first commercial fusion-power deal and marks the beginning of what will be the next great energy transition.

Fusion happens when two atomic nuclei, usually the hydrogen isotope deuterium, join together and form a heavier element, releasing a lot more energy than the current form of nuclear power, fission, which involves breaking atoms apart.

Like fission power generation, fusion is free of greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike fission, it's completely safe, creates little waste, and the fuel is much more plentiful than uranium.

Deuterium is found in water, and there is enough of it in the world's oceans to power the world for millions of years.

And fusion energy looks to be another way in which America is yielding global supremacy to China.

Loading

CFS was spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Plasma Science and Fusion Center in 2018, which was set up in 1976 with funding from the US Department of Energy.

It's been a 50-year scientific journey so far. By comparison, it took 16 years to get from the discovery of nuclear fission to the first nuclear power plant (in the USSR). Fusion is much harder to do than fission.

Trump's 2026 budget slashes funding for science and universities, and while no specific cutbacks have been announced for MIT's fusion and plasma research, it is clearly at risk, along with all basic scientific research in the US.

The Department of Energy still has an Office of Fusion Energy Science, but the Chinese equivalent is out-spending it at a ratio of 2:1.

The Chinese government has made fusion power a national priority and last month launched the state-owned China Fusion Energy Co (CFEC) with $US2.1 billion in capital.

There is now a race between China's CFEC and America's CFS to generate fusion electricity, and both are talking about 2027 as the year they enter the final lap. But with the Trump administration cutting back science funding and China increasing it, you'd be brave to back America in this race.

Meanwhile, in a speech to the United Nations earlier last week, Trump doubled down on his opposition to renewable energy, calling climate change the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion"", and added that he had signed executive orders to hunt for oil because ""we have the most of any nation in the world"".

""And if you add coal, we have the most of any nation in the world,"" he said.

""I call it clean, beautiful coal.""

So he's hardly likely to back fusion energy to replace coal and oil and help stop global warming.

Elsewhere in that speech, he said that everyone thought Russia would win the war in Ukraine in three days, ""but it didn't work out that way"".

That's true, and one reason for that is drones, which have now become the key weapon of war and evened up the battlefield between the bullied and the bully.

From ANZUS to AUKUS

In World War I, coal-powered trains were the key to military success, getting troops and supplies to the front. In World War II, it was oil-powered tanks and planes. Now it's cheap, electric battery-powered drones.

In June, the French Institute for International Relations published a paper that said: ""… the Russian invasion of Ukraine has become the theatre of a massive drone-driven transformation of military operations. This phenomenon is unprecedented, both in quantitative terms — with several million drones now produced and destroyed each year —and in its influence on the dynamics of operations and the structure of forces.""

American supremacy in the second half of the 20th century rested on having built global leadership in three things that it did while World War II was still going: harnessing nuclear fission with the Manhattan Project in 1942, making an alliance and oil deal with Saudi Arabia in 1943, and hosting the Bretton Woods conference in New Hampshire in 1944 that established the post-war financial system with the US dollar and free trade at its centre.

So, when Australian prime minister Sir Robert Menzies retired in 1966, he said, justifiably: ""If I were asked which was the best single step that had been taken in the time of my government, I think I would say the ANZUS Treaty.""

But now ANZUS, signed in 1951 and entrenched and expanded by AUKUS in 2021 (if the Americans don't bail), is the proverbial old generals fighting the last war — the submarines it is supposed to provide will be useless against drones, including underwater ones.

More broadly, for the next few years at least, the US is an autocracy that is unreliable and unfocused, in what might be called the set-up phase.

At least Trump's authoritarianism is out in the open; China's is cloaked in fine-sounding rhetoric, but it is mature and very focused.

China's weak climate target

Chinese President Xi Jinping also addressed the UN last week, saying: ""This year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations. Eighty years later, while the historical trends of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit remain unchanged, the Cold War mentality, hegemonism and protectionism continue to haunt the world.""

He announced China's emissions reduction targets for 2035, contrasting his approach with Trump by talking about how China is at the forefront of the energy transition, that it would increase solar, wind and hydropower to run more than 30 per cent of its power system over the next decade and said in China, ""new energy vehicles are the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles"".

But then he came out with about the world's weakest 2035 target (apart from America's non-existent one, of course): 7 to 10 per cent down from the peak, whatever that was.

Experts were baffled and unhappy, but I suspect it's simply because China is more focused on electrifying its economy than reducing carbon emissions, so it's building every type of generation, as fast as possible, including both coal and fusion.

That's because it's not just warfare that is becoming electrified through drones, but the new technology that is revolutionising civilian life: artificial intelligence.

On Friday, the chief executive of Walmart, Doug McMillon, said: ""It's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.""

The military industrial complex on which American power has been based is morphing into the ""electro tech stack"".

China is driving hard to supplant the US in this new military industrial complex, and has already achieved leadership in electric vehicles, batteries, drones, renewable energy and is working on semiconductors and AI.

Someday, nuclear reactors the size of shipping containers could power your hometown, but a huge number of regulatory hurdles will have to be cleared before nuclear power starts popping up in your backyard – and public buy-in will be critical.

After decades of relatively little change in nuclear power technology, there is currently a flurry of nuclear energy innovation taking place around the world. Scientists are looking into how to make nuclear power production more efficient, cost-effective, safe, and streamlined in response to an ever-growing need for reliable and carbon-free energy production. Like renewable energies, nuclear power is carbon-free, but unlike solar and wind power, the production potential of nuclear power is steady and constant, making it an attractive option for energy security in the decarbonization era.

Some of the potential new nuclear technologies garnering investor attention are small reactors and microreactors. In recent years nuclear energy development has been trending toward much smaller models in the interest of lowering up-front development costs and making new nuclear projects more easily deployable.

Most of the excitement and investment has been geared toward small modular reactors (SMRs), which many advocates believe could be the backbone of a nuclear renaissance in the United States and other countries that have begun to move away from nuclear power production. These modular models can be mass-produced in a factory setting and installed on-site alone or in clusters to create utility-scale nuclear power plants more quickly and cheaply than traditional large-scale models.

Microreactors, which have so far received less attention and funding support than SMRs, are much smaller. While a full-scale nuclear power plant would produce, on average, upward of 700 megawatts, and an individual SMR would produce about 300 megawatts, a microreactor’s output would be around 10 megawatts.

While microreactors are much smaller, they could be used to power entire towns for a relatively low up-front cost, and they have unique selling points compared to SMRs and traditional nuclear power plants. They’re safer than larger models, and they’re so small that they could be brought in on a truck or barge, hugely easing the installation process. Plus, microreactors do not require any on-site workers for their operation and maintenance, and can be operated remotely and autonomously.

“Microreactors have the ability to provide clean energy and have passive safety features, which decrease the risk of radioactive releases,” Euro News reported earlier this year. “They are also much cheaper than bigger plants as they are factory-built and then installed where they are needed in modules.”

All of these benefits mean that microreactors could be enormously useful in a wide range of contexts. A recent article in The Conversation touts their utility, saying that “this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.”

The problem is that while the microreactors themselves would be relatively low-cost, building the facilities to construct these microreactors would be a massive and expensive undertaking. And so far no one has been willing to take that risk. Investors want guaranteed orders before they build such a factory, and potential buyers want to see the technology built, tested, and proven before they place an order. “It’s a catch-22,” says The Conversation’s Aditi Verma.

There’s another considerable downside to widespread deployment of microreactors and small modular reactors – surprisingly large amounts of nuclear waste. A Stanford study found that “most small modular reactor designs will actually increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal, by factors of 2 to 30,” said lead author Lindsay Krall. “These findings stand in sharp contrast to the cost and waste reduction benefits that advocates have claimed for advanced nuclear technologies.”

Community buy-in is essential to get microreactors off the ground, but those communities need to seriously consider the cost of managing all that nuclear waste. The many benefits of microreactors may still be worth it, but nuclear waste is a major cost to taxpayers that should not be overlooked.

In addition to producing less planet-heating pollution per mile than gas-powered vehicles, EVs can save owners thousands of dollars per year in fuel costs, according to the Department of Energy.

To take the environmental benefits and cost savings of driving an EV even further, you can pair an electric vehicle with a home solar system. Charging an EV from home solar is cheaper than doing so from the electrical grid or at a public charging station, plus you get the added benefit of knowing that your vehicle is powered by cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

By Aidan Hughes for Inside Climate News

The energy and natural resource sector has spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying the federal government so far this year, according to data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets.

That spending comes amid a wave of policy wins for fossil fuel interests—and significant setbacks for environmental and green energy groups.

Nearly $240 million poured in during the first and second quarters of 2025, with about 2,200 lobbyists representing the sector—nearly half of whom are former government employees themselves. That spending puts the sector slightly ahead of last year’s pace, when its yearly total reached $435 million.

This year’s expenditures make energy and natural resources the fifth-largest lobbying sector that OpenSecrets tracked over this period—ahead of transportation, defense and labor.

Electric utilities represented the largest share of those expenditures, totaling nearly $75 million.

That’s more than half of what it spent in all of 2024 combined—the industry’s biggest year in over a decade.

And with about $71 million already spent on lobbying this year, the oil and gas industry continues to significantly outpace the renewable industry’s lobbying expenditures of roughly $40 million.

The totals for oil and gas so far this year put the industry slightly below the pace of last year’s expenditures, which totaled over $150 million—its highest since 2009.

However, watchdog organizations say the industry’s steady funding is actually the result of its existing influence within the federal government.

“When you’ve got a White House that has made clear that they’re going to do whatever you want, you don’t have to spend as much money to get results,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “They had to spend more when you had bipartisan, shared control over government, and you didn’t have a rubber stamp in the Oval Office. Now they do.”

Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration and Republicans in Congress have pushed through a slew of regulatory and legislative measures fulfilling the priorities of fossil fuel interests, often at the expense of renewables.

The party’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been criticized as a handout to the fossil fuel industry that increases lease sales for drilling and mandates that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining.

Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told CNBC at the time that the bill “includes almost all of our priorities.”

The administration has also granted Clean Air Act exemptions to dozens of fossil fuel-burning power plants, delaying their need to reduce emissions of mercury and other air toxins.

And the EPA’s announcement that it intends to rescind its “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases would remove the basis for its ability to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.

These moves have come amid a reversal of government support for renewable energy projects. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act included a phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar that critics say runs counter to the administration’s goal of achieving “energy dominance.”

Wind energy, in particular, has been singled out as a target by the administration. Trump issued a presidential memorandum on his first day in office halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects. The administration later took the unusual step of issuing stop-work orders for some offshore wind projects that were already under construction.

Multiple watchdog organizations told Inside Climate News that the real source of the fossil fuel industry’s current influence stems in part from industry insiders who have been strategically placed into key government positions. That list includes Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, and a range of political appointees with ties to the industry within the EPA.

In an emailed statement, a White House spokesperson did not directly address concerns about administration officials’ ties to fossil fuel interests, but said that “President Trump has kept his Day One promise to unleash American energy, protecting our national security and lowering costs for families and businesses.”

According to Robert Maguire, vice president for research and data at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, those ties have meant that the fossil fuel industry hasn’t had to increase spending on lobbying to secure key wins.

“This has been a hallmark of both [of] Trump’s terms, where essentially he fills his administration with lobbyists and industry officials who, in many cases, have no government experience,” Maguire said. “Their only qualifications for the jobs that he’s putting them in is the fact that they want to do the industry’s bidding within the government.”

A source within the oil and gas industry, however, downplayed the effect of the “revolving door” of industry insiders gaining positions within the government, and instead emphasized that Trump came into office with an already-friendly attitude toward oil and gas.

The source, who requested anonymity to speak freely on the topic, said that industry lobbyists have had conversations with people in government who are “more engaged or more willing to talk for any number of reasons,” saying that there is “expertise” within the current administration on matters tied to the oil and gas industry that didn’t exist during the Biden administration.

Although the source emphasized that the industry has still fought difficult policy battles this year, including over tax credits for clean hydrogen projects, they said that this expertise has meant that industry lobbyists haven’t needed to spend as much effort educating lawmakers or officials on key issues.

Utilities, meanwhile, continue to have a “massive” amount of influence in D.C., according to David Pomerantz, executive director of the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute.

But he noted that far fewer utility insiders have been appointed to positions within the federal government during Trump’s second term.

And unlike the oil and gas industry, the agendas of various utility companies are more complex, and sometimes reveal significant differences between what utilities want and what the Trump administration wants.

“Where the utilities are lobbying for policies or regulatory changes that will allow them to burn more coal and gas, they’re successful,” Pomerantz said.

“The EPA basically said, ‘If you want waivers so that you do not have to comply with pollution limits, all you have to do is send us an email.’”

Still, Pomerantz said that not all utility companies sought out those exemptions—and that some utilities have also lobbied unsuccessfully against some of the Trump administration’s anti-renewables policies.

“Even [with] their considerable political power notwithstanding, the utilities have tried … to prevent some of the worst attacks on wind and solar,” Pomerantz said, “and they’ve basically failed at every turn.”

Although the renewable energy industry continues to lag behind oil and gas, its spending so far of roughly $40 million puts it on pace to eclipse last year’s record of $63.7 million.

This year’s spikes are driven in part by massive increases from the renewable industry’s top spender—the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

ACP’s expenditures in the second quarter of 2025 alone, which reached $3.8 million, were nearly twice the amount the trade association spent in all of 2024 combined.

The $4.3 million it has spent so far this year places it ahead of any of the oil and gas industry’s trade associations. The American Petroleum Institute, by comparison, spent just under $4 million, while American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers spent less than $3 million

But Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, suggested that ACP’s efforts have been unsuccessful.

“The American Clean Power Association sort of is on the outside looking in, and I’m not sure that any amount of money is going to be able to overcome this,” he said.

Slocum also said that the association had “badly misjudged their strategy” by assuming they could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.

“They thought that they could build a bipartisan appeal for renewable energy, and you see that with a few senators like [Chuck] Grassley and [Lisa] Murkowski, but for the most part, you know, mainstream Republicans just do not want to challenge Trump publicly,” Slocum said.

In an emailed statement, ACP suggested that its efforts on Capitol Hill helped the renewable energy industry avert even worse outcomes—and defended the association’s attempts to build bridges with key Republican legislators.

“The ability to successfully remove the destructive excise tax [from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] and secure a more reasonable phase out of clean energy tax credits required a sophisticated response to underscore the impact of these policies on consumers and the communities we represent,” said Jason Grumet, the CEO of ACP.

“Despite the highly polarized environment, a group of Republican senators came forward to support the core interests of the clean energy industry,” Grumet said. “Securing this support for provisions that the entire Republican caucus originally voted against is an important accomplishment.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1442146/story_image/AP25140741660616.jpg?1749501029,N,,2025-09-28 15:01:58.636131

“When Democrats had one-party rule in Washington, you saw them appropriating tens of billions of dollars to go through their well-connected left-wing environmentalist NGO friends, former Biden and Obama officials, and Democratic donors,” Zeldin said on Newsmax’s “Sunday Report,” referring to nongovernmental organizations.

He added that President Donald Trump often talks about ending the Democrats’ Green New Deal “scam” and that the administration has been dismantling it all year long, saying it has been “abusing the wallets of Americans.”

Zeldin said voters made clear last November that they wanted a new direction, sending Trump back to the White House. He argued that the final years of the Biden administration were marked by regulatory decisions aimed at “suffocating out of existence entire sectors of our economy.”

Looking ahead, he said the Trump team is focused on unleashing U.S. energy dominance, lowering costs, and fostering innovation. “We need to make America the AI capital of the world,” he said. “We need to be able to better afford energy costs to ramp up energy production.”

The Trump administration last week announced it was canceling nearly $680 million in federal funding for 12 offshore wind projects, including the first terminal on the Pacific coast. California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office criticized the cuts as an attack on clean energy and jobs.

Zeldin countered that private investors are eager to build new energy projects without taxpayer money, but offshore wind only survives with massive subsidies.

“We need to be massively ramping up baseload power in this country,” he said. “People and companies want to invest. They’re not asking for money to get them to build these projects. They’re looking for the government to just get out of the way.”

He added that offshore wind economics don’t add up.

“These projects would not exist without government subsidy,” Zeldin said. “On the one hand, we can massively, efficiently ramp up baseload power without having to subsidize it with federal dollars,” he said. “On the other hand, we could be pursuing these other energy sources, really lying to ourselves and the country as if it is a substitute for baseload power … The president is looking at the economics, and it’s a no-brainer for him.”

Zeldin also pointed to earlier federally backed projects that faltered, including California’s Ivanpah solar facility, which will close in 2026 after receiving more than $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees during the Obama administration.

“You’re talking about a project into the billions, not millions,” he said. Farmers and landowners across the country, he added, don’t want to see vast amounts of land taken up by solar panels that wear out prematurely. “And then what? Now you have all of these solar panels just sitting around. You might have these wind projects just sitting around.”

He said the debate over renewables also ignores the cost of battery storage needed to back up intermittent sources like wind and solar.

“Those battery storage sites cost a whole lot of money, and they then catch on fire,” Zeldin said. “Local municipalities, fire departments, they’re not prepared for those massive fires … That should be part of the discussion as well. And unfortunately, it hasn’t been.”

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

As of Monday, Weld County approved its own regulations on oil and gas, adding stricter regulations regarding pipeline placement.
That’s a scary world.” Also at the roundtable, Barron shared his desire to encourage the revival of nuclear energy in Weld County at the Colorado House of Representatives this fall, now that nuclear energy was deemed a clean energy source by Colorado lawmakers.
Jared Polis signed a bill into law reclassifying clean energy as energy with little to no carbon emissions.","U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans and other Colorado Republicans have set their sights on reducing environmental regulations in an effort to increase oil and gas production and revive nuclear power in Weld County.

Evans and State Reps. Carlos Barron and Scott Slaugh, who was recently appointed to District 64 after Ryan Armagost resigned, visited Aims Community College on Monday for a workforce roundtable. Evans’ message to the students and faculty who attended was clear: if we don’t improve our energy production, then Colorado will suffer.

Evans discussed China and its innovations in artificial intelligence and drone technology. For every 100,000 drones made in the U.S., China makes a million, he said. Evans praised AI for lessening workloads and promoting more “long-term strategic planning,” but the technology requires a lot of energy, he noted.

“Energy security is national security,” Evans said. “Energy security fuels our economy, which fuels our ability to manufacture and make things. That fuels our position as the global leader in a lot of these technologies and a lot of other technologies that require energy.”

Colorado remains the fourth-largest oil-producing state, accounting for 4% of the U.S. total crude oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Weld County is responsible for 80% of the state’s production.

In 2024, Colorado produced five times as much oil as it did 10 years earlier. Between 2024 and 2025, the total number of permits in effect in Weld County increased by 42%, resulting in the construction of 3,124 oil and gas wells within the county.

Evans believes the state needs to continue invest in oil and gas to better support the country’s energy security. At the roundtable, he blamed Colorado lawmakers for working against federal interests and implementing further regulations that support renewable energy while restricting oil and gas.

If the regulatory burden were reduced by consolidating the various regulatory forms required by the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act into a single regulation, Evans said, the permitting process could be sped up by several years. Evans said this would lead to a boost in the local economy, creating more jobs for people across the state as more oil and gas wells could be constructed.

“The problem that I’ve seen in the workforce, in both private and public, is people worrying about the stability of their job with respect to the decisions from the people above them,” said Thomas Hall, a student from Aims and a former intern at the Greeley Water Department. “It can be scary when there are doubts about whether or not their job will be funded this year. This is a trend that I’ve seen at every place that I’ve worked for.”

State lawmakers have cited environmental concerns such as air quality and safety as they’ve continued to push for regulations on the energy industry.

As of Monday, Weld County approved its own regulations on oil and gas, adding stricter regulations regarding pipeline placement. These regulations also emphasized the need for more in-depth emergency action plans to ensure that accidents are properly addressed and that the sites are safer for workers and residents, according to Weld County Oil and Gas Director Brett Cavanaugh.

Weld County Air Policy Analyst Annareli Morales said though more oil and gas wells would result in more air pollution, they would not necessarily be enough to cause problems with air quality. The effect of additional wells depends on how many more there are and where they are located, she said.

“Logically speaking, if you had more wells, you would have more emissions, even if they are cleaner,” Morales said. “But it’s the context of, relatively speaking, how much more is emitted with these additional permits compared to what vehicles emit during rush hour per day? Is it comparable? Is it less?”

According to a state report from October 2024, 60% of Colorado’s air pollution originates from the oil and gas industry, with 45% of that coming from Weld County alone.

Evans dismissed the concern, saying that 70% of the detected emissions in Weld County originate from outside Colorado, specifically Canada and China. Though Morales was hesitant to confirm this percentage, she did say more than half of ozone pollution is attributed to the base quality of the atmosphere as a whole.

“The latest data we have, which is very old, tells us that a significant amount of the total ozone is out of our local control,” Morales said. “There’s a very small portion that is human-caused. And then within that, there is an even smaller portion that the state actually has jurisdiction over to do something about.”

According to Morales, however, the current regulations in place, even if they are lessened to streamline the permitting process, would still be more stringent than those in other states. She backs Evans’ claim that unless Colorado reduces its regulations surrounding oil and gas, developers will go elsewhere, where they don’t have to deal with the regulatory burden.

“If we can’t build it here, China will happily build it for us, and we can lose our position of global leadership,” Evans said. “If we don’t do it, China’s going to do it, and if you think the world is a scary place now, wait until China’s the global leader on AI. That’s a scary world.”

Also at the roundtable, Barron shared his desire to encourage the revival of nuclear energy in Weld County at the Colorado House of Representatives this fall, now that nuclear energy was deemed a clean energy source by Colorado lawmakers. In March, Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill into law reclassifying clean energy as energy with little to no carbon emissions.

“It is the cleanest, safest, most reliable form of energy produced. Period,” said Weld County Commissioner Scott James, a proponent of “everything and anything energy related.”

“Now, granted, there is nuclear waste, but under the newer forms of reactors, they can take that spent fuel and get even more fuel out of it. The technology has so dramatically increased around nuclear power generation that the amount of radioactive material has dramatically decreased.”

Its this jump in technology surrounding nuclear energy over the past 40 years that Evans says will be critical to bringing nuclear power back to Colorado. In the effort to promote reusability, Barron suggested that Fort St. Vrain, an old nuclear plant in Platteville that was shut down in 1989, could be converted into a modular nuclear plant — a smaller-than-average plant with a reduced environmental footprint —and utilize the used fuel that is still stored there.

“It’s laughable that we are a growing economy that has a massive demand for electricity as we move from an agricultural to an industrial economy, as we transition from an industrial economy to a data economy,” James said. “We have to have that conversation about nuclear power. I think we’re foolish for not doing so.”

Despite the strong push for more oil and gas production and the revival of nuclear energy in the county, Evans did not want to give the impression that he’s against wind or solar energy. Barron, who works in the oil and gas industry, added that since oil drilling sites are often in remote locations, oil and gas companies often must use solar energy to power their equipment.

As the roundtable came to a close, Evans and his Republican colleagues reiterated their commitment to increasing jobs and ensuring Weld County remained a top energy producer in the state. Both he and Barron promised to continue pushing for further deregulation this year on both the state and federal levels.",https://www.greeleytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GRE-L-WREvans_a531e6.png?w=1024&h=528,N,,2025-09-28 15:01:06.867259

First, they undermine the development benefits sought by multilateral development bank projects.

This change is being prompted in part by the new U.S. administration and is also supported by developing country experts.

Yet, the reality remains that fossil fuel emissions, and specifically the climate change they induce, can severely undermine multilateral development bank projects and overall developing country growth prospects.

Most emissions, however, come from richer big economies, not poorer developing ones. Given the negative effects of these emissions, multilateral development banks need to push richer economies away from fossil fuels, even as they consider softening restrictions on lending for fossil fuel projects in poorer countries.

Last decade, multilateral development banks began restricting funding for fossil fuel projects due to concerns about emissions, but also under pressure from the U.S., European and other key stakeholders.

For example, the World Bank announced in 2017 it would largely stop funding gas drilling and extracting projects. Other multilateral development banks followed suit.

Many have noted the economic benefits being denied to poor countries by these restrictions, such as export revenues and power plants fueled by domestic gas reserves. Sub-Saharan Africa and South America have contributed little to historical global emissions — 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, a trend projected to continue.

As the International Energy Agency consistently highlights in its climate scenarios, the emissions reduction needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change must come, unsurprisingly, from the world’s biggest economies. This includes China, with 33 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in 2022, followed by the U.S. with 13 percent, the European Union taken as a block, Russia and then Japan. Together, these countries generate 60 percent of the global total. India is also a large emitter, but its level is driven more by a massive population than wealth.

These emissions, and specifically the climate change they drive, present two significant risks for multilateral development banks. First, they undermine the development benefits sought by multilateral development bank projects. Second, they create financial risks for these banks by potentially weakening the capacity of developing country borrowers to repay their loans.

The massive 2022 flooding in Pakistan illustrates the potentially devastating economic impact of climate change, as the country suffered over $30 billion in losses — nearly 10 percent of its GDP. This degree of devastation is not feasible to plan for or adapt to. It needs to be avoided.

Unfortunately, various factors stunt a proper appreciation of climate change’s potential destructive impact. First, there is the inability to see the future. Looking back or even to the present does not provide a full sense of the future potential destructive impact of climate change.

Second, climate change’s impact grows over time, producing more destruction in a more distant future. Its small impact on today’s stock market contrasts significantly with its potentially large-scale economic damage 15 to 20 years from now as climate change worsens.

That longer period is particularly relevant to multilateral development banks, whose projects often take years to mature, and whose corresponding loans extend beyond 15 years.

Third, this sense of uncertainty is being exploited by climate minimizers to play down the long-term perils of emissions relative to the shorter-term benefits of fossil fuel projects.

As a result, multilateral development banks are caught in a tricky dynamic: responding to pressures from key shareholders — notably the U.S. — to loosen restrictions on financing for fossil fuels while working to limit greenhouse gas emissions that negatively affect development.

Earlier this year, the World Bank’s president proposed an “all of the above” shift in approach, with more natural gas development projects, as well as nuclear power and other alternatives. Although this proposal was welcomed by some, the World Bank’s board in June deferred a decision on natural gas, even as it approved nuclear power.

The writing is on the wall as the U.S. pushes multilateral development banks to fund more fossil fuel projects. This debate will continue, including at the upcoming World Bank Annual Meetings next month.

In order to reduce the risks climate change poses for multilateral development banks, these organizations should launch an initiative to encourage the largest greenhouse gas violators to reduce their emissions.

Although these countries aren’t susceptible to influence by multilateral development bank lending policies, they are all leading shareholders and active on multilateral development bank boards. This involvement provides an avenue for multilateral development banks to engage with these countries.

The initiative for change could be built around analytic work, convenings and outreach regarding the negative development impact of wealthy country emissions. It could even be launched at October’s annual meetings.

Is that likely in today’s political environment? No, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t make sense.",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/senegal_natural_gas_lng_01232025_GettyImages-2195408775-1.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-28 13:01:54.133546

""The Ivanpah plant was a financial boondoggle and environmental disaster,"" she said, via AP.","A multibillion-dollar solar plant is set to close down next year because it's supposedly not 'serving its purpose', which has left everyone saying the same thing.

An eye-watering $2.2 billion was reportedly spent on the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, a solar thermal plant based in the Mojave Desert in California.

The plant, made up of three 459-foot towers and nearly 174,000 computer-controlled mirrors called heliostats, opened in 2014, but it will be switched off for good next year after failing to meet its energy targets despite hopes it was going to make America 'a world leader in solar energy'.

Next year's closure comes 13 years earlier than planned. The likes of Pacific Gas & Electric and NRG Energy Inc. were supposed to have contracts that lasted until 2039, Associated Press reported, but news broke back in January that they were ending their respective agreements early.

""PG&E determined that ending the agreements at this time will save customers money,"" the company said in a statement on its website at the time.

Meanwhile NRG dubbed the project 'successful' but that it unable to compete with rival photovoltaic solar technology.

Plans for the planet were approved back in 2010, and a year later, former President Barack Obama’s Department of Energy issued $1.6 billion in three federal loan guarantees.

With this in mind, Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System's upcoming closure has left a lot of Americans saying the same thing: that the whole debacle was a waste of taxpayers' money and government funding.

""Both a waste of money and an environmental disaster that will take decades to clean up,"" somebody said on Twitter, as another fumed: ""Yet another left-wing taxpayer-funded boondoggle turns out to be a useless waste of money.""

A third added: ""Another total failure and waste of taxpayer dollars by Gavin Newsom. Guy fails at everything he does.""

As another person insisted that the solar power plant 'was always a boondoggle'.

Julia Dowell of environmental organization The Sierra Club echoed similar sentiments earlier this year.

""The Ivanpah plant was a financial boondoggle and environmental disaster,"" she said, via AP. ""Along with killing thousands of birds and tortoises, the project’s construction destroyed irreplaceable pristine desert habitat along with numerous rare plant species.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
Big players on both sides The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the US, where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.","HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania, Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence (AI) race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants, and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the work

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9 percent stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible October 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a date center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the US and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the US, and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10 percent returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the US, where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19 percent premium — to affect electric rates.",https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://www.manilatimes.net/theme_manilatimes/images/TMT_1920x1008.jpg&w=1920&q=100&f=webp&v=1,N,,2025-09-28 15:01:50.001446

Gonzales resident Connie Thompson, who grew up in Gentilly, said she had always been curious about the seawall’s history. Thompson asked about the seawall’s construction and history, along with the scope of the wall: “I always wonder why the seawall was built around Lake Pontchartrain only on the New Orleans side? The year it was built? Was it to put people to work?”

The northshore has a similar, although smaller, seawall. The Mandeville concrete seawall was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project. The story of the New Orleans seawall is a bit of a deeper dive.

Kristi Trail, executive director of Pontchartrain Conservancy, reached back into the early days of European settlers and south Louisiana’s alluvial flood plain to begin to describe the seawall’s importance.

A growing city looks outward

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the city began expanding, looking for ways to grow outward, Trail said. Back then, what is now the Lakeview, Gentilly and City Park neighborhoods were all swamps. By the late 1800s, the Lakefront was in constant use for commerce and recreation. Fishing camps were set up with elevated walkways and structures, but had to maneuver around Lake Pontchartrain’s tidal pattern. The Port Pontchartrain lighthouse, which still stands today, was floating out on the water, unconnected to land, Trail said.

Mechanical engineer Albert Baldwin Wood, whose impact on New Orleans drainage cannot be overstated, opened up new possibilities with his screw pump invention, patent filed in 1913. The screw pump could pump massive amounts of water, allowing for quick drainage of swampland — although this mass draining would eventually cause subsidence issues.

In the 1920s, the Orleans Levee Board began a huge project of reclaiming land from the lake. The lakefront development used clam shells from the lake to mix with sediment dredged from the lake bottom for this new land. In 1930, the Orleans Levee Board started what would be about a 2½-year project to build an 8-foot-high concrete seawall, according to the Lakefront Management Authority. The seawall was set into place to halt shoreline erosion and offer flood protection for the newly created area.

“The mud they are pumping in from the lake to fill in all that area, from Allen Toussaint to the seawall, it's just mud, and it's so soft to build on,” Trail said. “So this is when the clamshell dredging began in the lake.""

Those clams were taken out of the lake to mix in with those soft soils in the neighborhoods, Trail said. ""Those neighborhoods are all built on reclaimed land, as a result of the sea wall going in, which allowed those neighborhoods to be built,"" she said.

Dredging harmed lake environment

The project indirectly led to Trail’s current job — large-scale clam dredging led to massive environmental lake degradation. In the wake of this degradation, environmental advocacy groups popped up to defend the lake, one of which became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Since clamshell dredging was banned in 1990, the lake has started to bounce back. As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.

“It's solid concrete installation techniques. …I would bet it's probably sunk a pretty good bit over time, but I don't have the data on that,” Trail said. “We're out there every day, we see it. It's still there. It's still doing its job.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/8a/38a3d1ff-b52d-5ab6-a50e-1f66b7f2c0c6/66301c56851bb.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-28 18:00:28.636547

The company announced that it has secured $9 million in seed funding. Eclipse led this significant investment round.

The funding will significantly accelerate the deployment of Anode’s mobile battery energy storage system, or mBESS, technology. This will involve working closely with their initial customers and forging strong partnerships with strategic collaborators, allowing their innovative solutions to reach a broader market and address critical energy needs.

Anode’s mBESS technology, along with their comprehensive microgrid solutions, presents a distinctly superior alternative to traditional power rental services. These older services typically depend heavily on noisy, polluting generators and the logistical complexities of fuel delivery. Anode operates with a vertically integrated business model, meaning it manages every aspect of its offering. This includes developing purpose-built hardware specifically designed for their systems, crafting proprietary software that powers their operations, and providing AI-powered services that optimize performance and efficiency.

Through this integrated approach, Anode can deliver highly flexible and remarkably high-performance solutions. These solutions are tailored to meet the demands of some of the largest entities that frequently rely on temporary power, including essential utilities, rapidly expanding data center owners, general contractors overseeing large-scale projects, and operators of growing electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle fleets.

There has been a profound and ever-increasing demand for electricity, a trend largely fueled by the exponential growth of AI data centers, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, and the ongoing expansion of industrial automation. This escalating demand is placing immense strain on an electrical grid that is already showing its age and struggling to keep up.

The pervasive effects of climate change are only magnifying the risks of significant business disruption for an economy that is becoming increasingly reliant on electrification. Historically, the temporary power industry has attempted to offer a stopgap solution through the use of traditional generators and mobile refueling services. But these analog solutions are deeply problematic; they are environmentally polluting, notoriously inefficient, and often prohibitively expensive, failing to meet modern demands for sustainable and cost-effective power.

Anode’s innovative technology and forward-thinking business model are together creating a completely new paradigm in the energy sector. They are introducing the concept of mobile batteries and on-demand energy delivery, transforming how temporary power is accessed and utilized.

By intelligently capitalizing on the continuously declining costs of battery technology and the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, Anode is uniquely positioned to deliver energy at prices that are not only competitive with traditional grid electricity but also a mere fraction of the cost associated with older fossil-fuel-powered solutions. This makes their offering economically attractive and environmentally responsible.

The team at Anode is built for substantial scale and impactful growth. The company’s founding members bring together a rich and diverse range of expertise. Their backgrounds include extensive experience in the complex field of autonomous vehicle development, specialized knowledge in electric vehicle powertrain engineering, critical insights from battery manufacturing processes, and a solid understanding of renewable energy project finance.

KEY QUOTES:

“U.S. electricity consumption is growing 5 times faster than recent historical averages, and our electric grid is struggling to keep up. The rapid electrification of our economy is creating transmission bottlenecks and electricity shortfalls, increasing demands for flexible, cost-competitive, grid-independent power. Anode’s AI-orchestrated microgrid solutions create a new model for large electricity users who can’t wait on the grid or be held back by legacy technologies to scale their operations.”

Paul Huelskamp, co-founder and CEO of Anode

“Anode is solving one of the most urgent challenges in the energy transition: Access to reliable, clean, and on-demand power. Their vertically integrated model and world-class team enable them to scale rapidly and electrify some of the most critical industries of the future. Anode is uniquely positioned to bridge the gaps in existing electrical infrastructure by delivering scalable energy solutions that will unlock growth across transportation, manufacturing, and beyond.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/09/Anode-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 14:00:00.570581

While political shifts in the United States are pulling the emergency break on clean energy policy mechanisms, the international energy sector is plowing full-steam ahead. “This is no longer a distant promise: it is happening now, at a pace and scale that was unthinkable even five years ago,” writes Reuters, “and it is being driven not just by advanced economies but increasingly by developing ones.”

As clean energy becomes cheaper, more reliable, and more decentralized, increasing adoption of renewable and clean energy technologies is a no-brainer for many countries. It’s not even about clean energy policy anymore – it’s basic economics. Take Pakistan – one of the world’s largest new adopters of solar power, at what may be the fastest rate in history. The nation’s traditional energy model based on fossil fuel imports has led to rolling blackouts and punishing energy prices for locals. As a result, citizens are increasingly turning to rooftop solar with attached battery systems to power their homes more affordably and reliably.

And Pakistan is just one example of many emerging economies that are turning to clean energy technologies to provide energy affordably, reliably, and locally. “The new generation of wind and solar power, batteries, and electric vehicles are on the verge of, or have already achieved, escape velocity, breaking free from the gravity of political capriciousness,” reads a recent article from Vox. “In a lot of places, especially in power generation, the cleanest option is also the fastest, the cheapest, and the one most likely to turn a profit. That’s true whether or not you care about the climate.”

A recent analysis from Ember shows that roughly two-thirds of the world’s emerging and developing economies are now leapfrogging the United States and Europe in their shift to clean energy. And it's clear why – the Ember report also calculates that 91 percent of new solar and wind developments are even cheaper than the cheapest fossil fuel plants when accounting for fuel cost. As a result, last year a whopping 87 percent of energy generation investment in emerging economies and China went to clean energy projects.

China has been instrumental in bringing clean energy to emerging economies around the globe. Through their ambitious Belt and Road international infrastructure project and well-established trade relationships, China has established itself as the central player of the global clean energy market. “Since 2018, Kenya, Yemen, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania have imported an amount of Chinese solar equal to roughly half the capacity of their entire power grid,” reads a recent report from Yale Environment 360. Recent United States policy has only served to solidify those trade relationships and incentivise closer ties between China and many emerging economies who have been targeted by steep tariffs.

However, developing nations still need a leg up in terms of climate financing if global targets are to be met. A coalition of rich and poor governments around the globe has prepared an open letter for this week’s U.N. General Assembly in New York this week urging global leaders to act swiftly in what is to be a ""decisive decade"" for the climate.

""Stark disparities in access to energy and investment remain,"" the statement warns. “Much more needs to be done to ensure the transition not only advances globally but also benefits the people and economies that need it most."" Africa, which has some of the greatest clean energy production potential in the world, has received only a fraction of global climate financing, despite the fact that its people are already suffering the impacts of climate change brought on by emissions from the Global North.

While the clean energy transition makes good economic sense, and has reached “escape velocity” in some contexts, scientists say that it needs to be significantly hastened to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. While clean energy projects are ramping up internationally, so too are fossil fuel developments.

The United States is facing an uphill battle in the wind sector thanks to several measures being championed by the current administration that aim to roll back the progress in the sector made during the Biden administration. The CVOW has the potential to completely transform the region and deliver short-term employment during the construction phase, as well as long-term jobs for Virginians.

The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is the largest of its kind in the United States

Wind power remains a crucial part of the energy sector in the United States, as it should. One would struggle to argue with the advantages that wind power presents to the energy sector. Wind is free, and as such, the inevitable costs that Virginians will need to fork out are exceedingly low. The project is located a mere 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach in federal waters.

Those federal waters may pose a risk to the completion of the project, as Donald Trump aims to prevent wind projects from making any progress during his administration. Which we must remember is only in year one of four. In August of this year, the project reported that over 130 turbine foundations have been installed.

Couple that with the fact that all undersea transmission cables are in place, and specialized U.S.-built installation vessels are being deployed from Virginia’s shores, and the construction progress is well on track to reach its 2026 completion date. Once that happens, the 176 Siemens Gamesa turbines will produce roughly 2.6 gigawatts of electricity, or enough to power up to 660,000 Virginia homes.

Dominion Energy reports that the project is approximately 60 percent complete

Dominion Energy has reported that the major components are on track for full deployment by the end of 2026. Which will provide crucial employment for local residents in the short and long term. Once operational, the site is expected to generate more than $210 million in annual economic output. Roughly 900 jobs have been created during the construction phase, with another 1,100 long-term jobs being created in the final phases.

According to Dominion Energy filings with the State Corporation Commission, the project is expected to reduce fuel costs by more than $3 billion over the first decade of operation. The project will have an environmental impact as well. Once operational, the project will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by a staggering 2 million metric tons.

The project plays a crucial role in the Virginia Clean Economy Act

The Virginia Clean Economy Act aims to mandate 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, as well as set a target of 5.2 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2035. The economic and environmental impact on the Virginia region will be substantial, to say the least. Despite the stance of the current administration, the project is on track to achieve its lofty goals and deliver crucial energy for the residents of Virginia, as well as deliver employment to thousands.

The longer summers have given these native bloodsuckers an extra three weeks on average to find a host.
It can make all the difference.” Advertisement REASON TO HOPE Maine scientists believe that people can help the environment adapt to the changing climate.
In certain areas, when the conditions are just right, they may be able to create new cold spots, she said.
“We can’t stop our rivers from warming, but we can slow down how fast it is happening,” Ouellet said.","When she looks at the Narraguagus River, Valerie Ouellet sees what others can’t: a thermal mosaic that explains why it’s one of the last places in America where wild Atlantic salmon come to spawn.

This 55-mile-long waterway in Downeast Maine is a hodgepodge of cold-water pockets hidden within the warmer river where adult salmon can find refuge from the state’s increasingly hot summers.

Atlantic salmon do their best growing and spawning in 68-degree water. Any higher and they stop eating; they lay fewer, smaller eggs. At 73 degrees, they swim erratically. If they don’t find cold water created by shade trees, spring-fed tributaries or groundwater seepage, some will die.

Ouellet is an ecologist with the Atlantic Salmon Federation and is part of a state and federal research team that has spent two years documenting the river’s temperature and flow to explore how close, how big and how cold these spots must be for salmon to survive.

Her research suggests cold water spots are shrinking or disappearing, especially during drought years. The Narraguagus now spends a lot of July and August above 73 degrees, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitoring data. On July 17, 2023, a legendary salmon pool in the Cherryfield section topped 83 degrees.

“Wild salmon are an indicator of ecosystem health,” Ouellet said. “If they go away because the water is too warm or not clean enough, what, or should I say who, do you think is in trouble next? That’s us.”

“If we lose them,” she said, “that means we’ve failed ourselves, too.”

The salmon’s struggle — which is shared by alewife and brook trout — is part of a much larger story unfolding across Maine. Projected to heat up by as much as 10 degrees by the year 2100, the state’s landscape is changing in ways that scientists are only just starting to understand, from its deepest waters to its highest peaks.

There is already a phenological disconnect in some areas — the dwarf bilberry shrub, for example, is flowering before the bumblebee and flies are ready to pollinate it. Experts say these are powerful indicators of a biological rhythm thrown out of sync by rising temperatures.

The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram spoke to two dozen experts this summer about the ways increasing heat is affecting Maine’s environment, ranging from the short-term impacts of heat waves on bats and birds to the long-term effects of warming lakes, forests and oceans.

A FOREST IN FLUX

Maine’s evergreen cloak is beginning to show strain.

The state’s iconic spruce and fir populations are declining and heat-tolerant hickories and oaks are taking their place. Even the tree line is changing, inching up the warming mountainsides by about a foot a year, putting the squeeze on the plants and animals that had adapted to the harsh conditions at the top.

This is perhaps nowhere more visible than at Acadia National Park, where the red spruce’s prickly yellow-green needles scent the trails like orange rind when crushed by hikers’ boots. It is where the boreal and temperate forests meet. Many trees there are at the edge of their range.

With summer temperatures projected to warm by as much as 8 degrees, the amount of suitable red spruce habitat at Acadia is expected to drop by 50% by 2100, according to a 2022 U.S. Forest Service report that outlined how a warming climate would change the park.

“Acadia National Park is experiencing unprecedented change,” Laura Gibson, who runs a climate adaptation program at Friends of Acadia, said at a lecture this month about finding new ways to protect Acadia’s forests. “Thinking about the future can certainly be daunting at times.”

The red spruce provides winter cover for American marten and white-tailed deer and food for grouse, snowshoe hare and white-winged crossbill, whose twisted bill is designed to pry open spruce cones to get at its seeds.

As Acadia’s forest changes, the songbirds that make up its soundtrack could disappear. The Maine Audubon, a statewide wildlife and habitat conservation group, predicts that as many as 60 bird species will leave the park by 2150.

The husky call of the boreal chickadee will be replaced by the cardinal’s telltale pew-pew-pew or the red-bellied woodpecker’s shrill churr.

“Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, but we’re not listening,” said Sally Stockwell, the director of conservation at Maine Audubon. “We’re watching one species after another decline. … I never thought I’d see such dramatic changes right here in Maine.”

WILDLIFE FEEL THE HEAT

Moose can be quite vocal. During the fall mating season, males make deep grunts while females will use a long, nasally call to attract a mate. Calves often call out to their mothers. Both sexes will use snorts or roars when they are in danger, in distress or in a fight.

Then there is another, manmade sound — a kind of digital death rattle — that comes when Maine moose die. It is the notification tone Lee Kantar, the only state-appointed moose biologist in the country, hears come from his phone when a tracking collar has not moved for six hours.

It almost always means a moose is dead, he said, and it’s nearly always climate change, or more specifically the winter tick, that is to blame. The longer summers have given these native bloodsuckers an extra three weeks on average to find a host.

And once one latches on, it and tens of thousands of its friends will cling to that single host from fall through spring, slowly bleeding the moose to death. Kantar and others say it has turned the animal, which once numbered more than 100,000, from a symbol of Maine into one of climate change.

“As a scientist, I try to be objective, and maintain an emotional distance, but it can be difficult,” Kantar said in an interview this month after the debut of the film “Guardian of the Giants,” which highlights his work.

“With our changing climate, and what that means for winter ticks, I end up dealing with a lot of death,” he said.

The rising heat is also taking a direct toll on endangered bats, rare turtles and various species of birds that fall from their nests or are hit by cars when roused from dormancy too early.

At the Center for Wildlife in York, director Kristen Lamb sees the consequences. The nonprofit rehabilitation facility treats about 500 sick, injured or orphaned wild animals a year. During heat waves, chimney swifts are admitted with broken wings after the spit they use to hold their homes together dissolves in the heat, causing whole nests to drop to the ground.

The center often treats bats, already stressed from deadly white nose syndrome, that are injured after falling from exhaustion during a heat wave when the caves they use for roosting become dangerously hot, and the tiny creatures, unable to cool down, simply fall, Lamb said.

Extreme heat also confuses some animals, throwing their natural instincts out of sync. Normally dormant in summer, turtles are waking up in response to the warm ground. They begin to move across roads in search of food and water, only to be hit and injured or killed by cars.

“Every single wild animal that comes into our clinic tells a story,” Lamb said. “Many of the stories serve as a warning for humans. Because what we do to wildlife, well, we are also doing that to ourselves. Their problems will be our problems.”

WARMING WATERS

The average surface water temperature of Maine’s 100 biggest lakes has risen by 5.5 degrees between 1980 and 2020, according to monitoring data collected by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. That’s faster than Maine’s air and its oceans.

Those changes can result in a bumper crop of algae and invasive plants, according to researchers at Lakes Environmental Association and Lake Stewards of Maine. Algal blooms, once a rare occurrence, are becoming more frequent in shallower lakes and ponds as temperatures climb. These blooms can be toxic, posing a risk to human health and wildlife.

Consider Lake Auburn, a critical reservoir for the Lewiston-Auburn area. Historically, its deep, cold waters have been remarkably resilient. Now, longer, hotter summers have increased stratification — where oxygen levels in the deeper layers are dropping, impacting aquatic life and water quality, research from the Lake Auburn Watershed Protection Commission shows.

Rising lake temperatures also allow harmful bacteria and pathogens, such as E. coli, to survive longer, said Ben Peierls, research director for Lakes Environmental Association. This risk is compounded on hot days when more people visit lakes to cool off, which can increase the spread of these bacteria.

That exposure can sicken people, but it can also harm fish, Peierls said, causing infections, weakened immune systems and growth and reproduction problems.

At the same time, the Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest-warming bodies of water on the planet, and its transformation is sending ripples through the aquatic food chain, down to a tiny zooplankton called Calanus finmarchicus.

This minuscule crustacean is a temperature-sensitive species whose decline impacts a broad array of other marine wildlife and shows how interconnected they can be, said Kathy Mills, a senior scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.

As the zooplankton moved out of the Gulf of Maine, past the Bay of Fundy and into a new habitat in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, both the herring and the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale followed, according to a separate studies on the species.

But the habitat switch brought new dangers. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, 12 right whales out of 450 died in the Gulf of St. Lawrence from ship strikes or fishing gear entanglement in 2017, leading to regulatory changes that reshaped lobstering on both sides of the border.

A warmer Gulf of Maine is also less suitable for herring, the fish that puffin, a beloved symbol of Maine’s coast, likes to eat and feed its chicks, said Don Lyons, the director of conservation science at the Maine-based Audubon Seabird Institute.

During marine heat waves, they’ll often fall back on Atlantic butterfish, a less heat-sensitive species, but its round body can be too large and oddly shaped for puffin chicks to swallow, Lyons said.

“We’ve found butterfish piled up outside of burrows with dead chicks inside,” he said. “It’s not that there was no food at all, but it wasn’t the right food. A few degrees warmer, a different fish supply. It can make all the difference.”

REASON TO HOPE

Maine scientists believe that people can help the environment adapt to the changing climate.

Researchers at the Appalachian Mountain Club are investigating whether alpine plants that grow atop southern New England mountains — which may have evolved with a higher heat tolerance — could be transplanted to Katahdin, the Whites and even Acadia National Park.

Maine’s puffin colonies had a successful nesting season this summer thanks to a break from the year-on-year heat waves that have dominated the Gulf of Maine over the last decade. Scientists counted 672 active puffin burrows at the Seal Island National Wildlife Refuge, about 100 more than the previous census five years earlier.

Some chicks drowned at Eastern Egg Rock and Hog Island, the two sites monitored by Audubon Seabird Institute, when storms in May and August flooded the low-lying burrows, but those that survived the storms had plenty of bite-sized fatty fish to eat, Lyons said.

This summer, Ouellet, the salmon researcher, is focused on the indirect impact of a warming climate — drought, which leads to lower water levels and reduces the ability of rivers to absorb and dissipate heat, making them more susceptible to warming, and thus more harmful to salmon and other aquatic life.

“It’s not looking good for Atlantic salmon this year,” Ouellet said.

She and the research team conducting thermal mapping of the Narraguagus are still processing their data, trying to determine the farthest a salmon will swim between cold spots, but they have already started sharing some with conservation groups.

In certain areas, when the conditions are just right, they may be able to create new cold spots, she said. If the thermal maps identify a warm pond spilling into a tributary, that’s fixable, Ouellet said. If too many trees have been cut back, they can plant more. A drainage ditch dumping warm water into a stream can be rerouted.

“We can’t stop our rivers from warming, but we can slow down how fast it is happening,” Ouellet said. “We created this problem, so we have a responsibility to fix it when we can.”

Although it remains unclear whether air pollution is directly linked to breast cancer, research in this field is expanding.","On a tree-lined street in a quiet suburb known by some as “Arbor City”, Eileen Miranda often watched her grandson race around the yard, trusting – like most – that the air they were breathing was clean. But data from an air quality sensor she recently installed outside her home showed otherwise. Now she wonders if it was the air that contributed to her eldest son’s childhood struggle with asthma.

“It overwhelmed me,” Miranda said. “I thought the numbers would be low. This community is nice, but lo and behold”

At 66, the grandmother of eight, who lives in La Mirada, a suburb south-east of Los Angeles, began noticing in her everyday life the cars idling on congested streets and the dizzying pace of heavy-duty diesel trucks coming in and out of an industrial hub a mile from her home.

“These are the things that got me thinking this cannot be good for the air,” she said.

Eileen is one of a growing number of Latinos across the US who, motivated by rising pollution concerns, have installed air quality sensors outside their homes, businesses and churches to better understand the air they’re breathing and advocate for change in their communities.

The grassroots monitoring comes as Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moves to scrap almost all pollution regulations by rescinding a key 16-year-old legal finding, alongside a barrage of other rollbacks of life-saving rules.

Although more than half of the US population resides in areas with unhealthy air quality, communities of color are disproportionately affected, comprising 50% of those breathing in toxic air pollutants, despite representing just 41% of the US population, according to a recent analysis by the American Lung Association. Latinos are nearly three times more likely than white individuals to live in communities with poor air quality.

Although agencies such as the EPA collect air quality data, researchers note that this information may not present the complete picture since some sensors are primarily located in wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods. Meanwhile, companies can bypass air quality rules by using data from monitors located farther from pollution sources, where the air is cleaner, or by not collecting data at all, as a recent Guardian analysis found.

Sensors in specific neighborhoods can help people better understand the air quality where they live, while also helping to fill data gaps. This local data can then be published for the public and shared with government agencies to inform where regulations and enforcement are needed.

In Miranda’s case, the air quality sensor is provided by the Hispanic Access Foundation, a national non-profit organization. Through a three-year grant funded by the Biden administration, the group aims to engage communities most affected by measuring air pollution in 12 areas with significant Latino populations.

The locations have some of the highest air pollution rates in the US, and all but one have asthma rates higher than the national average among adults.

Using PurpleAir monitors, everyday citizens and community leaders, known as “site managers”, gather data and track levels of harmful air pollutants, especially the type scientists call PM2.5 – particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers.

While not visible on its own, PM2.5 in large amounts – such as from car exhausts, coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources – can cause serious health problems for humans. Particulate matter has been linked to respiratory diseases such as asthma as well as neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and other health issues.

A 2021 study found people of color faced higher exposure to PM2.5 pollution regardless of region or location. The study’s authors note that because of a legacy of housing policy and other factors, racial-ethnic exposure disparities continue to persist even with a decrease in the overall exposure.

PM2.5 levels are also worsened by heatwaves and wildfires, both of which are becoming more intense and widespread due to human-made global heating.

“When it comes to climate, everything is really interconnected. The wildfire smoke we’re seeing in California, we’re seeing that in other parts of the world,” said Hilda Berganza, the Hispanic Access Foundation’s climate manager, overseeing the project called El Aire Que Respiramos (The Air We Breathe).

In southern Idaho, Cecy Ruano, 50, and her family host one of the 12 air monitors in Caldwell, a small city surrounded by acres of farmland that is 38% Latino.

In 1989, many laborers migrated to Caldwell in search of employment in the agricultural industry. Likewise, Ruano migrated as a young child with her parents, harvesting and packing beets and onions in the fields, and she eventually stayed to raise a family of her own. Driven by her faith and family, she actively works to educate others and nurture a caring relationship with the environment.

“My mother suffers from asthma, and my great-grandmother also had breathing problems, so for me it’s very important, and not just for my mom but for the people in my church,” Ruano said. “I’ve got to take care of them; I need to make sure they’re OK.”

Located in a valley with Oregon to the west and Boise to the east, Caldwell faces wildfire winds from both directions from May to October. Worsening drought conditions across Idaho, along with extreme heat, are increasing wildfire risks in the area and lengthening the wildfire season.

Ruano’s mother, Maria A Espinoza, 66, her voice soft and raspy, gets winded easily and tries to stay indoors during those months.

Just eight miles south of Caldwell, at the Deer Flat national wildlife refuge, Cecy’s daughter Aimee Benitez and her husband, Bryan Benitez, both 29, informed residents in English and Spanish about the latest air quality data from their Caldwell sensor and how they can reduce exposure when the air quality is poor.

The project aims to compare three years of data with EPA data, enabling the sharing of this information with local officials and giving them a fuller picture of potential exposures.

“It’s just the start of what we can do,” said Benitez.

Down the road from Eileen in Commerce, California, a line of freight trucks idles as they prepare to enter the freeway next to Iglesia Bautista La Resurrección, where Pastor William Carcamo, 69, had an air quality sensor installed through the Hispanic Access Foundation as part of his commitment to serving the community.

“We Hispanic people worry about paying the rent, paying off the car and having money to sustain ourselves. But I tell my congregants, what’s the point of having a nice car if our air is polluted?” Carcamo said in Spanish.

The city of Commerce faces significant air quality challenges due to its location between the 710 freeway and a major rail yard that transports international goods to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

California is widely known for some of the worst air pollution in the country, yet significant challenges persist when it comes to implementing and enforcing regulations.

In January, California rolled back a law aimed at curbing air pollution by requiring trucks to run cleaner by 2035. The law would have phased out diesel trucks at the ports of LA and Long Beach to a hydrogen and electric future. The rule was withdrawn from EPA approval just ahead of the return to office of Trump, who had previously threatened to revoke California’s clean air standards.

Since taking office, Trump has issued multiple executive orders rescinding previous efforts by previous administrations to tackle environmental injustice. So far, the EPA has cut more than 600 grants aimed at addressing the climate crisis and environmental justice because of what it considers unnecessary spending. These rollbacks come in response to the rapid growth of community data-collection projects over the last several years.

Democrats are accusing the EPA of illegally canceling billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds.

When asked whether current EPA monitoring networks adequately reflect air quality realities in communities of color, the agency clarified that although it provides technical and financial support, most monitoring stations are operated by state, local and tribal air agencies. It stated that the largest networks, which measure PM2.5 and ozone, are typically located in urban and rural areas chosen to represent broader regions or neighborhood-scale zones. The EPA did not address whether support would be renewed for expiring grants related to air quality monitoring.

“The Trump EPA is committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water, and land for ALL Americans regardless of race, gender, creed, and background,” the agency said.

The Hispanic Access Foundation was among 127 projects in 37 states that received grants from the EPA under the Biden administration in 2022 to monitor air quality in communities with environmental and health disparities stemming from pollution and the Covid-19 pandemic. Its grant remains in place through September 2026.

Industrial facilities foul nearby neighborhoods

In the historically Latino and working-class neighborhoods of Barrio Logan and Logan Heights in San Diego, California, industrial development near homes has led to increased health risks for residents and fueled decades of activism for cleaner air.

The neighborhoods face disproportionately high levels of air pollution that come from nearby industrial facilities, a naval base, a freeway and marine terminal operations, which have also limited access to the waterfront. The contrast is stark when compared with the wealthy community across the Coronado Bridge, where residential areas are kept separate from industry.

“You don’t need to live here to help us advocate, just caring is enough. It’s not right to have these negative statistics.” said Maritza Garcia, 33, a second-generation resident whose mom has breathing issues and led her to get involved with Environmental Health Coalition, a non-profit that has been working to reduce pollution and improve health since the 1980s.

While they’ve seen some success, such as advocating for a policy with the port of San Diego that would require a transition from diesel trucks to electric trucks by 2030, they still face uncertainty about what these policies will truly deliver and how effectively they will be enforced.

Recently, the Environmental Health Coalition faced a funding setback to its clean air project when one of its grants was cut by the EPA in May. While the remaining funds will allow it to continue its work for now, the organization is now seeking alternative sources of support to sustain its efforts.

“This is not a position against industry,” said José Franco García, executive director of the Environmental Health Coalition, “It really gets frustrating to hear the way environmental justice is being attacked as if it were a luxury or something that people are trying to take advantage of for funding, when in reality, it’s people who have been taken advantage of for years and have been suffering.”

At a South Bronx Unite (SBU) community meeting in May, about 20 residents packed into a small room in the Bronx, while others joined online to discuss data from 65 air monitors tracking particle pollution across the borough.

Much of that pollution comes from heavy truck traffic, industrial sites such as waste transfer stations, and local power plants. The Bronx is 55% Latino and 29% Black and has some of the highest rates of asthma in the country.

One of those 65 sensors is mounted on the concrete facade of the building where Grace Gonzalez, 56, lives. A lifelong Bronx resident, she lives less than half a mile from the Bruckner Expressway, a major truck route, and just a mile from the industrial waterfront.

Grace has lived in the building for 56 years and has asthma that has worsened with age, now limiting her ability to go on walks and jog like she used to.

“I try to live a normal life as much as I can,” she said. Every day, she climbs the five flights of stairs, taking breaks in between, to get to her apartment. For the past three years, she’s been having to use a nebulizer when her asthma flares up. “I call her nebu,” Grace chuckled.

She remains in good spirits and has become known in her building as a sort of messenger, making an effort to share information about air quality and updates from the SBU meetings with her neighbors and family.

Her daughter Gracie, 35, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021, despite having no family history of the disease. Grace’s asthma, her daughter’s diagnosis and those of five other women in the building led the mother and daughter to question the air they were breathing – and what it might be doing to their health.

“I’m not going to be a statistic on a paper,” said Gracie, a patient care navigator at a care management agency. She trusted her instincts, advocated for herself and pushed for answers until she received a diagnosis. Gracie underwent chemotherapy and radiation, and now stays on top with regular follow-ups.

Although it remains unclear whether air pollution is directly linked to breast cancer, research in this field is expanding.

With two younger daughters, Gracie hopes more can be done to improve quality of life for Bronx residents. She loves her neighborhood and doesn’t want to leave. “We’re kind of the overlooked borough,” she said.

Even before Trump’s second term, nearly 73 million people lived in counties where neither ozone nor PM2.5 are monitored, according to a recent study by the American Lung Association, creating a gap in public health data likely to worsen as funding is cut.

“People need to know what’s in the air they’re breathing,” said Diana Van Vleet from the American Lung Association. “Stepping up and using these more localized air monitors and even filling in some of the gaps with satellite information is more useful and helpful than ever, especially as we’re seeing more areas impacted by wildfire smoke.”

Efforts to block community air monitoring projects have also gained traction. In May 2024, Louisiana passed a law that effectively bans community groups from using their own air pollution monitoring equipment and publishing the results, imposing fines for violations. In response, a coalition of environmental and community organizations filed a federal lawsuit in May challenging the law, arguing it violates their first amendment rights by restricting the publication of collected data.

Meanwhile, the Hispanic Access Foundation’s attempts to expand its air quality project were blocked when two subsequent grant proposals submitted to the EPA were rejected. The proposals aimed to grow the project to 20 additional sites, stretching from New Mexico to Florida.

Despite these challenges, experts believe it’s essential to continue the data collection to track trends over time.

“Latino communities are, on average, dealing with higher levels of air pollution, so nationwide this is definitely a trend,” said Dr Christopher Hennigan, from the University of Maryland, who’s been doing data analysis for the Hispanic Access Foundation project. “Is it fair for people to be exposed to higher levels of air pollution because of their ethnicity?”

Hennigan said that raising awareness and education remain the primary focus as the project’s future is uncertain.

Back in California, Eileen Miranda has been working to educate both her family and her community.

“Climate change is happening,” she said. “We made this problem; now we have to fix it. We have the tools to fix this.”

Miranda says she looks forward to presenting the data to local elected officials and remains undeterred by recent federal funding cuts.

“Now that I know, my eyes are open,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3128555c71f544a37dde1c37491d392d8d70a0e/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5bc826a17fee993d4f4f6f555e7184e",N,,2025-09-28 10:59:27.727063

Westchester County’s trusted clean energy nonprofit makes it easy for residents to take action, with vetted programs, local contractors, and free energy advising

September 16, 2025 – With federal clean energy tax credits set to expire, many homeowners are asking: “Is it still worth upgrading my furnace, boiler, or AC system in Westchester?” The answer is yes.

Through its relaunched EnergySmart Homes campaign, Sustainable Westchester is making it simple for residents to make the switch to clean, efficient home energy systems that make homes more modern, cost-efficient, comfortable, and ready for the future.

“Now is the time for Westchester homeowners to take action,” said Noam Bramson, Executive Director of Sustainable Westchester. “EnergySmart Homes makes the process simple, connects residents with trusted contractors, and ensures they benefit from the best available rebates. Our role is to help homeowners navigate options and move forward with confidence, so they don’t miss out.”

This relaunch comes at a pivotal moment: as federal incentives wind down, energy costs rise, and many households are confronting the high costs of keeping outdated furnaces, boilers, and AC units running. With winter approaching, it’s an ideal time for homeowners to schedule free energy assessments and “button up” their homes with insulation and air sealings to improve comfort and lower bills. As a trusted local nonprofit and municipal partner, Sustainable Westchester provides clear, unbiased guidance to help homeowners make smart energy choices without the guesswork.

What is EnergySmart Homes?

EnergySmart Homes is Sustainable Westchester’s free program that guides homeowners step-by-step through upgrading outdated systems—such as old furnaces, boilers, and air conditioners—with modern clean-energy systems such as:

Air source heat pumps

Geothermal heat pumps

Energy efficient insulation and air sealing

Heat pump water heaters

“This campaign is about setting a new standard of efficiency and comfort in Westchester homes,” said Lauren Brois, Director, EnergySmart Homes, Sustainable Westchester. “A modern home feels comfortable year-round, runs efficiently, and uses clean technology instead of outdated fossil-fuel systems. Whether it’s better insulation, air sealing, or upgrading to a heat pump, EnergySmart Homes guides homeowners toward solutions that fit their homes, budgets, and long-term goals.”

Are Clean Energy Rebates Still Available?

With federal tax credits sunsetting, homeowners can still tap into statewide programs like NYSERDA’s Comfort Home and EmPower+, which provide rebates for insulation and weatherization. Utilities such as Con Edison and NYSEG also offer incentives for heat pumps via the Clean Heat Program and offer equipment upgrades and smart thermostats. And with electricity rates rising and technology costs falling, clean energy upgrades often make economic sense even without incentives.

“Westchester residents are hearing mixed messages when it comes to federal incentives,” said Lauren Brois, Director, EnergySmart Homes at Sustainable Westchester. “The truth is: support is still available, the process is simple, and homeowners don’t have to figure it out alone. We guide families step by step, from understanding rebates and improvements to choosing the right contractor.”

Key Benefits of Energy-Smart Upgrades:

Lower bills: More efficient systems often result in lower utility bills. For example, adding insulation and sealing air leaks can save homeowners an average of 15% on heating and cooling costs. (1)

Greater comfort: Consistent year-round temperatures, gain air conditioning in the summer, and less drafty homes in winter.

Health & safety: Cleaner and safer living conditions at home and fewer greenhouse gas emissions in the environment.

Community resilience: Recent analysis in Westchester County found that pairing insulation with heat pumps can reduce peak summer demand by up to 8% and cut outage times by more than 60%, strengthening neighborhoods during extreme weather events. (2)

How Does the EnergySmart Homes Process Work?:

Sign Up – Residents connect with Sustainable Westchester’s Energy Smart Homes team to get started.

Assess – A vetted local installer completes a home energy / site assessment and provides a detailed report.

Review – Homeowners choose improvements and financing options that fit their needs.

Upgrade – Contractors install the technologies, delivering greater comfort and reduced emissions.

A Westchester Family’s Story

Mike Beilstein and Amy Kwan wanted their 105-year-old Pelham home to be the perfect place to raise their two children — but without air conditioning, poor insulation, and an oil-fired heating system, comfort was hard to come by.

After connecting with Sustainable Westchester’s EnergySmart Homes team, the family installed a geothermal heating and cooling system, a heat pump hot water heater, new insulation, and replacement windows.

“Our home finally feels comfortable in every season,” said Kwan. “The upgrades made a huge difference for our family — and having Sustainable Westchester’s guidance took the stress and guesswork out of the process.”

The discussion took place on Reddit's r/heatpumps subreddit, where a Canadian homeowner shared their experience with three local HVAC contractors. The homeowner wanted to replace their furnace with a heat pump, but each contractor suggested one that would be far too small to heat their 2,400-square-foot home.

""Is it because gas is so cheap that they just assume everyone will switch to gas [at sub-freezing temperatures]?"" the homeowner wondered.

Commenters quickly chimed in, saying the contractors likely did expect the homeowner to continue using gas-powered heat during the cold Canadian winters, but that burning dirty fuels wouldn't be necessary.

""What you are seeing is the dinosaurs of the industry showing their age,"" one commenter wrote. ""You can meet all your heating needs with a heat pump.""

By capturing heat from the ambient air, heat pumps don't need to burn dirty energy sources to keep a house warm. This makes them not only better for the environment but also more energy-efficient.

That efficiency results in lower monthly energy bills, and thanks to available tax credits and rebates, the upfront cost may also be lower than you'd expect. With EnergySage's Heat Pump Marketplace, you can see exactly what that cost is.

This free tool from EnergySage allows homeowners to get estimates from several local, verified HVAC installers, letting you quickly compare quotes to find the right heat pump — and right installation company — for your home and budget.

""Your home will be comfortable year-round with only a heat pump,"" one Reddit commenter wrote. ""No question whatsoever.""

To really amp up the savings on an electric heat pump, savvy homeowners could pair it with rooftop solar panels. Even in cold or cloudy climates, solar panels can generate enough power to bring monthly electricity bills down to nearly nothing.

Even better, EnergySage can help out with solar shopping, too. Thanks to their free tools, homeowners can compare solar-installation quotes — and according to EnergySage, the average homeowner can save up to $10,000.

Several eco-friendly credits and rebates, including the federal solar tax credit, will expire at the end of this year. Fortunately, several Inflation Reduction Act credits will remain for appliance upgrades, such as a heat pump, allowing homeowners to save thousands of dollars.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/heat-pumpimage-recY8M2nYqIl7c9l3.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:36.454917

For those who were eyeing the most affordable version of the Tesla Cybertruck, the most recent news must feel like a rug being pulled out from under them. The company decided to pull the plug on its most affordable base model, the rear-wheel-drive Cybertruck.

What's happening?

According to a report from Quartz, Tesla decided to discontinue the RWD version of the Cybertruck only five months after the vehicle's launch. This model was billed as the most affordable, with a relatively low price tag of about $61,000, and was released this year. But now, the cheapest option available will be the all-wheel drive model, which starts at about $80,000, a $19,000 difference that represents a significant financial hurdle for many prospective buyers who have already placed reservations.

Why is this concerning?

This isn't just about one truck model. It's about accessibility. When the most affordable version of a high-profile electric vehicle disappears, it shrinks the pool of potential buyers and can slow down the transition to cleaner cars. Fewer EVs on the road have a real impact on community health by keeping more polluting gas-powered cars in circulation.

The decision also adds to a list of recent challenges for the company. While Tesla has seen sales growth in key markets such as China, its sales have recently plummeted across several major European countries. Adding to the concern is the shocking trend of preowned Cybertrucks losing their value much faster than expected, making it a tougher investment for buyers.

What can I do to help?

If you're thinking about buying your first electric vehicle, remembering the reason is important. Electric vehicles are far better for the environment, your family's health, and can save you a ton of money on repairs and gas. They are a win-win for everyone.

While you can't force an automaker to sell a specific model, you can still make informed choices. The good news is the EV market is bigger than just one truck, and there's plenty of information out there for those considering making their next car electric. Exploring all the options is the best way to find a vehicle that fits your budget and lifestyle.

Buying new isn't the only path, either. As the EV market matures, more affordable preowned options are becoming available. Some automakers are even expanding leasing programs for their used vehicles, creating another avenue for drivers to get into an electric car without the high upfront cost.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x0l.GuQxHbRKqsubC6HGFw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5e6aeb983c58513ecb78ea855583f383,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:44.212482

The federal EV (electric vehicle) tax credit is ending on September 30. The program, which allows EV buyers to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a new vehicle and up to $4,000 on a used vehicle, was originally slated to last until 2032, but President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" is bringing it to a close years earlier.

The website told the outlet that demand for new EVs on its site are up by 33 percent when compared to a year ago, and up 22 percent for used EVs over the same time period.

In August, Cars.com conducted a survey asking its customers what was motivating them to buy EVs, and nearly 75 percent of the 950 respondents said that the federal tax credit was a ""major or contributing factor"" to their decision.

Jeremy Lardeau of Cascale outlines why outdoor brands must collaborate and align with this shift to stay competitive and climate-resilient.

China’s rise as a low-carbon production leader

China is rapidly evolving into a hub for low-carbon, circular, and technology-driven production. China built nearly twice as much utility-scale wind and solar capacity as the rest of the world combined in 2024 and 2025, and with national initiatives pushing for textile recycling by 2025, the country is making measurable strides toward sustainability in its textile and apparel sector. Just this week, China announced its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 7 and 10 percent by 2035, solidifying its commitment to renewables.

As Cascale’s recent analysis shows, many Chinese textile manufacturers are no longer just meeting compliance standards; they’re turning sustainability into a competitive advantage. Factories that adopt renewable energy and improve efficiency to offer “low-carbon apparel” are changing the conversation for brands.

However, ongoing US-China trade tensions are prompting some American importers to rethink sourcing strategies. While not all apparel categories are equally affected, unpredictability adds complexity to long-term planning.

Action points for outdoor brands

So, what does this mean for the outdoor industry?

First, outdoor brands should initiate discussions with their Chinese suppliers about their climate goals, greenhouse gas emissions and energy sources. Tools, like Cascale’s Higg Facility Environment Module (Higg FEM), enable this dialogue between brands and suppliers, by reporting and validating sustainability performance. The Higg FEM is a key tool for the industry value chain, striking a balance between reporting and benchmarking.

Second, collaboration in a pre-competitive environment is key to progress. Although it is promising to see many outdoor brands individually moving towards decarbonization, brands often source from the same facilities. This means some initiatives may force manufacturers and suppliers to work to different standards and specifications. Instead, outdoor brands should collaborate to develop aligned plans in partnership with each other and their supply chains, helping to build trust and transparency in the process.

From sourcing to strategy

Finally, outdoor brands must take a considered approach to their sourcing practices. To reach the industry’s sustainability ambitions, companies need to evolve the buyer-supplier engagement to foster long-term collaboration, climate investment, and shared accountability. There can be no meaningful progress towards deep, complex, and capital-intensive decarbonization efforts without a true commercial partnership between buyers and suppliers. Tools like the Better Buying Purchasing Practices Index can help brands understand the impact of their current purchasing practices and provide a blueprint for improvement.

Our recent Cascale Annual Meeting, which brought together over 700 stakeholders, underscored a critical truth: collective action is no longer optional. It’s the only way forward. For the outdoor industry, the path is clear. Sustainability isn’t just an added value; it’s an ingrained strategy. China’s evolving manufacturing landscape is a call to action we can’t afford to ignore.",https://sustonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cascale-Hero-WEB.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:18.673104

Carolina Utilities Merger: Regulators are reviewing the planned January 1, 2027 tie-up between Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, designed to deliver $1 billion in customer savings by 2038.","Overview

Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) is one of the biggest regulated utility companies in the US. Its bread and butter is Electric Utilities & Infrastructure—serving 8.6 million electric customers across the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky, with a hefty 55,100 megawatts of generation capacity. Its Gas Utilities & Infrastructure arm delivers natural gas to 1.7 million customers in five states. A smaller Renewables & Other unit dabbles in wind, solar, and storage, but regulated operations still make up over 90% of the company’s revenues. In short: most of Duke’s money comes from stable, rate-based businesses where profits are closely tied to the capital it invests and the tariffs regulators approve. Duke’s in a business with big walls—think regulated monopolies and high costs to compete—giving it a defensive moat and cash flows that are about as reliable as you’ll find. Its closest rivals by size? NextEra Energy, Southern Company, Constellation Energy, and American Electric Power. Like its peers, Duke’s growth depends as much on regulators agreeing to raise rates as it does on its own investment plans.

Recent Performance

Duke’s stock returned about 4.9% in the past year, lagging well behind the S&P 500’s 15.1% gain. Rising interest rates and a stubbornly hawkish Federal Reserve dented utility valuations, while tech stocks and cyclical sectors pulled the overall market higher. On top of that, storm costs and Duke’s relentless investment in new infrastructure have taken their toll on near-term earnings clarity.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Duke’s rolling out a hefty five-year, $87 billion capital plan to cover grid improvements, cleaner energy, and growing demand from things like data centers. Management is calling for earnings per share to grow at a 5–7% annual clip through 2029, mostly thanks to steady rate case approvals and the returns on all that new investment. Still, near-term sales growth is running at 5.08%—behind the overall market’s 8.72%—and remains heavily dependent on how quickly regulators sign off and whether demand from industrial customers keeps rising.

Quality & Moat

Duke’s operating margins are solid at 29.00%—firmer than its five-year average of 23.36% and higher than the market’s 18.71%. That’s the benefit of having pricing power and scale on its side. Return on invested capital has risen to 5.46% from 4.47% over five years, though that’s still less than half the market average of 11.14%—a reminder that this is a capital-heavy industry. Duke’s free cash flow yield is finally positive at 0.58% (up from a negative five-year average of –0.21%), but the market beats it at 1.91%. The bottom line: Duke’s seasoned management and its regulated franchise keep profits consistent, but the moat is more practical than spectacular.

Valuation

Duke trades at 21.5 times forward earnings—cheaper than the market’s 25.9 times—so investors are getting a bit of a discount for that stability and dividend focus. But its EV/Sales of 6.11 stands above both its own five-year average (5.60) and the broader market (4.69). In other words: the market’s paying up for reliability, even if top-line growth is slow. That disconnect—lower earnings multiple but richer sales valuation—highlights the tug-of-war between Duke’s defensive cash flows and its limited growth.

Market Sentiment

With a beta of just 0.18, Duke’s stock barely budges when the wider market swings. The 50-day trend is up by 0.20, and volatility at 11.7% is half that of the S&P 500’s 23.1%. These numbers add up to a classic defensive play. Most analysts see Duke as a hold, institutional investors own a chunky share, and there’s little short interest—so sentiment’s generally steady as she goes. Recent moves—like selling a 19.7% stake in Duke Energy Florida to Brookfield—have been well-received because they tidy up the balance sheet.

Key Risks

Regulatory Approval: Duke’s growth relies on promptly securing new rate approvals and a friendly regulatory climate. Red tape or unfavorable decisions could crimp returns and slow down earnings.

Leverage and Interest Rates: Net debt to EBITDA stands at 5.41 times, far above the market’s 1.37 times. That makes Duke vulnerable if borrowing costs climb or if the credit rating comes under pressure.

Weather and Climate: Severe weather events and hurricanes hit utilities hard, racking up restoration costs and making it longer for Duke to get repaid, squeezing short-term cash flow.

Capital Intensity: That $87 billion in planned capital spending? It might mean more share sales, diluting existing investors, and could strain how much spare cash Duke generates.

Bull Case

Regulated Rate Base Growth: The $87 billion capex plan is set to grow Duke’s rate base and earnings for years—assuming regulators play along.

Defensive Cash Flows: Duke’s monopolistic businesses throw off reliable cash flows and strong margins, backing up those regular dividends.

Valuation Buffer: Trading at a forward P/E below the market gives some cushion, and there’s room for the stock to move up if investor sentiment shifts.

Low Volatility: With a beta of 0.18 and much lower volatility than the average stock, DUK suits risk-averse investors who still want some equity exposure.

Bear Case

High Leverage: Net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times means more financial risk—especially in a world where rates could climb higher still.

Slow Organic Growth: Sales growth lags the market, and if regulators become more stingy on allowed profits, the returns on all that spending could disappoint.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Future investment could hit a wall if rate cases drag out, are denied, or if regulators clamp down on how much Duke can earn.

Weather-Related Costs: Restoration costs from storm damage are unpredictable and can put a dent in both cash flows and returns.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings: Results due in early November 2025. Expect updates on how Duke is managing its spending plan, regulatory battles, and storm-recovery costs.

Carolina Utilities Merger: Regulators are reviewing the planned January 1, 2027 tie-up between Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, designed to deliver $1 billion in customer savings by 2038.

Brookfield Stake Closing: Brookfield expects to make an initial $2.8 billion payment for a piece of Duke’s Florida operations in early 2026, which should shore up Duke’s balance sheet.

Investment Conclusion

Duke Energy is a classic defensive utility: stable cash flows, a healthy dividend, and trading at a bit of a discount compared to the broader market. But it comes with baggage: high leverage, constant need for new investment, and the risk that regulators might not always see eye to eye. For long-term, income-focused investors, Duke could offer a reliable way to get equity exposure with less drama.

After about 25 to 30 years, solar panels wear out. Over the years, heating and cooling cycles stress the materials. Small cracks develop, precipitation corrodes the frame and layers of materials can start to peel apart.

In 2023, about 90% of old or faulty solar panels in the U.S. ended up in landfills. Millions of panels have been installed worldwide over the past few decades – and by about 2030, so many will be ready to retire that they could cover about 3,000 football fields.

As an electrical engineer who has studied many aspects of renewable energy, recycling solar panels seems like a smart idea, but it’s complicated. Built to withstand years of wind and weather, solar panels are designed for strength and are not easy to break down.

The cost conundrum

Sending a solar panel to a landfill costs between $1 and $5 in the U.S. But recycling it can cost three to four times as much, around $18. And the valuable materials inside solar panels, such as silver and copper, are in small amounts, so they’re worth about $10 to $12 – which makes recycling a money-losing prospect. Improvements in the recycling process may change the economics.

But for now, it’s even hard to reclaim the glass in solar panels. Many layers are glued together and need to be separated before they can be melted down for reuse. And if the separation is not precise enough, the glass that is recovered won’t be of high enough quality to use in making other solar panels or windows. It will be suitable only for lower-quality uses such as fill material in construction projects.

Other panels, usually older ones, may contain small amounts of toxic metals such as lead or cadmium. It can be difficult to tell whether toxic materials are present, though. Even experts have trouble, in part because current tests, such as the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure, can give inaccurate results. Therefore, many companies that own large numbers of solar panels just assume their panels are hazardous waste, which increases costs for both disposal and recycling. Clearer labels would help people know what a solar panel contains and how to handle it.

If someone wants to recycle a solar panel, and is willing to bear the cost, there aren’t many places in the U.S. that are willing to do it and are equipped to be safe about it.

Designing for a new life

Despite the Trump administration’s cuts to subsidies for solar projects, millions of solar panels are already in use in the U.S., and millions more are expected to be installed worldwide in the coming years. As a result, the solar industry is working on ways to minimize waste and repeatedly reuse materials.

Some ideas include sending used solar panels that still work at least a bit to developing nations, or even reusing them within the U.S. But there are not clear rules or processes for connecting reused panels to the power grid, so reuse tends to happen in less common, off-grid situations rather than becoming widespread.

Future solar panels could also be designed for easier recycling, using different construction methods and materials, and improved processing systems.

Making panels last longer – perhaps as long as 50 years – using more durable materials, weather-resistant components, real-time monitoring of panel performance and predictive maintenance to replace parts before they wear out would reduce waste significantly.

Building solar panels that are more easily disassembled into separate components made of different materials could also speed recycling. Components that fit together like Lego bricks – instead of using glue – or dissolvable sealants and adhesives could be parts of these designs.

Improved recycling methods could also help. Right now, panels are often simply ground up, mixing all of their components’ materials together and requiring a complicated process to separate them out again for reuse. More advanced approaches can extract individual materials with high purity. For example, a process called salt etching can recover over 99% of silver and 98% of silicon, at purity levels that are appropriate for high-end reuse, potentially even in new solar panels, without using toxic acids. That method can also recover significant quantities of copper and lead for use in new products.

A shared journey

Increasing the practice of recycling solar panels has more than just environmental benefits.

Over the long term, recovering and reusing valuable materials may prove more cost-effective than continually buying new raw materials on the open market. That could lower costs for future solar panel installations. If they are fully reused, the value of these recoverable materials could reach over $15 billion globally by 2050.

In addition, recycling panels and components reduces American reliance on materials imported from overseas, making solar power projects less vulnerable to global disruptions.

Recycling also keeps toxic materials out of landfills. That can help ensure a shift to clean energy doesn’t create new or bigger environmental problems. Also, recycling solar panels emits far less carbon dioxide than manufacturing panels from raw materials.

There are already some efforts underway to boost solar panel recycling. The Solar Energy Industries Association trade group is working to collect and share information about companies that recycle solar panels.

Governments can provide tax breaks or other financial incentives for using recycled materials, or ban disposing of solar panels in landfills. California, Washington, New Jersey and North Carolina have enacted laws or are studying ways to manage solar panel waste, with some even requiring recycling or reuse.

These efforts are important steps toward addressing the growing need for solar panel recycling and promoting a more sustainable solar industry.

With mounting energy demands from coastal urban areas and new data centers, offshore wind advocates still insist there can still be a future for U.S. offshore wind.
Meanwhile wind power opponents keep pressuring the Trump administration to do even more to foreclose on surviving projects.","The U.S. Justice department intervened Sept. 27 in a lawsuit brought by New Jersey opponents of offshore wind power, with a motion asking the federal court to remand previous approvals for the already-stalled Atlantic Shores project.

“This filing means federal agencies are going back to the drawing board,” said Bob Stern, president of the local activist group Save LBI, in an email to supporters Saturday. The group, a coalition of seaside homeowners, businesses and commercial fishermen, had filed their lawsuit July 11 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and has won allies in the Trump administration’s drive to shut down offshore wind development.

Earlier this year Save LBI successfully petitioned the administration and federal Environmental Protection Agency to suspend the Clean Air Act permit issued for Atlantic Shores construction. The latest move in the group’s larger federal lawsuit would completely reverse the construction and operations plan and record of decision issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management a year ago, among a flurry of wind power plans approved in the last year of the Biden administration.

“This is a significant admission by the federal agencies that the Atlantic Shores approvals cannot withstand legal scrutiny in their current form,” said Thomas Stavola Jr., a lawyer for Save LBI. Over years of local organizing and fundraising the activists mounted what they call “a comprehensive, multi-statute challenge to the Atlantic Shores project, citing data deficiencies, injurious impacts to marine mammals, tourism, economy, and electric rates and failures to assess cumulative impacts across the broader offshore wind buildout.”

Atlantic Shores, a joint venture of EDF Renewables and Shell, had been planned as 197 turbines as close as 8.7 miles off Long Beach Island, in an array rated for potential power up to 2,800 megawatts. The proposal faced fierce resistance from residents of beachfront communities who feared effects on tourism and property values, commercial fishermen and some environmental activists resisting what they see as a future industrialization of waters in the New York Bight.

Like another ill-fated New Jersey project,Ørsted’s Ocean Wind,Atlantic Shore’s financial prospects deteriorated with global inflation following the covid-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and supply chain problems. Atlantic Shores’ backers had hope to submit an updated bid for future power production to New Jersey energy planners, but in June asked the state Board of Public Utilities to cancel its original bid.

Partner Shell withdrew from the venture and wrote down a $1 billion loss on U.S. offshore wind investment after the Trump administration moved aggressively against the industry. Those attacks continue, with mixed results. A federal court allowed Ørsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project off southern New England, already almost 80 percent complete when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a temporary stop-work order.

An earlier administration order to shutter the 810-MW Empire Wind project off New York was reversed in mid-May after negotiations between the Trump administration and state officials. With mounting energy demands from coastal urban areas and new data centers, offshore wind advocates still insist there can still be a future for U.S. offshore wind.

Meanwhile wind power opponents keep pressuring the Trump administration to do even more to foreclose on surviving projects.

In a Sept. 25 letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-NJ, argued that wind projects pose “long-term effects and impacts…on national security and the radar used for marine vessels and military and commercial aircraft.”

Van Drew singled out Equinor’s Empire Wind project, reportedly reprieved after Tump administration and New York State officials agreed to reconsider proposed natural gas pipeline links to supply Northeast states.

Interior Secretary “Doug Burgum and his team at the Department of Interior have already identified significant insufficiencies in several projects approved under the prior administrations,” Van Drew wrote.

He asserted “the prior administration also downplayed the threats to our national security posed by the large scale offshore wind industrialization including radar used for missile defense, air traffic, marine traffic, as well as sonar impacts from electromagnetic interference, the impact on training grounds off the northeast coast, and potential hazards posed by these structures during a time of conflict.""",https://s3.divcom.com/www.workboat.com/images/Atlantic shores crop.png.medium.800x800.png,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:31.461580

These investors aren’t just backing flashy data centers anymore. They’re going after local utilities that deliver power to everyday people and the massive servers running AI models like ChatGPT.

According to reporting from the Associated Press, billions of dollars from firms like Blackstone and BlackRock are now flowing into electric companies in New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.

These utilities supply power to more than 150 million people across millions of miles of power lines, and the profit potential is turning heads fast.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private equity and hedge funds.

Greg said investors are now stacking up power plants, data centers, and energy services, all thanks to the surge in demand since the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT.

Blackstone targets utilities while Minnesota fight escalates

Blackstone is pushing regulators to approve its purchase of both Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power, based in Albuquerque and Lewisville. Wisconsin has already cleared the sale of Superior Water, Light and Power, and last year, Northern Indiana Public Service Company sold a 19.9% stake to Blackstone.

But in Minnesota, things are far messier. A major fight is unfolding over whether BlackRock, through one of its subsidiaries, can team up with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to take over Allete, the parent company of Minnesota Power. That utility provides electricity to 150,000 customers and runs a mix of coal, gas, wind, and solar power.

This isn’t just another transaction. Google might be building a data center in the area, and whoever controls Minnesota Power stands to make serious money from feeding power to it. The proposed $6.2 billion deal offers $67 per share, a 19% premium to Allete’s stockholders.

Allete claims this deal helps them hit Minnesota’s 2040 law requiring utilities to use 100% carbon-free power. They estimate needing $4.3 billion for grid and clean energy projects in the next five years. They also argue that BlackRock isn’t under short-term stock market pressure and can take a more “patient” approach.

Opposition slams deal as profit play on ratepayers

Not everyone’s on board. Critics say the whole thing is just a profit scheme. Karlee Weinmann, a policy advocate at the Energy and Policy Institute, said, “Private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice.”

Mark Ellis, a former utility exec turned consumer advocate, testified against the deal. Mark said he’s personally talked to private equity firms looking to jump into utility ownership. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” he said. He added these companies don’t come up for sale often, but when they do, they’re golden.

Utilities generate about 10% returns, not by selling power, but by spending money. The more they invest in substations, poles, and wires, the more they can charge customers under rules set by regulators. That’s where critics say the danger lies, the incentive is to overspend so investors can overcharge.

This fight over Minnesota Power mirrors battles in other parts of America, where people are pushing back against having data centers built near their homes. In this case, Gov. Tim Walz and building trades unions support the buyout.

But the Minnesota Attorney General’s office and large industrial power buyers (like U.S. Steel, Enbridge, and pulp and paper mills) are pushing against it. These industrial players use two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity.

In its filing, Allete insisted that BlackRock’s ownership wouldn’t change its operations or strategy, and promised the deal wouldn’t raise rates. But filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Allete already said it was “well positioned” to meet its funding needs without new owners.

Things got even worse for BlackRock in July, when Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie told regulators to block the deal. She said the record showed the buyers plan to do what private equity always does — “pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

Meanwhile, 16.4% of Electrek survey respondents admitted they had no idea there even was a 30% federal solar credit. That fact, while frustrating, serves to highlight the need for better public awareness around both clean energy incentives, and the potential benefits to adding solar power to your home.

Interesting, but does it matter?

That said, it’s important to consider the source here. Electrek readers tend to be more educated in general than the American public at large to begin with (check out our Partner Program page for some of that demographic data), and you’re certainly more educated and informed about things like EVs, home battery backups, and – of course – solar power.

The general public? The people who don’t read Electrek, don’t follow the cimate tech blogs, and generally have no idea what’s going on in the world of clean energy incentives? Getting rid of a tax credit they don’t even know exists may not move the market one way or the other. And, frankly, I don’t think it will.

What do you guys think? Is the march towards more universal home solar system deployment already too far along to stop, or do you think eliminating the tax incentive will turn off enough people to do the industry in for good? Head to the comments and let us know.

Waaree Energies affirmed its US investment plans, including the Texas facility expansion and exploring US solar cell manufacturing, are unaffected by a US tariff evasion investigation. The company is cooperating with customs officials, asserting no material duty exposure or operational disruption. Waaree views the US as a strategic, high-growth market for continued clean energy investment.

A US investigation into potential solar tariff evasion will not impact Waaree Energies' investment plans, including the expansion of its Texas facility and exploration of setting up a solar cell manufacturing capability in the high-growth, strategic US market, the company said Sunday.

Waaree is one of the largest vertically integrated companies in the manufacturing of solar modules, which convert sun rays into electricity. It has an operational capacity of 13.3 GW in India.

It commenced operations at its US solar module manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas, in January this year with an initial installed capacity of 1.6 GW. The Texas facility is being scaled to 3.2GW by FY27.

US customs officials last week launched an investigation into whether Waaree bypassed tariffs on Chinese-made solar cells and panels by falsely labelling them as manufactured in India.

""The investigation has no impact on our investment plans. The Texas plant expansion from 1.6 GW to 3.2 GW is already underway,"" the firm said.

Live Events

""Our recent acquisition of US-based Meyer Burger assets further strengthens its long-term manufacturing footprint in the country. The United States is a high-growth, strategic market for Waaree, and it continues to invest in local jobs, technology, and capacity.""

""Waaree Energies will continue to operate with integrity, and we reaffirm our strong commitment to the US market - both as a clean energy partner and as a growing localised manufacturer,"" the firm said in a written Q&A to PTI.

The firm said it is providing all required information to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in its ongoing inquiry.

""As a responsible corporate citizen, we have consistently complied with all applicable local laws and regulations,"" the company said.

""Our internal assessment indicates no material duty exposure, and we continue to engage transparently with CBP throughout this process.""

Importantly, there has been no operational disruption, and the US manufacturing operations and customer deliveries continue as planned.

""Based on our current assessment, we do not expect any material financial impact from this inquiry.""

The demand in the US solar market, it said, remains extremely strong and is growing rapidly, making it one of the most lucrative clean-energy markets globally.

""Our diversified global supply chain and our domestic US production provide natural insulation from geopolitical or policy shocks, ensuring business continuity.""

Asked about manufacturing solar cells as well in the US, Waaree said backward integration was a key strategic priority for the company.

""In India, we have already built significant solar cell manufacturing capability and are exploring similar opportunities in the United States,"" it said.

""We are evaluating options for US cell manufacturing in line with policy incentives and market demand, and any future investments will support our goal of becoming a holistic clean-energy transition company serving US customers end-to-end.""

Waaree Solar Americas primarily serves the US market through its Texas manufacturing facility, which currently operates at 1.6 GW with expansion underway to 3.2 GW, thereby reducing reliance on imports.

""Where imports are required, we maintain a diversified supply chain across multiple countries to avoid any single-source dependence, and all such imports strictly comply with US trade regulations, including AD/CVD rules and rules of origin. Our long-term strategy is to progressively localise more production within the United States to further reduce import needs, and detailed country-wise volumes are provided to regulators as required, though not disclosed publicly for competitive reasons.""

He said one of the programs that will expire on Dec. 31 incentivizes residents to invest in high-efficiency appliances.
Carsner said another program, which provides tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, will expire at the end of September.

Q: With your role with the Iowa City Sierra Club, I'm curious, what has the Iowa City community said about this?","In his role with the Sierra Club’s Iowa City Chapter, Tom Carsner has spent a lot of time in recent months thinking and talking about the ways the federal government incentivizes energy efficiency.

Tax incentives intended to encourage Americans to invest in energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy, like solar panels, were part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, under the Biden administration.

But the Big Beautiful Bill Act — which Carsner refers to as the “Big Bad Bill” — that was passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump this summer, rolls back those incentives. Many are scheduled to end Dec. 31.

As political director for the Sierra Club’s Iowa City Chapter — a position he’s held for eight years — Carsner has followed the legislation that will end these incentives. He said one of the programs that will expire on Dec. 31 incentivizes residents to invest in high-efficiency appliances.

The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate program, or “HEARS,” provides rebates to low- and moderate-income households when they purchase high-efficiency electric appliances like heat pumps, electric stoves and dryers, as well as for electrical upgrades to their homes, like installing solar panels.

Carsner said another program, which provides tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, will expire at the end of September.

The Gazette spoke with Carsner about these programs and how they might affect the state and its residents.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Q: How can Iowans take advantage of these programs before they go away at the end of the year?

A: It's just contacting your appliance dealer, whether it is for a heat pump or water heater, Iowans should contact their dealers directly. That hasn't changed; you have to contact a registered or qualified contractor to make an appointment and get set up with them.

Some things with solar panels are tightening up partially because you don't know what the weather is going to be. It may be slower in November and December to put them in since it is outdoors. But these other ones like an electric stove, a heat pump, water heater, and other things like that can be done year-round since it's not really weather dependent.

Q: What makes this program important, and what will the loss look like for Iowans when this program does cease at the end of the year?

A: Every wind turbine you see in the State of Iowa has been subsidized by taxpayers, to some degree, because those are all built with tax rebates. The problem is that it will make all of those attempts to build the utility-scale wind farms or solar farms that much more expensive for the companies putting them up. If it's more expensive for them, it's going to be more expensive for the utility as well. So, electric rates are bound to go up as well on that large utility scale basis.

There are all sorts of estimates that show many of the rebates are in the 30 percent range. It's not necessarily a one-to-one ratio but there's no doubt that having those large-scale rebate programs taken away, it will increase electric costs across the board for all people who use utilities, which is pretty much everybody.

Q: From your perspective, what makes programs like this such a partisan issue?

A: It's the fossil fuel industry. Many Republicans in today's world rely on fossil fuel campaign financing and when they vote to take away subsidies for non-fossil fuel or renewable energy type of programs, they are doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, so they get more campaign contributions. That's the real problem.

Now, they also turn a blind-eye to the fact that fossil fuel industries have, for a century, gotten tax credits, and tax favoritism through the Internal Revenue Service, but they conveniently ignore that. It's quite disingenuous for Republicans to vote for the “Big Bad Bill” that just passed, and then to still claim they support renewable energy. The two just don't go together.

Q: What will the direct impact of this look like for Iowa? Will it be more significant in Iowa, rather than other Midwest states or across the country?

A: Iowa is already producing over 60 percent from clean, renewable energy, which is mostly wind, with a little bit of solar. For the consumer, the real problem is that they will end up consuming more gas when it comes to heating and cooling their home, making electricity more expensive for the consumer.

But a secondary issue is every one of these solar panels, heat pumps or water heaters are distributed by a local appliance dealer. When the rebates go away, it's going to drive their sales down to some degree. It's hard to predict how much, but if you think of an appliance store in a medium-sized Iowa town, and it sounds good to be able to get a rebate on an efficient hot water heater, they'll buy it. But if rebates go away, they're going to be less inclined to purchase the new hot water heater that's more electrically efficient.

Q: With your role with the Iowa City Sierra Club, I'm curious, what has the Iowa City community said about this? What have you been hearing from the public?

A: I don't think you'd have to stretch very deep to find a solar panel company who would tell you there's a rush right now to finish projects before the end of the year. But I'm not sure how many people truly understand that this was part of the “Big, Bad Bill” of things going away at the end of the year. People might be surprised by this. When I talked to people about it, some were aware, and some were not.

Q: For those who are not as aware about this issue or this deadline that's coming up, what have you been recommending they do?

A: They should call their dealer as soon as they can because, especially solar panel installation, it is getting increasingly busy as the end of the year comes. Appliance dealers are probably the same. It's just a race to get a project started or get a contract signed at least by Dec. 31.

Q: Looking forward, are there opportunities for programs like these to come back for Iowans to use?

A: There's still uncertainty. There is a state version of some of these programs. The money is less, but there's still $120 million for a state-run program, where you can get it deducted immediately from your bill. I don't know how much it was or wasn't affected by the “Big, Bad Bill,” but it would soften the blow. It wasn't created to be a replacement by any means, but it would soften the blow somewhat.

The French state wants much more offshore wind by 2035 and 2050.","France awarded the Centre Manche 2 offshore wind tender to a team led by TotalEnergies with RWE. The wind farm will have 1.5 GW of capacity and sit more than 40 km off the Normandy coast. It’s now the country’s largest renewable energy project.

The power price is fixed by the tender at €66/MWh. Expected output is about 6 TWh each year, enough for over one million homes. The plan calls for a final investment decision by early 2029 and first power in 2033.

RWE Signals an Exit

RWE has said it wishes to exit the consortium after a strategic review. This step needs approval from French authorities. TotalEnergies plans to proceed as operator and may invite a new partner later.

Why This Project Matters

Scale: 1.5 GW, France’s largest offshore wind award so far.

Location: More than 40 km off Normandy, near Calvados.

Output: ~6 TWh/year, powering 1M+ homes.

Price: €66/MWh as set by the tender.

Timeline: FID by early 2029; generation from 2033.

Money, Jobs, and Local Plans

TotalEnergies says the project will require about €4.5 billion in investment. It’s the company’s largest investment in France in three decades. The firm plans to favor European suppliers, especially for turbines and cables.

Construction could employ up to 2,500 people over three years. Local factories and ports should see steady work. The operator also plans crowdfunding so residents and authorities can invest.

Community and nature funds are part of the plan. There’s a €10 million territorial fund for training, education, and culture. Another €45 million is for environmental measures, and €15 million for a biodiversity fund in Normandy.

At a Glance: Key Facts

Item Detail Capacity 1.5 GW Location > 40 km off Normandy Annual Output ~6 TWh Households Served 1M+ equivalent Tender Price €66/MWh Investment ~€4.5 billion Jobs Up to 2,500 during build FID / First Power Early 2029 / 2033 RWE Status Wishes to exit; approval needed

Company View and Strategy

TotalEnergies’ CEO called the award a major step in the firm’s shift to low-carbon power. The company says the project proves its long-term commitment to France. It also points to competitive prices for French customers after startup.

The French state wants much more offshore wind by 2035 and 2050. This award supports that plan and sends a clear signal to suppliers. The project also helps build a skilled workforce in Normandy.

What Comes Next

The operator will continue studies, permits, and supplier work. Grid timing is linked to the national plan, so design must stay aligned. A new partner could join once approvals are in place.

There’s still risk, of course. Offshore wind faces supply chain tightness and changing rates. But early planning, local sourcing, and fixed pricing can help. The project’s funds for nature and training also build community trust.

Quick List: What Readers Should Know

Biggest yet: Centre Manche 2 is France’s largest renewable project.

Set price: Power will sell at €66/MWh under the tender.

Local stake: Crowdfunding and a €10 million territorial fund are planned.

Nature focus: €45 million for environmental steps and €15 million for biodiversity.

Silver is important to solar energy photovoltaic systems to convert sunlight into electricity. Platinum is a key to autocatalysts used to recycle other precious metals and in automobile catalytic converters which help sustain clean air.

The Chinese have pledged to cut emissions, reduce greenhouse gases, increase solar energy use, and move to alternative fuel vehicles. These new moves toward environmental protection are seen as a positive sign for precious metals futures. Analysts hope that U.S. policy will match the Chinese efforts.

Fall Harvest Has Bean Stressful So Far

With China looking to Brazil and now Argentina for their soybeans, American farmers continue to look for ways to profit from their large bean harvests. With this year’s U.S. crop half harvested,Taiwan has signed a $6.4 billion deal with Indiana to buy beans and corn to ease some of the farm pain. Last year, China spent $12.6 billion on U.S. beans, but the number stands at zero dollars as of now due to tariff disagreements between the two countries. China has basically admitted to withholding purchases of U.S. soybeans as a tariff protest.Hopes for a tariff agreement were high after a recent U.S. — China TikTok accord, but no further deals come forth.

The American Soybean Association has called upon the current administration to resolve the tariff issues. Meanwhile the government will use other tariff dollars to ease losses sustained by the bean farmers. However, farmers are looking for long term solutions that will allow them to earn their incomes directly from crops. With bumper crops and few options to sell their harvest, farmers are running short on storage facilities to hold the corn and beans as bulls hope the Chinese will come to American markets by winter.

Late Week Copper Droppers

Global demand had kept copper prices up through Thursday. However, a decision to exempt the 50% tariff on the raw material, fears of recession, and a slowdown of Chinese factory work caused a sell-off late in the week. Copper’s use in electric vehicles as well as in AI infrastructure adds to its versatility.

Declining and unreliable mine supply along with increased production and mining costs have created the supply issue. Freeport McMoRan, the largest producer of the metal, has dropped Indonesian production by 35% due to mudslides in their mines. The company declared a force majeure contract situation, a clause that allows previous contract agreements to be broken due to natural causes such as fires and mining accidents.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-28 09:59:48.851740

Regional Energy Transformation

Across the MENA region, renewable energy adoption is accelerating. Installed solar capacity reached 24 GWAC in 2024 — a 25% year-on-year increase, with projections indicating a surge past 180 GW by 2030. Over the next five years, MENA is set to add 62 GW of new renewable capacity, with countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt investing heavily in solar, wind, and green hydrogen. Expanding renewable energy to 30% of the power mix could create up to 1.2 million jobs by 2050.

In Saudi Arabia, the energy transition is a cornerstone of Vision 2030, with over $266 billion committed to renewable energy and sustainable development. The Kingdom aims to achieve 50% renewable electricity by 2030, powered by giga-projects like NEOM, expansive solar parks, and pioneering green hydrogen initiatives. CARE KSA will unite innovators and stakeholders to accelerate projects, finance mechanisms, and climate-tech solutions aligned with this bold vision.

In fact, electricity prices have only risen, outpacing the rate of broader inflation.
For PJM Interconnection alone, wholesale electricity costs are set to jump by 22%.","Simultaneously, however, the Trump administration has stymied the development of solar and wind — some of the fastest energy sources to connect to the grid — and has yet to implement the reforms necessary to upgrade transmission to allow new power sources to supply homes, factories, and more.

Meanwhile, energy demand is only expected to grow.

Trump’s promise

Throughout his campaign, Trump vowed to cut the cost of energy and electricity for consumers dramatically.

“Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,” he said during an August campaign rally in North Carolina.

“We’re going to get your energy prices down. We’re going to get your energy prices down by 50%,” Trump repeated in Pennsylvania just a few days later.

Over nine months into his second presidency, there is no sign that electricity prices will be lower anytime soon. In fact, electricity prices have only risen, outpacing the rate of broader inflation.

In the latest Consumer Price Index report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, electricity prices rose by 6.2% for the year ending in August. This is more than double the rate of inflation, which increased slightly to 2.9% for the year.

Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at climate and energy research firm Energy Innovation, told the Washington Examiner that this has resulted in some households spending 10% or more on their utility bills compared to this time last year.

While officials like Energy Secretary Chris Wright have affirmed the administration still hopes to bring these costs down, even some Republicans are not convinced they will be successful.

“I don’t see prices going down, hopefully, the increases can be slowed,” Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow with the Energy and Environment Legal Institute and former Trump Environmental Protection Agency transition team member, told the Washington Examiner.

Milloy said he was confident that the Trump administration’s policies are still addressing the energy demand in the right way by focusing on extending coal and building out more natural gas. Like Trump, Milloy has blamed higher prices on the accelerated integration of renewables such as wind and solar.

“The system has been loaded up with all this green crap,” Milloy said. “Prices have been going up for some time because of all the green stuff. And you know … prices would have continued to — would have exploded with the demand and the failure of green to keep track of it to supply the power.”

What is driving higher prices?

The Trump administration has increasingly blamed renewable energy efforts for higher prices, but evidence suggests that the underlying cause of higher electricity prices is not that simple.

There are several factors driving costs, including the replacement and maintenance of transmission lines and their distribution infrastructure, Pierpont said. Utilities also face increased wildfire risk and more extreme weather, which require them to spend more money on risk mitigation. Plus, older legacy generation plants are experiencing rising costs related to maintenance and operation, he said.

“We at Energy Innovation took a look at the coal fleet in the U.S., and between 2021 and 2024, the average coal plant costs rose by 28%, outpacing the rate of inflation,” Pierpont said.

The growth in artificial intelligence and data centers, which are highly energy-intensive, has been linked to the rising energy demand. The Center for Strategic and International Studies forecasts that by 2030, AI data centers in the United States will consume nearly 84 gigawatts, compared to only 4 gigawatts consumed by data centers last year.

Grid operators have moved to significantly increase their capacity prices due to the growing need for power. For PJM Interconnection alone, wholesale electricity costs are set to jump by 22%. When the rates take effect in the summer of 2026, consumers in the PJM region are expected to see a 1.5% to 5% increase in energy bills.

That’s not to say renewable energy doesn’t play a role.

As many analysts point to the need for additional transmission infrastructure, critics have blasted utilities for failing to plan necessary upgrades and grid expansions properly.

Republicans have often accused utilities of prioritizing building new green energy projects instead of making these upgrades while removing traditional baseload energy, like coal, from the grid.

As these renewable projects have integrated more slowly into the grid than demand calls for, some suggest that this has forced grid operators and utilities to raise their prices.

“They don’t make any money from keeping a coal plant or an old coal plant or an old gas plant,” Milloy said. “They make money from a new wind farm or a new solar farm. So it’s that sort of corruption that has led to where we are now, which is, for electricity, skyrocketing prices.”

Who is to blame?

The Trump administration has repeatedly pointed fingers at former President Joe Biden and his administration for the electricity price hikes, blaming their accelerated phase-out of fossil fuels and focus on renewables.

At the same time, some energy experts dispute the idea that Trump has done much to lower costs.

“Whatever he promised, there’s no action in the direction of reducing electricity prices,” James Sweeney, emeritus professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University, told the Washington Examiner.

Sweeney argued that the administration’s efforts to boost fossil fuels, limit renewable energy, and impose sweeping tariffs have not contributed to lowering power costs.

He said that wind and solar power have been the primary sources of new electricity generation in recent years, were previously supported by federal subsidies, and often offered cheaper energy than traditional sources. However, he noted that the administration’s actions to restrict energy development have led utilities to pay more for green energy, which is now reflected in higher electricity prices.

Additionally, Trump’s tariffs on materials such as steel and aluminum, key components in energy infrastructure, have increased construction costs for various energy projects.

“I have not seen anything he’s done that would reduce electricity prices,” Sweeney said.

Frank Macchiarola, chief advocacy officer of American Clean Power, also told the Washington Examiner that it is important to examine the Biden administration’s policies aimed at restricting oil production.

Macchiarola explained that the Trump administration appears to be pursuing a similar strategy with renewable energy sources, the fastest-growing source of electricity in the U.S.

“It would only be natural that energy prices would increase at a time when the American consumer is facing inflation concerns about the economy, and this has exacerbated it,” he said.

“This is an administration that has really kind of stressed the importance of American energy dominance, and what we’ve seen from President Trump is American energy weakness,” Macchiarola added.

As electricity prices rise, Democrats have placed the blame on Republicans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said earlier this week on a conference call at Climate Week that “Trump and Republicans are doing what the American people hate most, and that is raise costs.”

“You may remember the biggest issue they had against Biden is raising costs,” Schumer said. “They’re making it much worse, and the American people are realizing it.”

Where should the focus be?

Still, some experts caution against placing any blame too quickly, as the energy system is highly complex.

David Hill, executive vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Energy Program, explained that the federal government has limited influence over power prices and that the electricity system is “very complicated.”

“I would say to the policymakers who are trying to point fingers of blame: There’s a lot of blame to go around,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Instead of trying to figure out how the finger of blame can be pointed, it’s, ‘How do we actually address this going forward?'”

To curb electricity price hikes and meet growing energy demands, Hill said the U.S. needs to focus on utilizing energy from all sources and reform permitting to accelerate the construction of transmission infrastructure and new generation.

Passing permitting reform has become a top priority for both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, with discussions currently revolving around reforming lengthy environmental reviews.

Earlier this month, the House also passed legislation that would expedite the interconnection process for dispatchable and baseload energy projects, allowing traditional power sources to connect to the grid more quickly. This bill, known as the Guaranteeing Reliability through the Interconnection of Dispatchable Power Act, passed with bipartisan support and is now with the Senate for consideration.

ELECTRICITY PRICES ROSE FURTHER IN AUGUST AS TRUMP BLAMES RENEWABLES

Hill said the administration’s emphasis on energy reliability is essential, adding that Americans want an energy system that is “reliable, affordable, and clean.” This puts the country in a unique position to move forward in a bipartisan manner, he said.

“The fact that affordability and reliability are concerns right now do allow for some bipartisan agreement on some important changes that need to be made that help us meet the challenge,” he said.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-collage-lxulk5m1r-1758916796616-e1758922777303.jpg?1758908372&resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-28 07:59:25.018773

Opinion: How Western North Carolina can turn Helene disaster into opportunity Opinion: Who will care for our public lands?","As we mark the one-year anniversary of Helene, the images of floodwaters tearing through Western North Carolina are still vivid. Lives, homes, and livelihoods were lost. Roads and trails were washed out. Families were displaced. Yet what stays with me most is not only the devastation. It is what came after: the unmistakable truth that we are in this together.

Storms like Helene don’t just wash away roads and homes. They compromise every layer of community life: infrastructure, from bridges to water systems; economy, as businesses close and jobs disappear; health and safety, when hospitals are stretched and families face trauma; and communications, as power outages and downed networks leave people cut off. In those first days, it felt like the very systems we depend on had collapsed.

First responders worked around the clock to save lives. Nonprofits mobilized food, clothing, and emergency support. Conservation groups began the hard work of restoring rivers and repairing damaged landscapes. Volunteers cleared debris, ran supply lines, and checked on neighbors. Local governments stepped up with the tools they had. Every sector of our community did its part. The work was not perfect, but it was shared.

I saw a sign written by a child offering some of their stuffed animals to children who had lost theirs in the flood. That simple act of kindness said as much about recovery as any truckload of supplies. I remember churches opening as shelters and staging grounds. Volunteers carried food, water, and essentials into areas where roads had washed out, moving them by foot, mule, and ATV. That is what recovery looked like in real life.

Meanwhile, so much of the daily news seems determined to divide us. We are told that we are red or blue, rural or urban, us or them. But Helene told us a different story. When the waters rose, those lines blurred. Neighbors showed up with bottled water, hot meals, chainsaws, or simply their presence. Not once did anyone offering aid ask me about my politics, what god I worshiped, or whether I was a citizen. What mattered was that someone needed help, and someone else was there to give it. Volunteers came from around the country to stand with us. That too is community — people answering the call to care for one another in a time of need.

Helene also changed how we prepare. I still keep cases of bottled water and MREs stacked in my home. Others have stocked generators, radios, or emergency kits. But the most important preparation is not physical. It is relational. The real safety net is not only what is stored in our basements, but the strength of the connections we build with one another.

The question now is whether we will carry those lessons forward. We do not need to wait for another storm to practice the kind of community that got us through Helene. I joined volunteers for a day in Marshall as the town dug itself out. The effort was strategically organized, yet 100 percent citizen-led. That kind of initiative is what keeps communities alive. We can support the local businesses that reopen against the odds. We can strengthen the nonprofits that mobilize in every crisis, from food banks to conservation groups. And we can stay engaged with local governments that keep essential services running when everything feels uncertain. These choices matter. They strengthen the networks that will hold us together when the next storm comes, whatever form it takes.

In that sense, Helene is a metaphor for our larger moment. We are living through an era of change, uncertainty, and anxiety from climate disaster to economic strain to bitter polarization. The forces around us may try to pit neighbor against neighbor, but when the storms come, whether literal or figurative, we only have one another.

That may sound romantic to some. But the truth is practical: communities survive because we need one another. Alone, no household could have faced what Helene brought. Together, we found not just resilience, but abundance in compassion, shared labor, and the will to keep going.

At the end of the day, we do not just share roads and rivers. We share a future. And if Helene taught us anything, it is this: we are in this together, and we will need to lean into one another even more than before. Institutions may falter, but Helene showed us who we truly are: neighbors helping neighbors. That is the America I want to live in.

Ten years after Volvo Cars launched its first North American manufacturing plant in Ridgeville, executives are working on an aggressive timeline to make the most of its $1.3 billion investment that has struggled to meet capacity.

The plant has an annual output of about 26,000 cars. But with the Sept. 23 announcement of an all-new hybrid vehicle to be made in the U.S. in 2030, the production line should finally hit the 150,000 vehicles a year it was built for.

Tariffs have accelerated the increased production plans,

CEO Håkan Samuelsson said while visiting stateside for Volvo’s 10-year anniversary celebration.

“To have faster deliveries, we need to build where we sell,” he said. Currently, cars imported to the U.S. from Sweden and the European Union face 15 percent tariffs.

By 2030, the original equipment manufacturer will add a still-unnamed hybrid vehicle to production — the fourth car on its Ridgeville line. The boost is expected to double its workforce to 4,000.

While few specifics have been confirmed about the hybrid under design in Sweden, Volvo has held clinics with American consumers to determine the present market needs. Samuelsson confirmed it will be a second-generation hybrid and “more of an electric car with a backup engine.”

First-generations are more derivative of a combustion car, he said, but the new vehicle will have “very fast acceleration,” be agile and quiet, and have an onboard charger.

“Many places in America are still not ready for full electric cars,” Samuelsson said. “Then this will be a very good solution.”

The future hybrid will accommodate the specific demands of the U.S. market, with its larger size with “room for big families and luggage and everything they bring along,” specific colors and even how it's marketed, Samuelsson said.

It will join Ridgeville's existing lineup that includes the fully electric Volvo EX90 SUV and the Polestar 3. In July, the company announced it would bring production of its XC60 to South Carolina from its plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. The midsize SUV is one of the manufacturer’s key U.S. products and is set to roll off the local assembly line in 2026.

Volvo sold more 27,000 XC60s in the U.S. between January and August 2025, an increase of almost 20 percent year over year.

With U.S. production, the vehicle should bring the Ridgeville plant to about 50-60 percent capacity, while the new hybrid will take it to 100 percent within the next decade, said Francesca Gamboni, chief industrial operations officer of Volvo Cars.

“This plant should be used for production for the American customers, which means bringing the cars that are closer, that are more adapt, suited for the American customers, and then build them locally,” Gamboni said.

She joined Samuelsson at the Ridgeville event, along with Luis Rezende, president of Americas for Volvo; David Stenstrom, vice president of manufacturing for the U.S.; and Sweden’s ambassador to the U.S., Urban Ahlin. Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-Charleston, also attended.

While Volvo’s goal has been to go fully electric by 2040, the U.S. still lacks infrastructure, incentives and affordable options that encourage people to buy EVs.

The Biden administration had previously set ambitious goals for automakers to electrify more of their fleets and reduce emissions by 2032, but current leaders have pushed back of late.

Aiko Toyoda, the chairman for Toyota and former CEO for 13 years, told Forbes last year that customers, not regulations or politics, should drive production and that battery electric vehicles will most likely never gain majority market sales, “no matter how much progress the BEVs make.”

President Donald Trump has further voiced skepticism of EVs, including at a 2023 rally when he criticized, “They don’t go far. They cost a fortune.”

Ramping up more jobs in Ridgeville

With increased production in the U.S., Gamboni wants to localize the majority of Volvo’s suppliers to make the plant “more resilient” and “quicker to respond to the demand.”

“We have done a good job with it on the EX90, I think so far,” she said. “We have 60 percent … of suppliers who are in the Americas and 11 percent within the state of South Carolina.”

With the expansion news Sept. 23, Volvo’s stock trading in Sweden jumped over 3 percent.

Volvo also operates three auto production plants in China, as well as one in Belgium.

Here in South Carolina, the carmaker employs a staff of 2,000 with plans to grow to 4,000 with the increased output of the XC90 and the on-deck hybrid.

Stenstrom said ReadySC, the workforce training arm of Trident Technical College, has been instrumental to helping fill those roles in the last 10 years and the company will look to them again.

Kelly Steinhilper, vice president of communications with the SC Technical College System, said as of now, they haven’t been asked to support the future ramp-up.

Starting salaries begin at $23 an hour with raises every six months based on hourly output, staff said.

Gamboni reiterated the jobs would not be automated. Currently, any robotics are “complementary” to support human output and make jobs more efficient.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/8e/08ebb4f0-0435-4e20-8231-af6c8fe25096/68d2f9c090f90.image.jpg?crop=1768%2C928%2C0%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:55.118236

The study, titled “Reshoring Solar Module Manufacturing to Europe,” provides a detailed cost gap analysis and policy impact simulation, offering strategies to accelerate domestic solar manufacturing while building a resilient and innovative solar industry.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, emphasized that Europe has the potential to deliver up to 30 gigawatts of solar manufacturing by 2030, creating thousands of local jobs and retaining economic value within the region. She stressed the need for urgent action from the EU and its Member States, warning that without targeted policy interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar manufacturing.

The report shows that producing a solar module in Europe using EU-made solar cells currently costs around 10.3 €ct/Wp more than producing the same module in China. This cost difference is driven by higher expenses in equipment, building and facilities, labor, and materials, with labor costs alone being 280 percent higher in Europe. For utility-scale solar installations, the total cost amounts to approximately 60.8 €ct/Wp for European-made modules, compared to 50.0 €ct/Wp for Chinese modules, resulting in a Levelised Cost of Electricity that is 14.5 percent higher for European production.

Despite these higher costs, European-made modules already fall within the 15 percent additional cost limit set under the Net-Zero Industry Act auction rules, suggesting that competitiveness is achievable with the right support. However, the report also identifies a cost difference of 2.2 to 5.8 €ct/Wp between NZIA-compliant EU-made and non-EU-made modules. While the NZIA’s resilience criteria can help diversify module supply chains and boost imports from other regions, reshoring production to Europe will require additional policy measures.

The analysis suggests that combining CAPEX and OPEX support for both manufacturers and project developers, along with output-based incentives similar to those used in the United States and India, could reduce the cost gap to below 10 percent, especially if solar factories reach 3–5 GW capacity. The report estimates that achieving the 30 GW target for European solar manufacturing by 2030 would require annual industry support of between €1.4 billion and €5.2 billion. Up to 39 percent of these costs could be recovered through macroeconomic benefits, including the creation of 2,700 jobs and up to €66.4 million in annual tax and social contributions per gigawatt-peak of installed capacity.

The report recommends establishing an EU-level output-based support scheme for solar manufacturing, combining grants, loans, and de-risking instruments to cover both CAPEX and OPEX. It also calls for the implementation of NZIA policy schemes across Member States, including “Made-in-EU” bonus points in rooftop support programs and public procurement initiatives. The Net-Zero Industry Act, adopted in June 2024 with secondary legislation in May 2025, sets out rules for Member States on incorporating non-price criteria in renewable energy auctions. Under the act, at least 30 percent of auctioned volumes, or six gigawatts annually, must apply non-price criteria, which account for 15 to 30 percent of overall evaluation metrics.

Resilience under Article 26 is defined as sourcing from non-dominant suppliers, and Member States are required to implement these provisions from January 2026 onward. The act provides a historic opportunity for reshoring clean technology manufacturing in Europe, but its success will depend on how effectively Member States apply the non-price criteria in their auctions. The report concludes that with targeted policy support, Europe can successfully build a competitive solar manufacturing sector, enhance supply chain resilience, retain economic value domestically, and contribute significantly to the region’s broader climate and energy transition goals.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4-3.png,N,,2025-09-28 05:58:49.338055

But at salvage auctions across Australia, a new type of buyer is emerging, and they are interested in one thing: the high-powered batteries inside electric vehicles.

The demand for secondhand EV batteries is surging, with buyers repurposing them for everything from solar storage units to off-grid energy systems that can replace diesel generators.

Brendon Green, the general manager of automotive solutions at Pickles, says the auction house is selling about 100 salvaged EVs every month, and interest is surging.

“It’s only very early days, but they are certainly in strong demand,” says Green.

“We’ve got this new element of second-life battery startups. That industry really didn’t exist 18 months ago.”

Battery hunters

Salvage auction houses started regularly seeing salvage EVs in early 2024, most of which were Teslas, the first mass market electric vehicle on Australian roads.

Battery hunters are now also seeing alternatives, such as BYDs and MGs, in line with the growing number of different makes on the market. Many of the wrecked vehicles are two-to-three years old, and include a mix of complete write-offs and those that are repairable.

The appeal for EV batteries is obvious, given they are about five times as powerful as a typical home energy storage unit.

Andrew Chadwick, a lithium battery repair specialist, says even ageing EV batteries have plenty of life in them for other purposes.

“The output requirements for a solar battery are a lot less than what you need for an electric vehicle,” says Chadwick, from Second Life Battery Sales.

“Even if they are no longer good for an electric vehicle, with a little finessing, they’re perfect for a solar system.”

Consider an EV battery that is down to 70% capacity. While this will considerably reduce the range of the vehicle, making the car undesirable, it still holds plenty of charge for less-intensive uses.

You could even put a trailer load of second-hand EV batteries together, and power an entire music festival.

A music event in Queensland’s Sunshine Coast was postponed in June over council concerns its power usage would disrupt nearby businesses. The punk and indie-alternative festival went ahead in early September, powered by repurposed EV batteries.

“Our trailers powered the whole event for the day, including speakers, food trucks, everything, and had plenty of power left over,” says John Myler, co-founder of MyNu Energy.

“People really like them as an alternative to a diesel generator. If you’ve got sound equipment or food trucks, having a noisy, smelly diesel generator probably isn’t the atmosphere you’re looking for, whereas these batteries are silent, pollution free, and hold huge amounts of power.”

After the event, the trailers were recharged using solar, ready for their next deployment.

Life extension

At Pickles auctions, the demand for EV batteries is evident.

Financial year sales of salvage EVs increased 200% over the prior year, with the wrecked vehicles now boasting much higher price tags than combustion engine cars.

Buyers know that EVs contain some of the world’s most advanced battery technology, ready to be deployed.

About one in 10 new car sales in Australia are battery-powered, with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 and the BYD Seal and Atto the most popular models in 2024, according to the EV Council.

After a comparably slow roll out in Australia marked by political headwinds, motoring experts believe EV sales will surge as prices become more competitive and charging infrastructure catches up.

Currently, many batteries are shredded, with the material then separated into components ready to be rebuilt into new batteries, with the process often including multiple facilities in different countries.

A repurposed battery can reduce this process, with some second-hand buyers believing they can get about 20 years of usage from them.

Myler says repurposed EV batteries are part of the solution to Australia’s intensifying energy needs.

“We need a huge amount of short term energy storage to help us transition to sustainable energy solutions,” he says.

“As a country, we need every bit of storage we can get our hands on.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ca30e0a113e6b14984e1c8ca49a5919bc681343/338_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5726f1cd121240f0d12d34d2028cacab",N,,2025-09-28 05:59:08.665348

Leaving the tight-knit community his family had called home for five generations along the Louisiana coast was one of the hardest things Chris Brunet has had to do.

But three years ago, he felt he had no other choice.

The Gulf of Mexico’s swelling waters were gradually consuming Isle de Jean Charles—the narrow strip of land in Terrebonne Parish that has been the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s.

“This is where I was awakened to my Native American identity,” Brunet says on a sticky late afternoon in August as he sits in his wheelchair, gazing upon the tattered remains of his family’s island home. “I would want to be here if I had any choice in the world.”

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving fishing community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres but has shrunk to about 320 acres due to erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, manmade canals and sea level rise spurred by climate change.

Isle de Jean Charles is a shell of a place once filled with life. The remaining strip is now dotted with the dilapidated homes of those who fled; a few properties are used as recreational camps by their owners.

Brunet says it’s hard to watch his beloved Louisiana coast wash away.

“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime,” Brunet said. “Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration.”

This new chapter for former island residents is no fairy tale. They say their new homes are substandard, with rainwater seeping through doorways, malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards causing costly repairs.

“I just wish they would have given themselves a little bit more time to try to prevent so many of the issues that we had over here,” Brunet said. “Some things that immediately just broke down right away—whether it be electrical, whether it be plumbing, whether it be exterior, interior.”

And ironically, their new community—dubbed New Isle—could literally become an island surrounded by water if predictions of accelerating coastal land loss and inland flooding come to pass.

What was supposed to be a model for how the government could get people out of harm’s way along the country’s steadily eroding coastlines has instead become a cautionary tale for the estimated 2.5 million Americans who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the United States. But leaders there have rejected a controversial nearly $3 billion plan—paid primarily by BP to compensate for a massive 2010 oil spill—designed to shore up the coastline.

And Louisiana has no further plans to help residents and businesses move away as rising water, hurricanes, storm surges and flooding eat away at the land underneath them.

In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the United States has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way—and “limited” funds to do so.

Some of that money is being targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, which is seeking to defund the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has provided $4.5 billion to mitigate harm from natural disasters and climate change. Trump also has cut about 10 percent of the Federal Emergency Management Agency staff, arguing states should be in charge of their own disaster relief.

In Alaska, more than 30 indigenous villages face imminent relocation due to flooding, land erosion, permafrost thaw or combinations of all the above because of climate change. But thus far, only one village, Newtok, has made successful strides in that direction—and even that took nearly two decades and about $60 million in federal funds.

Relocation Causes Rift

Brunet and the other 37 residents living on the island packed up their lives to move to a new community in Gray, Louisiana, 9 miles north of Houma and 40 miles north of their old homes. They are now dealing with substandard housing, and they accuse state leaders of ignoring their input in a rushed attempt to build their new community.

“It made us angry,” said Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation. “We thought we were going to have a community and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

It was Naquin’s uncle who devised the original plan, seeing it as a way to reunite the tribe in a safer community after some had already fled the storm-ravaged island. But after the chief of another tribe, Citizens of the United Houma Nation, learned of the relocation funding, he lobbied for his members living on the island to be included.

The conflict led state officials to determine that any residents still living on Isle de Jean Charles or those whose homes had been disrupted by a 2012 hurricane would be eligible to relocate. That ended the original intent of the relocation and sparked a rift between the Choctaw Nation and the state.

Mathew Sanders was the point person for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development on the relocation. He says island residents had a “significant voice” in the process, but the state had to balance individuals’ goals with those of the tribal leaders.

“One of the things that we heard very early on in the project from the residents was that they didn’t really want either of the tribes to represent their interests,” Sanders said. “We wanted to do what the community was telling us they wanted to do. So, I would push back on the notion from either tribe saying they didn’t have a say.”

But looking back, he acknowledges that Louisiana officials—despite their experience with coastal planning and gauging flood risk—“were not prepared to really take on this type of effort.” In fact, no other state had ever attempted such a move, notes Sanders, who now works on disaster planning at the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts.

Marvin McGraw, spokesman for state’s OCD, wouldn’t say whether the agency considers the relocation a success. He said in a prepared statement that honoring the wishes and needs of “Old Isle” residents was the highest priority but “stakeholder wishes did not always align with federal laws and regulations governing the use of funds.”

McGraw pointed out that the Isle de Jean Charles relocation project was designed to relocate the community, not just certain tribal members.

“While most residents are Native American, some identify with one tribe, others with multiple tribes, and some with no tribal affiliation,” he wrote. “Federal guidelines prohibit determining eligibility for housing in the new community based on tribal affiliation.”

Louisiana: Leader in Severe Flood Risk

Louisiana tops an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central when it comes to the amount of land projected to experience severe coastal flooding—approximately 9,200 square miles—over the next 25 years.

Those projections, released in April, were based on the assumption that the United States will honor its greenhouse gas emission goals. That means the outcome could be worse given the Trump administration’s systematic kneecapping of the climate-focused initiatives of the previous administration.

Louisiana’s coast contains 40 percent of the nation’s wetlands, which serve as an important protective barrier from severe storms.

For the past 20 years, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) has led the state’s efforts to address its shrinking coastline through a master plan the agency updates every six years. That plan is essentially an unfunded wishlist of projects and science-backed initiatives designed to reduce rapid coastal land loss.

But in July, the agency cancelled the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the nearly $3 billion centerpiece of the effort. Officials said the controversial project had become too costly and was stalled by permitting issues and ongoing litigation. The project also faced criticism from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who said it would negatively impact the coastline instead of helping it.

The project broke ground in 2023. It was designed to reintroduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into the basin, rebuilding up to 30,000 acres of coastal wetlands over 50 years. It was funded by the $8 billion-plus settlement Louisiana got from oil giant BP following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Advocates with Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, said the state was “throwing away more than $618 million” that had already been spent on the project.

Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chair of the CPRA, said the state will honor its “commitment to coastal restoration” by investing in a less costly and smaller sediment diversion project in the same area.

But Emily Guidry Schatzel, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program, called that project “outdated.” She noted the CPRA had discarded it from earlier master plans because it “failed to meet science-backed benchmarks” and couldn’t “deliver the scale or speed of land-building required to keep up with the coast’s rapid collapse.”

CPRA acknowledges the need for flood mitigation to protect businesses and people living along the coast, suggesting an organized retreat from the shoreline would be needed. But the agency says any such actions should be left to “community members and their local elected officials.”

Owners Report Leaking Doors, Broken Appliances

The original plan for The New Isle settlement included more than 100 homes, walking trails, a community center, commercial and retail development and other amenities.

“We knew the money that was awarded wasn’t going to be enough,” Naquin said about the relocation project. “But we had opportunities for more funding.”

According to the OCD, the homes in New Isle would be energy efficient, able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds, have insulation in the walls, ceiling and under floors; certified energy-efficient appliances and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Brunet grew up loving the marsh, the sound of boats slicing through swamp waters, the quiet stillness and wildlife encounters that came with living along the coast. He knew living in the suburbs would bring unforeseen challenges.

One thing he didn’t anticipate was their new homes breaking down.

Brunet’s neighbor, Kristi Naquin, says the handles on her front door leak from rainwater. During strong downpours and hurricanes, they put down towels to keep the water out. The shower also leaks onto the floor, she said. And the dishwasher and air conditioner have malfunctioned.

And Naquin says it feels like the house is leaning and there’s no insulation. She and her husband, Simon, Chief Deme Naquin’s brother, have had to pay for repairs.

“I’m honestly pissed,” Naquin said. “We should not have this many complaints. We should not have this many problems. It should have been (built) better than what it was.”

She added: “To come to a house that is falling apart, and we got no help, no help at all. They just washed their hands of us.”

Sanders had already left his position with the Louisiana development agency by the time construction began. But he says there was a sense of urgency to get New Isle developed because the state had a deadline of 2021 to use the federal money or risk losing it.

“You know, that’s a very short timeline to build out a 500-acre development,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction. “I mean, that’s almost impossible.”

In response to the complaints about the quality of the homes in New Isle, McGraw says all items that were under warranty were timely handled by the building contractors. After the warranty period on items had expired, he said, “responsibility for repairs shifted to the residents.”

Community-Driven Relocation Touted

University of New Orleans urban planning Professor Marla Nelson and Traci Birch, director of the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University, recently wrote about the pitfalls of relocation initiatives in that state. The best approach, they say, is to deeply involve the people who need to move away from the coast.

“It’s about the individuals and communities coming to the decision that, ‘Hey, you know, this isn’t viable to live here anymore,’ and what can be done to help expand people’s options,” Nelson said. “How do we empower individuals and communities who want to move, or need to move, to move?”

Renia Ehrenfeucht, professor of community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico, was a co-author on the piece. In 2018 and 2019, the three interviewed nearly 60 former residents who lived on the Louisiana coast and more than two dozen coastal planning professionals to understand the factors contributing to household decisions about relocating or adapting to sea level rise.

They concluded that even though residents living along the Gulf Coast recognized the need to relocate, the loss of historical ties, family bonds and cultural connections made them hesitant to leave. Local elected officials perceived the loss of tax revenue from property buyouts as “politically unacceptable.” And without funding or policies to relocate entire communities, many people decided to “focus on today’s problems” instead of the “problems of the future.”

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, dubbed Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline:

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

While that state has acknowledged the need for relocation since 2005, the researchers wrote that no agency in Louisiana has developed the funding or infrastructure to do so.

“True management would mean we’re thinking through the process from beginning to end,” Birch said. “There’s kind of ‘Do nothing.’ And then on the other end of the spectrum is, ‘We’re going to move everybody all at once.’ But the reality is, most of life happens somewhere in the middle.”

“This Conversation Is Hardly Happening”

Cultural anthropologist Maida Owens along with Shana Walton, coordinator of the Bayou Culture Collaborative, have spent the past few years leading workshops discussing environmental adaptation, climate migration and relocation planning.

When asked if cities are ready for the shifts in population that climate-driven relocation will cause, Owens replied, “The simple answer is ‘no.’ ”

“It’s hard to get people to prepare for storms and hurricanes. It’s even harder for them to think about all this,” Owens said. “It’s hard because our brain is ‘Get fed today.’ I need food for today, and I’ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And that’s just as true for government officials.”

Owens, a Baton Rouge native, grew up enduring major hurricanes. But it was rain and floods in 2016 and 2017 that sent Owens and Walton into the climate preparation business. Owens said it was the flooding in 2016 that swamped most of the Baton Rouge metro area and damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes.

For Walton, “What really tipped my boat was a heavy precipitation event in 2017 where I watched my car float away down the street in New Orleans … and this is just rain!”

Now they run relocation workshops aimed at the public and state and local officials.

There are many challenges government leaders need to consider: Is their infrastructure sufficient to withstand climate impacts? Is there housing for relocatees? Are there jobs for the people once they arrive?

“It just gets immensely complicated, really quickly,” Owens said. “Within (Louisiana) state government, this conversation is hardly happening.”

At the federal level, then-President Joe Biden’s administration tried to start the conversation about a national relocation effort. It published two reports identifying next steps federal agencies could take toward community-driven relocation and existing federal resources to get started.

But all traces of those reports were scrubbed shortly after Trump took office.

Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response.

“I think states and local governments need to lean in on the idea that they’re going to have to be engaged in relocation activities before they think they need to,” said Sanders, formerly of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “They need to really take this seriously before it becomes a dire sort of emergent situation like it was in Isle de Jean Charles.”

High Insurance Costs Driving Coastal Retreat

And even if the water is not wiping out homeowners—yet—the cost of insurance might be.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, said sharply rising property insurance premiums caused by climate-fueled disasters are already prompting people to move away from the coasts. And the cost of insuring homes there is convincing the companies themselves to pull out.

“(Insurance companies) are a pretty good witness of what’s coming at us and they’re saying, ‘Hey, coastal areas, wildfire adjacent areas, we’re outta here’,” Whitehouse told reporters in July during an interview hosted by Covering Climate Now.

Whitehouse, one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill when it comes to climate change-related issues, says historically when coastal areas were hit by hurricanes and floods, the federal government would swoop in to help people rebuild. But that doesn’t mean they can—or should—stay.

“The fact that it’s going to continue to happen and continue to get worse and worse and worse, this isn’t like a one off thing where you come in and rebuild the house and everything’s back to normal,” Whitehouse said. “This is a continually degrading situation.”

Scientist Joshua Elliot argues the federal government must step in to subsidize insurance programs tied to flooding if they want coastal areas to remain habitable.

“At what point does the cost of inaction then become so great that it overcomes the political will for inaction?” said Elliot, chief scientist for Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit that works on climate mitigation, including “advanced research for climate emergencies.”

“There are things that can be done,” Elliot said. “And there are things that are being done. Although, we need to do a whole lot more if we actually want to get ahead of this problem and not end up instead in the position of having to play catch up when it’s too late.”

Bolstering Wright’s argument is the fact that – despite its recent growth spurt – solar power generates less than 3% of global energy, according to Energy Department data.
“One of the big problems with solar and wind is they only produce electricity,” Wright said.
Solar power could approach that milestone as soon as 2050, according to the Energy Department’s latest International Energy Outlook report.
Free-market conservatives have cheered Trump’s moves to roll back Biden-era subsidies for solar power.","The Trump administration has a dim view of the sun.

Solar panels provided most of the electricity capacity added to the U.S. power grid last year, and they will account for most new power built in America for the rest of President Donald Trump’s term, according to Energy Department data. But Trump and his Cabinet secretaries have argued this form of energy is so unreliable and expensive that it’s unlikely to play an important role in powering the world.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said solar panels are “just a parasite” on the grid that couldn’t power the planet even if they blanketed the entire surface of the Earth. The Energy Department’s X account – which once cheered solar projects during the Biden administration – now says solar panels are “essentially worthless when it is dark outside.”

In a speech to the U.N. on Tuesday, Trump told world leaders “the high cost of so-called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet.”

The administration has used these arguments to justify policies that slow solar development while promoting fossil fuels – particularly natural gas, the industry where Wright made his fortune before becoming energy secretary. In an interview with the Washington Post, Wright stood by his criticism of solar power and his prediction that it would always play a minor role in global energy.

“If solar continued to grow at its current (rate) it could theoretically catch up to gas, but I don’t think that’s likely,” Wright said.

Bolstering Wright’s argument is the fact that – despite its recent growth spurt – solar power generates less than 3% of global energy, according to Energy Department data. The vast majority of the global economy runs on oil, gas and coal.

Switching to solar isn’t as simple as replacing fossil fuel power plants with solar farms, either: Roughly 80% of global energy consumption comes from cars, trucks, planes, ships, factories and furnaces that directly burn fossil fuels. They aren’t designed to run on electricity, so they’d have to be replaced with electric versions or burn expensive fuels made using electricity.

“One of the big problems with solar and wind is they only produce electricity,” Wright said. “We’ve been talking about ‘electrify everything’ for a while. Today, 15% of energy in manufacturing comes from electricity, same as it was 25 years ago.”

Despite the long-term challenges of powering the world with renewable electricity, many countries are investing in generating more electricity from solar and wind, which don’t cause as much planet-warming pollution and are often cheaper than fossil fuels. In the meantime, electric vehicle sales have surged in China and Europe, and electric heat pumps have started to replace fuel-burning furnaces. Both trends have gradually raised the share of global energy that comes from electricity.

“One hundred fifty years ago, zero percent of our energy consumption was coming from electricity, roughly,” said Josiah Neeley, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank. “A lot of [energy] consumption that isn’t electricity-based right now could move over to being electricity-based.”

The Trump administration’s solar policy makes the United States “an outlier” among world governments, according to Robert Stavins, a professor of energy and economic development at Harvard University.

“The European Union is going forward. China is going forward. India has not changed its position. Brazil is moving forward. So, the U.S. is really an exception,” Stavins said.

The Trump administration’s solar stance also puts it at odds with some right-leaning think tanks and political figures within the U.S., including Elon Musk, the former head of the U.S. DOGE Service, who posted on X, “Solar power is so obviously the future for anyone who can do elementary math.”

In a chippy exchange with the libertarian-leaning venture capitalists who host the “All-In” podcast, Wright said Musk “has a wildly exaggerated view of where solar and batteries will go.”

“If we could make a bet 50 years out, I’ll make a bet solar never gets to 10 percent of global energy,” Wright said.

Solar power could approach that milestone as soon as 2050, according to the Energy Department’s latest International Energy Outlook report.

When the report was released in 2023, the department estimated the world was on track to get about 8 percent of its energy from solar power by mid-century – potentially as high as 10 percent if costs keep falling or as low as 6 percent if the technology does not get cheaper. But the modelers wrote that big, unforeseen energy policy changes could “dramatically shift the course of energy system development.”

Two years later, Trump took office and wound down tax credits for solar power, restricted solar development on federal land and raised tariffs to block imports from China and other big solar manufacturers in Southeast Asia.

Solar installations in the U.S. may be 18 percent lower over the next five years in response to Trump administration policies, according to a September analysis from the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.

Free-market conservatives have cheered Trump’s moves to roll back Biden-era subsidies for solar power.

“I agree with the Trump’s stance on solar, which is to repeal subsidies for solar so that energy sources can have a fair, level playing field,” said Austin Gae, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment.

They’ve been less thrilled with his vow to block permits for solar projects.

“If Secretary Wright has confidence that fossil or thermal is the answer and that solar power is not going to succeed, then you don’t have to try and support fossil and place restrictions on solar,” said Neeley, the R Street Institute fellow. “Just let them compete and that’s what will happen.”

But Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, argued that the Trump administration’s meddling in the energy market is a mirror image of the Biden administration’s moves to block fossil fuel projects.

“The pearl clutching has been ironic to me because it’s like, ‘Hey guys, this has been the ballgame from the left for decades now,’” Fisher said. “So, the fact that it’s now the ballgame from the right – I’m not wild about it, but there’s a sense of irony that comes with it.”

Energy experts, meanwhile, say Trump’s policies are kneecapping the fastest-growing source of electricity in a country that is running out of power.

“What they’re doing right now is making it much, much, much harder than necessary to build economically competitive wind and solar resources across the U.S., while going out and saying all kinds of things in public that just aren’t true about them,” said Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineer at Princeton University.

Even without government support, most experts think solar will continue to grow.

“I think it’ll find its place, and it’s probably going to be less than the solar maximalist bros are talking about, and it’s probably going to be more than Trump is talking about,” Fisher said. “But the only way to know for sure is to see where it lands in the market.”

STATE HOUSE and BEYOND

Only about two weeks into the Trump administration, House Speaker Ron Mariano declared in February that Massachusetts had ""lost our federal partner."" That was long before July's final passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, the landmark law that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans believe will put the nation on a path of progress and prosperity. Local analysts have a dimmer view, asserting that the law will set back social welfare programs and health care efforts that were carefully cultivated over many years by draining a range of federal supports, including clean energy incentives, that are central to the state economy. Now, as the calendar turns to October, there's a possibility that the federal government may shut down due to the inability of Republicans and Democrats in Washington to find common ground on spending plans. State finance officials this week called on executive branch agencies to consider contingency plans and ways to protect residents and meet payrolls if a shutdown occurs on Wednesday. The shutdown threat comes as executive and legislative branch leaders hold an invite-only public session Tuesday to discuss the economy and shifting federal policies. A report is due by week's end on potentially pivotal September tax collections. And inside the Healey administration, the governor still doesn't have an official answer from the Legislature about her request for expanded budget cutting authority, should she need to exercise it. Calculations within the Executive Office for Administration and Finance must also consider the import of Oct. 15, the statutory deadline for the executive branch to deliver any recalibration of available budgeted revenues, taking into account tax collections, probable economic growth, anticipated federal fund receipts, and expected growth in wages and salaries.

The new legislation is a win for residents because installing solar panels can save them up to $3,000 a year on energy bills, depending on how big their system is.
In addition to saving you money, solar panels are more environmentally friendly because they don't run on dirty energy sources that warm the planet and intensify extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts.","A new law in Texas is making it easier and faster for its residents to install solar panels on their homes. According to Environment Texas, while Texas ranks third in the country for solar power, it's only ""20th for per capita small-scale solar."" That's due to a lack of incentives.

The Senate Bill 1202 allows for faster permitting, enabling third-party professionals to conduct reviews to avoid delays. Once a third party submits the approvals, construction can begin right away. Standards, laws, and rules must be posted for transparency. Additionally, the reviewers are the ones who are accountable for negligence, not the government.

If you're looking for installers in your area, EnergySage has a handy tool you can use to search for them, like you do flight deals and compare prices.

Environment Texas highlighted an analysis done by Brown University's Climate Solutions Lab, which shows that having third parties use permitting software ""could reduce the cost of rooftop solar systems in the state by $2,100 in 2030 and $4,900 by 2040.""

Environment Texas Executive Director Luke Metzger said, ""When it comes to Texas's solar energy potential, the sky's the limit.""

He added, ""Our state's energy security and independence can grow to new heights.""

The new legislation is a win for residents because installing solar panels can save them up to $3,000 a year on energy bills, depending on how big their system is.

EnergySage is also an excellent resource for tapping into these savings by making the process easy. The energy company can also help you save up to $10,000 on installation costs.

Additionally, EnergySage has a helpful mapping tool that shows what solar costs in each state, and the incentives that are available in your area.

To really lower your utility bills, you can install heat pumps with your solar.

Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.
A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON D.C., DC — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

The Pumphouse property is reportedly owned by Xcel, and a Colorado Parks & Wildlife spokesperson said CPW owns the parking lot and boat ramp.
Aside from the eventual transfer of the three assets, the county commissioners remain opposed to the current financial compensation package proposed in the Just Transition Solicitation.
“We have serious concerns that the outcome will fall short of meeting the needs of Routt County residents,” Macys said.
The PUC recently completed deliberations for the first phase of the Xcel Energy Just Transition Solicitation Electric Resource Plan Phase 1 that included a proposal for how much energy Xcel will need to build or acquire to serve its customers through the next five years.","The Colorado Public Utilities Commission has verbally ordered Xcel Energy to eventually transfer ownership of three physical assets to Routt County governments, according to a statement from county commissioners.

“While we are disappointed with the PUC’s approach to several key aspects of the transition, we do expect the final order to include some positive outcomes,” stated Sonja Macys, chair of the county commissioners. “These include the preservation and dedication of assets that benefit the broader community, such as the rail spur, water rights and the Pumphouse property, an important access point for residents and visitors to the Yampa River.”

The rail spur that leads to the Hayden Generating Station — stopping and looping through Xcel property — would be transferred after it is no longer in use by Xcel, Hayden Town Manager Mathew Mendisco said. The town manager discussed the status of the Just Transition program, designed to support communities where coal plants are retiring, during a Sept. 4 Hayden Town Council meeting with county commissioners Macys and Tim Redmond in attendance.

The Pumphouse property is reportedly owned by Xcel, and a Colorado Parks & Wildlife spokesperson said CPW owns the parking lot and boat ramp.

The water rights transfer is expected to happen after 2050. That timing is due to a change in state law approved in May 2024. While current Colorado law stipulates that a water right can be considered abandoned after 10 years of nonuse, Senate Bill 24-197 changed the law in the specific case of electric utilities that own a water right in state water Division 6, including the Hayden Station, to allow the plant to keep its water rights through 2050.

“The conditional water right may be used to support a specific project or potential future generation technologies or concepts that have the potential to advance progress toward Colorado’s clean energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals,” according to SB 24-197.

Aside from the eventual transfer of the three assets, the county commissioners remain opposed to the current financial compensation package proposed in the Just Transition Solicitation. Xcel Energy previously agreed during an Electric Resource Plan process conducted in 2021 to six years of property tax replacement after coal operations are retired, while Routt County and Hayden leaders in April asked for a larger contribution of 10 years of financial support calculated at $89 million.

“We are extremely disappointed that the PUC did not seriously consider the request that we made for 10 years of replacement property tax revenue,” Macys said in an email Friday.

Coal-fired operations at Hayden Station are set to retire by the end of 2028, and discussions continue as to what type of energy generation may happen on the site after 2028.

Mendisco said the PUC maintaining the six years of property-tax financial compensation agreement was “really, really unfortunate news.”

“If the PUC sticks to the six years with no economic adjustments as proposed by Routt County governments, we plan to file an official appeal to the PUC to ask them to re-look at the issues,” Mendisco said Wednesday.

Mendisco said taxing districts in western Routt County for fire, library, school and cemetery services “will be the most impacted by this poor decision the PUC has contemplated making.”

“West Routt County has roughly a population of 2,800 people if you include everyone in Hayden and the unincorporated areas,” Mendisco said. “The PUC seems to think that other communities around the state, such as Pueblo and Craig, should receive 10 years of property-tax backfill, except the smallest area in the state that has the fewest resources to transition, which is Hayden/West Routt County.”

“The Just Transition Office, Colorado Energy Office and Consumer Advocacy Office all testified that Hayden/Routt County should be treated equally; indications from the PUC would say otherwise,” Mendisco said. “The town of Hayden feels the PUC was directed by the state through the Just Transition legislation to make this a fair and just process. Anything that is short of what others around the state are receiving is simply wrong, and certainly not ‘just.'”

Mendisco said the town “will continue to strive to mitigate the loss of Hayden Station through economic development efforts.”

PUC Spokesperson Megan Castle said the final written decision is expected “in the coming weeks now that deliberations are complete.” Castle said interested individuals can listen to the state commission deliberations on the Just Transition Solicitation process on the PUC YouTube page at https://tinyurl.com/daac5vz7 .

“We have serious concerns that the outcome will fall short of meeting the needs of Routt County residents,” Macys said. “We believe this limited focus does not adequately reflect the intent, or potentially the mandate, outlined by the state legislature in 19-1314, which established a ‘moral commitment to assist the workers and communities that have powered Colorado for generations’ by supporting ‘a just and inclusive transition’ away from coal.”

The county commissioners’ statement this week reiterated that the current level of funding offered “would have significant negative consequences for Routt County, the town of Hayden and numerous special districts, including fire protection, school districts, libraries and cemeteries.”

“We will continue to review and assess the final order once issued and remain committed to advocating for a truly just transition that fully supports our community, local governments and special districts during this critical period of economic transformation,” according to the county commissioners’ statement.

What's happening?

In September 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice to Volkswagen for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.

The EPA accused Volkswagen of intentionally installing software in models manufactured between 2009 and 2015, ""defeat devices"" designed to conceal emissions of nitrous oxides ""up to 40 times"" above existing federal standards.

Ultimately, Volkswagen and the EPA reached a settlement that required the automaker to create a $2.7 billion mitigation trust fund. Florida received $166 million, funds invested in electric buses for schools and public transit.

The Miami Herald reported that $41 million of those funds had yet to be spent, and that an August draft proposal from the FDEP indicated the agency intended to divert tens of millions to ""'new diesel' and compressed natural gas.""

Citing ""equipment supply challenges"" and ""shifts in federal incentive structures"" among other factors, the FDEP proposed a cessation in funding electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) in favor of investing in ""new clean diesel and compressed natural gas replacements.""

Why are energy experts objecting to the proposal?

Anne Blair, the Electrification Coalition's vice president of policy and freight, talked to the Herald about what the FDEP's proposal entailed.

Blair cut to the chase, explaining that the ""alternative fuels"" outlined in the draft ""aren't nearly as clean as electrification."" She acknowledged they could reduce emissions to a degree, but unlike electric vehicles, the proposed alternatives weren't ""emissions-free.""

Energy sciences expert Kevin Lofgren works with biofuels, and he emphasized that biodiesel and renewable diesel are not interchangeable, as they have different qualities and impacts.

Lofgren explained that the production of renewable diesel can result in carbon dioxide emissions, and he referred to the process as ""energy-exhaustive."" Lofgren characterized renewable diesel as a form of greenwashing.

""Renewable diesel is a little bit of a greenwash scam. It's great for business, not necessarily great for the environment. The temperatures and the pressures it takes to make this stuff is really extreme,"" Lofgren said.

""As much as I wish that these things were just God's gift to mankind, they aren't, and they do have their downsides,"" he lamented.

Florida's swift turn away from clean energy wasn't entirely surprising: In March, the Tampa Bay Times speculated that the federal government might ""claw back"" the state's mitigation funds.

What can be done about it?

As the Miami Herald noted, the FDEP's plan was a draft proposal.

The outlet indicated that a public comment window closed on September 19, before the article was published.

Beyond data centres: The ESG challenge For automakers, that means sustainability will soon be measured not just at the tailpipe, but also in the cloud.
The cleaner the cloud, the greener the vehicle.","As the auto industry accelerates towards electrification and software-defined vehicles (SDVs), a new sustainability dilemma is emerging: the hidden energy footprint of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

From the sprawling data centres powering connected mobility to the chips embedded inside vehicles, AI is fast becoming the next climate paradox. Are automakers truly steering towards sustainability, or is the horsepower of AI quietly heating the planet?

Cloud dependency and energy demand

Today, much of the AI mobility stack from connected services to data-driven R&D relies heavily on external cloud and data centre infrastructure. High-volume model training, fleet management and large-scale data ingestion often take place off-vehicle.

Advt

“Core tasks like deep learning model training, simulation, HD map updates and remote diagnostics are typically performed in remote cloud/data centres rather than solely on vehicles or at the edge,” explains Jay Shah, Global COE Head - Data Science, Tata Technologies.

Shifting intelligence to the edge

To mitigate this footprint, he says both automakers and their cloud partners are increasingly sourcing 100% renewable energy for data centres. Edge computing, too, is gaining traction, shifting more analytics and inference tasks directly into the vehicle.

Processing data locally reduces latency and carbon footprint, while cutting down energy-intensive round-trips to the cloud. Moreover, OEMs are deploying AI-based systems that use sensor arrays and predictive algorithms to dynamically adjust cooling intensity based on real-time thermal loads, driving style, and weather conditions.

The efficiency paradox

Still, the paradox persists. “AI and autonomous technologies inherently increase energy consumption, especially due to large-scale data processing and connectivity requirements,” says Rajeev Ralhan, Partner and Leader, Decarbonisation, PwC India.

Yet, they also unlock profound capabilities for efficiency, optimisation, and emission reduction throughout the value chain. “AI, when incorporated into vehicle platforms, manufacturing processes, and grid management, can substantially reduce wasted energy and enhance resource use,” he adds.

Ralhan explains how state-of-the-art AI applications from predictive energy management to real-time carbon tracking and dynamic load balancing enable precise allocation of energy and curtail unnecessary consumption. This often results in significant operational cost savings and energy reductions in manufacturing scenarios.

Advt

According to him, AI-enabled manufacturing achieves significant reductions in energy consumption, substantial decreases in waste, and improved resource use across the supply chain, directly reducing the carbon footprint of automotive operations.

“Digital twins help optimise designs and manufacturing workflows for minimal material and energy use, enabling lifecycle assessments, recycling potential, and circular economy innovations through every stage,” he says.

Research flags rising energy use

A study by the University of Michigan suggests that connected and autonomous vehicles may increase primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 3–20 per cent compared to conventional vehicles. This rise is attributed mainly to the energy demands of AI systems, sensors, and data networks.

“To counterbalance these impacts, drivetrains must transition to electric — given their superior energy efficiency compared to internal combustion engines — and that the electricity powering them increasingly comes from clean, renewable sources,” says Charith Konda, Energy Specialist, IEEFA (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis).

He adds that tech-infused driving assistance systems, available in connected and electric vehicles, can facilitate eco-driving and reduce energy consumption. In his view, regulators are primarily focused on ensuring human safety and cybersecurity in the context of connected and autonomous mobility. The good news is that the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles is accelerating across many regions, which should help alleviate concerns about rising energy use to some extent.

Regulations are catching-up

Emerging regulations like the EU AI Act already mandate environmental impact assessments for AI systems, requiring transparency and risk management throughout AI lifecycles. Future frameworks will likely require companies to measure and report carbon emissions, pushing responsible AI development, efficient algorithms, and renewable energy use in data centres and vehicles.

This will mirror current automotive standards for emissions and safety, thereby ensuring sustainable AI innovation in mobility. “Regulators are expected to increasingly scrutinise AI’s environmental footprint in mobility, similar to emissions and safety,” says Shah.

Beyond data centres: The ESG challenge

For automakers, that means sustainability will soon be measured not just at the tailpipe, but also in the cloud. “It is still early, but regulators are beginning to recognise AI’s indirect environmental costs like energy-hungry data centres and compute requirements,” adds Ankita Sabharwal, Head of Data Privacy, Chadha and Chadha.

“We may not see rules as structured as emissions and safety standards right away, it is realistic to expect disclosures, reporting requirements, or sustainability guidelines around AI in mobility within the next few years, especially as governments push broader climate goals,” she says.

Studies show that high-intensity AI activities, such as those required for autonomous vehicles, connected mobility, and smart city applications, are associated with significant added CO₂ emissions. Concerns about the “hidden” footprint from rare earth minerals in chips to upstream energy use for cloud-based AI modelling are prompting calls for regulation similar to existing standards on vehicle emissions and safety.

According to Ralhan, the pace of AI adoption in transport could amplify these impacts unless monitored and balanced with sustainability targets. Governments and organisations are putting environmental practices of tech and automotive companies under closer inspection.

“ESG frameworks now increasingly call for transparent reporting not just of tailpipe or manufacturing emissions, but technology-enabled footprints - including data centre usage and AI-driven operational impacts,” he points out.

The future impact of AI on the environment hinges on robust strategies integrating AI with clean energy, hardware innovation, carbon accounting, and regulatory frameworks. With conscious design, AI will drive transformative sustainability, outweigh its own environmental footprint and catalyse the automotive sector’s transition to net zero.

The road ahead is clear. The cleaner the cloud, the greener the vehicle.

On Sept. 9, the Hernando County Board of County Commissioners discussed several projects to submit to seek state funding for during the next legislative session.

Request: Fire Station to Serve Weeki Wachee Area

Public Information Officer Dominique Holmes began her presentation with a proposed request for a new fire station along US 19 at Atlanta Avenue. Population density in the Weeki Wachee area has increased and additional home construction warrants a need for a fire station that will meet the needs of the community without reducing the effectiveness or response time of existing fire and EMS locations. The proposed funding is $8 million, and Hernando County would pay $3 million of that cost.

Commissioner Champion challenged the $8 million cost as being too cost-prohibitive when the state is trying to be fiscally responsible.

Request: Public Safety Training Center

The second proposal was a training center for the county’s public safety departments, not just fire safety and EMS personnel, but the sheriff’s office as well. A similar request has been made annually since 2012.

The cost for just the first phase of the facility is approximately $8 million, with Hernando County providing just over $1 million for the project. With 60 acres available, a local training center would resolve several issues: personnel could remain available for emergency situations, reduce the current scheduling conflicts that occur between multiple agencies and counties, and would provide sufficient and varied training environments.

Though located in Hernando County, this training center would be available for use by agencies across the state as well. A critical aspect is the benefit of providing continuing education, increasing the requisite skills for these departments’ effectiveness during emergencies or critical situations such as natural disasters.

Commissioner Champion said Governor DeSantis vetoed this request during last year’s legislative session. He also reminded the board that the item is being put on a referendum.

Request: Waterways/Multi-Agency Building

Ms. Holmes addressed the third item: a building to accommodate the three agencies which need access to Hernando County’s marine waterways. The beneficiaries of an updated building are the Waterways Division of the Parks and Recreation Department, Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the HCSO Marine Unit.

While the county has such a building, it was built 65 years ago. Two recent storms revealed how susceptible it was to natural disasters. It sustained significant but repairable damage from Hurricane Idalia in 2023. In 2024, however, Hurricane Helene’s 5-foot storm surge damaged the concrete block structure, an out-building and fencing beyond repair. Everything must be demolished on that property, and on the adjacent property the county purchased with BOCC approval.

Floodplain maps have changed since the original building was erected and any new building(s) at that site must adhere to the Flood Insurance Rate Maps and current building codes. The proposed office building at the original site will be elevated and ADA accessible. The 4,340 sq. ft.-space will be jointly used by FWC, HCSO’s Marine Unit and the Waterways Division, with maintenance and storage for boats and equipment below the office, at ground level. It will include parking areas for the agencies’ staff and visitors.

Repairing and/or upgrading the existing docks and adding a new dock for the HCSO’s Fire Rescue boat are also part of the proposed project. An additional building for boat storage and unknown future needs is included. New infrastructure will be added for both properties.

The primary beneficiary of the new facilities is the public using the waterways. Emergency services will be able to reach them faster, navigation aids can be repaired quickly, and in the case of severe weather, provide safe harbor.

The cost for this funding request is $3.5 million. The county’s matching portion is approximately $725,000.

Commissioner Champion stated concern that this would not be approved due to the proposed cost.

Request: Taxiway and Infrastructure Project at Brooksville-Tampa Bay Regional Airport

Both Economic Development Director Valerie Pianta and Ms. Holmes discussed this proposal. Mrs. Pianta requested board approval to submit a grant application for funds to construct/resurface a new taxiway from an inactive runway at the Brooksville-Tampa Bay Regional Airport. Current water and sewer infrastructure would be extended across the infield area. Opening hundreds of unused acres is designed to attract additional industry in both aviation and non-aviation fields.

Pem-Air Turbine Engin Services, LLC and Judah 1, Inc. have pledged to both provide funding and create new jobs by either expanding their existing facilities or constructing additional ones. Combined, their financial contributions will be significant. The higher-wage jobs the companies will provide are even more beneficial.

The project cost is estimated at $17 million. Between the EDA Disaster Supplemental Grant funds and FDOT Aviation Grant Program funds total of $13.6 million, the county match would be $1.6 million. Ms. Holmes stated the county could request $1 million from the state’s legislature, reducing the county’s matching funds to just $600,000.

Request: Hermosa Lift Station Upgrade

There are six wastewater lift stations that feed into the Hermosa lift station, which forwards the wastewater to the Hernando County Airport Water Reclamation Facility. The Hernando Beach area continues to see growth and the Hermosa lift station was not engineered to handle the amount of wastewater that flows through it.

The lift station is older and the control system as well as the electrical system are at risk due to equipment stress, potential overflows and other issues. An engineering analysis also recommended the lift’s electrical panels should be elevated.

There are several factors being considered such as public health hazards from overflows or flooding, potential system failures and future wastewater needs. Protecting Weeki Wachee Springs by preventing nitrogen seepage to the aquifer is also of serious concern.

The design phase is still in progress, Ms. Holmes said. The funding request is $3.4 million, with the county match of $850,000.

Request: Septic-to-Sewer Conversion – District A Phase 2

The Weeki Wachee Springs area is under the protection of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). One reason water quality is impaired is high nitrate levels from wastewater and agricultural runoff. This can cause algal growth, reduce water clarity and damage the springs ecosystem.

Hernando County participates in a Basin Management Action Plan (BMAP) to help improve water quality by reducing the amount of nitrogen that enters the groundwater. One way to do this is to convert homes from using septic systems and connecting them to the sewer system. Phase 1 conversion is in progress.

Phase 2 builds on this and will include approximately 350 properties. The property locations are even closer to the Springs than Phase 1. The goal is to improve the Springs water quality by reducing even more nitrogen in the water. A secondary benefit is having more reclaimed water.

The funding request for Phase 2 is $26 million. The county’s cost would be $1.8 million.",https://www.hernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tingey-injury-law-firm-yCdPU73kGSc-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 05:59:03.386467

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., visited Woodstock Soapstone to raise awareness about those impacted by tariffs.
The cost increases aren’t life-threatening for Woodstock Soapstone, which has no debt and owns its property, tools and supplies, Morrissey said.","WEST LEBANON — As the burden of tariffs and expiring tax credits begins to weigh on the only woodstove manufacturer in New Hampshire, the company has begun downsizing.

“What you do if you’re in business and you’re dealing with tremendous uncertainty is that you contract,” said Tom Morrissey, the president of Woodstock Soapstove in Lebanon.

Five of the firm’s 25 manufacturing positions have been left unfilled in recent months, said Morrissey, who has been with the company for all of its 47 years.

The company is also reducing inventory, decreasing the number of models in production and increasing lines of credit, General Manager Lorin Day said.

The stove manufacturer recently had to pay $40,000 in tariffs on a shipment of material for which they would have paid just a couple hundred dollars in the past, Morrissey said.

“We’re just like a little acorn in this hurricane,” Morrissey said.

Any steel and aluminum materials coming from outside the U.S. are now tariffed at 50%, including the steel and cast iron that Woodstock Soapstone uses to make its stoves.

The company at one point got its cast iron from Randolph-based Vermont Castings, which stopped supplying it to Woodstock Soapstone’s specifications. Their cast iron now comes from a foundry in Spain.

And while most of its steel is North American, some of it comes from Canada, which is subject to tariffs, Morrissey said.

There’s also uncertainty about whether the soapstone — a naturally occurring rock — will be tariffed, as it comes from Canada, but isn’t produced in the U.S., Morrissey said.

Morrissey said he expects the tariffs to raise retail prices of his stoves by around 12% to 15%. This will begin in the next seven to 10 days, Day said.

As a small business that sells directly to “working class” customers mostly, Woodstock Soapstone is at a disadvantage to larger manufacturers that have more leeway on prices, Morrissey said.

And while the increase will have to happen soon, the company has been holding it off, Morrissey said. It hasn’t started shipping products built from the tariffed goods, using more of their reserve supplies as they try to “put off the pain as long as (they) can,” Morrissey said.

“It’s essentially an unexpected unilateral tax on materials that we buy from outside the United States — that we can’t get from the United States,” Morrissey said.

The manufacturer requires a certain grade and format of metal that is not available in the United States, Day said.

For example, the business buys some steel from China, which is not produced well domestically, for a specialty part that reburns smoke.

“I can show you what you can get in the United States, but you’d be disgusted,” Morrissey said.

In addition to the raised tariffs, the federal tax credit on wood heaters is set to expire at the end of December, instead of 2032, as previously set. This credit reduces the price of woodstoves approved by the Environmental Protection Agency by 30%.

Morrissey said he expects the surge in orders to increase as more people learn that the credits are ending. This will help in the near future, but hurt sales long term.

It will also strain the company’s ability to build enough stoves on time, he said.

The strain is worsened by bureaucratic red tape. For example, Woodstock Soapstone has been awaiting the EPA’s approval of a new stove model since April.

There are currently $300,000 to $400,000 in orders that can’t be fulfilled because of the lack of approval, Morrissey said.

In the past, a phone call to EPA administrators could have resolved the issue in a matter of days, Morrissey said. But he hasn’t been able to reach anyone in the agency for the last five months, he said.

A spokesperson for the EPA wrote in an email that the processing time for new certifications have been “longer than usual” due to “resource issues and the need to prioritize renewals of expiring certifications.”

The spokesperson also wrote that Woodstock Soapstone’s new model is scheduled for a detailed review starting on Sep. 29.

But at a certain point, Morrissey has to tell customers that he’s “not sure I’ll be able to fulfill their orders,” he said.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., visited Woodstock Soapstone to raise awareness about those impacted by tariffs.

“The only thing that’s going to move this administration is when they hear from businesses (and) consumers that they’re being hit by these tariffs in a way that makes it hard to do business,” she said.

In January, Shaheen introduced Senate Bill 151, which seeks to deny tariffs imposed through the act that the Trump administration used on metal imports. The bill was blocked by Republican senators, but she has continued to push the issue.

“We need to continue to bang that drum so that people make the connection between the tariffs and what they’re seeing in their pocketbooks – and what small businesses, in particular — are seeing with the impact of tariffs,” she said.

The cost increases aren’t life-threatening for Woodstock Soapstone, which has no debt and owns its property, tools and supplies, Morrissey said.

But as Woodstock Soapstone braces for the near future, it is beginning to look into other markets that aren’t regulated by the government, such as furniture — which can be built in their shop, Morrissey said.",https://i0.wp.com/vnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250924-vn-shaheen-jmp-177-copy.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:16.509028

When it argued that climate models erroneously predicted warming trends, drought and melting ice, it cited the DOE report.","Wright, who rose to prominence and wealth as a fossil fuel executive, has pushed the idea that dissenting views are unwelcome in climate science.

""We want to have a real debate and discussion about climate change, and get away from the cancel culture,” he said on CNN after the report was released.

So when Wright was looking for authors to write the report, he made a list of 12 “honest, true scientists,” he told The Wall Street Journal.

The DOE report, written by a small group of high-profile climate contrarians, stands in stark contrast to decades of assessments published by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s preeminent authority on research into the planet’s warming.

The DOE launched its science review in March and published the findings just four months later, after a secretive process that drew a sharp rebuke from a federal judge. DOE disbanded the group, but the authors pledged to advance their work outside of government. At the IPCC, scientists are nominated and vetted for their expertise and spend years reviewing hundreds of studies to evaluate their strengths and look for trends. One section of the IPCC report alone, on climate impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities, had more than 270 reviewers, 34,000 citations and received more than 62,000 comments.

Contrary to Wright’s assertions that divergent voices are pushed out of the scientific process, experts said, scientific papers that disagree often receive more attention and discussion from reviewers.

Wright’s claim that dissenting views are silenced is “at best preposterous and arrogant and at worst a deliberate ruse to undermine decades of rigorous science,” said Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at the National Scientific Research Institute of France who served as a coordinating author for the IPCC.

“I personally believe this is a deliberate attempt to sabotage real science and replace it with unfounded and dangerous ideology,” Parmesan wrote in an email.

Some of the discrepancies are semantic. Climate scientists are reluctant to declare a trend, for instance, unless they have decades of data to back it up.

In the case of hurricanes, the best data extends only to around 1980, when satellites began comprehensively tracking storms as they crossed oceans. Curry, one of the DOE report authors, says that timeline is “not good enough to discern a meaningful trend.”

But a large majority of scientists disagree, arguing that the data shows rising dangers.

The percentage of intense hurricanes has likely grown compared to the overall share of storms, said Jim Kossin, a prominent hurricane researcher and a retired NOAA atmospheric scientist who served as a lead author for the IPCC.

He said the DOE report “is clearly designed to mislead the audience into believing that there are no trends.”

There’s another problem: Scientists have not predicted that climate change would lead to more hurricanes, as DOE suggests. Instead, they have found that hurricanes are intensifying and dropping more rain.

The lack of discussion in the DOE report about water — not wind speed — being the biggest danger from hurricanes is “a dead giveaway” that the report authors had downplayed the climate risks, said Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The DOE report’s focus on the hottest daytime summer temperatures is misleading. The 1930s were unusual because of the Dust Bowl, a period of intense drought and high heat across parts of the central and southern U.S., exacerbated by severe soil erosion caused by unsustainable farming practices of the time. Many temperature records at locations in the region did topple nearly a century ago — but most scientists say it was a statistical outlier that skewed heat trends for decades afterward.

“It was hot in the 1930s, yes! But that does not undermine the rising trend in extreme heat over the past few decades and the associated societal consequences,” said Deepti Singh, a climate scientist at Washington State University Vancouver.

It’s true that some areas of the central and southern U.S. haven’t seen an increase in daytime summer temperatures, a pattern known as the “U.S. warming hole.” Scientists believe many factors are at play, including the Dust Bowl’s statistical legacy. But outside the warming hole, the U.S. is seeing increases in extreme summer heat.

All kinds of other highs are also rising in the U.S., including maximum temperatures over the entire year, winter temperatures, and nighttime summer temperatures.

Researchers are aware that not all regions of the country are warming evenly. But there’s a clear upward pattern. One regional anomaly doesn’t change that fact.

The DOE report relies on studies or reports that have sometimes been amplified by the fossil fuel industry, or are connected to conservative groups that oppose government efforts to address climate change.

For example, the report cites a blog post that DOE report author Roy Spencer wrote about “faulty” climate models. He wrote the post for the Heritage Foundation, the same organization that produced the Project 2025 playbook that called for jettisoning climate policy and defunding science.

Spencer argued in his writing that climate models are biased and show no meaningful warming trends. He urged policymakers to “proceed cautiously and not allow themselves to be influenced by exaggerated claims based on demonstrably faulty climate models.”

But his assertions about the models’ track record are false. Climate models in the 1970s accurately predicted current global warming. And peer-reviewed assessments of models since then have shown that they generally performed well.

“This notion that there's a fundamental disconnect between simulations and observations is incorrect,” said Ben Santer, a former climate scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “The DOE report also cherry picks in terms of which model simulations and which observations they show.”

The Heritage piece is one example of some of the DOE authors’ current and past affiliations with conservative groups that have tried for years to undermine climate regulations placed on polluting industries.

“Any current or past affiliations with other organizations do not define any of our perspectives on climate science,” said Curry, a climatologist and professor emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She added, “The policy preferences of these organizations are not relevant in any way to our perspectives on the science.”

Other than Koonin, who worked as chief scientist for BP, the authors’ actual research has not been directly funded by the fossil fuel industry. But some of them have been paid by industry groups and conservative think tanks to opine on how their findings raise questions about mainstream science.

Spencer, a researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has held roles at the Heritage Foundation and the Heartland Institute. Both groups promote climate misinformation and have pushed to eliminate fossil fuel regulations. They have received funding from foundations linked to Exxon Mobil and Shell, and the Koch brothers network.

Koonin is a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, whose scholars have downplayed climate science and argued against regulations.

McKitrick, an economist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, is also listed as a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, a right-wing think tank in Canada that is critical of climate policy. Fraser has received funding from the Koch brothers network, Exxon and foundations that oppose regulations.

The DOE report amplifies supposed conflicts among climate scientists — even when there isn’t any.

For example, it’s not true that there is “substantial debate” within climate science over whether the sun could be a primary driver of global warming.

But the DOE report makes that claim nevertheless. The idea has been pushed for years by Willie Soon, a researcher favored by industry groups and promoted by Republican lawmakers.

There’s no dispute among scientists that the sun affects the Earth’s climate. But the idea that it’s responsible for the warming observed over the last 50 years is “considered scientifically invalid,” said Theodosios Chatzistergos, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany.

Curry said the DOE authors were planning to “modify some of the text” because the group did not have time to review all the references on the topic.

The DOE report was released on the same day in July that the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding the so-called endangerment finding, which gives the agency its legal authority to reduce climate pollution from sources like power plants and cars.

EPA pointed to the DOE report as evidence that climate risks have been overblown. When EPA asserted that hurricanes, floods and wildfires have not gotten worse, it cited the DOE report. When it argued that climate models erroneously predicted warming trends, drought and melting ice, it cited the DOE report. And when it claimed it’s overly difficult to attribute rising temperatures to human activity, it cited the DOE report.

It was a clear example of how the Trump administration will use the findings of a few researchers to cast doubt on the vast scientific consensus that rising temperatures pose a danger to humans — a determination that has led many governments around the world to impose measures for confronting the peril.

Curry said it was the authors’ hope that the report would be published on its own, but DOE and EPA instead “elected to publish this at the same time as the filing on the Endangerment issue.”

Altogether, EPA pointed to the report 16 times in its bid to roll back climate regulations — a move that drew criticism from a federal judge in Massachusetts. The judge allowed the citations to stand but rebuked DOE for describing the report as a scientific exercise, when he said it was overtly political.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

“As we come around on this one-year anniversary of Helene that our jobs are really important to giving security back to people during storms,” Brooks said.

Duke Energy is preparing thousands of line and tree workers that can easily be shifted ahead of the storm or after the storm has passed.

“With this particular storm, even if it doesn’t make landfall the significant amount of rain along with the wind gusts could definitely create outage scenarios at least in our coastal areas potentially inland,” Brooks said.

Over the past few years, Duke Energy has learned from each storm and upgraded software that has helped avoid roughly a million outages just last year.

“We’ve added upgraded poles and wires to strengthen the grid against severe weather, we’ve added self-healing technology that can automatically detect a power outage and reroute service to restore service faster,” Brooks said.

It’s not just crews who should be getting prepared; at home, residents can put together a “go bag” with important documents.

The pressure to reduce emissions has not decreased, and the new network could be an essential component of the United States’ energy portfolio in the future.

Turning ambitious plans into reality as the vision for clean energy takes shape

The plan is bold yet simple. Establish hydrogen stations that pump globally: this will create a network of hubs established with highways, ports, factories, etc. Not only concerns powering trucks, but also the aim is to ensure that hydrogen becomes a clean, flexible fuel for industries that are hard to electrify.

Financial assistance and incentives in promoting the development of this gas are provided by the government. Efforts like the Clean Hydrogen Hubs of the Department of Energy aim at having areas cooperate, helping make sure the necessary infrastructure is established, and more clean hydrogen is produced to be consumed in the nation.

Building a low-emission future one hydrogen hub at a time

The significant hydrogen hub is being installed and is part of a $7 billion program taking roughly $1 billion. States like Texas, California, the Midwest, and the Gulf Coast will have an advantage. The investment will be used to aid in producing, storing, delivering, and fueling this natural gas to trucks and to the general public transportation system.

The ARCHES project, being located in California, receives up to $1.2 1.2billion of federal funds, along with community and individual investments, to construct clean hydrogen infrastructure in the state. It aims at making hydrogen a viable transportation and industrial fuel with no emissions.

Understanding the project’s plans, schedule, and important checkpoints

Officials want to shift the hydrogen hub locations from the planning phase to the construction phase. The success will be measured in terms of the number of fueling stations constructed, the amount of gas generated, emissions minimized, expenses controlled, and employment opportunities generated, just like this unexpected underground discovery changing everything we’ve known.

Several hubs have already entered into preliminary deals, and production and distribution will grow in a slow process.

Overcoming obstacles and concerns as the project moves toward its goals

The manufacture of clean hydrogen is expensive. Green and blue hydrogen have challenges in terms of finances and scale. Construction of pipelines, storage facilities, and fueling stations is attended to with permits and safety checks, and it is feared that the network can always serve the long-haul routes. The activists of environmental justice require more openness and improved security. Other projects involve natural gas mixed with carbon capture, and opponents do not note that this would leave fossil fuel infrastructure alive.

The people in the local communities are concerned about the emissions, the risks to their health, and whether these projects will have fair benefits for them. The proponents argue that hydrogen expansion will create thousands of new jobs and clean the air in the industrial regions, as well as enhance U.S. opportunities to achieve the 2030 and 2050 climate objectives.

These are advantages that point to economic and environmental benefits. With this project, it will not only be fueling stations, but also a new energy highway. It will only succeed as an expensive experiment or become an essential component of a low-carbon future of America if it is carefully planned and implemented.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1001350099.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 01:59:47.163801

As part of this strategy, the company has approved a US$14 billion investment to expand the Port Arthur LNG project in Texas. In addition, it announced the sale of 45% of its stake in Sempra Infrastructure Partners.

Business restructuring through divestments

As part of its capital recycling program, Sempra has agreed to sell 45% of Sempra Infrastructure Partners to affiliates of KKR and CPP Investments. This transaction, valued at US$10 billion, allows the company to strengthen its balance sheet, reduce exposure to unregulated businesses and focus its efforts on earnings growth within the U.S. regulatory framework.

The deal, which could close between the second and third quarters of 2026, projects an average accretion of $0.20 in earnings per share between 2027 and 2031. In addition, Sempra holds a 25% stake, while ADIA retains the remaining 10%. With this structure, the KKR-led consortium becomes the new majority shareholder.

Port Arthur LNG Phase 2: key expansion for global market

In parallel, Sempra Infrastructure Partners has made the final investment decision to develop Phase 2 of the Port Arthur LNG project. Phase 2 of the Port Arthur LNG projectproject, located in Jefferson County, Texas. This phase includes the construction of two liquefaction trains trains, a new storage tank and other associated facilities, with an estimated capacity of 13 million tons per year.

The project is financially backed by Blackstone, KKR, Apollo and Goldman Sachs Alternatives, which have acquired a 49.9% stake. Sempra retains control with a 50.1% stake. Engineering and construction will be carried out by Bechtel Energy, with operations scheduled to begin in 2030 and 2031.

The 20-year sale and purchase agreements have already been signed with key players such as ConocoPhillips such as ConocoPhillips, JERA and EQT, which consolidates the profitability and long-term viability of the project.

Financial impact and growth projections

With these decisions, Sempra improves its credit profile and eliminates the need to issue shares under its 2025-2029 capital plan. The company projects a compound annual earnings per share growth rate of 7% to 9% for that period, reflecting a strategy focused on generating sustainable value for shareholders and customers.

The capital plan update will be filed in the fourth quarter of 2026, upon completion of the rate review at Oncor, another of Sempra’s regulated subsidiaries.

New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has announced that Pacific Fusion, a commercial fusion energy company, has selected New Mexico as the site for its first Research and Manufacturing Campus.

The $1 billion facility at Mesa del Sol positions New Mexico at the forefront of the emerging fusion energy industry and cement its role as a national leader in advanced energy innovation. Fusion, the same process that powers the sun and stars, has long been considered the holy grail of clean safe energy, and with the potential to generate near-limitless on-demand power.

“Pacific Fusion’s decision to build in New Mexico proves that our state can compete—and win in the race to attract the most innovative companies in the world,” Lujan Grisham said. “This project will create good jobs, expand our clean-tech economy, and ensure New Mexico continues to lead in the industries of the future.”

Pacific Fusion will build a state-of-the-art research and manufacturing facility, housing its Demonstration System, which is designed to achieve net facility gain—producing more energy from a fusion reaction than the total energy used – by 2030. Reaching this milestone would mark a historic breakthrough toward commercial fusion power. future,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said. “Today is proof of the assertion that we have passed a turning point—that our city is not only on the map, but can define the next chapter of clean-energy innovation.”

Pacific Fusion was founded in 2023 to deliver affordable fusion energy. Its technology builds on New Mexico’s legacy of applied physics and clean-energy innovation, including decades of research at Sandia National Laboratories, home to some of the world’s leading fusion experiments. In addition to its historic leadership in applied physics and energy innovation, New Mexico offers a growing clean-tech ecosystem and a workforce that aligns with Pacific Fusion’s future hiring needs.

“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, co-founder and chief technology officer of Pacific Fusion. “Working alongside the Governor’s office, the Economic Development Department, the City of Albuquerque, key legislators from both parties, and the national labs, we’ve built true partnerships over the past several months. That collaboration gives us confidence that together we’ll be able to move quickly to deliver on the promise of low-cost fusion power.”

Upon finalization, the project will bring more than 200 long-term jobs to the state, along with hundreds more construction jobs, workforce development programs, and regional economic activity. It is an anchor investment for a broader fusion ecosystem in New Mexico. “This is a groundbreaking project that puts New Mexico at the forefront of fusion energy,” said Economic Development Department Cabinet Secretary Rob Black. “Welcoming a world-class company like this into our state opens the door to an entirely new era of clean energy innovation. It means thousands of potential future jobs, a new supply chain, and the opportunity to cement our state’s leadership in clean technology for decades to come.”

Power the Future is a nonprofit dedicated to Americans who work in reliable energy sources.

Behrens told The Center Square that the Department of Energy’s action “is a welcome step toward restoring accountability and letting free markets – not bureaucrats – determine our energy future.”

“The American people made it crystal clear at the ballot box that they don’t want another taxpayer dollar wastefully spent on green scam pet projects,” Behrens said.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Heritage Foundation told The Center Square that with the return of $13 billion, “the deficit will be lower than otherwise.”

When asked what other actions the Department of Energy should take to end wasteful spending, Furchtgott-Roth said that “the Department should comb through its budget and see what projects can be accomplished by the private sector, then end those projects.”

“The Department should also look through its regulations and see which ones impose costs on businesses and families,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

“For instance, the Department should eliminate appliance regulations that prevent companies from producing the gas stoves, boilers, or water heaters that people want to buy,” Furchtgott Roth said.

The Department of Energy announced Wednesday its “intention to return more than $13 billion in unobligated funds initially appropriated to advance the previous Administration’s wasteful Green New Scam agenda.”

The department said its announcement reflects “the [Trump] Administration’s commitment to halt wasteful spending and refocus the department to its core mission.”

For instance, Trump signed the Working Families Tax Cut into law earlier this year, the release said, which “directed the Energy Department to rein in bloated federal spending and expedite the return of unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury to support hardworking Americans.”

“The Department of Energy is working to advance its critical mission of unleashing affordable, reliable and secure energy for all Americans while increasing efficiency and promoting better stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” the release said.

The Department of Energy has not yet responded to The Center Square’s request for comment.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the news release: “The American people elected President Trump largely because of the last administration’s reckless spending on climate policies that fed inflation and failed to provide any real benefit to the American people.”

“Thanks to President Trump and Congress, those days are over,” Wright said.

Renewable energy group American Council on Renewable Energy has not yet responded to The Center Square’s two requests for comment.

Behrens told The Center Square, “keep in mind it was Biden’s DOE that funneled billions to an electric vehicle charging program that failed to deliver results.”

“Over $6 billion in EV charging funding has now been flagged as wasteful,” Behrens said.

Behrens also referred The Center Square to a White House document entitled “Ending the Green New Scam.”

Furchtgott-Roth informed The Center Square that “in general, states with the most expensive electricity require renewables (with the exception of Alaska), and states with the least expensive electricity do not require renewables.”

“States should prioritize affordable, resilient, reliable energy,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

LIMBONG: So how do you bring the whole world along when the U.S. isn't playing ball?
LIMBONG: Climate action isn't a light switch, right?
LIMBONG: Wopke Hoekstra is the European Union climate commissioner.","ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST:

At the United Nations this week, more than a hundred countries met to discuss commitments to cut pollution by 2035 as part of a global effort to counter climate change. Also at the U.N. this week, President Trump called climate change, quote, the ""greatest con job"" ever perpetrated on the world, and he called green policies a scam. And he said he was worried about Europe. We're joined now by the climate commissioner for the European Union, Wopke Hoekstra. Hi, Commissioner. Welcome.

WOPKE HOEKSTRA: Thank you very much for having me on the show.

LIMBONG: So let's start with some of the new commitments announced earlier this week to cut pollution levels, to address global warming. What stands out to you?

HOEKSTRA: First of all, it is hugely important that the world continues to make this effort because, frankly speaking, this problem is getting worse before it gets better, right? So if you just look at the sheer impact on our economies, on geopolitics, on the ecosystem we live in, the damage simply is huge. It is imperative that the global community, the world together also tries to fix this.

LIMBONG: And so what have you heard this week?

HOEKSTRA: We learned, for example, about the Chinese example, which, in my view, is a step, but at the same time, disappointing in where they land. They're not going to do much more than some 10% reduction by 2035. And given that they are the largest emitter on the planet, responsible for roughly 30% of global emissions, it would have been hugely important for them to take more responsibility, more leadership and do more.

LIMBONG: So Commissioner, help us understand, what are the EU's commitments for 2035?

HOEKSTRA: So our commitment is a range between 66.3- and 72.5% and...

LIMBONG: To reduce emissions.

HOEKSTRA: Of reduced emissions compared to '99, which was our peak here. You always take the peak and then, you know, the percentage that you managed to drive down by 2035. If you were to put into perspective - because I can fully understand that it's hard to assess, is this is good? Is this mediocre? Is this bad? - this will put us at the top or very near the top of the most ambitious. Great Britain is probably going to have a target that is even higher, but we will come as a close second, I think.

LIMBONG: How does President Trump's hostility to climate action impact momentum on the world stage?

HOEKSTRA: I think it is diplomatic to basically refrain from trying to be a pundit and analyze his specific speech. But if I zoom out, what I can tell you is that American leadership matters, and frankly speaking, all matters that we have, whether it's geopolitics, whether it's the economy or whether it's climate, the U.S. simply is the most formidable player across the globe. You are the No. 1 economy, and you are the second largest emitter. So the fact that the U.S. is no longer being part of these conversations is a major blow to international efforts. That's just a reality.

LIMBONG: So how do you bring the whole world along when the U.S. isn't playing ball?

HOEKSTRA: It makes it more complicated, and it makes conversations with China also more complicated. And with all the other large emitters, all the large industrial nations, which we typically call the G20, together responsible for roughly 85% of global emissions, it does do something with the dynamics. At the same time, the problem is not going to go away, right? The ecosystem, the planet doesn't give a damn whether this is easy or difficult. It's simply warming up. And the impact in terms of droughts, wildfires is basically continuing, and that will have increasingly a very, very significant economic cost. So forget about all the lingo about saving the planet. This is an economic reality we need to face.

LIMBONG: Climate action isn't a light switch, right? It's not particularly nimble. Like, businesses have invested, and there are new market realities, but how do you face the big challenges when you have these big swings in American policy?

HOEKSTRA: So the interesting thing is, when I talk to businesses, whether they're from the U.S. or from Europe or wherever, it is crystal clear to them that the future will be decarbonized and that if you don't expose yourself to that economy, you will have a very bad chance of surviving as a company, not in the very short run, but in the longer run for sure. So that is why, in so many industries, CEOs are making sure that they do go into change mode. They might not always use that anymore under the header of climate or of clean, but for many of them, it simply makes business sense to step up.

And the numbers show that they are right. Just to give you one number that I've always found absolutely spectacular, if you look at what happened to the price of solar, that dropped by roughly 95% in terms of cost just in this decade or in this century, so in these 25 years, alone. And the costs are ever further going down. So it is just attractive from a commercial perspective to have exposure to that.

LIMBONG: The EU has made progress in its clean energy transition, but it still imports Russian gas. And I think that reliance is problematic for the bloc's climate and broader policy goals. So how are you working to reconcile this?

HOEKSTRA: We're trying to eradicate that as quickly as we can, Andrew. I just - no doubt about it. We have made a severe mistake years ago to believe that, you know, this dependency was actually OK and that it was with a trustworthy partner. And then the Ukrainians turned out to be at the receiving end of an absolutely illegal, horrible war the Russians have forced upon them. And immediately, when we then started to side with the Ukrainians, the effect was that the Russians were trying to threaten us with this dependency. So never again. The good news is, we have actually eradicated this dependency already for 90%. The last 10% is the most difficult, but you're absolutely right. We should step up and make sure that we get rid of that.

LIMBONG: Often, you know, regular people get lost in these conversations, right? So what stories do you hear from people about what is changing their lives? And what can people concerned about climate do themselves?

HOEKSTRA: I fully understand that people, on the one hand, are saying, look, I'm worried about all the news I'm getting and what this will mean for my life or for the life of my kids, and at the same time, wonder about how measures governments are taking might impact our lives. If you're working in the coal industry and the plant is going to close, well, you might intellectually agree that that is good for climate, but of course you wonder about how you're going to feed your kids. And then it matters whether there are actually jobs available in new industries and whether there's training available to make sure you get skilled in a way that gives you a decent chance for a great job in that new industry. But it is important to make sure that we facilitate these type of things, in my view.

LIMBONG: Wopke Hoekstra is the European Union climate commissioner. Commissioner, thank you so much for joining us.

The logic seems impeccable: eliminate the need for paper production, which involves deforestation, energy-intensive manufacturing, and transportation, and replace it with digital storage in efficient data centers. Yet, recent scrutiny reveals this transition might not be the environmental panacea it’s often portrayed as. According to a report in FE Week, the idea of going paperless via the cloud is more “pie-in-the-sky” than practical, with hidden energy costs undermining the purported CO2 savings.

The FE Week analysis highlights how data centers, the backbone of cloud services, consume vast amounts of electricity—often from non-renewable sources—leading to emissions that can rival or exceed those from traditional paper use. For instance, storing and accessing digital files requires constant power for servers, cooling systems, and network infrastructure, which globally accounts for about 1-2% of total electricity use, per estimates from the International Energy Agency.

The Hidden Energy Appetite of the Cloud

This energy hunger is escalating with the rise of AI and big data, where cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure report surging carbon footprints despite green pledges. A 2024 study in Carbone4 notes that major cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud saw emissions spikes of up to 20% in recent years, driven by data center expansions. While proponents argue that cloud efficiency aggregates resources better than on-premises servers—potentially cutting emissions by a billion metric tons over four years, as forecasted by IDC in 2021—the reality for paper replacement is more nuanced.

Paper’s lifecycle emissions, from tree harvesting to recycling, are indeed significant, but digitization doesn’t eliminate them entirely. Employees still print documents for reviews or legal requirements, and the cloud’s always-on nature means idle servers burn energy around the clock. Posts on X from users like environmental researchers emphasize this, with one noting that a single data center can guzzle electricity equivalent to 50,000 homes, rivaling the airline industry’s carbon footprint, drawing from MIT Press insights.

Weighing Real-World Trade-Offs

Industry insiders point to case studies where the switch has backfired. In education sectors, as detailed in FE Week, schools aiming for paperless operations via cloud tools like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 found that device charging and data syncing added unexpected emissions, often offsetting paper savings. A 2023 analysis in ScienceDirect on cloud computing’s carbon reduction potential suggests that while technology innovations like carbon trading could help, the industry’s growth trajectory—projected to consume 13% of global electricity by 2030, per Xomnia estimates—demands more than just migration.

Moreover, not all clouds are created equal. Providers using renewable energy, such as Google’s carbon-free data centers, offer better outcomes, but widespread adoption lags. A recent X post from AMD highlighted a packaging firm’s 10% emissions drop by optimizing cloud instances, yet this requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple paper replacement.

Policy and Innovation Imperatives

For true CO2 reductions, experts advocate hybrid approaches: combining cloud efficiencies with reduced printing through better workflows. The MIT Press Reader’s ethnographic work on server farms underscores the ecological toll, from water usage for cooling to e-waste from outdated hardware. Current news on X reveals growing sentiment for “green coding” practices, like using efficient languages such as Rust to minimize computational waste, as noted in discussions around sustainable software.

Regulatory pressures are mounting too. With the EU’s Green Deal pushing for digital sustainability reporting, companies must audit their cloud footprints. A 2025 post on X from AI at Meta discussed carbon-driven AI models reducing emissions by 9%, hinting at future tech solutions.

Brendon Green, the general manager of automotive solutions at Pickles, says the auction house is selling about 100 salvaged EVs every month, and interest is surging.

“It’s only very early days, but they are certainly in strong demand,” says Green.

“We’ve got this new element of second-life battery startups. That industry really didn’t exist 18 months ago.”

Battery hunters

Salvage auction houses started regularly seeing salvage EVs in early 2024, most of which were Teslas, the first mass market electric vehicle on Australian roads.

Battery hunters are now also seeing alternatives, such as BYDs and MGs, in line with the growing number of different makes on the market. Many of the wrecked vehicles are two-to-three years old, and include a mix of complete write-offs and those that are repairable.

The appeal for EV batteries is obvious, given they are about five times as powerful as a typical home energy storage unit.

Andrew Chadwick, a lithium battery repair specialist, says even ageing EV batteries have plenty of life in them for other purposes.

“The output requirements for a solar battery are a lot less than what you need for an electric vehicle,” says Chadwick, from Second Life Battery Sales.

“Even if they are no longer good for an electric vehicle, with a little finessing, they’re perfect for a solar system.”

Consider an EV battery that is down to 70% capacity. While this will considerably reduce the range of the vehicle, making the car undesirable, it still holds plenty of charge for less-intensive uses.

You could even put a trailer load of second-hand EV batteries together, and power an entire music festival.

A music event in Queensland’s Sunshine Coast was postponed in June over council concerns its power usage would disrupt nearby businesses. The punk and indie-alternative festival went ahead in early September, powered by repurposed EV batteries.

“Our trailers powered the whole event for the day, including speakers, food trucks, everything, and had plenty of power left over,” says John Myler, co-founder of MyNu Energy.

“People really like them as an alternative to a diesel generator. If you’ve got sound equipment or food trucks, having a noisy, smelly diesel generator probably isn’t the atmosphere you’re looking for, whereas these batteries are silent, pollution free, and hold huge amounts of power.”

After the event, the trailers were recharged using solar, ready for their next deployment.

Life extension

At Pickles auctions, the demand for EV batteries is evident.

Financial year sales of salvage EVs increased 200% over the prior year, with the wrecked vehicles now boasting much higher price tags than combustion engine cars.

Buyers know that EVs contain some of the world’s most advanced battery technology, ready to be deployed.

About one in 10 new car sales in Australia are battery-powered, with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 and the BYD Seal and Atto the most popular models in 2024, according to the EV Council.

After a comparably slow roll out in Australia marked by political headwinds, motoring experts believe EV sales will surge as prices become more competitive and charging infrastructure catches up.

Currently, many batteries are shredded, with the material then separated into components ready to be rebuilt into new batteries, with the process often including multiple facilities in different countries.

A repurposed battery can reduce this process, with some second-hand buyers believing they can get about 20 years of usage from them.

Myler says repurposed EV batteries are part of the solution to Australia’s intensifying energy needs.

“We need a huge amount of short term energy storage to help us transition to sustainable energy solutions,” he says.

“As a country, we need every bit of storage we can get our hands on.”",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22544904/1000.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:13.367435

Shifting global dynamics India’s role as a growing solar module exporter is gaining significance as the global clean energy transition accelerates.","Indian solar panel manufacturer Waaree Energies has said it will fully cooperate with United States authorities following the launch of a formal investigation into its solar exports. The probe, initiated by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), focuses on whether the company misclassified Chinese-made solar cells and modules as Indian-origin products to bypass import tariffs.

According to official communication, CBP stated that it has “reasonable suspicion” that certain imports linked to Waaree were not properly labelled to reflect long-standing antidumping and countervailing duties applied to Chinese and other Asian solar products. As part of the interim measures, the agency has asked Waaree to place cash deposits while the inquiry is underway.

Company response and US expansion

In a public statement, Waaree reiterated its commitment to compliance, highlighting that it has always cooperated with US regulatory processes and will continue to do so. The company emphasised that the US remains a core market in its international expansion strategy.

Waaree Solar Americas, its US subsidiary, currently operates a 1.6 GW module manufacturing facility in Texas, with plans to scale capacity to 3.2 GW. The subsidiary recently acquired assets of Meyer Burger US to strengthen its domestic production footprint. Waaree underlined that these investments reflect its long-term goal of building a sustainable manufacturing base in the US market.

“We are a responsible corporate citizen in every country we operate in and abide by all applicable laws and regulations,” the company said in its statement.

Why the scrutiny matters

The investigation follows a petition from the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, a coalition representing US-based solar producers including First Solar and Qcells. The group has argued that some Indian solar products benefit from cost advantages by using Chinese cells without paying the required US duties.

Over the last two years, US imports of Indian solar panels have risen sharply, especially after tariffs were imposed on solar imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. India’s exports now account for nearly 8% of US solar module imports, positioning it as one of the top suppliers outside Southeast Asia.

Market and financial implications

News of the investigation has already impacted Waaree’s market performance. On Friday, shares of Waaree Energies fell 6.76% on the Bombay Stock Exchange, closing at Rs 3,213.35 per share.

The inquiry also comes at a time when the US Department of Commerce has begun a separate investigation into solar photovoltaic cells and module imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos. Analysts say these probes could shape the trade environment for Indian solar exporters in the medium term.

Shifting global dynamics

India’s role as a growing solar module exporter is gaining significance as the global clean energy transition accelerates. In 2024 alone, the US imported 54 GW worth of solar modules, with India contributing 4.4 GW. While this has boosted India’s visibility in the renewable energy supply chain, regulatory hurdles such as the ongoing US probe underline the challenges of competing in tightly scrutinised international markets.

For Waaree, the outcome of the investigation will be crucial in determining not just its US strategy but also its standing in global solar trade. As the company expands its manufacturing base in the United States, compliance with trade rules will remain central to sustaining growth in one of the world’s most competitive renewable energy markets.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/08/01/waaree.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 22:58:58.259322

This shift, driven by a surge in supply from early adopters trading up and aggressive manufacturer incentives, is making battery-powered cars more accessible than ever. Yet, for buyers eyeing these deals, the question looms: Does the lower upfront cost translate to long-term value, or are there hidden pitfalls in maintenance, resale, and infrastructure?

Data from recent analyses shows that the average price of a used EV now hovers around $28,000, compared to about $28,900 for a comparable used gas vehicle. This parity marks a dramatic reversal from just a few years ago when EVs commanded premiums of 20% or more. Factors like the expiration of federal tax credits for new models are pushing more inventory into the secondary market, flooding dealership lots and online platforms with options from Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet.

The Economics of Ownership

Beyond the sticker price, operating costs remain a strong selling point for used EVs. Charging at home equates to roughly $1.41 per gallon equivalent in fuel savings, as highlighted in reports from energy think tanks. Maintenance is often simpler too, with fewer moving parts—no oil changes or transmission repairs—potentially saving owners thousands over a vehicle’s life. However, these advantages hinge on access to reliable charging; in rural areas or apartment complexes without dedicated spots, the convenience factor diminishes sharply.

Battery degradation emerges as a critical concern for used EV shoppers. Models like the older Nissan Leaf can lose up to 30% of range after five years, according to reliability studies, which might necessitate costly replacements exceeding $5,000. Buyers are advised to scrutinize vehicle history reports and opt for certified pre-owned programs that include battery warranties, often extending coverage to 100,000 miles.

Market Dynamics and Buyer Profiles

The influx of used EVs stems partly from lease returns and fleet disposals, with companies like Hertz offloading thousands of Tesla Model 3s at steep discounts after high-profile rental challenges. This has created bargains, such as a 2021 Chevy Bolt for under $20,000, but it also underscores volatility—resale values for EVs have plummeted 25% in the past year amid broader economic pressures.

For industry insiders, the real calculus involves total cost of ownership. A study by the nonprofit publication Grist emphasizes that while the $900 price gap favors EVs, variables like insurance premiums (often 10-15% higher due to repair complexities) and regional electricity rates can tip the scales. In states with robust incentives, such as California, used EV buyers can still claim up to $4,000 in rebates, amplifying affordability.

Risks and Opportunities Ahead

Skeptics point to infrastructure gaps: Only about 50,000 public fast-chargers exist nationwide, far short of demand, leading to “range anxiety” for long-haul drivers. Moreover, emerging technologies like solid-state batteries could render current models obsolete, depressing future resale values further. Analysts from Hacker News discussions note that early adopters might face depreciation hits if autonomous features or longer-range packs become standard.

On the flip side, environmental benefits and policy tailwinds position used EVs as a smart bet for urban commuters. With global pushes toward net-zero emissions, demand is projected to surge, potentially stabilizing prices. Publications like LAist, republishing insights from Grist, argue that for budget-conscious buyers with short commutes, these vehicles offer unmatched efficiency—up to 100 miles per gallon equivalent—outweighing drawbacks.

Strategic Considerations for Buyers

Industry experts recommend thorough due diligence: Test drives should include highway speeds to assess real-world range, and third-party inspections for battery health are non-negotiable. Financing options have improved, with lenders offering EV-specific loans at competitive rates, sometimes bundled with home charger installations.

Ultimately, whether a used EV represents a good deal boils down to individual circumstances. For tech-savvy millennials in electrified cities, the savings and eco-credentials shine.

Rachel Carson, a biologist and nature writer from Pennsylvania, authored the book to expose the hidden costs of widespread pesticide use, particularly focusing on their devastating effects on birds, insects, and the broader natural environment.

Carson focused especially on the pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and warned . that pesticides don’t stay where we put them; they get into the soil, our water-ways, wildlife and even inside us. They move through the food chain (whether absorbed by crops or consumed by animals) exposing people, even those living far from farms, to harmful chemicals.

Many of these substances are linked to serious health risks, including respiratory problems, neurological disorders, reproductive health issues, and increased cancer risk. Decades after Silent Spring, we are still discovering just how far these chemicals can travel and how deeply they affect human health and wildlife. Carson knew that something needed to change.

Pen to Paper Activism

Carson started a whole movement without a single marth – just her written word. Before Silent Spring, she had already achieved acclaim, her books The Sea Around Us and Under the Sea Wind, introduced millions to the importance and beauty of oceans and coastal ecosystems, even impacting the opinions of those who might never be able to sea the ocean. Her writing combined poetic language with rigorous science; making the truth of human impact on the environment digestible and impactful.

What gave Silent Spring the unique ability to motivate action was its urgency. Carson’s words were not just celebratory of nature and all its beauty, but cautionary of the risk of losing it. She warned that if humanity did not change course, we could one day experience a spring without birdsong. That DDT and other pesticides would eventually kill all the birds, leaving behind a silence that would signal not peace, but deep loss and absence. The early mornings, once filled with chirping and fluttering life, would be still.

Corporate Foes Failed

Carson faced fierce opposition. Chemical companies attacked her credibility. She was dismissed as “hysterical,” and accused of being a Communist whose agricultural methods would just reduce the food supply.

At the time, she was also battling breast cancer, which she kept a secret so she could not be accused of blaming the pesticide industry for her ill health. Along with her penmanship, she testified on the dangers of these toxic chemicals before Congress, insisting that the government had the duty to protect its citizens from contaminants. Sadly, she did not live to see the full impact of her work, but the rest of the world did.

Carson ignited an environmental consciousness in the United States and the world with her urgent message laying out the intellectual and moral groundwork for what would become the modern environmental movement. Her work created the climate that made the first Earth Day, held in April 1970, possible and mobilizing 20 million Americans in a national call for clean air and water for all. This pressure directly led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency later that year, and paved the way for landmark legislation including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.

In the years that followed, Carson’s warnings proved prophetic. The bald eagle, America’s national symbol, teetered on the edge of extinction. DDT caused eggshell thinning in these majestic birds. This thinning led to fragile eggs that often cracked under the weight of incubation, resulting in widespread reproductive failure. The pesticide accumulated up the food chain, affecting eagles who consumed contaminated fish and prey. Public outrage grew and by 1972, the U.S. banned DDT for agricultural use. The recovery of the bald eagle is now one of the most celebrated conservation success stories in American history.

Where Are We Now?

Rachel Carson’s legacy doesn’t belong to any single organization or policy. It belongs to anyone who listens to a bird’s song and understands that its presence is not guaranteed. It belongs to those who believe that science should serve life, not only profit. And it belongs to those who still care enough to fight for a future where springs are full of sound.

The battle against pesticides has not gone away. In her honor, help us speak out and oppose Section 453 of the Interior Appropriations Bill, which would grant pesticide manufacturers broad legal immunity, even when their products cause harm.",https://www.earthday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250927_article_silentspring.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:19.673176

The event, held on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, featured the launch of the 2025 Global Carbon Neutrality Annual Progress Report, a comprehensive study on the world's climate transition.

Framed around the theme ""Global Progress and China's Practice,"" the forum opened with a dialogue featuring Liu Yang, Deputy Director General, Department of Climate Change, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China, who outlined China's latest progress toward its ""dual carbon"" goals and its newly announced NDC. Her remarks were followed by international perspectives, including a call to action from Patricia Espinosa Cantellano, former UNFCCC Executive Secretary.

The centerpiece was the launch of the third annual progress report, led by Professor Wang Can of Tsinghua. The study offers one of the most wide-ranging, science-based assessments of global climate progress, notable for:

Tracking 198 countries and regions with 217 indicators across technology, finance, and policy.

Adopting an equity lens to evaluate the justice of the global transition.

Committing to a continuous, long-term evaluation to inform global climate governance.

For the first time, the report is guided by a 13-member international Advisory Committee, co-chaired by He Kebin of Tsinghua and Erik Solheim, former UNEP Executive Director, underscoring its mix of Chinese leadership and global perspective.

This year's report identifies a ""profound structural imbalance"": while ambition and innovation are driving progress, they are being severely undermined by bottlenecks in climate finance and international cooperation. This has created a critical ""implementation gap"" between stated goals and tangible results.

The report's rigorous methodology has earned praise from international climate leaders. ""This is the type of research into climate that reinforces our sense of purpose and our sense of hope,"" said Patricia Espinosa Cantellano. She added, ""What stands out is the four-part framework — target, policy, action, effectiveness — a game-changer for tracking climate progress.""

The findings and dialogues from the forum are intended to provide a scientific basis for shaping stronger NDCs and informing the critical discussions at the upcoming COP30 in Brazil. By highlighting both the irreversible momentum of the green transition and the urgent need to close the implementation gap, the event concluded with a strong call for renewed international efforts to translate commitments into concrete action.",https://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/icons/2019-Q4-PRN-Icon-32-32.png,N,,2025-09-27 19:02:00.023761

The U.S. Department of Energy announced a record $9.63 billion loan to BlueOval SK for the construction of three battery manufacturing plants in the country, which was finalized in 2024.

Once the three locations are up and running, with one in Tennessee and two in Kentucky, they're expected to deliver more than 120 gigawatt-hours of battery production each year.

This move will strengthen the domestic supply in the U.S. and was estimated to add 5,000 construction jobs and 7,500 operations jobs across the facilities, according to the DOE at the time of the announcement.

Bolstering the development of more sustainable transportation technologies is key to achieving our clean energy goals and reducing the proliferation of gas-powered vehicles that spew planet-warming tailpipe pollution and run on dirty fuels.

InsideEVs also reported that this investment is being made while Ford faces pressure from local rival General Motors and tough competition from other automakers like Hyundai and Kia.

Additionally, the outlet noted that Ford's EV sales have declined in the first half of the year, with F-150 Lightning sales dipping 17%, and E-Transit sales down 34%.

Still, the Ford F-150 Lightning beat out Tesla's Cybertruck in sales numbers for the second quarter in a row, proving that it's headed in the right direction.

It doesn't help that the Trump administration's actions to cut environmentally friendly programs, credits, and rebates — reversing course from the previous administration's push to support them — are having a negative impact on EV sales in the country.

GM, which claims to be the largest OEM battery cell producer in North America, has its own joint venture in Tennessee with LG Energy Solution under the name Ultium Cells.

In fact, both Ford and GM are developing more affordable lithium-iron-phosphate battery cells, which Reuters notes are gaining traction in the industry.

Notably, both companies are partnering with Redwood Materials for recycling efforts to build up the circular economy in the U.S. and diversify the supply chain.

The company claims it has been able to recover lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper with a rate of above 95% efficiency.

Ford's CEO Jim Farley shared that the company aims to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant to deliver a next-generation electric truck to replace the aging Escape and Lincoln Corsair crossover models in what it's calling a Model T moment.

The numbers are huge: the report estimates that 6.3 to 9.5 million job years of new construction work will be from now to 2050. This is equivalent to an average of 235,000 to 350,000 ongoing new construction jobs over then next quarter-century – a 20-30% step increase in overall construction employment in Canada.

Energy-efficient industrial and commercial building construction and retrofits, and construction of district energy systems.

Sustainable transportation infrastructure (including urban transit, inter-urban high=speed rail, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure).

About half of the new jobs would arise in commercial and industrial building activity, including new construction, deep-energy-saving retrofits, and construction of high-tech district energy systems (which integrate heating and cooling systems with new geothermal, battery, and other technologies to achieve huge gains in energy efficiency).

The job-creation estimates do not include indirect jobs created in the supply chains that feed these investment projects, nor the downstream or induced jobs that would result from additional employment and consumer spending by hundreds of thousands of construction workers. In short, these huge investments will stimulate an unprecedented boom in demand for construction labour.

Sean Strickland, President of the CBTU, concluded these investments are an enormous opportunity for building trades workers:

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON D.C., DC — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

Tapping into solar power at an individual level can just as easily contribute to avoiding those outcomes while saving yourself a few bucks.","Ampion has announced an impressive advancement in its community solar power service, according to Solar Power World.

The company runs a community solar credit business, where customers pay for a portion of a large-scale solar plant's output and receive a proportional credit on their utility bill in return. This allows residents to benefit from the savings of solar power without using solar power directly. Ampion generally guarantees at least 10% savings with this scheme. It says it's possible to cover an entire utility bill with these solar energy credits.

Traditionally, this plan has required homeowners to be in the same state as the solar energy farm, but Ampion has just announced its ability to start participating across state lines.

Ampion's model hinges heavily on government policy to exist. Local jurisdictions have to mandate that utility providers accept solar energy credits and attach them to specific subscriber accounts.

By that token, this new Synthetic Community Solar program is made possible by a federal credit targeting low-income homes. Ampion hopes that this credit will incentivize the creation of more solar energy generation to plug into its system, since it will be easier to sell credits.

Utility-scale solar is the cheapest energy source available, making its efficient transmission an important bottleneck. Providing creative means for residents to support solar through credits like Ampion's can not only save people money, but it also helps to displace dirty energy sources on the grid.

Fossil fuels, such as gas and coal, are among the primary drivers of increasingly destructive weather events, including floods and droughts. These disasters have massive housing and agricultural costs.

Tapping into solar power at an individual level can just as easily contribute to avoiding those outcomes while saving yourself a few bucks. EnergySage has a free online tool that can connect homeowners to vetted local installers. These experts can save up to $10,000 on installation costs thanks to rebates and credits.

Ampion was excited about the potential of its new Synthetic Solar Credit program.

""We're grateful to offer a solution that helps developers navigate the complexities of community solar across different state programs while providing additional savings to low-income subscribers. This initiative directly supports our mission of making renewable energy accessible everywhere, for everyone,"" said Ampion CEO Nate Owen.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EFaLTOmaxKn2m0XlveeqzQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5d329219f10fccd5e33593a44831dbb9,N,,2025-09-27 19:02:09.117845

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
""For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,"" the staff wrote.","Private investment firms that are helping finance America's artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

""The reason is very simple: because there's a lot of money to be made,"" said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is ""at the beginning of a golden age.""

""We believe that there's a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

""It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don't have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,"" said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech's data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

""It's just a matter of what's the price and will the regulator approve it,"" Ellis said. ""The challenge is they're not going to come up for sale very often.""

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don't want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general's office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota's law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is ""well positioned"" to meet its financing needs.

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's ""intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.""

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

""For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,"" the staff wrote. ""For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity 'wins' and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.""

Only Denmark, Germany and Ireland have more expensive domestic electricity, while industry pays at least 50% more for electricity in the UK than it does in most of the rest of Europe – and over three times more than in the US. Although this is bad for everyone, particularly poorer households, arguably the real crisis is in industry.

Energy-intensive manufacturers have been hit hard, leading to the closure of factories such as the CF Fertilisers plant in Billingham, and the Ineos oil refinery in Grangemouth; the steel industry is on its knees. Lowering energy bills is one of the current Government’s core “missions”, but the short-term outlook isn’t great, with the typical domestic bill set to be 44% higher this winter than four years ago.

Why are British prices so high?

The short-term cause is the Ukraine War. The average household “duel-fuel” bill (of which electricity makes up a bit more than half) went from around £1,200 per year in 2020 to £3,549 in October 2022, then down again, before creeping up to £1,720 now. The underlying causes are complex: they include an ageing national grid; high network operating costs; a lack of storage; and the practicalities of being on an island (in Europe, electricity can be transmitted to where it’s needed more easily). Finally, there are “policy costs”: levies to support green energy and vulnerable customers. Of a typical electricity bill, under Ofgem’s price cap (the highest tariff providers can charge), about 20% consists of network costs; 15% is the energy supplier’s costs; 11% is policy costs; 5% is VAT; and suppliers’ profits are 2.4%. But the biggest chunk, around 45% of a bill, is the wholesale cost of energy, which is largely dictated by the price of natural gas, which is both high and volatile, for reasons beyond government control.

Why is it underpinned by the price of gas?

UK non-fossil fuel sources – wind, solar, hydroelectricity, bioenergy and nuclear – generated around 58% of the UK’s electricity last year, with wind alone providing around a third of the country’s power since 2023. And wind and solar are, in theory, very cheap. However, much electricity for the grid is bought short-term, with an auction for every half-hour period, and the price is determined by the most expensive provider for that moment. Electricity is bought from generators – wind farms, power plants – in “merit order”: cheapest first. But the price for all is set by the last or “marginal” generator needed; and in the UK that’s almost invariably a gas-powered turbine. This is known as “marginal pricing”.

Why on earth use this system?

Electrical grids must be exactly balanced between supply and demand. In the UK, gas-powered plants are the only practical means of topping up the grid during a sudden shortage. Nuclear reactors can’t quickly be switched on and off; wind and solar are intermittent, and we can’t yet store enough of their output. For now, the only way to be sure of keeping the lights on when there’s a surge in demand involves gas. As a matter of economics, many, from Boris Johnson to the energy supplier Octopus, have questioned marginal pricing. But both Labour and Tory governments have concluded that it is the most efficient system; it is used across most of Europe and the US.

So how much do renewables cost?

In theory, the green part of “policy costs” comprises under 10% of our electricity bills. But the true price is much higher. Connecting the grid to wind and solar farms is expensive, as is back-up and grid-balancing. In 2024/25, about £2.7bn was spent balancing the grid – for instance, paying wind farms to “curtail” generation when the system was overloaded. Besides, high gas-derived prices often govern real renewable prices anyway. The UK relies heavily on gas, because it got rid of coal-fired stations. Marginal pricing means gas set the price of electricity 98% of the time in Britain in 2023, compared with the European average of 58% (in France, prices are mostly set by cheaper nuclear, and in Poland, by coal).

What is the Government’s solution?

To help industry, Labour is exempting around 7,000 companies from some levies, with extra support for those in energy-intensive sectors such as chemicals, steel and glass. But its long-term plan is to take gas largely out of the electricity system: to reach “grid net zero” (95% carbon-free electricity) by 2030. The UK will need about twice the generating capacity as it did pre-renewables, and a much more complex, dispersed grid. It is investing several billion pounds in renewables, aiming to double onshore wind capacity, triple solar and quadruple offshore wind by 2030; it is also investing heavily in nuclear, in projects such as Sizewell C in Suffolk. At the same time, it aims to improve network capacity and boost grid storage, with vast batteries and pumped hydropower. The hope is that, in the future, the marginal price will seldom be set by gas – greatly driving down UK energy costs, cutting emissions and creating high-quality green jobs.

Is this realistic?

Many are sceptical. Dieter Helm, the Oxford energy economist, doubts that renewables will reduce bills long-term. Decarbonising the grid by 2030 would be a massive undertaking. Big British infrastructure projects usually run hugely over budget and schedule. Mechanisms for balancing a mostly renewable grid are untested, and will be expensive. Vast amounts will need to be invested – which will come, ultimately, from Britain’s electricity bills. Manufacturing is likely to be lost to nations with cheaper power. Although reducing emissions is a worthy aim, if those emissions only go abroad, it won’t help the climate. Helm thinks it would be better to move more slowly, and to be cautious about phasing out fossil fuels.

Marginal pricing: the alternatives

The present Government has looked into having a “split market” – separate pricing systems for renewables and the rest. A linked idea, which has been pushed and fought against by opposing armies of lobbyists, is “zonal pricing”: replacing a single national price for electricity with different prices for different zones, lower in areas with cheap generation nearby.

Industrial areas such as Teesside and Grangemouth that are near offshore wind farms could, with lower prices, attract energy intensive industries such as steel, fertilisers, or data centres. Wind farms would no longer need to be paid to be turned off. Octopus Energy CEO Greg Jackson thinks the scheme would bring costs down by £5bn a year. The Government rejected zonal pricing in July. It was deemed too politically difficult: it would risk creating a “postcode lottery”, with customers in some regions paying more than others. Ministers also concluded that it would be too difficult to implement. Marginal pricing is a fiendishly complex issue, but it was thought to be the best method of setting prices in a way that incentivises investors and generators, and ensures a reliable supply. Ministers are nervous of anything that might interfere with security of supply.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8EJn4Xg9jEsWfhUYiLzyV.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 22:00:14.258379

They admitted to staying in Texas for family reasons but regularly daydreaming about what life might be like somewhere more politically aligned with their values. Is the grass really greener — or does everything feel just as hopeless, no matter where you live? Here's what 19 people who made the move had to say:

1. ""I moved from Texas to California in 2015 as a poor single mother with two elementary-aged children. Life improved so much that it is hard to quantify or describe all the ways. There are so many social safety nets in California, where there were almost none in Texas. Community college is free, and I was able to go all the way through and get my master’s degree thanks to state-funded programs. My children and I now live comfortably without assistance. The quality of life, the people, the beauty, and culture that we're surrounded by in California are priceless. You could not pay me enough to live in a red state again.""

2. ""Though the political makeup of the city I moved from and the city I moved to are roughly the same, Ohio's state-level policies threatened me in a way Illinois's absolutely do not. And since I can handle the increased cost of living, it's worth it to me (though feasibly one could move to an inexpensive part of Illinois, if you're not as concerned about day-to-day interactions).""

Published September 26, 2025 at 10:14 AM CDT

A company cofounded by Bill Gates will explore building a reactor in Kansas. It would generate power without emissions, but environmental groups have concerns.

One of the companies leading the charge to deploy safer, smaller, faster-to-build nuclear reactors is hoping to find a site for one in Kansas.

TerraPower, cofounded by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, began construction last month on its first power plant of this kind in southwest Wyoming as a $4 billion demonstration project cofunded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Now it is interested in building one in Kansas to generate power in utility company Evergy’s service area.

TerraPower, Evergy and state officials announced this week that they have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the prospects. They issued a news release featuring enthusiastic quotes from Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and both of the state’s Republican U.S. senators.

“We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state,” Kelly said.

“Nuclear energy is the way of the future,” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall said.

But the reaction from clean energy advocates in Kansas is mixed. The news sparked some interest in emissions-free power generation, but also concern about the price tag and whether the project would attract more data centers to the region with significant needs for electricity and water. Kansas faces water sustainability challenges.

“ We want to make sure that the plans we’re making for the clean energy future are affordable,” said Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project. “ I am increasingly concerned for our friends and neighbors who are struggling to pay their utility bills.”

Kansas regulators signed off on $128 million in rate hikes for Evergy this week.

The Sierra Club said Kansas has financially smarter options for powering its economy.

“We’ve got plenty of roofs here in Kansas,” said Zack Pistora, state director for the Sierra Club in Kansas. “Or backyards that could say, ‘Hey, we’ll be glad to lease our roof or our land for solar, Evergy. You can pay us instead of paying this out-of-state company.’”

Looking for potential sites in Kansas

An official with the Kansas Department of Commerce said regional power demand is projected to more than double over the next decade. That’s according to the regional grid operator, the Southwest Power Pool.

“We need to be ready for this,” said Paul Hughes, the department’s lead on matters involving megaprojects. “And I’m not saying it has to be this (nuclear) project, but we do need to act in ensuring that Kansas isn’t effectively blocked out of future opportunities because of the availability or unavailability of power in the state.”

Asked why TerraPower is specifically considering Kansas, Hughes noted that Evergy already has experience with nuclear energy. It owns Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station 60 miles south of Topeka, the state’s only nuclear plant. By contrast, some states don’t have nuclear power and some have restrictions or outright bans.

This fall Kansas State University launched a nuclear engineering program.

It’s not yet clear where in Kansas TerraPower would want to build a nuclear reactor. The company will need to consider proximity to transmission lines and to a workforce. It will also need to find communities interested in the project, and will need to ensure that any potential sites have stable underground geology.

Hughes said the state commerce department will help facilitate the discussions.

“We can help communities articulate their interest in the project or disinterest in the project,” he said.

Communities that aren’t interested will be passed over for consideration, he said.

“These (projects) just don’t go well when you try to force feed them into a community — and all parties to this agreement understand that,” Hughes said.

Advanced nuclear reactors and TerraPower

For decades, logistics and expenses have held nuclear energy back. Conventional nuclear plants not only have high price tags but also a propensity to greatly exceed their budgets and to take longer than expected to build.

Modular advanced nuclear designs are smaller than conventional plants and represent a potential industry turning point that is decades in the making. The companies developing them say they will be safer and faster to build.

However, none of the designs like TerraPower’s are yet in commercial operation in the U.S.

The Trump administration has thrown its weight behind advanced nuclear power, drawing a mix of praise and criticism. This spring it unveiled executive orders and plans to reconsider some regulations, press for approval of projects, and use the controversial Department of Government Efficiency to overhaul the nation’s independent regulator of nuclear energy.

Kansas officials said they’re aware of the development.

“ It is on our radar,” Hughes said. “We want to make sure that (Kansas is) doing this safely and that’s what we’ll do.”

TerraPower expects its Wyoming project to come online this decade. The company says that the project will create 1,600 jobs during peak construction, after which about 250 jobs will remain at the site for day-to-day operations.

The company’s design, the Natrium reactor, uses liquid sodium rather than water to envelop uranium fuel. This liquid has a far higher boiling point – 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit – which the company says adds to the reactor’s safety.

The reactor heats the liquid sodium, which in turn heats pipes full of molten salt. The pipes carry the molten salt to a storage tank that serves as a power battery. The salt heats tubes of water, creating pressurized steam. The steam turns a turbine to generate electricity. The salt then cycles back to the reactor area to be heated up again.

The battery represents a key departure from a conventional plant such as Evergy’s Wolf Creek. The facility would store the heated molten salt in a tank and draw upon it as needed to meet demand.

Wolf Creek can’t adjust its output to the ebb and flow of electricity demand or to account for sunny and windy weather generating more from solar and wind farms.

What do clean energy advocates think?

Barnett, from the Climate + Energy Project, wants to hear more details.

Generating electricity without pumping out greenhouse gases is “one of the most important things as we think about our climate future,” she said.

Additionally, her organization wants power plants to pair well with renewable energy and is interested in the efforts of advanced nuclear designs to do that.

But she’s skeptical because many people already struggle to pay their utility bills and Evergy not only got the greenlight this week from Kansas regulators for $128 million in rate hikes, it also got permission this summer to build and co-own two new natural gas-burning power plants.

“ At what point is it just too expensive for us to just keep having Evergy build and build?” Barnett said.

The Wyoming project suggests that an advanced nuclear facility would cost billions.

Also, she has questions about potential indirect effects. For example, even if the reactor doesn’t require much water because it uses liquid sodium as a coolant, data centers do. This means the reactor’s impact on water use in Kansas could depend on how the power gets used.

Pistora, with the Sierra Club in Kansas, said Evergy and TerraPower will need to answer a slew of pressing questions.

“Does this make economic sense from a cost and benefit standpoint?” he asked. “What about the water use? What about the (nuclear) waste disposal? … Where are we going to get this nuclear material and where’s it going to be mined?”

A few utility-scale battery projects have been proposed in Kansas, Pistora said, which could help store energy from renewable sources or existing fossil fuel plants for when the power is needed.

Like Barnett, he pointed to the recent approval of Evergy’s requests to hike its rates and to build new natural gas power plants.

“ Now we’re hearing about nuclear, which is the most expensive power out there,” he said. “Why are we going for these big-ticket, capital-intensive, expensive energy projects?”

The Energy Information Agency reported the statistics recently and pointed out that the solar and storage sectors in the United States are the dominant force in the American energy landscape, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. US developers added 12 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale solar electric generating capacity to the grid in H1 of 2025.

US developers plan to add another 21 GW to the grid in the second half of the year

Adding to the already impressive 12 gigawatts that energy developers brought to the grid this year, the additional 21 GW planned for the rest of the year would set a record for capacity additions if all 64 GW come online this year.

The Energy Information Agency revealed that wind, solar, and battery storage have become more prevalent options for new capacity in modern-day America. Booyed by the embrace of alternative energy solutions in Texas. About 27% (3.2 GW) of the solar capacity added so far in 2025 is in Texas.

In 2024, Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility-scale solar capacity. Pointing to the change in the type of energy being developed in the United States over the past two decades.

Coal-fired power plants face an uncertain future in the United States energy sector

While the Trump administration has implemented the new executive orders aimed at keeping the lights on for the coal sector in the United States, it’s hard to argue with facts. And the evidence suggests that the American public is wary of coal power and instead favors the safe and reliable energy creation that solar, wind, and battery storage present.

More than 3.6 GW of coal-powered energy has now been delayed or canceled, including plans to retire the coal-fired Units 1 and 2 of Brandon Shore. Which only adds to the importance of the solar sector in the United States.

The US Energy Information Agency has stated that “If current retirement intentions are realized, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas (19%).”

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects. The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.” – Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie

The SEIA wrote to DOI Secretary Doug Burgum last month, raising its concerns

The Solar Energy Industries Association wrote a letter to the Department of the Interior Secretary, Doug Burgum, who is a Trump appointee, regarding their concerns over the current administration’s policies.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses. Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid. But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.” – SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

Transportation is generally the biggest factor on the east and west costs, with electric power the primary source in 18 states.","There is some very good news on the climate front. Every U.S. state reduced per capita carbon dioxide emissions from primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2023. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released data indicating that total U.S. CO2 emissions fell by 20% over the period, even as population rose by 14%. The result is a 30% decrease in per capita CO2 emissions.

The reductions by state range from 49% in Maryland down to 1% in Mississippi. Texas had 24% lower per capita CO2 emissions in 2023 than in 2005, a remarkable amount given that the state experienced 77% growth in real output, a 34% increase in population, and an eight-fold surge in oil and gas production. States at or near the same or smaller levels of reduction include California, Vermont, New York, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and several others. These areas exhibit wide differences in climate policy, geographic size, industrial base, rate of economic development, and virtually every other measure, indicating the diversity of approaches available to address this critical issue.

In Maryland, the key to the decrease was reducing coal from 56% of its input fuel for electric generation in 2005 to only 5% in 2023; natural gas increased from 4% to 41% over the period, and some wind and solar came online. Similar coal retirement and replacement went on in all of the states with the largest reductions.

Transportation is generally the biggest factor on the east and west costs, with electric power the primary source in 18 states. Texas is one of only four states where the industrial sector (which includes manufacturing and agriculture) is the largest source of CO2, another underlying indicator of economic vitality.

While the sheer size and economic strength of the state results in a high level of overall emissions, the reductions indicate genuine and meaningful gains. In fact, Texas has improved dramatically in terms of far lower emissions on both a per capita and a per million dollars in gross product basis than in the past. These reductions take on even greater significance in light of recent scientific research at MIT which reveals that declines in carbon concentrations can be a catalyst to climate regeneration.

A key factor in the improvement in U.S. emissions has been increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half the CO2 per unit of energy as coal, as well as gains in wind and solar. Significant reductions in carbon dioxide released even as business activity has flourished is good news indeed, especially when coupled with credible analysis indicating that such efforts can move the needle on crucial climate issues. Much remains to be done, but the success is notable. Stay safe!",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ray-Perryman-24.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 15:00:53.148435

Fast Horse says there are serious concerns among Northwest tribes about further cuts to vital programs ranging from health and wellness to early childhood education.
Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.
In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes.
In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.","A new report from Portland State University found that budget cuts under President Donald Trump’s new spending bill threaten nearly half of federal funding allocated to federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native nations last year.

Roughly $530 million of the $1.19 billion allocated to Northwest tribal nations in fiscal year 2024 — used to fulfill the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to Native American and Alaska Native tribes — is at risk of being cut. The congressionally allocated funds serve myriad functions for tribes in the Northwest, including providing clean drinking water, affordable housing, schools, transit and land management. Funding is decided by Congress on a yearly basis and can be disbursed over a period of time that exceeds the calendar year it is allocated.

“All across the board tribes are worried about the funding cuts that are happening right now,” said Serina Fast Horse, who is Lakota and Blackfeet and serves as the co-director of the Northwest Environmental Justice Center, which provides grant application assistance and advising to Indigenous communities in the Northwest.

Fast Horse says there are serious concerns among Northwest tribes about further cuts to vital programs ranging from health and wellness to early childhood education. The report warns of vulnerabilities to programs and grants that tribes rely on for resilience in the face of climate change, like improving home weatherization, managing forestland and renovating aging homes. Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.

The Portland State report found millions in Clean Air Act funding could also go away — the Environmental Protection Agency earmarked nearly $2 million in 2024 for Northwest tribes in a series of grants for monitoring air quality and pollution. Much of the congressionally allocated funding has yet to be distributed to tribes and is now at risk of being cut altogether.

The report demonstrates how proposed major reductions across the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, could reverberate across Indian Country.

Tribal officials shared concerns that drastic cuts could cause the federal government to fall short of trust and treaty obligations that mandate the federal government support tribal services, uphold tribal sovereignty and protect tribal treaty resources — responsibilities that courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have repeatedly upheld.

“All the funding reductions addressing clean water, air and dealing with climate change have impacts on the Tribes’ culture and treaty protected resources,” said William E. Ray Jr., chair of the Klamath Tribes.

Researchers declined to disclose specific projects at risk of elimination for fear of retaliation, and a number of tribes and tribal organizations declined to comment to InvestigateWest, citing similar concerns.

“Trump and Congressional Republicans are wreaking havoc on Tribal communities with their ‘Big, Ugly BETRAYAL’ of a law that arbitrarily cuts many programs supporting folks in Indian Country, where chronic underfunding is already impacting services and exacerbating disparities,” said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat.

He added that the federal government plays an outsized role in funding essential services to tribal communities, including health care, education and public safety, and that the Inflation Reduction Act took important steps in advancing funding for water infrastructure and environmental programs for tribes.

In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes. The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Tulalip Tribes are some of the Native American nations set to receive research grants for improving air quality and pollution monitoring. Among 12 tribes selected for funding, several of them focus on minimizing exposure to poor air quality and harmful pollutants to their elderly and medically vulnerable residents. Other tribes intend to study impacts of pollutants on important first foods — culturally significant staple foods consumed before colonization — that officials say are critical to improving health outcomes for their citizens.

Researchers at PSU examined 469 programs impacted by President Trump’s reversal of former President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14008, which sought to address climate change and created a number of environmental justice initiatives. Sixty of the programs identified by researchers were specifically named in the Republican-led spending bill for cuts, and 17 of those provided funding directly to tribes. The programs accounted for roughly 35% of all federal investments in tribes in 2024. The report says not all of the funding will be cut, but a significant portion of it could be.

The cuts come at a time when Native Americans and Alaska Natives already have limited access to federal services and funds, according to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog. It found when tribes had to compete with other entities for federal funding, they may receive a small portion of the total amount, and that limited access to federal services and funds contributes to known disparities for Native Americans and Alaska Natives compared to other Americans.

Of the $20.15 billion in federal funding that went to tribes between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the boundaries of Idaho received a total of $304.56 million, Washington tribes $1.81 billion, Oregon tribes $690.76 million, and Alaska Native tribes received $2.35 billion.

Other programs at risk of being cut include the EPA’s embattled Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program, which funded initiatives by states, tribes and local governments to support activities that lead to measurable environmental or public health impacts.

Under that program, in 2023, the EPA awarded the Tulalip Tribes $977,000 to work in conjunction with the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation to create a tool to detect which homes are at greatest risk from wildfire smoke infiltration and dangerously hot weather, which are growing issues affecting both communities.

While the federal government has repeatedly affirmed its obligations to tribes, actual allocations remain disproportionately small compared to population figures. In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.

Between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the bounds of Idaho, Washington and Oregon received roughly $2.81 billion in federal investments in energy and environmental infrastructure, which represents roughly 14% of the $20 billion in allocations made to tribes nationwide.

The researchers determined that programs funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s 2022 climate, health and tax law, are at particular risk of being eliminated. The funding allocated to tribes under the IRA represented a historic investment in infrastructure in Indian Country, more than doubling energy and infrastructure investment from $1.51 billion nationwide to $3.94 billion in 2024, around .04% of total federal grant spending obligations for 2024.

“When you put them in the context of how much money the federal government actually spends on certain things, it’s pennies on the dollar,” said Sophie Lalande, a co-author of the PSU report.

Soon after taking office and without consulting Congress, the Trump administration suspended some grants that tribal communities used heavily, such as community change grants, distributed by the EPA’s Offices of Environmental Justice and of External Civil Rights Compliance during the Biden administration, to support climate resilience and clean energy. Distributed as a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the grants were suspended as part of the Trump administration’s anti-diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

The grants helped tribal communities in the Northwest tremendously, according to Fast Horse.

“They were providing hundreds of thousands of dollars to communities for infrastructure improvements, like access to clean drinking water and climate resilience hubs, just really essential pieces of community development for health and safety of communities,” she said.

The report stresses a multiplier effect from investments made in tribal communities. Infrastructure dollars invested on tribal lands often serve as anchors for broader local development, since tribal lands often share regional infrastructure like power grids, roads or water systems with non-Native communities, with the power of dollars rippling outward into surrounding rural towns and cities.

Bobby Cochran, a researcher with Portland State University and senior project manager at the National Policy Consensus Center, co-authored the report.

“We just haven’t made a major investment in infrastructure since the ’60s or ’70s, so this wasn’t fluffy,” he said. “It’s really important stuff that was just trying to play catch-up.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_2130-1024x6831758978260.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=1VtCohkB,N,,2025-09-27 17:00:49.774909

Cross-Border

UK new trade measures with emerging economies

On 10 July, the UK Government announced new measures to simplify imports from emerging economies and make it easier for businesses to trade with the UK. Goods from countries such as Nigeria, Sri Lanka and the Philippines will enter tariff free. Bangladesh and Cambodia will continue to benefit from zero tariffs on clothing and electronics. The measures are facilitated via the ‘Developing Countries Trading Scheme’. They aim to build resilience into supply chains and open up new opportunities. The updated rules are part of the UK’s Trade for Development offer. This is designed to boost partner countries’ economies and provide UK businesses and consumers with access to quality, affordable goods.

Impact: The announcement could help businesses secure existing supply chains, particularly in clothing and electronics. It could also provide new supply routes and opportunities with emerging markets.

UK-France industrial strategy partnership

On 11 July, the UK and France announced a new Industrial Strategy Partnership, the first initiative of its kind in Europe. It is intended to enhance economic cooperation and attract significant investment. Over £1 billion in confirmed investment deals were secured, which are expected to generate thousands of highly skilled jobs within the UK. This initiative aligns with the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy, the ten-year plan designed to foster a resilient, high-skilled economy.

The partnership will prioritise key growth sectors such as technology, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. Advancing the green and digital transition and reinforce economic resilience.

Impact: A key component of the partnership is strengthening co-operation to secure supply chains around critical minerals. This is expected to increase methodologies for supply chain analysis and mapping in shared priority sectors of interest. For businesses using critical minerals in their products, this partnership could be a welcome development.

UK-India trade deal signed

On 24 July, the UK and India signed a trade deal, first announced on 6 May. It aims to create trading opportunities between the countries. The deal strives for job creation as a result of Indian investment, export wins, and liberalised tariffs. Commitments have also been made for closer collaboration in the fields of defence, education, climate, technology and innovation. Alongside cooperating on matters of national security and organised crime.

Impact: Indian businesses could benefit from greater access to UK markets, particularly in competitive sectors such as textiles and food processing. The deal could provide new opportunities in global supply chains. The UK Government states that in the long term the deal is expected to increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion, UK GDP by £4.8 billion and wages by £2.2 billion each year.

EU-US trade deal

On 27 July, the European Commission and US Administration agreed a new EU-US trade deal.

A 15% US tariff ceiling will apply to nearly all EU exports currently subject to reciprocal tariffs. Where the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff exceeds 15%, the MFN rate will apply.

Strategic EU products like aircraft and aircraft parts, certain chemicals, certain drug generics or natural resources will benefit from reduced tariffs to pre-2025 levels. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are temporarily subject to MFN tariffs pending the outcome of US Section 232 investigations. Alcohol tariffs remain unresolved.

The EU plans to spend $750 billion over three years on US LNG, oil, and nuclear energy to replace Russian supplies. It also plans to buy €40 billion in US AI chips to safeguard its technological leadership. EU companies have expressed intentions of $600 billion in additional investment in US sectors by 2029, alongside commitments to purchase US military equipment.

Impact: EU carmakers could benefit from a 15% US tariff cap, down from 25%, boosting supply chain stability. In pharmaceuticals, 15% US tariff may potentially raise costs. This is estimated to be between $13 billion and $19 billion. US tariffs on EU steel and aluminium imports will remain at 50%. Steel, aluminium, and copper sectors could be protected through joint tariff rate quotas and fair competition measures. Non-tariff barriers may be reduced via cooperation on mutual recognition of assessments in various industrial sectors. US agricultural producers gain €7.5 billion in improved EU access, while EU farmers retain protections for sensitive products. Enhanced cooperation on LNG and renewables could strengthen EU energy security.

For more insight on what businesses need to know see our EU–US Trade Deal briefing.

EU mutual recognition agreement with Canada

On 1 August, the EU-Canada AEO Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) officially entered into force, aiming to enhance trade security.

The agreement enables mutual recognition of the EU’s Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) and Canada’s Partners in Protection (PIP) programmes. With the intention of streamlining customs procedures for compliant businesses.

Impact: Businesses could benefit from faster customs clearance, and simplified compliance.

Automated data exchange improves supply chain transparency and reduces delays. The agreement may also enhance business continuity during disruptions, allowing priority clearance for certified operators in emergencies.

UK-EU deal to reduce border checks

On 18 August, the UK Government announced the suspension of extra border checks on live animal imports from the EU and specific animal and plant products from Ireland / Northern Ireland.

This comes ahead of a new sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) deal with the EU (first unveiled at the UK-EU summit in May). It will establish a UK-EU SPS zone and aims to make the trading of food both cheaper and easier. This could strengthen food supply chains.

A risk-based approach is being adopted to manage biosecurity and the position will be reviewable.

This suspension follows from the announcement in June that checks on medium risk fruit and vegetables from the EU would not be brought into force in July 2025 but suspended until end of January 2027.

Impact: The precise terms of the SPS agreement are still to be finalised. Businesses involved in food and agricultural supply could ultimately benefit from reduced costs.

US-Japan trade agreement implemented

On 5 September President Trump signed an Executive Order implementing a US-Japan trade framework. It confirms that a 15% tariff rate will apply to most imported Japanese goods. Where higher rate tariffs already apply they will continue to apply, with some sector-specific exceptions including for automotive and aerospace sectors. The order also makes generic pharmaceuticals, including ingredients and chemical precursors eligible for zero rate tariffs. Also detailed in the Executive Order are commitments made by Japan to invest $550 billion in critical industries the United States.

Impact: Exemptions to the new baseline tariffs aim to address supply chain vulnerabilities in key industries. Businesses in the automotive sector will benefit from the new baseline rate, as Japanese automobiles and auto-parts were previously subject to 25% tariffs.

Asia

China: First national standard for hazardous chemicals in electrical products

On 22 August, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced a new mandatory national standard. Requirements for the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products will be effective 1 August 2027. The standard restricts four heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium) and six persistent organic pollutants (including polybrominated biphenyls, diphenyl ethers, and four phthalates). Requirements cover labelling, disclosure, and traceability of hazardous substances.

MIIT’s stated aims include promotion of green supply chains, consumer health protection and encouraging digital labelling. The standard will form part of China’s broader Restriction of Hazardous Substances framework and aims to align with international standards.

Impact: Businesses that manufacture, import, or sell electrical and electronic products in China should take advantage of the transition period until August 2027. They may consider reviewing supply chains to ensure compliant materials, substance testing, and maintenance of detailed technical documentation. Failure to comply may result in exclusion from the market.

China: New guidelines for strengthening financial support for industrialization issued

On 5 August 2025, the People’s Bank of China and six other authorities published guidelines to strengthen financial support for new industrialization. The stated aim is to establish a financial system tailored to support the development of the advanced manufacturing sector by 2027. Support measures focus on industry innovation, developing modern industry systems, balanced regional growth, and improving financial institutions. The guidelines call for optimized financial tools to support emerging industries such as connected vehicles, semiconductors and advanced manufacturing. Upgrading of traditional industries, and financing of supply chains is also addressed.

Impact: The guidelines are intended to encourage and accelerate investment. Critical and emerging industries may benefit from strengthened measures to support supply chains. Businesses in traditional industries may be able to access increased financial support to develop their strategies in digitalization and sustainable operations.

China: Battery technology export restrictions amended

On 15 July, the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Technology (MOFCOM) updated the Catalogue of Technologies Subject to Export Prohibitions and Restrictions. Now included are key technologies related to:

battery cathode materials, including lithium iron phosphate (LFP)

lithium extraction and processing

non-ferrous metal smelting and rolling technologies, including gallium extraction technologies

These technologies are critical to the clean energy, electric vehicle (EV), and semiconductor industries. LFP cathode materials technology is central to the production of cost-effective and high-performance EV batteries. Gallium extraction technologies are used to produce a critical material used in semiconductors.

MOFCOM’s stated aim is to balance technological development of technologies used in sensitive sectors with national economic security.

Impact: Since 15 July 2025, manufacturers exporting these technologies are required to obtain a government licence. Businesses that engage in joint ventures, licensing, or technical services agreements may also require licences. There are several steps to gaining approval for exporting restricted technologies, with applications potentially subject to multiple reviews.

Europe

EU: Safety of products online – first sweep to check compliance

On 18 July, EU Consumer Safety Network published the results of its first product safety sweep under the General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR). This focussed on childcare articles (such as baby carriers, bottles, soothers and highchairs). It covered online marketplaces’ compliance with obligations under the GPSR. It focussed on the very large online platforms (under the Digital Services Act) in addition to smaller providers and assessed them against the criteria of:

display of minimum product safety information and traceability

enforcement activities of the market surveillance authorities

registration with the Safety Gate Portal

Impact: As these sweeps commence, now could be a good time for businesses to check compliance with the requirements of the GPSR. Any supply chain issues identified with third party suppliers could help avoid potential regulatory action and reputational damage.

EU: Strategies for stockpiling and medical countermeasures

On 9 July 2025, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever EU strategies for stockpiling and medical countermeasures. The plan calls for building and coordinating reserves of essential items for crises like pandemics, natural disasters, or military threats. It includes doubling funding for the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to €200 million by 2027 and creating a Medical Countermeasures Accelerator.

Impact: This strategy could prompt businesses to reassess supply chain resilience and inventory management. Demand for medical and safety supplies may raise. Businesses working in logistics and warehousing could see demand rise for specialist storage and distribution. Collaboration between civil and defence sectors may open new procurement avenues. UK

EU: 18th package of sanctions against Russia adopted

On 18 July, the EU adopted its 18th package of sanctions against Russia. It expands restrictions on finance, energy, and trade in advanced military and industrial goods. New measures aim to prevent circumvention via third countries, introducing a ‘catch-all’ authorisation for certain exports if they might end up in Russia. Bans on “Economically Critical Goods” used in construction and transport are extended, and new designations include third-country entities involved in supplying military goods to Russia. Similar restrictions now apply to Belarus, with additional sanctions designations targeting its military sector. These changes are designed to disrupt Russia’s military-industrial complex and increase the overall effectiveness of EU sanctions.

Impact: It is anticipated that there will be an increasing focus on ensuring the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed against Russia, and therefore greater emphasis on extraterritorial measures. Accordingly, businesses will need to be even more mindful of potential stakeholder risks, and step up compliance measures across all stages of the supply chain. Businesses should also look out for the 19th package of sanctions – its presentation is currently delayed due to negotiations between EU Member States as to how be to respond to the Trump administration’s demand that the EU be more proactive in depriving Russia of energy revenues.

For a more detailed overview of the 18th package, please see our briefing here.

EU: Updates to EU Dual-Use Export Control List

On 8 September, the European Commission announced updates to the EU Dual-Use List (as set out in Annex I of Regulation 2021/821).

The 2025 amendments include a number of new entries to the EU Dual-Use List, including:

quantum technology (including quantum computers, cryogenic components, parametric signal amplifiers, cryogenic cooling systems and cryogenic wafer probes)

semiconductor equipment (including manufacturing, testing equipment and materials)

advanced computing components

high-temperature application coatings

peptide synthesisers (that are automated and capable of generating peptides at a system synthesis scale of 1mmol or greater)

The new controls will enter into force following the usual two-month scrutiny period for the European Council and European Parliament, allowing stakeholders to assess the impact and prepare for compliance.

Impact: Exporters across the EU should review the updated list to determine whether their products now fall under the revised controls. This is particularly relevant for companies operating in quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing and biotechnology fields. It is important to emphasize that some of the new control entries represent unilateral controls by the EU on items, including certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which are not currently subject to UK export controls. This misalignment may reflect a broader shift away from streamlining controls across jurisdictions to unilateral and protectionist measures impacting emerging technologies. For businesses trading globally and impacted by these new entries, it will be important to identify the differences between the relevant control lists and to obtain appropriate licences to continue cross-border trade.

EU: New guidance on “best efforts obligations”

In August, the EU Sanctions Helpdesk published an article, ‘The “Best Efforts” Rule under sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus’, providing new guidance on the obligation that EU parents to undertake ‘best efforts’ to ensure that its non-EU subsidiaries do not undermine EU sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus. This requirement was introduced in June 2024.

Importantly, it encourages EU parents to apply the ‘best efforts’ obligation to all EU sanctions, even if the legal requirement only applies to EU sanctions on Russia and Belarus. It also clarifies:

the act of ‘undermining’ sanctions refers to actions that weaken the effectiveness of sanctions without (in)directly violating them, which is different to a breach or circumvention of sanctions

‘best efforts’ involves a higher standard than ‘reasonable efforts’, and comprises all actions that are necessary and feasible in the context of the particular situation and business.

Impact: Businesses should review this guidance carefully to understand its obligations under EU law. Businesses are encouraged to plan ahead – the ‘best efforts’ obligation may only apply to EU sanctions on Russia and Belarus, but sanctions compliance programmes should prepare for the event that this is extended to all EU sanctions.

EU: New import rules apply from 1st September 2025

As of 1st September 2025, the Import Control System 2 (ICS2) is fully deployed across all transport modes, including road and rail. ICS2 is the EU system for collecting cargo details on all goods entering or passing through its borders.

ICS2 demands detailed cargo data before arrival, replacing the former system to improve risk analysis and border security. Timely and accurate Entry Summary Declarations (ENS) are now mandatory. Some Member States and Northern Ireland requested temporary derogations to ease transition for small businesses.

Impact: All businesses shipping in and through the EU must comply with the new rules. Inaccurate data may trigger shipment holds, investigation and potential fines.

UK

UK: Proposals to address late payment culture

On 30 July, the UK Government announced the Small Business Plan, with a focus on a package of proposals aimed at tackling late payment culture, in particular for SME suppliers.

Key proposals include:

limiting payment terms to 60 days, with the possibility of reducing this to 45 days after 5 years

a 30-day invoice verification period, so that invoices cannot be disputed once this has expired

statutory interest on late payment mandatory, removing the ability for parties to use a lower interest rate and making the interest payment automatic

reporting requirements on statutory interest both owed and paid, in order to aid transparency

financial penalties to businesses that persistently pay their suppliers late

investigations into poor payment practices, including acting as arbitrator in disputes and imposing arbitration awards

enhance scrutiny of large companies’ payment practices at audit committee and board level

A consultation on these proposals closes on 23 October 2025.

Impact: If implemented the proposals would supplement the voluntary Fair Payment Code. They could impact all businesses, but particularly large businesses within scope of the payment practices reporting regime. Businesses should review these proposals and consider the impact that the proposed reforms would have on their payment practices and contract terms.

UK: Report on inquiry into forced labour in international supply chains published

On 24 July, the UK Joint Committee on Human Rights published its report on its inquiry into forced labour in international supply chains.

The purpose of the inquiry was to consider the UK legal and voluntary framework. It aimed to check its effectiveness in managing the risks of exposure to forced labour in the UK market.

Key findings and recommendations include:

goods that are produced or part-produced using forced labour are being sold in the UK

the UK is falling behind international partners in its approach to forced labour in supply chains

the reporting duty in Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 should be strengthened

there is a willingness in the UK business sector to implement mandatory human rights due diligence; to do so would create a level playing field without putting responsible businesses at a disadvantage

new legislation is needed to establish

whilst the UK includes provisions on human rights and labour rights in some of its international agreements, there is no official policy on approach to this and no mechanisms to assess the impact of these clauses, and this should be addressed

the green energy transition creates specific risks of forced labour in supply chains because of the reliance on critical minerals and polysilicon

Impact: The inquiry will help inform the Government’s review of measures to tackle forced labour and increase transparency in global supply chains. This was promised in the December 2024 response to the House of Lords Modern Slavery Act 2015 Committee report. The Government now has two months to respond to the report. It is unclear whether it will commit to take legislative action in this area, and if it is likely to see a shift towards mandatory human rights due diligence.

UK: Product Regulation and Metrology Act 2025

On 21 July, the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill received Royal Assent, becoming the Product Regulation and Metrology Act 2025 (PRM Act). It aims to create a framework that gives the Secretary of State powers to make regulations to reduce or mitigate risks posed by products. This includes holding online marketplaces to account for unsafe products sold via their platforms. Certain categories of product are excluded from the scope of the PRM Act, including food, plants, animal by-products and products of animal origin, aircraft and their components, military equipment and medicines and medical devices.

The Government has announced its intention to use the PRM Act to introduce new requirements on online marketplaces to:

prevent unsafe products being made available to consumers

ensure that their sellers comply with product safety laws

provide consumers with relevant product information

cooperate with regulators

Impact: The actions of manufacturers, importers and distributors along a supply chain could come under increased regulatory scrutiny. The UK Government has indicated that they are prepared to enact further legislation as global supply chains get more complex and interconnected.

UK: Tax implications for umbrella companies

On 21 July, the UK Government announced draft legislation forming part of the draft Finance Bill, amending Part 2 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA 2003). It aims to make recruitment agencies accountable for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) on payments made on or after 6 April 2026 to workers supplied through umbrella companies (or the end client, where there is no agency).

The legislation aims to make the agency and umbrella company jointly and severally liable. Allowing HMRC to pursue either or both. If there is more than one agency in the supply chain, the rules will apply to the agency that has the direct contract with the end client to supply the worker.

Impact: Businesses should ensure their supply chain documentation and due diligence meet UFLPA compliance. Transparent supply chain documentation, meeting all import requirements, should help mitigate enforcement risks and subsequent reputational damage.

For more insight on the draft legislation, see our briefing.

GB/Northern Ireland: New powers to impose ‘not for EU’ labelling on goods on the GB market

On 1 July, the Marking of Retail Goods Regulations 2025 came into force. The Northern Ireland Retail Movement Scheme (Scheme) makes it easier to move goods from Great Britain (GB) to Northern Ireland (NI). In order to come within scope of the scheme, goods have to be individually labelled as “not for EU”.

These new regulations are intended to stop businesses from pulling out of the NI market because of these labelling requirements. Empowering the Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs to introduce ‘not for EU’ labelling for specified categories of retail goods that are placed on the GB market. In other words, the labelling requirements become the same for those goods in both the NI and GB markets. This can only happen if there is evidence that the supply of a retail good is, or is likely to be, seriously adversely affected by relevant business operators withdrawing from the NI market because of the ‘not for EU’ labelling requirements under the Scheme.

Impact: These regulations will impact all businesses selling retail goods in GB and/or NI. These businesses could see supply chain disruption, but the Secretary of State has stated that the risks will be monitored.

UK: Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation publishes guidance on sanctions circumvention

On 4 August, the Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation (OTSI) published ‘Countering Russian sanctions evasion – guidance for businesses’, which aims to support UK businesses in identifying export control and sanctions circumvention practices. The guidance sets out key circumvention data, including a list of goods that are seen to be at a generally greater risk of being diverted and re-exported to Russia, and a list of third-countries where entities continue to sell sensitive goods to Russia. It also identifies a number of potential red flag indicators of export control and sanctions evasion.

The guidance also shares best practice in relation to due diligence. This is split into four categories: product, customer, transaction, and export destination.

Impact: Businesses are responsible for determining its specific sanctions risk exposure and implementing an appropriate set of safeguards and controls to mitigate such risk. These safeguards and controls, especially relating to due diligence practices, should be informed by the suggestions set out in this guidance to protect against emerging methods of circumvention.

UK: New sanctions targeting Russia’s oil fleet

On 12 September, the UK launched a new round of sanctions that target 70 ships transporting Russian oil, as well as 30 entities and individuals identified to be supplying the Russian military with equipment used in weapon systems. The UK Government states this is in response to Russian air strikes violating NATO airspace in Poland. Impact: Businesses should continue to review the lists of sanctioned entities and individuals and manage dealings accordingly to ensure compliance with all UK sanctions on Russia.

US

US: New tariffs on copper imports announced

On 30 July, the US Administration announced increased tariffs of 50% on imported copper products. The increased rate applies from 1 August 2025. It applies to semi-finished copper products, including copper pipes, wires, rods and sheets. It also applies to copper-intensive derivative goods, such as cables and electrical components. The new rate does not apply to raw forms of copper, anode and cathode material or copper scrap.

The proclamation also directs the Secretary of Commerce to take steps to boost the US domestic copper industry. This includes a requirement that 25% of high-quality copper scrap produced in the US must be sold in the US. Additionally, from 2027 25% of copper input materials produced in the US will be required to be sold domestically. The requirement will rise to 30% in 2028 and 40% in 2029. Copper input materials include products such as copper ores, concentrates, mattes, cathodes, and anodes.

Impact: Businesses importing affected copper products may experience price increases and disruption to their supply chains. Electric vehicle manufacturers, defence, electronics and AI industries could be particularly affected. The housebuilding sector may also be impacted, with potential increased construction costs.

US: Draft Ensuring Safe and Toxic-Free Foods Act of 2025

On 17 July, a Senate bill was introduced which aims to end the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) self-affirming pathway for food substances. It would require Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for all GRAS determinations, including food ingredients, packaging and contact materials.

If enacted it would introduce public posting of GRAS notices and a 60-day comment period. It would also expand the FDA’s Food Chemical Reassessment Program. This would introduce reassessment of 10 substances every three years. Substances relying solely on industry self-GRAS determinations would be considered unsafe two years after enactment.

Impact: Businesses involved in food manufacture, packaging and contact materials may want to proactively assess their processes and supply chains. Businesses could expect increased scrutiny and reassessment of ingredients. Several large food and beverage companies have recently announced reformulation of popular products, particularly in relation to synthetic dyes.

US: Export Control Transparency Act becomes law

On 19 August 2025, the Maintaining American Superiority by Improving Export Control Transparency Act was signed into law. The new law aims to increase transparency in the US Department of Commerce export control system. The Department must now provide Congress with annual reports on all export license requests to covered entities.

In addition to aggregated statistics, the report must contain information on all license applications, including:

the name of the entity submitting the application

a brief description of the item (including the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and reason for control, if applicable)

the name and location of the end-user

a value estimate

decision with respect to the license application or authorization

the date of submission

the date, location, and result of any end-use checks

Impact: Affected businesses may face increased scrutiny of their due diligence processes, including historic license applications. Significant penalties may apply if businesses are found to be in breach of export control rules. US businesses may consider reviewing their compliance practices, specifically those relating to end-user and end-use verification.

US: 407 product categories added to steel and aluminium tariffs

On August 19, the Department of Commerce announced an additional list of products to be covered by tariffs. The steel and aluminium content of these products will now be subject to a 50% duty rate. Among the 407 additional product categories now included are:

wind turbines and their parts and components

mobile cranes

bulldozers and other heavy equipment

railcars

furniture

compressors and pumps

The affected product list now encompasses industrial and chemical products, as well as consumer and personal care goods. There are three annual periods for public steel and aluminium product inclusion requests. The next opportunity opens in September and will be announced in the Federal Register.

Impact: Businesses should review the full list of affected product categories, and evaluate their sourcing strategies and pricing models if required. Importers will need to comply with new requirements, including verifying the origin and processing of affected products. Businesses may also consider preparing submissions for any products they believe should be excluded in the next inclusions request window.

US: Updated forced labour in China strategy

On August 19, the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force of the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies, announced a new strategy to strengthen enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). This is aimed at preventing goods made with forced labour in China from entering the domestic market.

The new strategy adds five new high-risk sectors:

caustic soda

jujubes

copper

lithium

steel

The UFLPA Entity List now includes 144 banned entities. The update strengthens Customs and Border Protection’s ability to detect and stop such imports. It also aims to help domestic businesses reduce reputational and regulatory risks in their supply chains.

Impact: Businesses should ensure their supply chain documentation and due diligence meet UFLPA requirements. Transparent supply chain documentation could help prevent enforcement risks and any ensuing reputational damage.

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-27 17:04:55+00:00,www.royalgazette.com,We must choose clean energy – not LNG - The Royal Gazette,Not Available,,,,,https://www.royalgazette.com/opinion-writer/opinion/article/20250927/we-must-choose-clean-energy-not-lng/,"The Bermuda Environmental Sustainability Taskforce strongly urges the Regulatory Authority to chart an ambitious path towards renewable energy — and to firmly reject proposals to introduce liquefied natural gas.
Since the last IRP was issued, the cost of renewable energy has plummeted.
The case for renewables A clean energy transition is not just environmentally sound; it’s economically smart.
The sun is rising on a clean energy age… There are no price spikes for sunlight.
The Regulatory Authority has a rare opportunity to set Bermuda on a path towards clean, resilient, home-grown energy.","Our future depends on bold renewable targets, not another fossil fuel detour. Bermuda stands at a critical crossroads in shaping its energy future. The next integrated resource plan will lock in our electricity mix for decades. The choices made now will ripple through our economy, our environment and our climate resilience for generations.

The Bermuda Environmental Sustainability Taskforce strongly urges the Regulatory Authority to chart an ambitious path towards renewable energy — and to firmly reject proposals to introduce liquefied natural gas. Bermuda must move away from fossil fuels, not towards new ones. LNG would bind our island to long-term carbon emissions, price volatility and environmental risks — directly undermining our climate commitments.

Since the last IRP was issued, the cost of renewable energy has plummeted. We see no reason why the RA could justify allowing LNG now after rejecting it seven years ago.

LNG is the wrong choice

LNG is not a bridge to the future; it is a roadblock.

• Climate incompatibility: LNG is still a fossil fuel. Building new LNG infrastructure would lock in decades of carbon emissions just as the world is racing to cut them

• Environmental risk: LNG facilities carry major safety and spill hazards. Methane leaks trap 40 times more heat than carbon dioxide over their 12-year life span

• Physical impracticality: Bermuda’s small size and dense development make it virtually impossible to build LNG terminals with the required safety buffer zones

• Economic liability: LNG prices are volatile, and costly infrastructure will likely become stranded assets as the world rapidly transitions to clean energy

• Lost opportunity: Every dollar spent on LNG delays investment in renewable energy systems that will power Bermuda’s future.

The case for renewables

A clean energy transition is not just environmentally sound; it’s economically smart. The next IRP should commit to:

• High renewable targets: Set clear milestones for solar, wind and battery storage to cut emissions, create local jobs, and strengthen energy independence

• Accelerated floating solar: The RA’s proposed 10mW floating solar system could supply a meaningful share of Bermuda’s daytime power while overcoming land constraints. This should be fast-tracked and paired with battery storage

• Vehicle-to-grid integration: Electric vehicles can serve as mobile batteries, storing surplus solar and feeding it back into the grid during peak demand. This would reduce the need for expensive peaker engines while empowering consumers

• Energy efficiency: Incentivise building retrofits, efficient appliances and stronger codes to lower consumption and household costs

• Equity and inclusion: Ensure a just transition that protects low-income residents and includes broad community participation, so the benefits of clean energy are shared by all

• Grid diversity: When a Category 5 hurricane hits Bermuda, barely a telephone pole will be left standing. The only people with power will be solar-energy producers with stand-alone battery storage or a parked EV car with battery. This is our future

A vision for 2040

Imagine a Bermuda powered by 80 per cent to 100 per cent renewables by 2040. Homes and businesses run on abundant local energy from rooftop and floating solar, supported by offshore wind and advanced storage systems. Our vehicles double as grid assets. Energy bills are stable, our air is cleaner and our economy is more resilient.

This is the future we can choose — if we act now.

No time to lose

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has said: “We are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age… There are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind.”

He’s right. Ninety per cent of renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels. The smart economic choice and the moral imperative are one and the same.

The Regulatory Authority has a rare opportunity to set Bermuda on a path towards clean, resilient, home-grown energy. BEST calls on the RA to reject LNG proposals and embrace a bold renewable vision. Doing so would cut emissions, enhance energy security, protect our fragile environment and build a healthier, more prosperous future for everyone who calls Bermuda home.

Michael Rulli’s bill drew support from enough Democrats in the House of Representatives that it is now moving to the Senate, which will consider whether it is necessary to back up the executive order that, among other things, called for reinstating the group that provides guidance on the future of coal technologies and markets.

And Rulli, R-Ohio, is right.

It is important for those making decisions about our energy future to have information and guidance from coal producers, users, equipment suppliers, state and local officials, and other stakeholders across the coal value chain.

Lawmakers will do well, however, to address criticisms of such a group by advising its members that — as an accessory to the federal government — it works for us, rather than to serve its own interests.

But if it is necessary to hear from coal stakeholders, in this era of all-of-the-above, responsible energy diversification and expansion, the Department of Energy should seek out other similar councils filled with representatives of other energy industries.

A quick glance at the lists of advisory councils and committees working with the department shows there is a State Energy Advisory Board, which develops recommendations “regarding initiation, design, implementation, and evaluation of federal energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.”

But if there are other groups advising on renewables, they are impossible to find amid the National Petroleum Council, Ultra-Deepwater Advisory Committee (for natural gas and other petroleum resources), even the Unconventional Resources Technology Advisory Committee … meant to “advise on the development and implementation of programs related to onshore unconventional natural gas and other petroleum resources.” The list is quite a long one.

Eyebrow-raising references to Paul Revere in his comments about the bill aside, Rulli is right that our energy future is a matter of national security.

For that very reason, lawmakers MUST remember that just as we need to hear from stakeholders in the coal industry, we also need to hear from those working to provide energy via renewables and other ways that are not simply the way things have always been done.

The third DRC-Africa Battery Metals Forum is set to take place on September 29-30, 2023, in Kolwezi, under the theme ""Leveraging foreign interest in critical minerals to boost the country's economy."" This premier engagement platform brings together stakeholders across Africa's critical minerals transition sector, marking a significant shift from previous editions held in Kinshasa to the heart of DRC's mining region.

What is the DRC-Africa Battery Metals Forum?

The DRC-Africa Battery Metals Forum serves as a vital platform connecting key players in the battery metals ecosystem. The event facilitates dialogue and collaboration among producers of essential battery metals including cobalt, copper, lithium, nickel, graphite, manganese, and rare earths, alongside investors, manufacturers, technology providers, traders, end-users, and policymakers.

According to the World Bank's ""Minerals for Climate Action"" report, production of minerals like graphite, lithium, and cobalt could increase by nearly 500% by 2050 to meet growing demand for clean energy technologies. Forums like this are critical in addressing the complex supply chain challenges these growth projections present.

The gathering focuses on practical solutions for developing sustainable supply chains while maximizing economic benefits for host countries. Previous forum editions have resulted in significant partnership announcements and policy initiatives aimed at improving traceability and sustainability in the battery metals investment sector.

Why is Kolwezi Significant for Battery Metals?

The Strategic Importance of Lualaba Province

Kolwezi, the capital of Lualaba Province, represents a crucial hub in the global battery metals supply chain. The region has maintained its status as a significant mining center since the 1940s, with particularly abundant reserves of:

Copper: Essential for electrical conductivity in batteries and EVs

Cobalt: Critical for cathode stability and performance in lithium-ion batteries

The selection of Kolwezi as the forum's venue underscores the growing recognition of Lualaba Province's central role in the battery metals ecosystem. According to the US Geological Survey, the Katangan Copperbelt, which includes Kolwezi, contains some of the world's highest-grade copper and cobalt deposits, with ore grades averaging 3-5% for copper and 0.2-0.4% for cobalt—significantly higher than global averages.

Geological Wealth and Production Capacity

Kolwezi sits atop one of the world's richest mineral belts, containing:

Approximately 45-50% of global cobalt reserves

Significant copper deposits estimated at over 70 million tonnes

Additional critical minerals including manganese and rare earths

The geological formation of the Katangan Copperbelt dates back approximately 800 million years, when sedimentary deposits rich in copper and cobalt were formed in ancient marine basins. Over time, these deposits were subjected to intense heat and pressure, creating the exceptionally high-grade ore bodies that define the region today.

This natural endowment positions Kolwezi as a cornerstone of the global energy transition, providing essential materials for renewable energy technologies and electric vehicle manufacturing. The region's deposits feature unique mineralogical characteristics that make them particularly valuable for battery production, including high cobalt-to-copper ratios and relatively low levels of arsenic and other problematic elements compared to competing sources.

Who Are the Key Participants in the Forum?

Government Leadership and Representation

The forum will feature addresses from prominent government officials including:

H.E. Fifi Masuka Saini, Governor of Lualaba Province

H.E. Louis Watum, DRC Minister of Mines

Forum sessions will examine innovative approaches to water treatment and recycling that can reduce both environmental impact and operational costs.

These discussions reflect growing recognition that environmental performance is increasingly linked to market access for battery materials. Major battery and EV manufacturers have established stringent environmental criteria for their supply chains, making environmental performance a commercial necessity rather than just a regulatory requirement.

Social License and Community Relations

The forum will examine approaches to strengthening relationships between mining operations and local communities through:

Transparent benefit-sharing mechanisms

Community development initiatives

Local procurement and employment programs

Research by the International Finance Corporation suggests that social conflicts can cost major mining projects up to $20 million per week in delayed production. Effective community engagement is therefore both a social responsibility and a business imperative.

Case studies of successful community engagement will be shared to establish best practices across the sector. These include innovative models for participatory environmental monitoring, where community members are trained and equipped to independently verify companies' environmental performance.

How Does the DRC-Africa Battery Metals Forum Impact Global Supply Chains?

Strategic Positioning in the Energy Transition

The forum recognizes the DRC's pivotal role in enabling global decarbonization through:

Providing essential materials for battery manufacturing

The global residential solar market, after years of robust expansion, entered a period of contraction, leading to a significant slowdown in installations and a re-rating of valuations across the industry.

A pivotal factor contributing to the decline was the growing uncertainty surrounding crucial clean energy tax credits. In May 2025, a GOP bill passed by the House of Representatives aimed to significantly reduce or eliminate tax benefits, including the 30% federal tax credit for homeowners installing solar rooftop systems (Section 25D). This legislative threat, coupled with critical remarks on the sector from President Trump in August 2025, sent shockwaves through the market, directly impacting investor confidence in companies like Enphase that rely heavily on these incentives.

Compounding these external pressures, Enphase faced internal challenges, particularly margin compression. The company grappled with rising input costs, reciprocal tariffs, and higher component costs. New tariffs were projected to reduce gross margin by approximately 2% in Q2 2025, with a potential 6%-8% total impact in Q3 2025. This erosion of profitability highlighted the company's reliance on Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, without which underlying gross margins were considerably thinner. Softening U.S. demand, partly due to seasonality and California's net metering reform, and a slowdown in European markets due to unfavorable government policies further weighed on revenue growth.

The timeline of disappointing financial results further fueled the stock's turbulence. In Q4 2024, while revenue saw a slight sequential increase, the Q1 2025 revenue forecast suggested a decline. Q1 2025 results confirmed this trend, with total revenue of $356.1 million representing a decrease from the prior quarter, and U.S. revenue falling approximately 13%. The company missed adjusted earnings estimates and provided Q2 revenue guidance well below analyst expectations, leading to a nearly 9.3% stock drop. Although Q2 2025 results showed some stabilization, the Q3 revenue guidance of $350 million (midpoint) again fell short, triggering another 5.9% decline, underscoring the persistent struggle to meet market expectations.

Shifting Fortunes: Winners and Losers in a Volatile Market

The significant turbulence experienced by Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) has created a ripple effect across the solar energy sector, delineating potential winners and losers among its competitors and partners. Companies with diversified revenue streams, stronger balance sheets, or less exposure to the residential solar segment, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, might be better positioned to weather the storm. Conversely, those heavily reliant on residential installations or similar policy-driven incentives could face similar, if not greater, challenges.

One potential beneficiary could be larger, more diversified energy companies or utilities (e.g., NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK)) that are involved in renewable energy but are not solely dependent on residential solar equipment sales. Their scale and broader energy portfolios might offer more resilience against market fluctuations and policy shifts. Additionally, companies focusing on commercial or utility-scale solar projects, which often operate under different regulatory and incentive structures, might see relatively stable demand compared to the beleaguered residential segment.

Conversely, direct competitors to Enphase, especially those in the microinverter and solar inverter space, such as SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ: SEDG), have also been deeply affected by the same industry headwinds. SolarEdge, which also relies heavily on residential and commercial solar installations, has faced similar pressures from slowing demand, inventory gluts, and policy uncertainties. The entire solar equipment manufacturing segment is under scrutiny, and companies with weaker financial positions or less innovative product pipelines might struggle to survive if the downturn persists.

Installers and distributors of solar equipment (e.g., Sunrun (NASDAQ: RUN), SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR)) are also caught in the crossfire. A slowdown in equipment sales directly impacts their installation volumes and profitability. While lower equipment costs due to oversupply might offer some margin relief, the overarching issue of reduced end-user demand and uncertain tax credits presents a significant headwind. Companies that can adapt their business models, perhaps by offering more comprehensive energy management solutions or focusing on energy storage, may fare better than those solely focused on panel installations.

Broader Implications: A Shifting Landscape for Renewable Energy

The challenges faced by Enphase Energy are not isolated but symptomatic of broader, systemic shifts within the renewable energy sector, particularly solar. This turbulence underscores a critical juncture where the industry is transitioning from a period of rapid, incentive-driven growth to one demanding greater cost efficiency, technological innovation, and resilience against policy uncertainties. The residential solar market, once a darling of investors, is now confronting the realities of market maturity, regulatory reforms, and increased competition.

This event fits into a wider trend of consolidation and re-evaluation across the clean energy landscape. Many companies that thrived on generous government subsidies are now facing a more competitive environment where profitability and sustainable business models are paramount. The potential reduction or elimination of federal tax credits, as proposed in the House bill in May 2025, highlights the precariousness of policy-dependent growth. This could accelerate the shakeout of weaker players and force a greater emphasis on unsubsidized economic viability for solar installations.

Ripple effects extend to the entire supply chain, from raw material suppliers to financial institutions that fund solar projects. Reduced demand and margin compression at the manufacturing level can lead to decreased orders, oversupply, and price wars, impacting profitability for all stakeholders. Moreover, the decline in investor confidence in a leading company like Enphase could make it harder for smaller, less established renewable energy firms to secure funding, potentially stifling innovation and market entry.

Historically, the renewable energy sector has experienced boom-and-bust cycles, often tied to government incentives and technological breakthroughs. The current downturn shares similarities with past periods of market correction, where overcapacity and policy shifts led to significant industry restructuring. For instance, the challenges in the early 2010s, following the expiration of certain tax credits and increased competition from Chinese manufacturers, led to bankruptcies and consolidations. The current environment suggests a similar period of recalibration, where companies must demonstrate robust fundamentals beyond just growth potential. Regulatory bodies are also under pressure to provide clear, stable policy frameworks to support long-term investment, as inconsistent policies create significant market volatility.

What Comes Next: Navigating Uncertainty and Seeking New Horizons

The path forward for Enphase Energy and the broader solar sector remains fraught with both challenges and opportunities. In the short term, the market will closely watch for any definitive outcomes regarding federal tax credits. Should the proposed GOP bill to reduce or eliminate incentives gain further traction, it would likely trigger another wave of negative sentiment and potentially force significant strategic pivots across the industry. Conversely, any clarity or reaffirmation of existing incentives could provide a much-needed boost to investor confidence and stabilize stock prices.

For Enphase, strategic adaptations will be crucial. This could involve a stronger focus on international markets less affected by U.S. policy shifts, deeper penetration into the energy storage segment, or even exploring new business models such as providing comprehensive energy management solutions rather than just hardware. The company's strong balance sheet and continued product innovation, such as the IQ Battery 10C and IQ8P Microinverters, provide a foundation for these pivots, but execution will be key to regaining market share and investor trust.

Market opportunities may emerge from this downturn for companies that can innovate around cost efficiencies and develop products that offer compelling value propositions even without significant subsidies. The long-term trajectory towards decarbonization and energy independence remains intact, suggesting that the underlying demand for solar and storage will eventually rebound. Companies that can survive this period of volatility and emerge leaner and more efficient will be well-positioned for future growth.

Potential scenarios range from a continued challenging environment if policy uncertainty persists and demand remains soft, to a gradual recovery driven by technological advancements, new market entries, or a more stable regulatory landscape. A critical outcome will be the industry's ability to reduce its reliance on direct subsidies and compete more effectively on a level playing field with traditional energy sources. This could lead to a stronger, more resilient solar sector in the long run, albeit after a period of significant consolidation and transformation.

Wrap-Up: A Resilient Future for Solar Amidst Current Headwinds

Enphase Energy's (NASDAQ: ENPH) stock turbulence from late 2024 through mid-2025 serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and inherent risks within the rapidly evolving renewable energy sector. The confluence of slowing global demand, significant policy uncertainties surrounding federal tax credits, and persistent margin pressures created a challenging environment that saw the company's shares plummet dramatically. While Enphase boasts a strong balance sheet and continues to innovate with new products, these factors alone were insufficient to counteract the prevailing market headwinds and shifting investor sentiment.

Moving forward, the market will be keenly observing several key indicators. The resolution of policy uncertainties surrounding the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and other clean energy incentives will be paramount. Any legislative clarity that either affirms or modifies these crucial supports will significantly influence investor confidence and the operational strategies of solar companies. Additionally, signs of stabilization or rebound in residential solar demand in key markets like the U.S. and Europe will signal a potential easing of the current downturn.

Investors should watch for Enphase's ability to diversify its revenue streams, enhance cost efficiencies, and strategically expand into new geographies or product segments like energy storage, which may offer more resilient growth avenues. The company's future performance will largely depend on its capacity to navigate this period of intense competition and regulatory flux, adapting its business model to thrive in an environment where sustainable profitability, rather than just rapid growth, becomes the primary metric of success. The long-term vision for a decarbonized energy future remains strong, but the journey there will undoubtedly continue to present both significant hurdles and transformative opportunities for companies like Enphase.

This abrupt termination of incentives, enacted through the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) and significantly shortening the original 2032 timeline, has created a ""gold rush"" at dealerships. The looming deadline is profoundly influencing purchasing decisions, with a notable acceleration in EV and hybrid sales since early summer, as buyers aim to secure substantial savings before they vanish.

This immediate buying spree, however, is juxtaposed with widespread industry predictions of a significant slowdown in EV sales beginning in October. Analysts anticipate a ""speed bump"" for the market, as the absence of federal incentives and a ""payback"" from accelerated summer purchases are expected to temper demand, potentially lasting through the first quarter of next year. The expiration poses a considerable challenge for automakers ramping up EV production and raises concerns about future investment, the stability of green jobs, and the U.S.'s competitive standing in the global EV supply chain.

The Sudden End of an Era: Unpacking the EV Tax Credit's Accelerated Demise

The federal $7,500 EV tax credit, officially known as the New Clean Vehicle Credit, is set to expire on September 30, 2025, a dramatic acceleration from its original 2032 sunset date under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. This rapid curtailment is a direct consequence of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025. This act effectively eliminated the federal EV tax credits for new, used, and leased electric vehicles, along with a $1,000 credit for home EV chargers.

Prior to its expiration, the $7,500 credit for new EVs was contingent on several factors, including North American final assembly, strict critical mineral and battery component sourcing requirements (often splitting the credit into two $3,750 halves), MSRP caps ($80,000 for vans/SUVs/pickups, $55,000 for sedans), and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) limits. A key change implemented in 2024 allowed buyers to transfer the credit to an eligible dealership at the point of sale for an immediate discount. Recent IRS guidance has also clarified that a binding purchase agreement with a deposit made before September 30, 2025, can still qualify for the credit, even if delivery occurs after the deadline, potentially extending eligibility into early 2026 for some consumers.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (P.L. 119-21) represents a significant policy reversal, moving away from technology-specific subsidies for clean energy. Proponents of the OBBBA argued that the EV tax credits disproportionately benefited wealthier households and that non-EV-buying taxpayers were subsidizing EV purchasers. In place of the EV credit, the OBBBA introduced a new auto loan interest deduction, allowing buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on qualifying new U.S.-assembled vehicles (electric, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028, subject to income limits. This shift aims to support broader domestic manufacturing rather than specific vehicle types.

Initial market reactions have been a mix of urgency and apprehension. Dealerships are experiencing a ""gold rush,"" actively advertising ""last chance"" opportunities to clear EV inventory. New EV sales reportedly jumped 18-33% and used EV sales soared 59% in recent months compared to the previous year. Automakers are adjusting sales strategies, with some pushing aggressive campaigns to clear current inventory, while others are re-evaluating production volumes and considering offering their own incentives post-expiration. Key stakeholders include the U.S. government (President Trump, Congress, IRS), automakers (e.g., Tesla, GM, Ford), car dealerships, and consumers racing against the clock.

Navigating the New Landscape: Winners and Losers in a Post-Credit EV Market

The abrupt end of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, will fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape for electric vehicle manufacturers, creating distinct winners and losers as the market shifts from a subsidized environment to one driven by intrinsic value.

Companies heavily reliant on the $7,500 tax credit to make their vehicles competitive, particularly those with higher price points or less established brand loyalty, are most vulnerable. Newer EV manufacturers that have yet to achieve economies of scale and depend on incentives to attract buyers may face substantial headwinds. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN), for instance, saw its R1S models already facing eligibility issues for the federal credit earlier in 2025. The complete expiration will remove a significant incentive for direct purchases, likely leading to reduced sales and increased pressure on profitability, even as the company invests in future, more affordable models like the R2. Similarly, Volkswagen AG (OTCMKTS: VWAGY), whose ID.4 also lost direct purchase eligibility earlier in the year, may see a dip in sales for eligible models, potentially requiring the company to absorb some of the $7,500 cost through internal incentives, impacting per-unit profitability.

Conversely, companies with diversified portfolios, strong brand recognition, established profitability in their EV segments, or those focused on higher-end markets less sensitive to the $7,500 incentive are better positioned. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), despite a reported dip in overall sales in the first half of 2025, has a strong brand, vertical integration, and existing profitability from EVs that provide a degree of insulation. CEO Elon Musk has historically supported the credit's termination, arguing it harmed Tesla. The company's strategic focus on more affordable models for 2025 and its ability to adjust pricing could position it as a long-term winner. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE: HMC) are also well-placed due to their ""hybrid-first"" strategies and diversified product offerings. With slowing pure EV adoption trends, strong hybrid sales could provide stable revenue streams, cushioning the impact of the federal credit's expiration.

Legacy automakers like General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) represent a mixed bag. Both have several eligible EV models, such as the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Ford F-150 Lightning, which benefited from the credit. While they are likely to experience a short-term sales dip for these models, their larger scale, existing dealer networks, and long-term commitment to the EV transition may allow them to implement aggressive internal incentives (rebates, favorable lease terms) to sustain demand. However, this could come at the cost of profitability in the short term. Both companies are also actively working on more affordable EV options to compete effectively in a subsidy-free market.

A Seismic Shift: Broader Implications of the EV Tax Credit's Demise

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, represents a seismic shift, signaling the U.S. EV market's transition from a heavily subsidized environment to one increasingly driven by market forces. While a short-term surge in sales is currently underway, analysts widely anticipate a subsequent temporary dip of 20% to 30% in EV sales in the immediate post-deadline period. This is because the credit effectively made EVs more accessible, particularly for budget-conscious consumers, and its absence will widen the cost gap between EVs and comparable gasoline models.

This policy reversal, orchestrated by the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), reflects a broader recalibration of U.S. energy priorities. The OBBBA not only terminates EV credits but also repeals other clean energy incentives, including those for solar and wind facilities, green hydrogen production, and home electrification. It also eliminates non-compliance penalties for CAFE standards, further reducing pressure on manufacturers to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. This signifies a move away from technology-specific subsidies towards a focus on broader tax relief and supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types, as evidenced by the new auto loan interest deduction.

The ripple effects will be felt across the entire automotive ecosystem. Smaller EV rivals like Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) are particularly vulnerable due to their heavy reliance on incentives. The battery production sector is already experiencing an overcapacity crisis, with BloombergNEF data indicating a 56% plummet in U.S. battery deployment projections since 2022 and $6 billion in manufacturing projects canceled in Q1 2025. This could erode U.S. competitiveness against countries like China, which continues rapid expansion in battery manufacturing. While the expiration of the home charger credit might slow some infrastructure development, the current pre-deadline buying spree could still accelerate broader public charging infrastructure as municipalities respond to heightened EV volumes.

Historically, the removal of government incentives for specific industries has often led to initial market contractions, forcing industries to adapt or consolidate. Comparisons can be drawn to similar events where government support for emerging technologies was withdrawn, often revealing the true market demand and forcing innovation. Studies suggest that eliminating the EV tax credit could lead to a significant decrease in EV sales by 2030, potentially jeopardizing planned U.S. EV assembly plant expansions and making a substantial portion of U.S. battery manufacturing capacity redundant. This underscores the critical role of policy in shaping industrial landscapes and the risk of ceding ground to international competitors who actively support their nascent EV industries.

The Road Ahead: Navigating the Post-Subsidy EV Landscape

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, ushers in a new, challenging phase for the electric vehicle market. In the short term, the immediate aftermath is expected to be a period of significant adjustment. Following the current ""gold rush"" of pre-deadline purchases, analysts widely anticipate a notable dip in EV sales, potentially between 20-30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and into early 2026, as vehicles effectively become thousands of dollars more expensive for consumers. Automakers and dealerships will likely respond by offering their own aggressive incentives, price cuts, and favorable financing options to stimulate demand and manage inventory. State and local incentives will also gain heightened importance as buyers seek alternative forms of financial relief.

In the long term, the EV market will be compelled to mature beyond government subsidies, focusing instead on intrinsic value and market fundamentals. This means a renewed emphasis on cost reduction through technological advancements in battery chemistry and streamlined production processes, aiming for price parity with gasoline cars by 2027. The industry will need to build greater consumer confidence through improved range, faster charging, and a ubiquitous, reliable charging infrastructure. While overall EV adoption is still expected to grow, it will likely be at a slower, more organic pace than initially projected, with some forecasts suggesting a 25% EV sales mix by 2030, rather than the more ambitious 50%. A strategic pivot towards hybrids and plug-in hybrids is also anticipated, serving as a bridge technology for many consumers.

Automakers will need to implement several strategic adaptations. This includes aggressive cost reduction efforts, rethinking global production and sourcing strategies now that North American assembly incentives are gone, and diversifying product offerings to include more affordable EVs and a wider range of hybrid options. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) not only removed the EV credits but also introduced a new auto loan interest deduction. This allows buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on loans for new, U.S.-assembled vehicles (EV, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028. While not a direct replacement for the upfront EV credit, this deduction offers long-term savings and shifts the policy focus to supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types. This could partially offset the financial impact for some buyers who finance U.S.-assembled EVs, but notably excludes leased vehicles.

The Dawn of a New Era: A Market Redefined

The federal EV tax credit's expiration on September 30, 2025, marks a pivotal moment, fundamentally redefining the U.S. electric vehicle market. The immediate takeaway is the unprecedented ""gold rush"" as consumers rush to secure the $7,500 incentive, leading to record sales in the months preceding the deadline. This short-term boom, however, is a precursor to an anticipated slowdown, challenging the industry to prove its long-term viability without direct government subsidies. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) is the legislative instrument behind this shift, moving federal policy away from technology-specific consumer incentives towards broader support for domestic manufacturing through mechanisms like the new auto loan interest deduction.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by a heightened focus on affordability, technological innovation, and robust infrastructure. Automakers will be compelled to aggressively reduce costs, develop more competitively priced EV models, and enhance the overall value proposition to attract a wider consumer base. The long-term success of EVs will hinge on their ability to compete on par with gasoline vehicles based on price, performance, and convenience, rather than relying on purchase incentives. The new auto loan interest deduction, while not EV-exclusive, will indirectly support U.S.-assembled EVs by making financing more attractive, thereby bolstering domestic production.

The lasting impact of this policy shift will be a more resilient, market-driven EV industry. While the immediate transition may be bumpy, it forces a necessary evolution towards greater self-sufficiency and innovation. Investors should closely monitor several key indicators in the coming months: the severity and duration of the post-expiration sales dip, automakers' strategic responses (including pricing, new models, and proprietary incentives), advancements in battery cost reduction, and the continued build-out of charging infrastructure. Furthermore, tracking the effectiveness of the new auto loan interest deduction and observing how state and local incentives evolve will provide crucial insights into the market's trajectory.

Washington, D.C. – In July 2025, Trump and congressional Republicans pushed through the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — better known as the Republican Rate Hike — plunging Americans into a downward spiral of affordability. Donald Trump and Republicans’ agenda is creating a self-inflicted energy crisis. Their law is driving utility costs sky-high, shuttering factories, deepening our dependence on foreign oil, and polluting our air and water, all to fund new tax breaks for billionaires and oil and gas executives. Climate Power today released its inaugural Energy Crisis Snapshot, pulling from a new tracker detailing the rising costs, job losses, power shortages, and abandoned investments caused by Republicans’ nonsensical war on clean energy.

“Trump promised lower bills and more jobs, and Americans are getting the exact opposite,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power. “Trump is undercutting American jobs, driving up energy bills, and destabilizing the grid by gutting the cheapest, fastest power sources available. The Republican war on clean energy serves no one but the Big Oil executives whose campaign checks are clearly paying off.”

The report’s findings include:

• Household electric bills are up 10% nationally since Trump took office, and are poised to spike even further. New analysis from the Center for American Progress and Climate Power shows just how widespread the Republican Rate Hike has become. Since Trump took office, gas and electric utilities in 41 states and D.C. have raised—or are seeking to raise—rates by at least $78.9 billion. The hikes hit more than 80 million electric customers and 28 million gas customers, with families in Missouri, New York, and Illinois facing some of the steepest burdens—up to $500 or more in added annual costs.

• More than 80,500 energy jobs have been lost or delayed between Trump’s election and September 8, 2025. Companies have canceled, delayed, or laid off staff at 142 energy projects in 37 states, representing over $42.80 billion in lost investment. 57 percent of listed projects have been canceled altogether since Trump’s election.

• At the very moment we need more electrons on the grid to service a dramatic increase of data centers being built around the country, 25,013 megawatts of planned energy generation have been lost due to energy projects that were canceled or delayed since Trump’s election.

Nearly 13 million homes in the U.S. could be powered by the energy generation projects that have been canceled or delayed since Trump’s election.

Climate Power will track the fallout from the Republican Rate Hike through a monthly Energy Crisis Snapshot, backed by a weekly business impacts tracker that monitors private clean energy projects facing delays, cancellations, and job losses

since Trump’s inauguration.

This abrupt termination of incentives, enacted through the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) and significantly shortening the original 2032 timeline, has created a ""gold rush"" at dealerships. The looming deadline is profoundly influencing purchasing decisions, with a notable acceleration in EV and hybrid sales since early summer, as buyers aim to secure substantial savings before they vanish.

This immediate buying spree, however, is juxtaposed with widespread industry predictions of a significant slowdown in EV sales beginning in October. Analysts anticipate a ""speed bump"" for the market, as the absence of federal incentives and a ""payback"" from accelerated summer purchases are expected to temper demand, potentially lasting through the first quarter of next year. The expiration poses a considerable challenge for automakers ramping up EV production and raises concerns about future investment, the stability of green jobs, and the U.S.'s competitive standing in the global EV supply chain.

The Sudden End of an Era: Unpacking the EV Tax Credit's Accelerated Demise

The federal $7,500 EV tax credit, officially known as the New Clean Vehicle Credit, is set to expire on September 30, 2025, a dramatic acceleration from its original 2032 sunset date under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. This rapid curtailment is a direct consequence of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025. This act effectively eliminated the federal EV tax credits for new, used, and leased electric vehicles, along with a $1,000 credit for home EV chargers.

Prior to its expiration, the $7,500 credit for new EVs was contingent on several factors, including North American final assembly, strict critical mineral and battery component sourcing requirements (often splitting the credit into two $3,750 halves), MSRP caps ($80,000 for vans/SUVs/pickups, $55,000 for sedans), and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) limits. A key change implemented in 2024 allowed buyers to transfer the credit to an eligible dealership at the point of sale for an immediate discount. Recent IRS guidance has also clarified that a binding purchase agreement with a deposit made before September 30, 2025, can still qualify for the credit, even if delivery occurs after the deadline, potentially extending eligibility into early 2026 for some consumers.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (P.L. 119-21) represents a significant policy reversal, moving away from technology-specific subsidies for clean energy. Proponents of the OBBBA argued that the EV tax credits disproportionately benefited wealthier households and that non-EV-buying taxpayers were subsidizing EV purchasers. In place of the EV credit, the OBBBA introduced a new auto loan interest deduction, allowing buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on qualifying new U.S.-assembled vehicles (electric, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028, subject to income limits. This shift aims to support broader domestic manufacturing rather than specific vehicle types.

Initial market reactions have been a mix of urgency and apprehension. Dealerships are experiencing a ""gold rush,"" actively advertising ""last chance"" opportunities to clear EV inventory. New EV sales reportedly jumped 18-33% and used EV sales soared 59% in recent months compared to the previous year. Automakers are adjusting sales strategies, with some pushing aggressive campaigns to clear current inventory, while others are re-evaluating production volumes and considering offering their own incentives post-expiration. Key stakeholders include the U.S. government (President Trump, Congress, IRS), automakers (e.g., Tesla, GM, Ford), car dealerships, and consumers racing against the clock.

Navigating the New Landscape: Winners and Losers in a Post-Credit EV Market

The abrupt end of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, will fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape for electric vehicle manufacturers, creating distinct winners and losers as the market shifts from a subsidized environment to one driven by intrinsic value.

Companies heavily reliant on the $7,500 tax credit to make their vehicles competitive, particularly those with higher price points or less established brand loyalty, are most vulnerable. Newer EV manufacturers that have yet to achieve economies of scale and depend on incentives to attract buyers may face substantial headwinds. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN), for instance, saw its R1S models already facing eligibility issues for the federal credit earlier in 2025. The complete expiration will remove a significant incentive for direct purchases, likely leading to reduced sales and increased pressure on profitability, even as the company invests in future, more affordable models like the R2. Similarly, Volkswagen AG (OTCMKTS: VWAGY), whose ID.4 also lost direct purchase eligibility earlier in the year, may see a dip in sales for eligible models, potentially requiring the company to absorb some of the $7,500 cost through internal incentives, impacting per-unit profitability.

Conversely, companies with diversified portfolios, strong brand recognition, established profitability in their EV segments, or those focused on higher-end markets less sensitive to the $7,500 incentive are better positioned. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), despite a reported dip in overall sales in the first half of 2025, has a strong brand, vertical integration, and existing profitability from EVs that provide a degree of insulation. CEO Elon Musk has historically supported the credit's termination, arguing it harmed Tesla. The company's strategic focus on more affordable models for 2025 and its ability to adjust pricing could position it as a long-term winner. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE: HMC) are also well-placed due to their ""hybrid-first"" strategies and diversified product offerings. With slowing pure EV adoption trends, strong hybrid sales could provide stable revenue streams, cushioning the impact of the federal credit's expiration.

Legacy automakers like General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) represent a mixed bag. Both have several eligible EV models, such as the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Ford F-150 Lightning, which benefited from the credit. While they are likely to experience a short-term sales dip for these models, their larger scale, existing dealer networks, and long-term commitment to the EV transition may allow them to implement aggressive internal incentives (rebates, favorable lease terms) to sustain demand. However, this could come at the cost of profitability in the short term. Both companies are also actively working on more affordable EV options to compete effectively in a subsidy-free market.

A Seismic Shift: Broader Implications of the EV Tax Credit's Demise

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, represents a seismic shift, signaling the U.S. EV market's transition from a heavily subsidized environment to one increasingly driven by market forces. While a short-term surge in sales is currently underway, analysts widely anticipate a subsequent temporary dip of 20% to 30% in EV sales in the immediate post-deadline period. This is because the credit effectively made EVs more accessible, particularly for budget-conscious consumers, and its absence will widen the cost gap between EVs and comparable gasoline models.

This policy reversal, orchestrated by the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), reflects a broader recalibration of U.S. energy priorities. The OBBBA not only terminates EV credits but also repeals other clean energy incentives, including those for solar and wind facilities, green hydrogen production, and home electrification. It also eliminates non-compliance penalties for CAFE standards, further reducing pressure on manufacturers to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. This signifies a move away from technology-specific subsidies towards a focus on broader tax relief and supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types, as evidenced by the new auto loan interest deduction.

The ripple effects will be felt across the entire automotive ecosystem. Smaller EV rivals like Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) are particularly vulnerable due to their heavy reliance on incentives. The battery production sector is already experiencing an overcapacity crisis, with BloombergNEF data indicating a 56% plummet in U.S. battery deployment projections since 2022 and $6 billion in manufacturing projects canceled in Q1 2025. This could erode U.S. competitiveness against countries like China, which continues rapid expansion in battery manufacturing. While the expiration of the home charger credit might slow some infrastructure development, the current pre-deadline buying spree could still accelerate broader public charging infrastructure as municipalities respond to heightened EV volumes.

Historically, the removal of government incentives for specific industries has often led to initial market contractions, forcing industries to adapt or consolidate. Comparisons can be drawn to similar events where government support for emerging technologies was withdrawn, often revealing the true market demand and forcing innovation. Studies suggest that eliminating the EV tax credit could lead to a significant decrease in EV sales by 2030, potentially jeopardizing planned U.S. EV assembly plant expansions and making a substantial portion of U.S. battery manufacturing capacity redundant. This underscores the critical role of policy in shaping industrial landscapes and the risk of ceding ground to international competitors who actively support their nascent EV industries.

The Road Ahead: Navigating the Post-Subsidy EV Landscape

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, ushers in a new, challenging phase for the electric vehicle market. In the short term, the immediate aftermath is expected to be a period of significant adjustment. Following the current ""gold rush"" of pre-deadline purchases, analysts widely anticipate a notable dip in EV sales, potentially between 20-30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and into early 2026, as vehicles effectively become thousands of dollars more expensive for consumers. Automakers and dealerships will likely respond by offering their own aggressive incentives, price cuts, and favorable financing options to stimulate demand and manage inventory. State and local incentives will also gain heightened importance as buyers seek alternative forms of financial relief.

In the long term, the EV market will be compelled to mature beyond government subsidies, focusing instead on intrinsic value and market fundamentals. This means a renewed emphasis on cost reduction through technological advancements in battery chemistry and streamlined production processes, aiming for price parity with gasoline cars by 2027. The industry will need to build greater consumer confidence through improved range, faster charging, and a ubiquitous, reliable charging infrastructure. While overall EV adoption is still expected to grow, it will likely be at a slower, more organic pace than initially projected, with some forecasts suggesting a 25% EV sales mix by 2030, rather than the more ambitious 50%. A strategic pivot towards hybrids and plug-in hybrids is also anticipated, serving as a bridge technology for many consumers.

Automakers will need to implement several strategic adaptations. This includes aggressive cost reduction efforts, rethinking global production and sourcing strategies now that North American assembly incentives are gone, and diversifying product offerings to include more affordable EVs and a wider range of hybrid options. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) not only removed the EV credits but also introduced a new auto loan interest deduction. This allows buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on loans for new, U.S.-assembled vehicles (EV, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028. While not a direct replacement for the upfront EV credit, this deduction offers long-term savings and shifts the policy focus to supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types. This could partially offset the financial impact for some buyers who finance U.S.-assembled EVs, but notably excludes leased vehicles.

The Dawn of a New Era: A Market Redefined

The federal EV tax credit's expiration on September 30, 2025, marks a pivotal moment, fundamentally redefining the U.S. electric vehicle market. The immediate takeaway is the unprecedented ""gold rush"" as consumers rush to secure the $7,500 incentive, leading to record sales in the months preceding the deadline. This short-term boom, however, is a precursor to an anticipated slowdown, challenging the industry to prove its long-term viability without direct government subsidies. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) is the legislative instrument behind this shift, moving federal policy away from technology-specific consumer incentives towards broader support for domestic manufacturing through mechanisms like the new auto loan interest deduction.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by a heightened focus on affordability, technological innovation, and robust infrastructure. Automakers will be compelled to aggressively reduce costs, develop more competitively priced EV models, and enhance the overall value proposition to attract a wider consumer base. The long-term success of EVs will hinge on their ability to compete on par with gasoline vehicles based on price, performance, and convenience, rather than relying on purchase incentives. The new auto loan interest deduction, while not EV-exclusive, will indirectly support U.S.-assembled EVs by making financing more attractive, thereby bolstering domestic production.

The lasting impact of this policy shift will be a more resilient, market-driven EV industry. While the immediate transition may be bumpy, it forces a necessary evolution towards greater self-sufficiency and innovation. Investors should closely monitor several key indicators in the coming months: the severity and duration of the post-expiration sales dip, automakers' strategic responses (including pricing, new models, and proprietary incentives), advancements in battery cost reduction, and the continued build-out of charging infrastructure. Furthermore, tracking the effectiveness of the new auto loan interest deduction and observing how state and local incentives evolve will provide crucial insights into the market's trajectory. The coming months will truly test the EV era's ability to stand on its own.

Most of the coal plants in the U.S. are old and inefficient, with the average age of a coal plant standing at 44 years in 2024.","While much of the world is looking to phase out its coal production, United States President Donald Trump has put coal back on the energy agenda, with big plans to reinvigorate ageing coal facilities. Despite concerns over the impact of ongoing coal use on human health and the environment, Trump views fossil fuels as the most stable energy source to boost U.S. energy security, which could lead to consumers paying more for their energy bills over the coming years.

Upon entering office in January, Trump declared an energy emergency, and he has since worked rapidly to change the landscape of U.S. energy by signing a flurry of executive orders and passing bills aimed at reducing the growth of the renewable energy sector and, instead, returning to a reliance on fossil fuels. In April, Trump signed an order entitled “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive Order 14241”.

In the order, Trump stated, “Coal is abundant and cost-effective, and can be used in any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed hundreds of thousands of Americans. America’s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence, with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness.”

Despite promises to lower consumer energy bills in the coming years, sectoral experts now believe that doubling down on coal production could actually lead to an increase in consumer energy bills, compared to investing in alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Trump’s executive order tasked the Department of Energy (DoE) with ensuring that coal power plants continue to operate, even those that are destined for closure.

In July, the DoE published a report that states that current power plant retirements and additions will put the U.S. at massive risk of blackouts by the end of the decade. It has used its newly given powers to stop the closure of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan, even though the utility operating the plant warned that closing the facility would save consumers over $600 million. The DoE plans to halt the closure of other coal facilities across the country in line with Trump’s energy aims.

However, several energy experts have said that the report relies on worst-case scenarios to reach its conclusions and largely overlooks the new renewable energy capacity being added to the grid. Experts argue that paying to keep ageing coal plants online could result in consumers paying billions of dollars more for some of the least efficient and least reliable power plants on the grid, as well as put their health and the environment at risk.

A report from June, by the think tank Energy Innovation, showed that coal power was 28 percent more expensive in 2024 than in 2021, following several years of movement away from the “dirtiest fossil fuel” to various other less-polluting energy sources. The analysis shows that 95 percent of the 162 U.S. coal-fired power plants that were still operating at the beginning of the year were more expensive than in 2021, with costs increasing at twice the rate of inflation for half of these plants.

It's not just climate scientists who are concerned about the financial and environmental cost of keeping coal plants running, as one may have expected. Several U.S. utilities have found that the operating costs of coal plants are simply too high, particularly compared to gas-fueled facilities and renewables. Several utilities have chosen only to use coal plants for power as a last resort, when they cannot deliver enough solar or wind power to the grid, for example, due to the high cost of production. Experts believe that keeping more ageing coal plants online would inflate consumer costs further.

Most of the coal plants in the U.S. are old and inefficient, with the average age of a coal plant standing at 44 years in 2024. Older plants tend to be more expensive to run because they need more investment in maintenance. The generating power at these plants also falls over time, making them highly inefficient compared to many other energy sources. And consumers are seeing the effects of keeping these facilities online unnecessarily.

In Georgia, Plant Bowen was expected to be retried in 2028. However, Georgia Power has extended its life to 2035, even as costs rose from $46/MWh in 2021 to $72/MWh in 2025. This also follows six electricity bill increases for Georgia Power customers between 2023 and 2025. Meanwhile, in South Carolina, the Williams Station coal plant has had its retirement date delayed from 2028 to at least 2031, as costs have increased by $27/MWh, or more than 50 percent.

So, while President Trump insists that fossil fuels, including coal, will help fix the country’s “energy emergency”, the financial reports at many of these coal plants appear to prove otherwise. Meanwhile, the cost of gas and renewable energy production continues to fall, offering a cleaner alternative for consumers, as well as lower energy bills.

data centers.
But storing energy that way is relatively pricey and may still fall short of providing the nonstop energy that data centers need.
(As part of this week’s deal, OpenAI agreed to use Nvidia chips in at least 10 gigawatts’ worth of data centers.)
Many data centers near cities and towns don’t have that kind of space.","It’s been a big week for A.I. data centers. That means it’s also been a big week for coal and natural gas.

Nvidia this week announced a $100 billion investment to support OpenAI’s enormous build-out of data centers that use its chips. The next day, OpenAI said it had signed deals with SoftBank and Oracle to build five new data centers as part of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion plan for A.I. infrastructure. (The three companies unveiled it at the White House back in January.)

The announcements are the latest in a global push to speed the construction of A.I. data centers. OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft are together spending more than $325 billion on them by the end of the year. To stay on the bleeding edge, the companies want the latest processors, cooling systems, facilities — all running 24/7 on mind-bending quanta of electricity.

In the U.S., more than half of that power is coming from fossil fuels.

President Trump, who called green energy a “scam” at the U.N. General Assembly this week, has enthusiastically endorsed natural gas, coal and oil. He has also subsidized them. As part of his official A.I. plan, he pledged to scrap “radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape” and fast-track fossil fuel projects instead.

But there are reasons beyond politics that help explain why smog-spewing fossil fuels have become the go-to power source for futuristic data centers. The pairing is almost unavoidable — at least for now.

Renewables

Sprawling solar farms, windmills and hydroelectric dams are the best energy options for the planet, and usually the cheapest. Their economic upside has made them, collectively, the fastest-growing power source for data centers worldwide.

But renewables often can’t shoulder the load alone, despite being a major part of the A.I. power plan. That’s because servers hum and whir around the clock — not just when the sun is up or the wind is blowing. They demand a constant, stable flow of electricity. If power falters, even for a few seconds, companies lose thousands of dollars, sometimes more.

There’s a fix: Companies can pair solar and wind farms with massive batteries that store power and then release it in a steady stream. But storing energy that way is relatively pricey and may still fall short of providing the nonstop energy that data centers need. “Batteries are a great way to shift daytime electricity to evening electricity — but not a great way to shift July electricity to January electricity,” said Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard who studies energy policy. So even the greenest facilities rely on fossil fuels or the local grid for backup, he told DealBook.

Another challenge: The biggest data center campuses will consume multiple gigawatts of power. (As part of this week’s deal, OpenAI agreed to use Nvidia chips in at least 10 gigawatts’ worth of data centers.) To continuously produce just a single gigawatt, a renewable-energy plant would need around 12.5 million solar panels — enough to cover nearly 5,000 football fields. Wind turbines would need even more room. Many data centers near cities and towns don’t have that kind of space.

Nuclear

That’s where nuclear plants come in. They have smaller footprints, generate steady power and, like renewables, emit no carbon.

But they’re expensive. That’s why the nuclear industry has been in a decades-long rut. It boomed back in the 1970s, when the global energy crisis quadrupled oil prices. But Americans’ enthusiasm for nuclear energy soured after a series of headline-grabbing accidents, like the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island.

Around the same time, our electricity needs started to decline — which tends to happen in mature economies. Oil prices came down, so we stopped building nuclear reactors.

The industry has been groping for a good sales pitch ever since. With A.I., it finally has one: Energy demand is soaring, and nuclear companies can help fill the gap.

A slight snag: They’ll need another seven or eight years to do it, best-case scenario, said Jacopo Buongiorno, a nuclear science professor at M.I.T. That’s how long it takes to build new nuclear plants.

So, it’s a gamble: Tech companies investing in nuclear power (Microsoft, Google and Amazon, among others) are betting billions that A.I. demand will continue to rise a decade from now, when those nuclear facilities open for business. But it’s not clear their bets will pan out.

Fossil Fuels

The U.S. has vast natural gas reserves in underground reservoirs and offshore deposits, so it’s cheap and available. And the infrastructure to harness it can be ready fast: “A year or two, and you have a gas plant,” Buongiorno said.

If data centers continue expanding at their going rate, their energy needs will far surpass the current supply by 2030. So tech companies that need to bridge that widening gap are reaching for fossil fuels. Natural gas is already the top power source for U.S. data centers, according to the International Energy Agency, and it’s on track to dominate through at least 2030.

The only other energy source that can be deployed in one to two years — aligning with the construction timeline for most data centers — is solar, which has its own drawbacks.

His plan may work. It may also accelerate climate change by pumping heat-trapping gases into an atmosphere already at its highest-recorded temperature ever. For now, though, tech companies are seeing an opportunity to invest.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

Inflation held firm last month, the Fed’s preferred measure showed. Yesterday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures report showed core inflation rose 2.9 percent on an annualized basis, matching Wall Street forecasts, but still well above the central bank’s 2 percent target. That said, traders are still penciling in two more rate cuts even as Fed policymakers debate future moves.

Intel held investment talks with Apple. Intel’s shares soared on Wednesday after news broke that the company had held discussions with Apple about a possible investment. The talks, which took place before and after the Trump administration took a stake in Intel, raised questions about whether companies were considering Intel investments to please the White House.

Nvidia pledged to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The chipmaker at the center of the artificial intelligence boom agreed to supply the ChatGPT developer with millions of its most advanced processors and said it would take an undisclosed equity stake. The deal — along with a separate announcement that OpenAI will team with SoftBank and Oracle to build five new U.S. data centers — underscores the astonishing costs of the A.I. business, which is raising hard questions about whether these gigantic investments will pay off.

Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night TV. Kimmel was emotional and defiant in his first episode back after Disney suspended his show over comments he made about the killing of Charlie Kirk. The episode averaged 6.2 million viewers, almost four times its average audience, though Nexstar and Sinclair, which together own about 20 percent of ABC’s affiliates, pre-empted the show. President Trump suggested that he might take further action against ABC.

How the new H1-B fee is hitting in Silicon Valley

The White House’s announcement that it would charge a new $100,000 fee to applicants for the popular H1-B visa set off alarm bells across corporate America.

But they rang particularly loudly in Silicon Valley: About two-thirds of such visas, which are distributed via a lottery, go to workers in computer-related occupations.

“The first thing that happened was panic,” said Deedy Das, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, which has more than 250 start-ups in its portfolio.

DealBook’s Sarah Kessler talked with Das, who is a former H1-B visa holder, about how the change is being received at the smallest and largest companies in tech. The interview has been edited and condensed.

What have you heard from start-ups about the new fee?

When you are an immigrant start-up founder, one route you can take is to sponsor your own H1-B visa through your start-up.

That is probably the group most affected by a $100,000 fee, because you are paying out of your pocket. The company just got incorporated. You don’t have any cash. You don’t have funding.

The second most affected group are smaller start-ups. In computer science, about 60 percent of students who get Ph.D.s and 45 percent who get master’s degrees are international. So chances are, if I say, I want to hire anyone who is good enough, most of them are going to be on an H1-B. For those companies, $100,000 is meaningful.

What about larger start-ups?

Most of the later stage start-ups are at a point where they’re like, OK, we’re just paying the $100,000 fee.

It’s not ideal. But even if you have a thousand employees, you’re probably not hiring more than 100 people on H1-B next year. You’re probably hiring like 10. Maybe I just spend a million dollars in a one-time fee and continue doing what I was doing.

Will they just set up remote offices in other countries?

I don’t think start-ups will overnight decide, hey, we need an office somewhere else. There are tons of issues with offices in Europe, tons of issues with offices in India and China, all of these other places. It takes a lot of work.

I was talking to an start-up founder who liked that there’d be less competition for the lottery.

I think it is a reasonable incentive to say, if you want to hire internationally, pay more. Do I think 100K is the right amount? I mean, no, maybe start with 20K.

The IT consultancies who typically abuse these programs might resort to another kind of visa, but leaving that aside, I think they will struggle because they disproportionately use visas to pay lower wages.

Do you think the $100k fee makes starting a company in the U.S. less appealing?

Absolutely.

It’s hard to describe just how much better America is for entrepreneurship than the rest of the world: Everything from ease of doing business, access to capital and funding, access to talent and the social acceptance of failure.

Daily Record of Dunn

Benson commissioners agreed to take a thorough look at its costs of providing electricity to the town after hearing its electric department had about half the money it needed to cover its bills last fiscal year.

“The electric fund had an operating loss for the year,” Jay Sharpe, the town auditor, told the board at its meeting Sept. 18.

And fiscal year 2024 wasn’t a fluke.

Operating expenses have exceeded revenues in that department for at least the last three fiscal years, he said, pointing to a bar graph. Another graph showed deep dips of red to illustrate the department’s habit of operating with negative cash flows during those same years.

The Town of Benson Electric Department “only had $300 in petty cash” at the end of fiscal year 2024, and it had to borrow money from the town’s general fund to pay for its operations, Sharpe added.

His Raleigh-based accounting firm, Sharpe Patel CPA, recommends towns try to have two to three times the money it needs in the bank to cover all of its bills. The electric department had half of what it needed.

ElectriCities of North Carolina offered to complete the study at a cost of $28,900, only charging the town $23,900 after awarding Benson a $5,000 grant for the study.

“A cost of service study looks at the total costs an electric distribution system has for the provision of electrical service,” Interim Town Manager Steve Harrell told the board at its meeting Sept. 18. “This includes functional costs for local lines, poles, and transformers to deliver power to end-users and the costs for billing, meter reading and customer support.”

In other action, commissioners voted unanimously to end its $400 monthly health care stipend for any employees, outside of the 11 who already receive it, not wanting coverage from the state health plan.

There are also six new EV chargers at Phoenix, Arizona public libraries as part of that city's effort to install 500 public charging points by 2030.
Smaller cities are also taking steps to improve their EV charging infrastructure.","Electric Vehicle (EV) range anxiety and charging concerns are the technology's biggest sticking point for most consumers, and maintaining a sufficient charging infrastructure will be the biggest challenge moving forward. This is a particular challenge in large cities, where residents of apartments and condos above street level can't install personal charging stations like many homeowners. As for public EV chargers, in populated areas they tend to be in commercial areas, along highways, or in other spots less accessible to residents. To make EV charging more convenient for residents, some cities are taking a creative approach to the problem. The Czechian capital of Prague announced earlier in September that it had a plan to install 6,000 new charging points by 2030 to help prepare for the European Union's transition to exclusively zero-emissions vehicles.

Prague's goal is to install 1,500 of those charging stations by the end of 2026, and the city is doing that by converting some existing lampposts to EV chargers. These level 2 chargers take advantage of 230-volt AC power available across Europe, meaning many EV owners will be able to gain dozens of miles of range in a few hours. The cost of the initial 1,500 chargers is almost 500 million Czech Koruna, which equals about $24 million at current exchange rates. Prague is a city of over 1.3 million people, and the government sees this initiative as a way to measurably improve their lives. Deputy Mayor for Transport Zdeněk Hřib told Yahoo! News, ""Without accessible charging options, electromobility will remain the privilege of a small group. Prague must ensure that every resident has the opportunity to make the switch.""

Los Angeles, — where over half the residents are renters — has also latched onto this idea and begun mounting EV charging stations on existing streetlights. The city also installed LED bulbs in the lamps to reduce power draw, connecting the 240-volt power lines already in place to Level 2 chargers with retractable cables. A company called Voltpost is installing streetlight chargers in the Detroit area, and the city of New York worked with electrical utility Con Edison to install100 curbside chargers in 2024. The Big Apple hopes to have 10,000 such stations installed by 2030, five years before the state's ban on internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles goes into effect. There are also six new EV chargers at Phoenix, Arizona public libraries as part of that city's effort to install 500 public charging points by 2030.

Smaller cities are also taking steps to improve their EV charging infrastructure. Lancaster, Pennsylvania received a $3.1 million federal grant to install 74 electric charging stations in public parks and low-income neighborhoods in the city. Lancaster deputy director of public works Cindy McCormick told Lancaster Online these locations ""align with areas where residents don't necessarily have access to charging and off-street parking, which is an impediment for people to purchase electric vehicles.""

New York City is partnering with private firms to build a 24-hour public EV charging station at JFK airport with 12 DC fast chargers and 53 additional chargers, and car companies are stepping in to fill in the gap as well. A consortium of eight global automakers including BMW, Stellantis, Honda, and Hyundai/Kia teamed up on a new charging network called Ionna, with the goal of building 30,000 North American Charging System (NACS) stations in the United States.",https://www.slashgear.com/img/gallery/the-clever-way-cities-are-solving-ev-charging-woes/l-intro-1758718850.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 14:01:24.533492

TerraPower, founded by Bill Gates, is exploring whether its new natrium technology could be used for the facility.

The two companies along with the Kansas Department of Commerce, announced the signing of a memorandum of understanding Tuesday to explore sites for a possible nuclear plant.

There is already one nuclear power plant in the state.

Evergy’s Director of Corporate Communications Gina Penzig says there are record levels of development in both Kansas and Missouri with data centers, logistics, and manufacturing.

“And so, it’s driving an increased need for electricity over the next five to ten years,” Penzig said in a Zoom interview with FOX4 Wednesday.

Evergy recently announced they were planning to build two new natural gas plants in south central Kansas and a solar site in Douglas County.

“As we look forward over the next five, ten, 15 years with the growing need for electricity in the region, we want to consider all of the possibilities,” Penzig said.

That includes a nuclear power plant using TerraPower’s natrium technology. FOX4 asked Penzig where they’d consider building this.

“Our service area goes roughly from Hutchison to the eastern border of Kansas and then from north to south, so somewhere in about that eastern third of the state is where the site selection process will focus,” she responded.

Evergy has operated the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station in Burlington for the last 40 years. Penzig says that facility has had a great safety record.

TerraPower would not speak to FOX4 on camera Wednesday, but in June of 2024, they started building the first advanced nuclear reactor project in Wyoming. Later on Wednesday afternoon, a spokeswoman for TerraPower said a natrium nuclear power plant would take three years to open.

It's the reason why EV leases are so cheap, so if you want an affordable EV, you should act soon.

There are great deals on both mainstream and luxury EVs, you just have to know where to look.

The time has come. Later this coming week, the federal clean vehicle tax credit will disappear, and many of the ""I can't believe this price"" lease deals will go with it. But it's not gone yet, and you can still get a truly absurd price. Here's how to do it.

While the $7,500 EV tax credit expires on Sept. 30, it is possible that many automakers might continue to eat those costs themselves and continue to offer aggressive deals through the year. But long-term, there's no guarantee of that. This is a great weekend to go EV-shopping—perhaps the last great one for a while.

First off, at this point, you're going to be fighting with a lot of other customers for a rapidly shrinking supply of cars. That's why I'd suggest striking a deal this weekend; most dealers are good enough at inventory management that they'll be running low by Tuesday. Second, I'd skip the ""let me talk to the manager"" step by just browsing on a leasing forum or using a car broker. At this point, it's more about knowing who has excess inventory than squeezing the finance manager, so this can kill two birds with one stone.

I jumped on Leasehackr this morning to scour for deals, and I'm shocked by what I'm seeing.

While Leasehackr is not the only lease deal forum, and I haven't used a broker myself, it seems to be the one with the most consistently eye-popping deals. Here are a few that caught my eye. But note that lease deals in general are region-specific, and I'm looking in California, where inventory is plentiful and deals tend to be great.

The Deal King: Hyundai Ioniq 5

Hyundai dealers are offering crazy deals on new Ioniq 5s.

Part of why you see so many more Hyundai Ioniq 5s than Kia EV6s is that Hyundai has long offered much more aggressive lease deals. As the cheap-lease free-for-all ends, the Ioniq 5 still reigns. I saw this one advertised for $157 a month for 36 months, with $3,000 due at signing (I'm not including specific broker information because I can't speak to the quality of different brokers, and deals are changing rapidly).

That adds up $8,495 over the life of the lease (the first payment is included), meaning your net effective payment is $235 a month. That's for a car with a native Tesla-style NACS port, faster charging speeds than anything else remotely affordable and 318 miles of range. That's all the EV most people need, at a price that's hard to argue with.

The Luxury Play: Pick Your Poison

BMW and Mercedes have both been trying to clear out EV inventory. You can get great deals on EVs from both brands. The BMW i4 is one of my favorite EVs, and I've seen deals advertising 36-month leases for $399 a month for 36 months with $3,000 due at signing. If you must have a crossover, you can get an ex-loaner Mercedes EQE SUV for as little as $399 a month for 36 months with $3,5000 due at signing. That's a helluva deal for something with an MSRP of $80,000.

But there is a catch with these luxury-brand leases. For EV deals, Mercedes, BMW and Audi seem to be advertising ultra-low-mileage leases that only give you 7,500 miles per year. Since the average American drives over 12,000 miles a year, make sure that's not a dealbreaker.

Cadillac incentivized leases tend to come with 10,000 miles a year, which is much more reasonable. If you're interested—and based on our experiences, you should be—you can get an Optiq or a Lyriq for under $400 a month with about $3,500 down. But that's a two-year lease, so the down payment stings a little harder.

Affordable Alternatives

While the Ioniq 5 is our go-to non-Tesla recommendation, I personally leased a Chevy Blazer EV last year because the deals are just as good. I'm willing to sacrifice charging speed and driving dynamics for more space and ground clearance, so I'd recommend looking at what your local Chevy dealer is offering.

I found two-year deals for both the Equinox EV and Blazer EV that require a one-time payment of less than $6,000. One-pay leases are not always the best if you worry about exiting early, or if you don't have upfront cash, but it's hard to argue with these numbers. At $6,000 all-in, you can get a spacious electric crossover with over 300 miles of range for just $250 a month.

If paying up front isn't your jam, rest assured that you still have more options. First, your local Chevy dealer may be willing to arrange a similar deal with less down. But you can get another of the segment staples for cheap. Volkswagen ID.4 leases are cheap as hell right now. I saw a base-model, rear-wheel-drive version offered for 24 months at 7,500 miles a year for just $99 a month with $3,000 due at signing. If you want an all-wheel-drive, long-range ID. 4Pro, you might be able to get one for $139 a month with $3,000 down.

Examples, Not Promises

These are example deals, because every lease is different. You won't qualify for every rebate, and you'll need good credit to get these rates. But I'm writing about these deals to show you just how much money is sitting on the table. You just have to find a way to grab some yourself.

The good news is it's never been easier. There are forums like Leasehackr and plenty of car-buying services out there to ease the pain. Or, if you don't want to deal with a broker fee, do what I did: Put it requests at multiple dealers, and don't show up in person until you have a real offer, including all taxes and fees, in writing.

The Fix Our Forests Act will help reduce wildfire risk for Colorado communities and speed up mitigation projects while maintaining environmental safeguards and encouraging local involvement

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Senators John Hickenlooper, John Curtis, Alex Padilla, and Tim Sheehy highlighted growing support for their bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act from governors, state and local officials, community leaders, and industry stakeholders. The bill works to strengthen wildfire resilience by improving forest management, supporting fire-safe communities, and streamlining approvals for projects that protect communities and ecosystems from extreme wildfires.

The comprehensive bill reflects months of bipartisan negotiations to find consensus on how to accelerate forest management projects, promote safe and responsible prescribed fire treatments, expand public input in assessments of wildfire resilience needs, and enhance collaboration between federal agencies, states, tribes, and stakeholders.

Continued support for the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act picks up with organizations such as Colorado Water Congress, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, the National Water Resources Association, and more joining to endorse the bill. Coalitions of local fire chiefs and wildfire organizations have also sent in letters of support for the legislation.

“As the Western United States continues to experience unprecedented wildfire seasons, we recognize the urgent need for comprehensive and coordinated federal action. The status quo is completely untenable as our local, state, and federal systems are overwhelmed,” wrote the chair of Colorado State Fire Chiefs, Wildland Section, and the Fire Chiefs of Vail Fire and Emergency Services, Eagle River Fire Protection District, Aspen Fire Department, Red, White, & Blue Fire District, Summit Fire and EMS, Grand Fire District #1, and Colorado River Fire Rescue in a joint letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act. “We are greatly impressed by the collaborative nature of this legislation and the commitment it reflects to bipartisan solutions that empower local, state, and federal partners alike… As leaders of Colorado mountain region fire departments, we stand ready to support the implementation of policies that strengthen our ability to protect lives, property, and the natural environment.”

“It is paramount that we work to improve the health of our nation’s forested lands and protect communities and watersheds, particularly in the West, where wildfires have become increasingly devastating and destructive. This legislation outlines a comprehensive approach to improving forest and watershed health by helping to foster a collaborative partnership between federal agencies and local communities, authorizing common sense environmental streamlining authorities, and expanding important research initiatives,” wrote Colorado Water Congress in a joint letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act. “The resources included in this bill are crucial to help control and reduce the severity of wildfires and protect Colorado’s watersheds. CWC supports a collaborative process of planning, prioritizing, and implementing hazardous fuel reduction and forest health improvement projects while protecting, restoring, and enhancing forest ecosystems to promote the recovery of threatened and endangered species, improve biological diversity, water quality, and enhance productivity.”

“The devastating, ongoing wildfires across several Western states (e.g., Arizona, California, Colorado, and Oregon) highlight the need to prepare for the threat of wildfires while enhancing the ability of communities to withstand and recover from such events,” wrote Marty Durbin, Senior Vice President of Policy at the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in a letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act. “The U.S. Chamber of Commerce strongly supports S. 1462, the Fix Our Forests Act of 2025, sponsored by Sens. Curtis, Hickenlooper, Padilla, and Sheehy. We urge the Committee to quickly mark-up and report this bill for consideration by the full Senate.”

“The Fix Our Forests Act is a critical step forward. The bill provides an opportunity to speed up the planning and implementation of wildfire risk reduction projects on federal lands while expanding collaborative tools to bring more partners into this vital work. Additionally, it bolsters the use of prescribed fire to help reduce fire severity and restore ecosystems. The bill recognizes that replanting after wildfire and other extreme events goes hand in hand with active forest management and the legislation supports ecosystem and habitat restoration across our public lands and in the priceless white oak forests of the Eastern U.S. The Fix Our Forests Act also takes a broad view of the solutions needed by establishing a Community Wildfire Risk Reduction Program to address risk in the built environment and creating a Fire Intelligence Center to improve interagency coordination and adoption of new technologies,” wrote a coalition of 22 different wildfire organizations in a joint letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act.

“The Fix Our Forests Act provides a forward-looking framework that strengthens interagency collaboration and delivers common-sense reforms to improve forest and watershed health. NWRA believes this legislation will provide lasting benefits for our environment, public safety, and water quality and infrastructure,” wrote the National Water Resources Association in a letter of support for the Fix Our Forests Act.

The Fix Our Forests Act is supported by Colorado Governor Jared Polis; Utah Governor Spencer Cox; California Governor Gavin Newsom; Colorado Department of Natural Resources; Colorado State Forest Service; American Property Casualty Insurance Association; California Natural Resources Agency; Climate and Wildfire Institute; Utah Farm Bureau Federation; The Nature Conservancy; Association for Firetech Innovation and Convective Capital; Federation of American Scientists; National Audubon Society; Berkshire Hathaway Energy; Arnold Ventures; Utah Department of Natural Resources; The Property and Environment Research Center (PERC); Theodore Roosevelt Conservation Partnership; National Wild Turkey Federation; National Wildlife Federation; Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions; American Forests; Colorado Rural Electric Association; Congressional Sportsmen’s Foundation; Western Governors’ Association; National Association of State Departments of Agriculture; National Association of State Foresters; United Power; Rocky Mountain Elk; Citizen’ Climate Lobby; Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control; Bipartisan Policy Center Action; International Association of Fire Chiefs; Alliance for Wildfire Resilience; Wildfire Alliance; Tall Timbers; Rural Voices for Conservation Coalition; The Stewardship Project; Megafire Action; California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection; Hispanics Enjoy Camping, Hunting, and the Outdoors; Ruffed Grouse Society and American Woodcock Society; State of Utah; Environmental Defense Fund; Rural County Representatives of California; Salesforce; Central Valley Water Reclamation Facility; C2ES; U.S. Chamber of Commerce; Colorado State Fire Chiefs Wildland Section; Colorado Water Congress; and National Water Resources Association.

“I applaud the bipartisan work and leadership of the Senate sponsors of this bill, including Colorado’s Senator Hickenlooper, in crafting a bill that will make Colorado communities safer amidst the urgent and growing wildfire crisis in the West. From supporting responsible and expedited on-the-ground fuel reductions, to bolstering the use and development of the latest wildfire satellite monitoring technology which compliments Colorado’s national leadership in the aerospace sector, and to investing in stewardship practices for local communities to be better prepared for wildfires and reforestation efforts with the state nursery to improve our ability to recover – this bill makes major strides in addressing the country’s wildfire risk and will support Colorado’s continued leadership in wildfire preparedness, response and recovery,” said Colorado Governor Jared Polis.

“Extreme risk of catastrophic wildfires across the West demands urgent action,” said California Governor Gavin Newsom. “In California, we’re fast-tracking projects by streamlining state requirements and using more fuel breaks and prescribed fire. The Fix Our Forests Act is a step forward that will build on this progress — enabling good projects to happen faster on federal lands. I’m appreciative of Senator Padilla and the bipartisan team of Senators who crafted a balanced solution that will both protect communities and improve the health of our forests.”

“A century of fire suppression and decades of reduced forest management have left us with overgrown, unhealthy forests that are more vulnerable to disease and catastrophic wildfire,” said Utah Governor Spencer Cox. “The Fix Our Forest Act, along with the tools provided by President Trump’s executive order, will help us actively manage our forests—protecting our watersheds, improving wildlife habitat, reducing wildfire risk, and providing the timber we need to build strong homes and neighborhoods.”

“We applaud the efforts made by Senator Hickenlooper in the Fix Our Forests Act to provide federal, state, and local partners with the tools needed to address wildfire mitigation in the most vulnerable areas in Colorado. Wildfires do not abide by our political boundaries. But here in Colorado we have built strong coordination among federal, state, local land managers and stakeholders to help reduce the impact of wildfires on our critical infrastructure and landscapes,” said Dan Gibbs, Executive Director, Colorado Department of Natural Resources. “We appreciate that this legislation builds upon this important collaboration and draws on existing agreements, such as Shared Stewardship, which will help strengthen our intergovernmental partnerships as we prepare for the next Colorado mega-fire.”

“Forests are central to our way of life in Colorado. They support world-class outdoor recreation and a vital water supply that more than 40 million Americans rely upon. I am grateful to Senator John Hickenlooper for his work on the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act,” said Matt McCombs, Colorado State Forester and Director of the Colorado State Forest Service. “This critical legislation will bolster our shared stewardship ethic in Colorado and enhance our ability as a state to improve forest health, protect lives, communities and water supplies from wildfire, and ensure that the forests that define Colorado endure for generations to come.”

“First of all, thanks to Senators Hickenlooper, Curtis, Sheehy, and Padilla for their leadership in moving all this forward! Having spent so many hours working on the Wildfire Mitigation and Management Commission, it is refreshing to see so many of the recommendations moving forward!” said Mike Morgan, Director of the Colorado Division of Fire Prevention and Control.“Colorado has taken a very aggressive approach in addressing the wildfire challenges we face and we are pleased to see these efforts at the federal level taking a more holistic look at the challenges we all face and in support of the Commission’s recommendations. This bipartisan effort will serve Colorado and America well! I fully support this effort and I am happy to help in any way that would be helpful.”

“TNC appreciates the serious undertaking of Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Sheehy, and Padilla to build on legislation targeted at preventing more catastrophic wildfires through improved forest and fuels management and expanded use of prescribed fire. TNC has been working to restore beneficial fire and improve the resilience of forest systems on the ground for more than 60 years. Every year, wildfires continue to grow deadlier and more devastating to communities and the environment, and we remain concerned that the significant cuts to the Forest Service workforce will impede work to protect people and nature from these wildfire risks. We support this legislative effort aimed at improving the forest management process to better address catastrophic wildfires,” said Kameran Onley, managing director of North America policy and government relations, The Nature Conservancy.

“For many Americans, catastrophic wildfires are a very real and growing threat to their homes and lives,” said Environmental Defense Fund Executive Director Amanda Leland. “The U.S. Forest Service needs new tools and more resources now to prevent and control these wildfires, and with the right funding, this bipartisan proposal will help. Protecting people and nature from catastrophic wildfire requires both a robust, science-based plan of forest management and the resources to implement it.”

“As the megafire crisis grows larger and more severe with each fire season, we need policy solutions that reflect the urgency and scale of the problem. Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Padilla and Sheehy have negotiated a Senate companion to the Fix Our Forests Act that will move the federal government towards a science-based, strategic approach to addressing megafires. We look forward to working with the sponsors to advance this bill and enact the most transformative wildfire and land management law in a generation—since the Healthy Forest Restoration Act of 2003, if not the National Forest Management Act of 1976,” said Matt Weiner, CEO of Megafire Action.

“We are thrilled to see the Fix Our Forests Act introduced in the Senate through a bipartisan cooperation between Senators Curtis, Hickenlooper, Padilla, and Sheehy. The bill greatly expands upon the version that passed the House, adding critical details to support wildfire risk reduction in the built environment and provisions for mitigating the health impacts of smoke to communities while promoting expanded use of prescribed fire,”said Annie Schmidt and Tyson Bertone-Riggs, Managing Directors, Alliance for Wildfire Resilience. “Covering a third of the recommendations of the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission, this bill is a significant step forward in wildfire policy and, coupled with sufficient funding and staffing to realize the proposed tools and programs, will make a real difference in our nation’s experience with wildfire.”

“I thank Senators Hickenlooper, Padilla, Curtis, and Sheehy for introducing this bipartisan legislation,” said Fire Chief Josh Waldo, President and Board Chair of the International Association of Fire Chiefs. “As we saw in January’s fires in Los Angeles, the nation faces a serious and growing risk from fires in the wildland urban interface (WUI). This legislation will enact many of the recommendations of the Wildland Fire Mitigation and Management Commission. It also will improve coordination of federal wildland fire preparedness efforts; promote the use of prescribed fires and other preventative measures to prevent WUI fires; and promote the development of new technologies to help local fire departments. We look forward to working with the bill’s sponsors to pass this legislation.”

“Our national forests provide essential wildlife habitat, store carbon, and supply communities across the nation with clean air and water. These vital landscapes are under threat and must be proactively stewarded if they are to survive the changing climate, rapidly intensifying wildfires, and past management missteps. The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act will help increase the pace and scale of evidence-backed forest management, including the use of beneficial prescribed fire and the restoration of white oak forests. But we must have a robust and talented federal workforce in place for it to succeed,” said Abby Tinsley, vice president for conservation policy at the National Wildlife Federation. “We will work with Senators Hickenlooper, Padilla, Sheehy, Curtis, and Chairman Westerman in the House to strengthen and advance this important conversation.”

“The health of our nation’s forests is dependent on the rivers, streams, and wetlands that sustain them. Actively conserving and restoring these critical aquatic resources is an important tool that can be used to mitigate the impacts of wildfire and drought, among other threats,” said Alicia Marrs, director of western water for the National Wildlife Federation. “We’re encouraged to see language in the bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act that recognizes the wildfire benefits of aquatic restoration. We look forward to continuing to work with leaders from both sides of the aisle to elevate these common sense and cost-effective approaches to forest and water management for all Americans.”

“Wildfires grow more intense and destructive each year, leaving behind immense devastation for our forests, wildlife, and communities,” said Marshall Johnson, chief conservation officer at the National Audubon Society.“The bipartisan Fix Our Forests Act represents an important step in reducing wildfire risks across forested landscapes. Audubon thanks Senators Hickenlooper, Curtis, Padilla, and Sheehy for working together to craft a bill that sets the stage for improved forest management, and we urge Congress to dedicate the resources necessary to ensure federal agencies are well-equipped to reduce wildfire risks, steward our forestlands, and protect wildlife habitat.”

“Utah’s farmers and ranchers applaud Senator Curtis’ sponsorship of the ‘Fix Our Forests Act’, which will enhance forest health, reduce wildfire risks, and protect vital watersheds. We are particularly encouraged by provisions promoting locally-led restoration efforts, targeted grazing as a wildfire mitigation tool, and watershed protection strategies,” said ValJay Rigby, Utah Farm Bureau Federation President. “The Utah Farm Bureau appreciates the bill’s emphasis on active forest management and increasing the pace and scale of treatment projects to address catastrophic wildfire risks. The ‘Fix Our Forests Act’ represents a significant step toward healthier forests and safer communities.”

BACKGROUND:

The West has long been prone to wildfires, but climate change, prolonged drought, and the buildup of dry fuels have increasingly intensified these fires and extended fire seasons. Wildfires today are more catastrophic – growing larger, spreading faster, and burning more land than ever before.

Colorado has seen four of the five largest fires in our state’s history since 2020, including this summer’s Lee Fire. The 2021 Marshall fire was Colorado’s most destructive on record, burning over 1,000 homes. The Cameron Peak and East Troublesome fires in 2020 together burned more than 400,000 acres, the two largest fires in the state’s history. Nationwide, total acres burned rose from 2.7 million in 2023 to nearly 9 million in 2024, a 231% increase.

Forest health challenges are also increasing in frequency and severity due to climate stressors like drought and fire, and biological threats like invasive species – all of which the West is particularly vulnerable to. From 2001 to 2019, total U.S. forest area declined by 2.3%, with the Intermountain West experiencing the largest losses by area.

To address these challenges, the Fix Our Forests Act would:

Establish new and updated programs to reduce wildfire risks across large, high-priority “firesheds,” with an emphasis on cross-boundary collaboration.

Streamline and expand tools for forest health projects (e.g., stewardship contracting, Good Neighbor Agreements) and provide faster processes for certain hazardous fuels treatments.

Create a single interagency program to help communities in the wildland-urban interface build and retrofit with wildfire-resistant measures, while simplifying and consolidating grant applications.

Boost reforestation with the inclusion of Hickenlooper’s Reforestation, Nurseries, and Genetic Resources (RNGR) Support Act to support reforestation capacity of state, tribal, and private nurseries.

Strengthen coordination efforts across agencies through a new Wildfire Intelligence Center with the inclusion of Hickenlooper’s bipartisan Wildfire Intelligence Collaboration and Coordination Act of 2025, which would streamline federal response and create a whole-of-government approach to combating wildfires.

Support prescribed fire activities on both federal and non-federal lands – prioritizing large, cross-boundary projects, strengthening the prescribed fire workforce, and facilitating coordination on air quality protections.

Expand research and demonstration initiatives – including biochar projects and the Community Wildfire Defense Research Program – to test and deploy cutting-edge wildfire prevention, detection, and mitigation technologies.

Janine Warren wanted an electric vehicle to cut her carbon footprint, but she also wanted a Cadillac, preferably a small SUV.

After General Motors Co. launched its Cadillac Optiq early this year, Warren, an accounting coordinator at the public school district in Norman, Oklahoma, picked one up in April, trading in her gas-burning Cadillac SUV.

“We’re kind of Cadillac people,” she said. “But I feel like this is my favorite car by far, as far as a smooth ride and a quiet ride.”

Americans bought 310,800 electric vehicles in the second quarter of the year, a 6.3% drop from the year-earlier period, according to Cox Automotive Inc. However, the sales dip — 21,000 vehicles — was nearly equal to the slump in transactions for Tesla Inc., the longtime market leader whose CEO triggered a backlash among a wide swath of potential buyers.

Other carmakers also reported sagging sales, but many saw a growing number of buyers. Altogether, EV sales from rival brands were level in the quarter, driven largely by a sales surge for new models from GM. The company is now selling 12 fully electric vehicles in the US and commands 15% of the US EV market, triple that of Ford Motor Co. That means GM is now selling one electric vehicle for every three Teslas, a major coup given Tesla controlled 80% of the market four years ago.

CEO Mary Barra said profitable EV sales are now the company’s “North Star” on an earnings call Tuesday morning. “We are growing in EVs because we have a strategic portfolio of vehicles that people love for their design, performance, range and value,” she said.

Honda Motor Co. Ltd. also notched a sales boom in the period. Meanwhile, a handful of brands saw their EVs lose momentum, including Hyundai Motor Co. and Ford, which halted sales of one of its popular models over a software glitch.

GM appears to have unlocked the puzzle of EV affordability, which remains one of the bugaboos keeping drivers from going electric. Its Chevrolet Equinox EV, which debuted last year, starts at $33,600 without federal or state incentives. That’s almost one-third less than what a typical car or truck sells for in America these days. From April through June, some 17,420 people drove off in an Equinox EV, behind only Tesla’s Model Y and Model 3.

“It’s all about the affordability,” explained Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox. “And consumers are familiar with the Chevy brand.”

GM Chief Financial Officer Paul Jacobson has said the Equinox, in particular, is “gaining momentum with mainstream consumers.” At Cadillac, meanwhile, one in five models sold is now electric.

Long-term EV adoption in the US is expected to slump after the Trump administration dismantled federal incentives and continues to attack clean-air mandates. BloombergNEF forecasts 27% of the US market will be electric by 2030, down from the 48% share it estimated a year ago.

However, Cox expects EV buying to be frenzied until Sept. 30, when federal purchase incentives of up to $7,500 per vehicle expire. Ford, for example, is telling dealers to expect a rush of third-quarter buyers.

“We’re definitely going to see a lot of manufacturers and dealers try to create a sense of urgency,” Valdez Streaty said.

Warren in Oklahoma is one of the customers who accelerated her purchase to grab the government incentives. She had eight months left on the lease of her gas-powered Cadillac, but turned the keys in early. She won’t be buying another combustion engine.

“The technology is only going to get better and the range is only going to get better,” Warren said, “so it’s like, ‘Why go back?’”

The company plans to convert over 600 Shell locations into electric charging stations.
""This marks the first time in Finland that we're continuing operations at the station without any liquid fuels,"" said Juha Vanninen, head of retail in Finland at St1.
In fact, almost one in five vehicles sold was electric in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.
St1 shows that it's possible to make EV charging stations more accessible to owners by building a strong network of them across Nordic countries.","Finland recently marked a milestone in the global shift away from dirty fuels. Nordic energy company St1 turned a Shell gas station into a power station solely for electric vehicles, cutting out gas and diesel entirely, reported Electrive.

The company plans to convert over 600 Shell locations into electric charging stations. ""This marks the first time in Finland that we're continuing operations at the station without any liquid fuels,"" said Juha Vanninen, head of retail in Finland at St1.

This comes at a time when EVs are becoming more popular than ever across the globe. In fact, almost one in five vehicles sold was electric in 2023, according to the International Energy Agency.

EVs have a lot of advantages compared to gas-powered vehicles. It costs less to charge an EV than to fuel a gas-powered car, for one. Consumer Reports data also shows that EV owners spend about 50% less on maintenance over their vehicles' lifetime.

If you have solar panels installed at home, you could save even more. Solar makes charging costs more affordable — sometimes cutting your energy bill down to $0. Consider using the free solar installation quote tool from EnergySage to find a vetted installer in your area.

EVs also benefit the planet by reducing pollution from tailpipes and helping clean up the air in communities, especially urban areas.

St1 shows that it's possible to make EV charging stations more accessible to owners by building a strong network of them across Nordic countries.

Other companies are doing similar expansions, like EVgo, which is attempting to more than triple its network across America by 2029. And DeCharge launched a pilot program allowing property owners to install its chargers on their properties.

Building out these networks could encourage more people to buy EVs and, in turn, speed up the shift to cleaner transportation and less reliance on dirty fuels.

The move has already caught the attention of many online.

A Redditor commented on a post about St1's station conversions in r/electricvehicles: ""Norway has been a leader in all countries going EV. Super cool to see and hope to see more of this!""

We all want to leave our country more prosperous, secure, and sustainable for future generations, with a thriving domestic manufacturing sector. We’re locked into a constant competition with China in innovation, but while America is still pursuing this future, China’s industry has already been successful.

Just look at China’s electric vehicle (EV) sector: it’s now a massive economic engine for the country‘s manufacturing base, spawning giants like CATL and BYD while contributing to significant improvements in air quality across Chinese cities. This success story offers a roadmap that we can and should follow domestically.

However, we’re well behind, and our only path to competitiveness lies through rapidly advancing automation and manufacturing efficiency—with robotics at the core of this strategy.

State of robotics adoption in the U.S.

A large focus of the new administration has been to bring manufacturing stateside, with tariffs and other policies incentivizing domestic production. But this means very little considering the massive manufacturing labor shortage. According to the Manufacturing Institute, the industry will need 3.8 million additional workers by 2033, but as many as 2.1 million will go unfilled — with an opportunity cost of about $1 trillion a year to the U.S. economy.

While concerns about labor displacement are valid and require proactive solutions, the reality is stark. If we want more industrialization in the U.S., the only path to growth and competitiveness on a global scale is through the uptake of advanced automation and robotics. If we don’t, we’re not even in the race.

The U.S. is already seeing large-scale private investment into next-generation robotics applications, with robotics-related startups securing around $6.1 billion in venture capital investments last year.

Fueled by breakthroughs in computer vision and foundation AI models, what it means to be state-of-the-art is shifting. It will soon be possible that robots will be able to accomplish more and more complex tasks on their own, adapting to their environments and making decisions without relying on predefined logic or human teleoperation. This evolution promises efficiency gains, improved productivity through round-the-clock operation, and automation of tasks previously deemed impossible.

However, to meet this potential and translate this momentum in industrial deployment, the country needs a national strategy. Admittedly, we’ve had the opportunity to make meaningful gains domestically with technology that has already been in existence for many years. We now stand at yet another technological inflection point, and to fail to engage with strategic clarity and a unified vision would be missing an opportunity we may not see again.

The potential for economic growth and, I’d argue, accelerated decarbonization as a co-benefit, is enormous. Today’s global average robot density is still relatively low at 162 units per 10,000 manufacturing employees.

Editor’s note: RoboBusiness 2025, which will be on Oct. 15 and 16 in Santa Clara, Calif., will feature a panel on “Closing the Robotics Gap With China.” Register now to attend.

Robotics can play a role in addressing the climate

The long history of robotics is deeply rooted in the pursuit of efficiency and safety. From the early days of automotive manufacturing, with robots like Unimate shouldering dangerous tasks, to today’s agile mobile robots and sophisticated drones, the trajectory has been clear: Robotics enable us to do more with less.

These advancements laid the groundwork for the resource efficiency that is crucial in our fight to mitigate climate impacts as our economy continues to grow. It has the potential to make various climate technologies more effective and also meet labor demands of the climate industry. Recent estimates indicate an additional 13 million workers will be required to meet the needs from “green growth” across the world’s biggest economies.

Robotics are already enabling meaningful market growth for decarbonization use cases. Often in use cases that fall under the “4 Ds” framework: dull, dirty, dangerous, and dear (expensive) tasks. These are precisely the areas where robots can provide the most significant decarbonization co-benefits.

Certain sectors — such as grid upgrades, manufacturing, and mining — can capture disproportionate benefits by adding robots to the workforce. They aid in avoiding labor shortages and perform operations in extreme conditions unsafe for people.

From automating solar farm construction, EVs, and battery manufacturing to enhancing wildfire prevention and land use management, American startups are already leveraging robotics to tackle some of the most pressing environmental challenges.

The energy and industrial infrastructure sectors are already embracing this potential. Companies like Terabase are scaling robotics for solar installation, increasing labor productivity by 2x and dramatically reducing costs.

In land management, Kodama Robotics and BurnBot are emerging as crucial tools for wildfire prevention and suppression, and for more efficient reforestation efforts. For aviation, a sector that is notoriously difficult to decarbonize, Pyka is using autonomous aircraft for cargo delivery and crop dusting to reduce CO2 emissions by over 90%.

Even in mature markets like manufacturing, articulated robotic arms and autonomous logistics robots have long been recognized for their role in driving productivity, efficiency gains, and, consequently, emissions reductions.

Assuming a 5% emissions improvement across the whole industrial light manufacturing economy, this could be a reduction of over 30 million tons of CO2 emissions. And, that’s just the start.

Learning from China’s Success

China has become the global leader in both industrialization and the emerging climate economy as a result of its robotics and automation advances and widespread adoption. It has dominated market expansion across solar cells, EVs, batteries, and other crucial technologies. In turn, decarbonization technologies have proven to be massive economic growth drivers in China.

We’re now seeing the flywheel effect. Robotics offers a clear pathway to greater efficiency, reduced emissions, and a more sustainable future. It has long been core to scaling emerging climate technologies, and to make the U.S. a compelling and competitive manufacturing powerhouse, we must embrace automation to even be in the game.

The current technical inflection point makes this opportunity even more exciting, but potential alone is insufficient. We all want more domestic manufacturing and communities that are clean and safe from increasing climate disasters. Our industrialization pursuits and the emerging global climate economy are inexplicably tied.

The time to invest, innovate, and integrate robotics into our climate strategy is now, before the opportunity to make a meaningful decarbonization impact disappears. America has the innovation capacity and entrepreneurial drive to lead this transition — we simply need the strategic vision and commitment to make it happen.

As the AI and data center boom continues, the battle over who pays for America’s energy future—and who profits—shows no signs of cooling down.","Private investment in America’s electric utilities is booming as the artificial intelligence revolution and the demand for massive data centers send shockwaves through local power grids and communities. From the sun-baked fields of New Mexico to the pine forests of Minnesota, private equity firms and Big Tech giants are pouring billions into utilities and infrastructure, reshaping how—and for whom—electricity is delivered.

According to The Independent, private investment firms are aggressively acquiring stakes in electric utilities that serve more than 150 million customers across the United States. This surge is driven by the explosive growth of energy-hungry data centers, a trend ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT. Greg Brown, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina, summed up the motivation: “The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made.”

BlackRock CEO Larry Fink made the firm’s ambitions clear in a July interview on CNBC, declaring, “Infrastructure is at the beginning of a golden age. We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy, and energy.”

The deals are stacking up. Blackstone is seeking regulatory approval to buy out the Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power Co., while Wisconsin regulators have already greenlit the buyout of Superior Water, Light and Power. Last year, Blackstone also acquired a 19.9% stake in Northern Indiana Public Service Co. But nowhere is the fight more intense than in Minnesota, where a proposed $6.2 billion buyout of Allete, parent company of Minnesota Power, has sparked a fierce debate that could set the tone for future utility takeovers.

The proposed deal would see a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board acquire Allete for $67 a share—a 19% premium. Minnesota Power, which serves 150,000 customers and manages a portfolio of coal, gas, wind, and solar power sources, is seen as a valuable prize. The potential for Google to build a data center in the region only raises the stakes, making ownership of Minnesota Power even more lucrative.

Supporters of the buyout, including building trades unions and the administration of Minnesota Governor Tim Walz, argue that BlackRock’s deep pockets will help the utility meet the state’s ambitious clean energy goals. Allete projects it will need $4.3 billion over five years for transmission and clean energy projects to comply with Minnesota’s requirement that utilities deliver 100% carbon-free electricity by 2040. The company insists that BlackRock’s ownership would not change its operations, strategy, or values, and that the buyout price will not impact electric rates.

But not everyone is convinced. The state attorney general’s office, industrial customers such as U.S. Steel and Enbridge, and consumer advocates are sounding the alarm. Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute put it bluntly: “It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from.”

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive turned consumer advocate, testified against the Minnesota Power buyout. He explained, “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it. The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.” He and others worry that private equity’s incentive is to maximize returns by pushing for higher capital investments—like new poles and wires—since regulators allow utility owners to earn around 10% returns on such spending.

The skepticism is shared by regulators. In July, administrative law judge Megan J. McKenzie recommended rejecting the BlackRock deal, citing the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do—pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.” The Minnesota Public Utilities Commission staff echoed these concerns, warning that private investors could saddle Minnesota Power’s parent company with massive debts, borrow at low interest rates, and earn outsized profits if regulators grant generous returns. “For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses—it is a lose-lose.”

Meanwhile, in rural Louisiana, the impact of Big Tech’s energy appetite is playing out in real time. As reported by KNOE, Meta (the company behind Facebook and Instagram) is building a $10 billion data center in Richland Parish—so large it covers the area of 70 football fields and will consume more power daily than the entire city of New Orleans at peak summer usage. To support this behemoth, Entergy agreed to construct three gas-powered plants producing 2,262 megawatts, with the total infrastructure bill topping $3 billion.

The Louisiana Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August 2025, touting added consumer protections. Yet, critical details remain shrouded in secrecy due to nondisclosure agreements. Consumer advocates and even some commissioners are frustrated by the lack of transparency. Mandy DeRoche of Earthjustice warned, “You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community.”

Meta has agreed to fund about half the construction costs over 15 years but not the maintenance or operation of the new power plants. The company is also exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law, a move the state acknowledges could result in “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue. Critics fear that if Meta withdraws or fails to renew its contract, the public could be left footing the bill for decades. All grid users are already expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Locals in Richland Parish have mixed feelings. Some, like drywall business owner Trae Banks, welcome the economic boost and the promise of 500 new jobs. “We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” Banks said. Others worry about a boom-and-bust cycle, rising housing costs, and displacement. Mayor Jesse Washington of nearby Delhi noted, “We have a lot of concerned people—they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here. I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

States are scrambling to adapt. More than a dozen have moved to protect ratepayers from bearing the costs of powering data centers. Pennsylvania is drafting a model rate structure, New Jersey is studying the cost impacts, Oregon passed new legislation, and Texas implemented a “kill switch” law to reduce data center loads during emergencies.

As the AI and data center boom continues, the battle over who pays for America’s energy future—and who profits—shows no signs of cooling down. With billions at stake and communities caught in the crossfire, the outcome will shape not just utility bills but the very fabric of the nation’s digital and economic infrastructure.",https://thumbor.evrimagaci.org/i7QrK73-U3tDx2GBTVqScro9jPM=/1200x0/filters:format(webp)/tpg%2Fsources%2F03d359f7-08ce-45e9-9285-f2b2b056b58f.jpeg,N,,2025-09-27 11:03:19.447226

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

Energy analysts now expect that no new offshore wind farms will get built in the United States after 2028.","Oil and gas executives are expressing concern about the Trump administration’s attacks on offshore wind, including attempts to block the construction of projects off the East Coast.

Executives generally have refrained from publicly denouncing President Trump, but in interviews with The New York Times, some voiced misgivings about what they have seen as undue political meddling in energy.

“Ever-changing policy, particularly as administrations change, is not good for business,” Darren Woods, the chief executive of Exxon Mobil, said in a recent interview. “It’s not good for the economy and ultimately, it’s not good for people.”

Mr. Woods, who runs the largest U.S. oil and gas company, was responding to a question about the Trump administration’s attempts to halt fully permitted offshore wind farms. He stopped short of directly criticizing those actions.

Others have shared more pointed concerns privately, including that efforts to rescind federal approvals could set a precedent that a future administration could use to hamper pipelines or other fossil fuel infrastructure.

“Life is long, and the sword being wielded against the renewables industry right now will likely boomerang back in 3.5 years against traditional energy,” reads a response to a recent anonymized survey of oil and gas companies by the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas.

A federal judge recently allowed work to restart on one offshore wind project that the Trump administration tried to stop, a nearly complete wind farm off the coast of Rhode Island called Revolution Wind. Another, Empire Wind, was able to proceed after federal officials lifted a stop-work order after negotiations with Gov. Kathy Hochul of New York, a Democrat.

The Trump administration has said it wanted to assess how offshore wind farms might affect national security.

Asked about the oil and gas industry’s concerns, a White House spokeswoman, Taylor Rogers, criticized the actions of Mr. Trump’s predecessors.

“It was Obama and Biden who declared war on the energy industry by shutting down gas pipelines, banning offshore drilling in large parts of our waters, halting L.N.G. export terminals and freezing coal mining projects,” she said.

Mr. Trump is not the first president to oppose energy projects, though the practice appears to be escalating. President Joseph R. Biden revoked a federal permit for the Keystone XL oil pipeline in 2021, saying the project was not in the national interest. The pipeline, which would have carried oil from Alberta to Nebraska, was under construction.

Mr. Biden also paused federal approvals for new natural gas export infrastructure last year to study how they would affect the climate, economy and national security. A federal judge later ordered that the pause be lifted.

Mr. Trump has been especially blunt in attacking wind turbines and has made unfounded claims about them, including that they cause cancer and are responsible for whale deaths.

His administration has sought to block all new leasing for wind farms on federal lands and waters and moved to revoke federal approval for other permitted wind developments off the coasts of Maryland and Massachusetts. The White House also recently instructed a half-dozen federal agencies to probe the risks of offshore wind, The Times has reported.

“Windmills, we’re just not going to allow them,” Mr. Trump said during a recent cabinet meeting.

The quicker phaseout of tax credits for wind power, passed by Congress this summer, is only adding to the industry’s troubles. Energy analysts now expect that no new offshore wind farms will get built in the United States after 2028.

“I feel for the wind guys, man,” said Toby Rice, the chief executive of Pittsburgh-based EQT, one of the country’s largest natural gas producers. “I know exactly how it feels when you have an energy project that’s close to getting built getting stopped. I would like to see a world where that doesn’t happen.”

Trade organizations have said they are especially concerned about the Trump administration’s efforts to revoke already-granted permits.

“Not only does this inject significant uncertainty into the infrastructure development process, but it invariably increases the price of the projects and risks raising the cost of electricity, diminishing our ability to meet growing demand,” Martin Durbin, the senior vice president of policy for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, wrote earlier this month.

When compared to historical levels, the air quality in the United States has improved. However, exposure to air pollution remains one of the top environmental health risks faced by Americans. It is estimated that one hundred thousand to two hundred thousand deaths annually are associated with this exposure, which exceeds the deaths from murders and car crashes combined. Furthermore, evidence suggests that increasing concentrations of carbon dioxide, methane, and other greenhouse gases pose significant threats to public health. Examining sources of greenhouse gas emissions, such as CO2, fossil fuel-fired power plants are the largest source of these emissions in the United States. However, the Supreme Court, in its 2022 West Virginia v. EPA decision, limited the Environmental Protection Agency’s (“EPA”) ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions through the application of the major questions doctrine. The Court found that Congress did not clearly grant the EPA the authority needed to enact a regulation that would significantly impact the nation’s economy.

Hochul said the directive will focus on late-stage projects able to qualify for existing federal tax credits before they expire, cutting costs for ratepayers.

“By directing our state agencies to move projects across the finish line, we are seizing every opportunity to leverage federal incentives, reduce costs for ratepayers, and build a more resilient, sustainable and reliable energy grid,” she said.

It also forms part of a whole-of-government approach to streamline permitting, interconnection, financing and contracting to bring projects forward more quickly.

NYSERDA president and chief executive Doreen Harris said: “This solicitation will serve as another building block to help ensure a continuous pipeline of viable large-scale projects as part of New York’s versatile clean energy future.”

Also here is a popular loophole to still score the EV tax credit.

What’s Specifically Changing?

Until Sept. 30, qualified new EV buyers can still get up to $7,500 in the form of a tax credit. Used buyers may be eligible for a credit of up to $4,000, with some restrictions. But the One Big Beautiful Bill Act or OBBBA, eliminates the credits for both new and used EVs as of that date.

For those cutting it close to the deadline, it’s important to note that delivery does not have to occur before Sept. 30. What’s important is that you’ve signed a contract with a deposit or payment before the deadline.

What Does This Mean for EV Buyers?

Some of the consequences of the EV credit expiration are obvious. For starters, this means that EVs will effectively cost more for most buyers after Sept. 30. There might also be a “gold rush” at dealers in the last two weeks of September as buyers potentially flood dealer lots trying to cash in before the credits expire. But here are some additional consequences listed by ChatGPT:

More emphasis on local and state incentives: Federal EV credits aren’t the only game in town. Those offered by various states and municipalities may see growing importance in terms of incentive pricing. Buyers should do their homework and see what non-federal credits may still be available, both before and after Sept. 30.

Sales may slow after Sept. 30: If you wouldn’t qualify for an EV credit anyway, you might be rewarded by purchasing an EV after the deadline. As demand is expected to wane once the tax breaks go away, dealers may have to offer their own incentives to purchasers after Sept. 30. This puts post-deadline buyers in the driver’s seat when it comes to negotiations, including in the leasing market.

Used EVs may drop in value: ChatGPT noted that used EV values might shift as well if demand drops after the credits end. Resale and trade-in values are likely to fall as used EV buyers can no longer avail of the federal tax credit. This could also open up opportunities for buyers.

Steps To Take Now

If you find yourself rushing to get an EV before the credits expire, here are the action steps that ChatGPT suggests you take:

Act before Sept. 30: If you’re in the position to do it, at least put down a deposit to lock in your purchase, even if you can’t take delivery until after the deadline.

Check eligibility of the specific EV model (new or used): Not all vehicles qualify for the federal credit to start with, so don’t rush in without knowing all of the facts. Some of the factors that could impact eligibility include assembly location, battery/mineral sourcing, dealer, price and so on.

Compare total costs, not just sticker price: This part of the equation often gets overshadowed by the large $7,500 credit. When determining whether or not an EV is a value, factor in not just the federal credit and any state or local incentives but also likely charging costs, maintenance, utility/charging cost savings and so on.

Explore state and local incentives: As mentioned above, federal credits are not the only game in town. Some states may step up or boost incentives to make up for the loss at the federal level. Where you live may actually end up mattering a lot.

Consider transportation alternatives in your budget if the cost of EVs rises: It’s a simple fact that without the federal credits, other alternatives, including hybrid, PHEV or even highly efficient gas models, may actually make your purchase more cost-competitive.

Plan for resale and charging infrastructure: Even after the subsidies expire, two factors can help maintain the value of your EV: the quality of the charging infrastructure in your area and the overall demand for electric vehicles relative to other locations.

If you’re looking to snag EV tax credits before they expire — and potentially never come back — you’ve got to act fast. While you should never rush into a financial transaction, particularly one that is likely to be the second-largest in your life after buying a home, in this case, haste could translate to thousands of dollars in savings.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

More than two dozen Republican attorneys general, led by West Virginia’s J.B. McCuskey and Kentucky’s Russell Coleman have urged President Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency to , claiming the rule is holding back American industry and the county’s energy dominance.

The Sierra Club warns dropping a rule that effects emissions from cars, industry and power plants would gut the EPA’s power to fight climate pollution, harm public health and impact weather.

""I believe that climate change is real. I think that virtually all science agrees that it's real,” West Virginia Sierra Club Chair Jim Kotcon said. “Denying that reality and impacts from that is not a science. It’s not a service to the citizens of West Virginia.""

McCuskey said that power rests with Congress, that the EPA's past actions were an overreach and the only rational energy for West Virginia and the nation involves coal, oil and natural gas.

The GOP attorneys general argue that the original endangerment finding was illegal because only Congress could act on a decision so economically and politically significant.

""We have one pathway insuring that this country moves in the direction that we want and that is to a rational energy policy that recognizes that the minerals that have been placed under our feet by the creator need to be developed in a way that causes prosperity for every American and - particularly in my opinion - every single West Virginia,” he said.

McCuskey contends the price for the rule has been too high.

If Ford uses this opportunity to correct those habits, it can turn the page to a bright future.

Ford’s reshaping of its Dearborn product development and executive complexes — the global automaker is moving its world headquarters, including executives, closer to where product design and engineering take place — gives the automaker a rare a chance to overhaul its product planning and vehicle development processes, breaking bad habits that have plagued it for decades.

Ford must get this right.

Many of the automaker’s recent decisions to delay and change vehicle programs appear reactive and short-term, opening gaps in its lineup, wasting time and resources. If Ford uses this opportunity to correct those habits, it can turn the page to a bright future.

Otherwise, apparently dramatic moves like bulldozing its 70-year-old Glass House headquarters building and an even older design and engineering center will amount to little more than pouring old wine into new bottles.

Bright spots, big challenges

Ford’s current development process has created bright spots:

F-series pickups remain the unchallenged sales leaders, approaching a mind-boggling 43 years as America’s No. 1 selling model line.

The brilliant Maverick pickup created a new class of affordable and appealing compact vehicles.

The reinvention of the Bronco SUV raised expectations of serious off-roaders, creating welcome competition to the Jeep Wrangler.

But those triumphs look more like isolated incidents of brilliance than the result of a rigorous, repeatable system that efficiently allocates billions of dollars and tens of thousands of people.

Ford also:

Repeatedly delayed the second-generation F-150 Lightning electric pickup.

Canceled a new family of three-row electric SUVs after years of expensive development.

Is about to idle a massive factory in Louisville, Kentucky, that turned out two important vehicles — the Ford Escape and Lincoln Corsair compact SUVs — to build a family of new electric vehicles.

“The end of the Escape and Corsair will mean Ford has fewer vehicles to sell,” S&P Global Mobility principal analyst Stephanie Brinley said. “It’ll take a while for that plant to get back up to meaningful production scale.Ford’s not going to build 150,000 vehicles in the first year, and capacity there exists for 250,000 to 300,000” vehicles.

At the same time, the sprawling BlueOval City manufacturing complex in Stanton, Tennessee, being created 340 miles away from Louisville Assembly to make EVs and batteries waits in limbo as Ford pauses the next generation of the F-150 Lightning until 2028 at the earliest.

'At the 5 yard line'

“Every reset entails years of lost sales and billions of dollars of lost investment,” said Paul Waatti, AutoPacific director of industry analysis. “There’s a time and a place to make a pivot, but it’s not when you’re at the 5 yard line.

“Ford has set itself behind quite a bit.”

Ford generated headlines announcing a new generation of electric vehicles, but there’s cause for concern about its ability to execute that, or any, plan without fundamental change.

The very fact that Ford physically moved the vehicle development team 2,000 miles from its Dearborn engineering center to Long Beach, California, to work in secret demonstrates how broken the system is.

The problem isn’t Dearborn, or that people working on the secret project might have their creative process sullied by parking next to employees involved in the automaker’s current products.

A 'skunk works' can’t fix what ails Ford

The issue is that Ford lacks a disciplined product development and lifecycle planning process, and it always has.

The automaker called the secret offices its ""skunk works,"" in reference to a legendary Lockheed engineering center where a group worked on advanced aircraft, but that skunk works worked on far-out ideas — think the once super-secret but now iconic U-2 spy plane — not next year’s models.

Ford’s issue is the here and now, not a lack of blue-sky thinking.

The company almost routinely develops outstanding vehicles, then allows them to age into irrelevance while competitors improve and replace their competitors regularly. The Taurus, Escape and Ranger all led their segments for years, before declining due to management inaction.

F-series pickups are the only products where Ford management holds replacements to a strict schedule and insists on clear leadership on measurable criteria. The result: 48 years of truck sales leadership.

We can all hope that team dispatched to the Long Beach, California, offices where Ford developed the new EVs did that, but it won’t matter unless Ford's leaders change their approach to creating vehicles and keeping them competitive.

Otherwise, it’s only a matter of time before Ford is looking for another magic bullet, instead of rolling out a steady flow of first-class vehicles.","https://www.freep.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/12/PDTF/86117011007-new-ford-world-headquarters-01-a.JPG?crop=1023,577,x0,y52&width=1023&height=577&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-27 08:57:38.227668

This year, the organization gave Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress an “F,” scoring 12% on their metrics for transitioning away from climate-harming energy sources, coal and natural gas.

Mikaela Curry, East/South Beyond Coal campaign manager for the Sierra Club, said Duke supported the passage of legislation this session to roll back a climate law the utility originally supported. The new law eliminates the state’s 70% carbon-cutting goal by 2030 and allows the utility to charge ratepayers in advance for future energy plants.

“It’s been predicted that this cost families and businesses an extra $23 billion in the cost of burning gas at power plants through 2050,” Curry pointed out. “They lobbied in this legislation that really increased risks for families and ratepayers where North Carolina customers assume the risk of cost overruns.”

The study on costs from the legislation concluded the high price volatility of gas would lead to the $23 billion price tag. Duke Energy said the new law will give it more flexibility to meet growing demand. The Dirty Truth report found Duke Energy plans to build out nearly 8,800 megawatts of gas by 2035.

One source of growing electricity demand across the country is data centers. Curry noted the new climate law in North Carolina will allow Duke Energy to charge people for projects which might not be necessary.

“Customers are on the hook still to pay for those things, even if it turns out that all those data centers aren’t built or there’s other ways to manage the load,” Curry explained. “It makes sense for a utility that has shareholders, of course. They are guaranteed rate of return on profits. And so the more that they build, the more opportunity they have to secure profits.”

Curry stressed Duke Energy is focusing on fossil fuel technology, which will drive utility prices up.

The world has a problem. Energy demand continues to rise each year with a growing population — there were one billion humans on Earth in 1804, and over eight billion today — and the vast majority of energy used comes from burning fossil fuels including oil, coal and gas.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change considers that we can only burn at most between 20% and 30% of the remaining fossil fuel reserves to make sure we don’t hit the ‘catastrophic’ two degree upper limit — and the consensus seems to be that oil will run out by 2052 regardless, with gas following in 2060 and coal lasting perhaps until the end of the century.

Billions of dollars are now being poured into renewable infrastructure and technology — solar, wind, hydro, biomass and geothermal. There’s also significant capital investment into nuclear, though as this requires the use of uranium, it can only be classified as a low carbon energy source as uranium will also eventually run out.

Solar energy uses photovoltaic cells or solar thermal systems to convert sunlight into usable electricity, while wind energy relies on turbines. Hydropower generates electricity from flowing water, while geothermal energy uses heat from beneath the Earth's surface. Meanwhile, biomass produces energy from organic materials like plants and waste.

The sector is growing rapidly, particularly as costs fall and technology advances — while governments continue to use legislation to bring renewable targets forward and incentivise change. Perhaps cynically, some consider that governments are more interested in the enhanced energy security by diversifying energy sources, and reduced reliance on imported fuel.

Many analysts consider that the majority of the world’s energy supply will come from renewable resources by 2050 — and if nothing else, renewables are a major contributor to economic development, creating millions of jobs worldwide in manufacturing, installation and maintenance.

Of course, there are always going to be detractors. Critics point out that renewables are still less reliable than fossil fuels, and that current infrastructure is nowhere close to being able to replace non-renewable sources today. There are also concerns over the initial environmental costs of building and installing renewable infrastructure, which can create a carbon debt that takes years to pay back.

However, most believe this is the future, and as fossil fuels deplete, current choices may become future mandates — especially as more of the world demands first world living conditions and artificial intelligence energy demand surges.",https://a.c-dn.net/c/content/dam/publicsites/igcom/uk/images/news-article-image-folder/GT_wallstreet_18-04-24.jpg/jcr:content/renditions/cq5dam.web.1280.1280.jpeg,N,,2025-09-27 07:59:07.837079

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/2news.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/9/f5/9f517c66-11ff-57cd-bb49-760130b676c7/68d7627625467.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-27 06:58:24.916896

“ For some potential buyers, the end of the tax credit means they will stop shopping for EVs.","Shoppers are snapping up electric vehicles as time is running out on a big tax break for going green.

At the Orange County Auto Show, Corinne Lawson and her husband took a test drive in a glimmering white Mustang Mach-E, an all-electric vehicle made by Ford.

Lawson is looking to buy her fourth Mustang and — for the first time — is leaning toward a battery-powered one. The smaller motor makes it a more comfortable car for her family.

“It has a backseat for the grandkids,” Lawson said, who lives in Tustin and is retired. “That might be enough to tempt me.”

Interest in electric vehicles was high at the auto show, which opened Thursday and goes through Sunday. Potential EV owners lined up to get rides in the latest models. They have only days left to take advantage of a tax credit that would save them $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used one.

The federal tax credit is set to expire Tuesday, in accordance with a new policy from the Trump administration. As the clock ticks, consumers and auto dealers have seen a jump in sales of new and used EVs.

“We’re seeing a big spike in EV sales,” said John Sackrison, executive director of the Orange County Automobile Dealers Assn. “There’s a window of time that’s running out, and we know it’s going to become more challenging for consumers to make the leap over to electric.”

In May, before Trump moved to eliminate the tax credit, around 21% of new vehicles sold in Orange County were all-electric, Sackrison said. That number jumped to 25% in June after Trump targeted the credit, and again to 32% in July.

National sales of new EVs jumped 19% in July from last year, Cox Automotive said. J.D. Power predicted that nationwide EV sales will likely reach a record of more than 12% of car sales this month.

The rush to buy EVs also comes as Trump levies volatile tariffs on key trading partners, making cars and car parts from overseas more expensive.

At Cadillac of Beverly Hills, electric vehicles make up about two-thirds of new vehicles sold, said product specialist Naeim Nastar. The dealership has seen a “significant increase” in electric vehicle sales over the past couple of months, he said.

“We’re still selling gas cars, but most people who come in now are here to take advantage of the tax credit for electric,” Nastar said.

On Instagram on Thursday, the Ocean Cadillac dealership in Miami posted an ad promoting several of its electric models.

“Don’t miss out — the $7,500 EV Tax Credit ends this month!” the ad said. “This weekend is your chance to save big.”

At the auto show, Cadillac offered test rides in its electric Lyriq SUV and displayed several electric models on the floor, including the Optiq and Escalade. Show attendees slowly walked through the maze of vehicles, examining features like charging ports and trunk space.

Murrieta resident R.J., who declined to share her full name for privacy reasons, carried a black Cadillac T-shirt she received as a gift after her test ride. She’s considering buying a Lyriq, she said, but is also interested in electric models from BMW and Kia.

“I was hoping to get that $7,500 credit,” R.J. said at the auto show, “but I won’t have time to make my decision before it goes away.”

Analysts warned that there will likely be a hangover after the buying spree.

“The effect on sales will shift from positive to negative,” Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D.Power, said in a report this week. “A very significant decline in EV sales is expected for October, reflecting both the effect of the federal EV tax credit expiring and the start of payback from all the EV purchases that were accelerated into the summer. “

For some potential buyers, the end of the tax credit means they will stop shopping for EVs.

Stacey and Jim Palma were getting ready to purchase their first EV earlier this year when they found out the credit had an expiration date. The Long Beach retirees said they were now interested in a more affordable hybrid vehicle.

“We’re backing out a little because the rebates are going away,” Jim said. “Our incomes are limited, and the incentive is not going to be there anymore.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/3626d0a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/6720x3528+0+476/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fff%2Fa8%2F9721f7984e43a56ed62759e73407%2F1523819-fi-oc-auto-show-ev-demand-gxc-0285.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 06:58:02.246704

According to the CPANP, keeping national parks open during a government shutdown, particularly in the current context, could lead to worse outcomes than in the past.
National parks are already under pressure to remain open amid severe workforce reductions, due to a swathe of budget cuts implemented by the Trump Administration in the spring.
“If national parks are to be open to visitors when National Park employees are furloughed, these nascent issues from the summer season are sure to erupt,” the CPANP letter states.","If Congress doesn’t agree on a short-term spending bill to maintain funding for the federal government by September 30, a shutdown may be on the horizon. And if the U.S. government indeed shuts down, many former national park employees think national parks should, too.

Dozens of former national park superintendents and the Coalition to Protect America’s National Parks (CPANP) urged Interior Secretary Doug Burgum in an open letter to “protect our parks and public lands by closing them if a government shutdown occurs.”

“As former superintendents of national parks across the country, we write to you with an urgent appeal to protect our parks and public lands by closing them if a government shutdown occurs,” the group wrote in the September 25 letter. “Past shutdowns in which gates remained open with limited staff have hurt our parks: iconic symbols cut down and vandalized, trash piled up, habitats destroyed, and visitor safety jeopardized. If you don’t act now, history is not just doomed to repeat itself, the damage could in fact be much worse.”

Congress determines the National Park Service (NPS) annual budget because the bureau is housed within the Department of the Interior. When Congress fails to pass a budget, shutdowns may occur. During federal closures, government programs and sites considered non-essential to national security or safety—such as those run by the NPS—are at risk of losing both funding and employees.

The federal government has experienced at least 14 shutdowns since 1980, according to the Bipartisan Policy Center, a nonprofit think tank. But the government has only shut down twice in the 21st century. The first occurred in 2013, when over 400 national park locations closed. The most recent shutdown, which took place in December 2018, is also the longest in U.S. history, lasting for over 34 days.

In the past, these shutdowns “have hurt our parks,” wrote CPANP in the latter. The advocacy group comprises 4,600 current, former, and retired NPS employees and volunteers.

During the 2018 shutdown, some 80 percent of Park Service employees were furloughed; however, many of the country’s most iconic parks remained open, managed by a bare-bones crew. At the time, Outside reported that there was no one to collect park fees, guide tourists, plow the roads, or clean overflowing pit toilets. Trash was being cleared only by a few volunteer groups in a handful of popular sites.

In advance of a possible shutdown in the fall of 2023, some state governors, including Katie Hobbs of Arizona and Utah’s Spencer Cox, announced they would use state funds to keep national parks open. The 2023 shutdown was averted, however, and it remains unclear whether similar state-led initiatives will keep parks funded and open in a possible 2025 shutdown.

According to the CPANP, keeping national parks open during a government shutdown, particularly in the current context, could lead to worse outcomes than in the past. National parks are already under pressure to remain open amid severe workforce reductions, due to a swathe of budget cuts implemented by the Trump Administration in the spring.

“Sure, we can keep everything open,” an anonymous NPS ranger told Outside in April after a round of cuts earlier this year. “But who wants to recreate in a park with broken down facilities and no maintenance and no search and rescue?”

The CPANP says any attempt to keep parks running during the shutdown would be courting disaster.

“If national parks are to be open to visitors when National Park employees are furloughed, these nascent issues from the summer season are sure to erupt,” the CPANP letter states. “Leaving parks even partially open to the public during a shutdown with minimal—or no—park staffing is reckless and puts both visitors and park resources at risk.”",https://www.outsideonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-1089483216.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 07:59:30.461420

Transcript

Jim Puplava:

Last week on the program we did a big picture. We called it Economic War in the New World Order. We're moving to a multipolar world from a unipolar world. We're used to seeing the U.S. dominate geopolitically and economically. And now it looks like it's going to be more of a multipolar world. And the worst case would be a bipolar world, much like the Cold War between the U.S. and the Soviet Union. But in this case, it would be the U.S. and China. What we're seeing is the economic and geopolitical orders are readjusting.

And I'm going to talk about a book we mentioned on the show last week. It's called Breakneck. It's by Dan Wang. And just to give you a background: first of all, he grew up in China. He was born there, and his parents migrated to Canada after Tiananmen Square. So he spent part of his youth in Canada before migrating to the United States. Today he's a prominent writer. He's a researcher specializing in China, technology, and engineering. He's formerly a technology analyst with Gavekal Dragonomics and a fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center. He's now a research fellow at Stanford’s Hoover History Lab. And his new book is called Breakneck: China's Quest to Engineer the Future.

Some of the key themes—before we get into some of the details of the chapters—are the engineering state versus the lawyerly society. Basically, if you take a look at the Politburo, whether you're talking about the president of China, who's a chemical engineer, or the others, they're all engineers. You contrast that to the U.S., where the political figures are all lawyers. And what he talks about is that in China, if they want to do something—they're going to build a bridge, they're going to build a dam, a factory, a high-speed rail line—they think about it and just do it. They're not going to get caught up in zoning, environmental regulations, or impact studies that take five years before you can do anything.

And you know, we talked about this on the show, and it really struck me: Dan talks about the latest nuclear reactor that we built in the U.S. It took 17 years and $30 billion. He said for that same amount of money, China could build 11 nuclear power plants—and do it in five years. This is one of the problems where China basically focuses on process and getting things done, while we focus on environmental regulations. He contrasts this engineering-driven approach to governance and development with the U.S.’s lawyer-centric litigious environment.

The theme examines how each system influences capability, decision-making, and the speed of implementation. The best example is the one I just mentioned: it took us 17 years to build one nuclear power plant, while they could build 11 in five years. It's basically engineers versus lawyers. Because the first three chapters of the book talk about the contrast between a society run by engineers—which, by the way, used to be the U.S., if you go back to the early 20th century and especially after World War II. That began to change in the ’70s. Meanwhile, China developed a long-term plan.

We’ll get into long-term strategy in the next book review, but you contrast what China does—from high-speed rail to new cities—with America’s system of obstructing progress through legal and bureaucratic processes. That’s why it takes forever, whether you're going to start a new mine, build a factory, or even a housing development. For example, Chris, in my own case, when we designed a custom home that we wanted to build, it took me over a year just to get the permits. Another example: look at Los Angeles. Many affluent communities were destroyed by fires, but rebuilding is still caught up in red tape.

Another point I think is key here, especially when you look at why China has become the world’s largest manufacturer—and rapidly a high-tech society—is their dominance in drones, robotics, and manufacturing capacity. In fact, about 50% of EV sales globally are from China. He talks about this concept of “process knowledge,” something we lost when we outsourced manufacturing to China, Mexico, and elsewhere. A significant portion of the book details this. He contends that China's industrial might isn't simply the result of imitation, but of a deep accumulation of practical know-how. He highlights how they can take something, reinvent it, and make it more efficient. That’s something we've lost by outsourcing.

Cris Sheridan:

Yeah. And Key Point News came out today with Alibaba releasing a new model that rivals the U.S. big tech firms—the leading state-of-the-art models out there. And one of the things they’re doing is they’re often releasing these open-source, for free. That erodes the U.S. moat and creates a very competitive environment. Like you’re saying, they take the technology, re-engineer it, make it more efficient, and release it at a much cheaper price—or even for free, in the case of these AI models. That’s a good example of how this is playing out.

Jim Puplava:

And it's something that China has done repeatedly. They've been accused of dumping products. This happened with rare earth minerals in 2010, when China embargoed exports to Japan. Japan then started buying rare earths from the U.S. What did China do? They dumped rare earth metals on the market and drove that U.S. company out of business.

So another way to compete economically against U.S. high-tech companies is something like AI. We’re all talking about ChatGPT, Perplexity—all these AI programs that are basically free. Well eventually these companies are going to want to monetize them. Like some advanced AI models that require a subscription service. But China is releasing similar models for free, depriving U.S. companies of the revenue they would otherwise capture. In a way, China is dumping its AI knowledge into the marketplace for free to compete against Silicon Valley.

Cris Sheridan:

And they’re also doing what we’re doing here in the U.S.—building out massive data centers as part of securing that AI advantage. As we know, superintelligence—the ability for AI models to get more and more capable—requires massive amounts of processing power. That’s why we’re seeing huge buildouts here in the U.S., and China’s doing the same thing.

Jim Puplava:

In fact, there was a story in the Wall Street Journal this week that big tech companies from Meta and Microsoft to Amazon are going to be building AI and cloud centers in the Gulf States, because there isn’t enough energy capacity in the U.S. grid to handle the number of AI centers that are needed to make AI practical. They’re going overseas because our infrastructure here is too old.

Cris, let’s get into the first chapters. As I mentioned, the first three chapters—there are seven total—really emphasize the engineering state versus the lawyer state. He talks about massive Chinese infrastructure projects, built with speed, compared to U.S. projects that are delayed or blocked by legal barriers. China’s centralized governance allows coordinated, long-term planning, unlike America’s fragmented policies.

One problem is that in China, a dictatorship comes up with an idea and implements it. In the U.S., you have a political and lawyerly society, and elected officials who can’t think beyond the next election cycle. Everything here tends to be short-term.

In Chapter 2, he talks about the success and scale of these Chinese “mega-projects,” and there’s a YouTube video that showcases them. Compared to that, U.S. infrastructure looks ancient. President Trump once talked about trillions of dollars set aside to build U.S. factories and projects, but Chris, none of that works if it takes five years to get through zoning and environmental studies before you ever build. Like I say, right now, big tech companies are going overseas because our electrical grid simply isn’t modern or strong enough to handle this wave of AI data centers.

Cris Sheridan:

And we should also point out that China now leads in electricity production. They have a large and growing nuclear fleet and coal plants. They’re using every possible resource to achieve their goals of cheap and abundant energy for their economy. We should be doing the same, but we’re hamstrung by policymakers and red tape. That’s really the central point of Dan Wang’s book.

Jim Puplava:

Yeah, one of the things he emphasizes is process knowledge. It’s not just enough to engineer and design something. As Henry Ford demonstrated, with manufacturing you learn from hands-on experience. That knowledge accumulates and makes future production faster and more efficient.

Wang argues that the U.S. has lost this base knowledge by offshoring manufacturing, while China has meticulously built it up. That’s why China is becoming the leader in industries like EVs, green energy (solar panels and windmills), and robotics.

A good example was just this week, when the U.S. banned China from accessing Nvidia’s high-end chips. Instead of giving in, China boycotted lower-tier Nvidia chips and quickly developed an advanced chip of their own—with faster performance at a lower price. That’s process knowledge in action.

Cris Sheridan:

So he’s framing China as an engineering state—capable of rapid, large-scale projects—while the U.S. is a “lawyerly society,” excelling at legal processes but often obstructing progress. Of course, there are pros and cons on both sides. The founders of the U.S. set up checks and balances for good reasons, but as Wang points out, the complexity of this new landscape plays heavily into the multipolar view of power.

Jim Puplava:

We’re basically moving from a unipolar world to a multipolar world. The U.S. just doesn’t have the dominance it once did. Think back to the ’80s, when Reagan’s military buildup helped us win the Cold War. At one point, we had over 600 Navy ships. What shook China was what they witnessed in the Gulf War. They thought the U.S. might stumble like Vietnam, but instead, with our technology, we won in 42 days.

That changed China’s military trajectory. Their philosophy became: whatever the U.S. fears, focus on that. So, they’ve built over 50,000 sea mines in the South China Sea. They developed carrier-killer missiles traveling at twice the speed of sound. They built the world’s largest submarine fleet, mainly diesel-powered, for regional purposes. But now, just this week, they launched sea trials for their first nuclear-powered aircraft carrier with a magnetic catapult—and more are coming. They’re moving from a regional to a global military power.

On a more positive note, towards the end of the book, Wang says both societies can offer something to the world: China with its engineering capabilities, and the U.S. with its commitment to human rights. Ideally, China could become less restrictive, while the U.S. could shed some regulatory burdens.

Cris Sheridan:

That’s similar to what we’ve talked about before. China isn’t just copying anymore. They lead in EVs, robotics, and even in quantum communications. They’re producing patents and breakthroughs beyond the U.S. Maybe it’s time the U.S. starts learning from them and improving their methods for our own needs.

Jim Puplava:

That connects with another book I’m reading right now: First Among Equals: U.S. Foreign Policy in a Multipolar World. And there’s also Graham Allison’s Destined for War: Can America and China Escape Thucydides’s Trap? He argues that unless China moderates its ambition—or unless Washington agrees to share primacy in the Pacific—some conflict (a trade war, cyberattack, or accident at sea) could ignite a much larger war.

But I want to stay positive on this. I think we’re starting to wake up. Pharmaceutical companies are bringing factories back. COVID showed us the downside of overreliance, with half our drugs made in Asia. Ford, Apple, others are also returning production to the U.S. But again, it takes years just to get through permits and impact studies. Five years before pouring a foundation. We need to streamline the process—it doesn’t have to be five; maybe one or two years would be a big improvement.

Cris Sheridan:

So, here in the U.S. we suffer from too much red tape—we’re under-building in housing, development, and infrastructure. Meanwhile, China is guilty of overbuilding—decades of rapid building have created their own problems.

Jim Puplava:

Exactly. They overbuild and overproduce. That’s why exports are so critical for them—they don’t have enough internal consumption to absorb all the products.

Dan Wang emphasizes that the U.S. needs to get back to being a builder nation. Build infrastructure, build factories, restore process knowledge. He recommends watching the video China’s Insane Megaprojects That Make U.S. Infrastructure Look Ancient. It’s astounding what they’ve accomplished.

We’ll continue this theme with our next book review: The Long Game: China’s Grand Strategy to Displace the American Order by Rush Doshi.

Cris Sheridan:

So with that said, again, we were reviewing Breakneck: China’s Quest to Engineer the Future by Dan Wang. It was released August 26, 2025. It’s one of our must-read books this year.

And now for your environmental reports:

As the saga of climate reporting (and misreporting) continues, the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine just released a study confirming, beyond scientific dispute, that human-created greenhouse gases poses current and future harm to our health and welfare. The National Academics undertook this report in response to the Environmental Protection Agency proposal to overturn the endangerment finding. These rules regulate climate pollution, including from coal and gas-fired power plants, cars and trucks, and methane from the oil and gas industry. Despite federal reports minimizing the negative effects of climate change, this research demonstrates that the opposite is the case. Major fossil fuel producers, also known as “carbon majors,” have been linked to the growing frequency and intensity of heatwaves in the past years, confirming their role in the progression of climate change.

Scientists may have the knowledge, but they don’t always have the effective communication skills to drive an impact. Researchers at the University of Notre Dame reveal that while the conservation field has grown to include more diverse voices, disconnects and even overlaps in communication are undermining biodiversity protection efforts.

The solution isn’t getting everyone to agree; in fact, the Notre Dame team developed five practical principles for more productive disagreement. This guidance includes engaging with plural perspectives and recognizing unequal power relationships. The key insight is that conservation conversations work best when they happen in specific places where people share a stake in the outcome, and when power imbalances are directly addressed.

This matters because conservation is fundamentally about people and their choices, not just science. The research shows that addressing these communication gaps and power disparities—especially between the Global North and South—is essential for lasting environmental protection. The principles offer a roadmap for more effective dialogue in an increasingly polarized world, with implications that extend well beyond environmental issues.

The sandhill crane, a wading bird under protected status in Indiana, is treasured for its tall, elegant profile, red-orange cap, and memorable bugle call. Once extirpated from (no longer found in) Ohio, things are looking up for this impressive bird. The Ohio DNR has recorded their reappearance over the past three decades, including a 4% increase in the observed sandhill crane population in 2025 alone. These birds are often found migrating through northern Indiana up to the tens of thousands and can be spotted at Jasper-Pulaski Fish & Wildlife Area and southwest of Bloomington at Goose Pond Fish & Wildlife Area.

Human-Caused Warming Tripled the Death Toll of European Heat Waves This Summer, New Report Shows.

Public health researchers struggle to track the accelerating pace of global warming impact.

There have been few hurricanes this year due to factors like persistent wind shear, widespread sinking air in the atmosphere, and a larger-scale pattern of dry, stable air over the Atlantic. While sea surface temperatures remain warm enough, these conditions have thwarted the development and organization of tropical systems. However, with a upcoming cycle expected to shift and bring lower-pressure air back to the Atlantic, increased hurricane activity is forecast for late in the season.

International efforts to reach an agreement on reducing plastic pollution are disappointing. But we don’t need to wait for a treaty to make changes in our own lives.

Progress towards a legally binding global treaty on plastics pollution stalled and went into reverse this past week. The United Nations Intergovernmental Negotiating Committee meeting in Geneva, Switzerland, ran overtime. It’s likely to conclude without an agreement.

This is an incredibly disappointing result. Members of the Scientists’ Coalition for an Effective Plastics Treaty, were hoping for action to genuinely curb plastic pollution. Their priorities included considering the whole life cycle rather than just disposal, setting targets to reduce plastic production, and regulating the use of harmful additives to reduce risks to human health.

Unfortunately, vested interests hijacked the negotiations. Countries with major petrochemical producers resisted caps on virgin plastic production. We’ve seen this before. Legitimate scientific concerns about harm have been downplayed by powerful interests time and time again — with tobacco, PFAS, asbestos, and climate change.

When it comes to plastics — especially the micro- and nanoplastics now invading our bodies — awareness and early action could make all the difference. But we can still take action into our own hands as consumers, to minimise exposure and reduce waste. It we act together, we can also send a powerful message to the plastics manufacturing industry.

Health insurance plans through Kentucky’s marketplace, kynect, are used largely by small business owners, older Americans ineligible for Medicare and rural residents.
Originally introduced by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the subsidies grew during Covid-19 under former President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
“I believe health care is a basic human right, and we should expand access, not make it more difficult to afford.

The credits allowed federal funds to subsidize health insurance markets for people who make more than Medicaid recipients but lack a work-sponsored health benefit. Health insurance plans through Kentucky’s marketplace, kynect, are used largely by small business owners, older Americans ineligible for Medicare and rural residents.

A letter signed by Gov. Andy Beshear and seventeen other governors earlier this month urges Congress to take action and extend the credits.

“If they expire, premiums will rise by thousands of dollars for many families, millions will lose coverage, and people will be forced to make impossible choices between paying for healthcare, rent, or groceries,” the letter states.

Without the subsidies, the program’s premiums are expected to “increase dramatically in January,” according to a Sept. 26 news release from Beshear’s office.

Originally introduced by the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare, the subsidies grew during Covid-19 under former President Joe Biden’s American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022. Many of those more recent enhanced expansion plans had their premium plans reduced to $0.

“Rising costs for everyday needs are hurting Kentuckians, and I am committed to raising my voice and taking action to help,” Beshear said in a statement. “I believe health care is a basic human right, and we should expand access, not make it more difficult to afford.

“Between the ‘big, ugly bill’ taking aim at our health care system and the threat of these credits expiring, quality health care is going to be out of reach for most families – and that’s just wrong. ”

Predictions show President Donald Trump’s cuts to Medicaid under the One Big, Beautiful Bill Act could take health care away from more than 200,000 Kentuckians.

Dustin Pugel at the Kentucky Center for Economic Policy cautioned that if Congress doesn’t extend the premiums, health insurance rates could go up due to an imbalance between who is paying for care and who is receiving care.

“When the folks who are using less care but still paying in premiums leave, that raises rates for everybody else, because insurance companies have to compensate for that,” Pugel said. “And so it creates a spiral that, you know, we wouldn’t see this year, but we may see in future years.”

Costs have already been rising for hospital stays and doctor’s visits, according to a Peterson-KFF report. It also noted general inflationary pressures, labor costs and specialty prescriptions as factors in the increased rates.

Advocates like Priscilla Easterling, outreach director at Kentucky Voices for Health, think state lawmakers could take on investments to kynect next session if Congress doesn’t extend the subsidies. But ultimately, she hopes for broader access across the nation.

“We’re urging Congress to take action, ideally making those improvements permanent so individuals and families can count on stable, affordable coverage long-term,” Easterling said.",https://www.kentucky.com/public/latest-news/sp93mc/picture312041215/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/GettyImages-2197708857.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 06:58:10.285352

Commenters challenged the post after it claimed turbine blades cannot be recycled and are piling up in landfills, fueling misconceptions that more affordable energy sources like wind are more harmful than helpful.

In practice, wind energy is one of the most effective solutions available for cutting polluting gases. Turbines generate far more energy over their lifetimes than is used to manufacture them.

According to a 2013 study in the journal Energy Policy, the energy return on investment of wind ranges from 18 to 20. This means it delivers many times more energy than what goes into building and operating it.

While estimates vary, most studies find that wind projects make up for the pollution produced during its construction in just a few months.

For instance, one study published in Renewable Energy found that the average energy payback for turbines is seven months. Another study that the New Scientist shared provided estimates between seven and nine months.

That's a small trade-off, considering wind turbines have a typical lifespan of 20 to 25 years, according to Yale Climate Connections.

While the Reddit poster claimed that thousands of wind turbine blades end up in Wyoming landfills each year, others pointed out that the problem is mostly tied to turbines built decades ago.

""The ones that are being recycled or buried right now are from 25 years ago, when there was no thought in recycling wind turbines. Modern-day blades are made to recycle,"" one user explained.

An article in the MIT Climate Portal highlighted that some turbine parts can be recycled. These include wiring, electrical components, and steel towers. However, recycling turbine blades is still considered a challenge because they're made from composite materials like fiberglass.

Researchers are looking into making blades using easily recyclable plastics, the MIT article explained. Companies like Veolia and GE are collaborating to develop recycling technologies that can shred fiberglass blades and transform them into cement.

As reported by the Union of Concerned Scientists, businesses are also stepping up and turning turbine blades into textiles and railroad pellets. Consumers and communities benefit directly from this transition. Wind energy projects help offset energy costs.

U.S. wind turbines are also reducing air pollution by over 100 million tons annually, the American Clean Power Association reported. According to the U.S. Department of Energy, this reduction in air pollutants can minimize health effects like asthma and bronchitis.

Though posted three years ago, the conversation reflects misconceptions that still circulate today.

One Redditor noted: ""Not as clean as solar but much cleaner than oil.""

Another user summed up: ""This is a bad take if I am being honest.

The Michigan Department of Transportation expects next spring to issue another round of requests for proposals to add more DC fast chargers in hopes of encouraging EV adoption. Limited access to charging stations, particularly fast chargers that can add 100 miles of range on some EVs in as little as 10 minutes, is one of the biggest causes of hesitancy and range anxiety for consumers in assessing whether to get an EV.

The U.S. Department of Transportation last week approved the state's revised plan under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, paving the way for the release of $52 million remaining from $110 million originally allocated for the program before President Donald Trump's administration froze the funding in February.

""We're still very much moving ahead with the NEVI program, and never stopped,"" said Steve Minton, who is managing the project for MDOT. ""And we're excited to be able to utilize the remaining funding, and work with the industry to get as many chargers out as we can with the funding that we have left, and do it in a strategic way that will benefit the state of Michigan's citizens.""

The federal funding pause was for the $5 billion Biden-era NEVI initiative included in the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. Republican and Democratic lawmakers both criticized the program after it produced a few completed, functional charging stations within its first three years — becoming a poster child for government inefficiency.

But after a signal that a court could rule against the administration's funding pause, the Federal Highway Administration last month issued revised rules that seek to provide more flexibility to states and reduce red tape. States had to supply their updated agreements within 30 days.

""While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently,"" Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said when the new rules were announced.

Michigan's updated fiscal 2026 plan has about 70 fewer chargers than before the revisions, Minton said. In particular, the plan focuses on how the state will use the remaining funds, the kind of community engagement it has done to develop and receive feedback on the plan, and cybersecurity strategies to protect the network.

Much of the information in MDOT's revised plan is from its previous update. The department kept the plans for future use of the funds general, including applications for major routes, community charging, destination charging and future consideration, Minton said.

""There wasn't time,"" he said, ""to really get down to a specific level of detail with how we're going to use every last dollar.""

That, however, will be part of the next step. NEVI first requires the buildout of ""alternate fuel corridors"" along which to place the chargers off highways at locations like gas stations, convenience stores and supermarkets. In Michigan , those corridors include Interstates 75, 96 and 69, U.S. 127 and other major roadways.

The Biden-era rules required that chargers be installed within 50 miles of each other, but the Trump revision allows states to set that distance to whatever they believe is reasonable. MDOT chose 60 miles, though in the Upper Peninsula, the distance is as much as about 80 miles after the department didn't receive a proposal to shrink that spread. MDOT was planning to submit a letter this week to the FHWA certifying that buildout.

""We've got 83 stations,"" Minton said, ""along these AFCs that we feel achieves that buildout status.""

Michigan is expected to achieve buildout in the next few years. Trump's funding pause didn't stop reimbursement for already-approved NEVI charger locations in Michigan, though just two sites — in Lansing and Walker outside of Grand Rapids — have been completed so far. They include a total of 10 charging ports. Another four sites are under construction, and Minton said he expects 10 could be completed by the end of the year.

With the fuel corridor charger buildout certified, Michigan would be free to use the charger funds for discretionary projects. That may include more chargers along those corridors, but also could include chargers in local communities, along other major highways like U.S. 23 in northeast Michigan, in population centers like Metro Detroit, Grand Rapids and Lansing and tourism destinations, and for heavy trucking.

MDOT will work on prioritizing those objectives in the coming months in consultation with other relevant agencies and external partners. Minton said he expected that by March or April, the state will issue its next request for proposals for that funding, which will be the largest money pot compared to previous NEVI RFPs.A Michigan State University study that concluded Michigan needs more than 66,600 chargers — estimated to cost $998 million — to support 25% EV market penetration will help inform the plans.

""We had plenty to do with round one and round two, with having 83 sites that we weren't ready to even start the next round,"" Minton said. ""The time it took for them to figure out if they were going to move ahead with NEVI or what they were going to do, it allowed us to continue on. And then when they did finally release the guidance update in August, it was actually really good timing for us.""

MDOT gave companies awarded funds in 2023 under NEVI three years to get the chargers up and running. Those awarded in 2024 have two years. The state, however, is still bringing some of those companies under contract with the proper documents, insurance and proof of bonding to be a state and federal contractor.

""That's been a learning curve for the industry,"" Minton said.

Additionally, electrical components for transformers and switch gears needed to support the buildout of fast chargers can have long lead times. MDOT must obligate its NEVI funds prior to the end of the 2026 fiscal year, but there isn't a federal deadline by when the funds must be used. In addition to the years to design and build out these sites, companies are reimbursed by up to 80% over five years, during which time they commit to operate and maintain the chargers.

Given the pulled and then reinstated funding for NEVI, Minton said there's motivation to secure contracts for the funding, though stopping it likely would require an act by Congress: ""I'm not seeing a lot of risk if we take a little time to do some planning. We don't want to just jump into another solicitation. And we've been engaged with our Federal Highway office division, and they're on board with our approach to how we're going to move ahead. We're not going to drag our feet with it.""

Mehrnaz Ghamami, an associate professor at MSU's College of Engineering who co-authored the EV charger report, said roadways for intercity travel should be the priority to reduce range anxiety, given that cold weather can reduce battery capacity by 30%.

""Without fueling stations,"" she said, ""a lot of those trips won't be EVs.""

Michigan so far has done a good job of filling those gaps, she said, though some remain, especially in the Upper Peninsula. Some areas don't even have gas stations or other locations to install chargers.

With residents in urban areas more likely to adopt EVs, ensuring access to charging stations for those in multi-family housing units would help increase EV use in Michigan, Ghamami added. Support for medium-duty and heavy-duty transportation is also an important next space to address.

The new federal guidance removed an order for states to ensure ""the deployment, installation, operation, and use of EV charging infrastructure achieves equitable and fair distribution of benefits and services."" It also eliminated a requirement for states to explain how their NEVI implementation would encourage participation from small businesses, including minority-owned and women-owned small businesses. The new requirements also minimized state obligations to consider ""electric grid integration and renewable energy.""

The revised rules, however, don't prevent states from taking those matters into account, and the research for Michigan's original proposal will continue to inform its plans and priorities as it moves ahead.

""We may not just come out and say it directly,"" Minton said about ensuring charging in disadvantaged communities, ""but we'll still be looking at that very much.""

Detroit-based Red-E is a supplier of EV chargers and their software. It’s supplying dozens of NEVI locations in Michigan and more nationally. CEO Abass El-Hage illustrated the difference the funding makes: A regularly used charger in a place like Los Angeles might be able to make up the investment in three to five years without incentives. But in more remote areas, a charger might only see two vehicles per day. The payback could be 10 to 15 years.

“The incentives come in to bridge that gap,” El-Hage said, making the deployment of chargers in rural places possible where it otherwise wouldn’t make financial sense to do so.

One of the biggest concerns in the program's deployment had been the cost for infrastructure to support fast chargers in remote areas — which small utility companies in northern Michigan and the Upper Peninsula were estimating could be millions of dollars in some cases. With the 50-mile requirement gone, that alleviates the risks of Michigan losing out on funding, though it doesn't address the challenge of making EV charging available in those areas as NEVI was intended to support.

Companies like Toronto-based eCamion Inc.'s Jule are helping address those obstacles. The EV charging system supplier includes massive lithium ion battery storage with its system. Doing so helps particularly rural areas avoid costs of upward half-a-million dollars for utility infrastructure upgrades to support direct-from-grid charging, said Joseph Povolo, Jule’s sales and marketing coordinator.

Instead, the system allows the battery storage to charge during off-peak hours at night when electricity use is “next to nothing,” Povolo said. Energy from the battery then charges EVs that visit the ports, typically during the day. The system also lessens the burden on rural electrical grids by charging during off-peak times to lessen the need to increase the electricity generation needed during peak times, such as the afternoon.

“We take whatever spare capacity on the nearest transformer,” Povolo said. “Usually, we don’t need more than 50 kilowatts of spare capacity. If that’s what you have, that’s more than enough.”

The U.S.-built batteries also act as a backup power source in the event of a power outage. Jule has more than 100 ports across roughly 40 locations. There is a pipeline of 60 planned NEVI sites nationally, including at least two in the Upper Peninsula in Quinnesec and Iron Mountain. Another 150 to 200 sites in Canada are expected to come online in the next two to three years.

Povolo declined to provide exact pricing for the system, but it’s at least a quarter of a million dollars for the system alone. Red-E’s system, including installation, is around that.

""That is one option in more rural areas that we support,"" Minton said. ""I imagine we'll have more of that as we move ahead.""

The funding aims to support environmental site assessments, cleanup planning, and community engagement, strengthening redevelopment projects across Kansas.

“We are honored to present funds for Brownfields Assessment Grants to Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the city of Topeka, highlighting their commitment to transforming communities across the Heartland,” said Jim Macy, EPA Region 7 Administrator.

Local Impact in Topeka

The City of Topeka received $500,000 in Community-Wide Grant funds. These dollars will be used to complete eight Phase I and three Phase II environmental site assessments, maintain an inventory of brownfield properties, and support reuse planning. Priority sites include:

The 36-acre former White Lakes Mall

Two former schools

Mayor Mike Padilla emphasized the city’s collaborative approach: “It is great to be able to work with different organizations to reinvest in Topeka to create clean new areas for growth.”

Statewide Revitalization Efforts

KDHE received $2 million in Community-Wide Assessment funds. These will support 116 Phase I and Phase II site assessments statewide, preparation of at least three cleanup plans, and annual community meetings to provide progress updates.

Priority focus areas include:

Oak Grove neighborhood, Kansas City (Land Bank properties)

Eureka: former racetrack, nursing home, Masonic Lodge, and expansion sites near the fire department

El Dorado: the Grizzly Development

“These Community-Wide Grant funds from EPA put Kansas communities in the position to leverage additional funds that will aid in redevelopment, revitalization, and cleanup plans across the state,” said KDHE Secretary Janet Stanek.

Broader Context

The EPA Brownfields Program has provided more than $2 billion in funding nationwide since 1995, supporting cleanup or assessment of more than 35,000 sites and leveraging over $35 billion in redevelopment investment. In Kansas, these grants have supported renewal of industrial, retail, and institutional sites, bringing them back into productive community use.

By targeting properties such as malls, schools, and land bank parcels, the Topeka and KDHE grants align with a broader trend of linking brownfield redevelopment to housing, infrastructure, and resilience planning across the Midwest.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250926-092716-f43-Kansas%20City%20downtown%20skyline.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 07:59:47.915136

Pairing a rooftop solar system with an energy-efficient heat pump can further reduce your energy costs.
However, to claim the maximum amount of savings, ensure that installations are completed by the end of 2025, before the 30% federal tax credit for both heat pumps and solar panels expires.","Installing solar panels and backup battery storage is one of the best ways to save money on electric bills and keep the lights on during outages, but Stanford scientists say better policies are needed to give more people access to clean, affordable energy.

What's happening?

According to a study published in Nature Energy, Stanford researchers found that around 60% of U.S. households could reduce electricity costs by roughly 15% by investing in a solar and storage home system.

A residential solar setup would also help families ride out power outages — which are becoming more frequent due to an aging grid and extreme weather events — safely and comfortably, per a summary by Stanford University.

However, the team noted that households with higher energy burdens that experience more blackouts than normal and would consequently see the greatest benefits from a home solar system have the least access to energy upgrades.

""The solar-battery benefits often fail to align with the areas that need them most, like in certain high-outage-risk states where only one-fourth of households can get affordable backup power from solar-battery systems,"" Arun Majumdar, Stanford Doerr School of Sustainability dean and co-author of the study, said in the report.

The authors explained that the inequitable distribution of solar energy in many areas is partially due to policymakers' ""knowledge gap"" regarding how to increase adoption of rooftop solar and battery packs in high-risk locations.

Luckily, free tools provided by EnergySage make it easy for homeowners to access affordable solar panels, as they can compare quotes from qualified installers in their area.

Why are inadequate policies regarding electric bills concerning?

Electricity costs are climbing in many states due to infrastructure challenges and more extreme weather triggering blackouts. As a result, more people are considering investing in home solar and battery storage to save on bills and reduce the strain on the climate and grid.

Since many utilities offer solar buyback plans that credit homeowners for the excess energy they generate, it makes it even easier to save on energy costs.

However, utilities in some states, such as California, have switched to net billing tariffs rather than net metering policies, as it better incentivizes battery storage while addressing the financial burden on non-solar customers.

In states such as Iowa and Idaho, which still use net metering, and in disadvantaged communities, investing in a home battery system may not be feasible or offer the same benefits.

The study's authors suggested that policymakers look into ""incentive programs, rate approvals, and industry regulations"" that could promote a more equitable energy landscape while increasing grid resilience.

""Economic incentives, financing mechanisms, and community-based deployment programs that target areas with high financial and reliability needs but low economic viability of solar-battery systems could help families that need such systems the most,"" Tao Sun, a postdoctoral scholar at Stanford and the study's lead author, said.

What can be done to reduce energy bills?

As the study explained, since solar panels generate free electricity and battery systems store that energy for later use at night or during high-cost peak hours, a home system can significantly reduce energy costs.

With EnergySage, homeowners can take advantage of up to $10,000 in savings on solar purchases and installations, making it a great service for all your solar needs.

And with its free mapping tool, you can see the average cost of a solar system and available tax incentives and rebates on a state-by-state basis, ensuring you benefit from all the savings you're eligible for while getting the best price on home solar.

Pairing a rooftop solar system with an energy-efficient heat pump can further reduce your energy costs. Thanks to EnergySage's free heat pump quote comparison tool, you can find an installer and the right heat pump for your budget, along with an affordable home solar setup, all in one place.

Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona face the greatest health risks from extreme heat—the deadliest weather-related hazard in the U.S.","A new state ranking published by the Commonwealth Fund compares all 50 states and Washington, D.C. on their climate risks.

The scorecard, which the organization said is the first of its kind, evaluated states on eight indicators. They include flood risk, healthcare facilities, energy efficiency policies and the health impacts of emissions from electricity generation and the healthcare sector overall. The report was written by researchers at Northeastern University and Yale University.

“The health care sector is dedicated to promoting patient health but also contributes significantly to climate change and environmental harm,” the report said. “Because of this interconnectedness, it is incumbent upon the sector to embrace sustainability measures and climate action in order to uphold its commitment to ‘do no harm.’”

Vermont, New York, Washington, New Jersey and Maine ranked safest overall, thanks to their strong energy efficiency and clean energy policies. They are also less vulnerable to environmental hazards and have lower healthcare sector emissions.

West Virginia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Florida and Mississippi ranked lowest. These states face more frequent and intense hazards and don’t have supportive energy and environmental policies, per the report.

“As a physician, I have seen firsthand how closely the environment and health are linked,” Joseph R. Betancourt, M.D., Commonwealth Fund president, said in a press release. “People are better off when they can breathe clean air and when the hospitals they depend on are prepared for extreme weather. I hope this scorecard inspires states to learn from one another’s efforts to reduce pollution, prepare for environmental risks, and better protect people’s health.”

Some states face greater natural risks than others. Nevada, New Mexico and Arizona face the greatest health risks from extreme heat—the deadliest weather-related hazard in the U.S.

Both Arizona and California have the poorest air quality, driven by ground-level ozone, wildfire smoke and dust. The states with the cleanest air were Alaska and Hawaii.

The report also ranked flood risk to hospitals. Florida has the highest share of hospital beds in high-hazard flood zones, at nearly 15%. Louisiana and Mississippi also face severe flood risks.

Healthcare accounts for 8.5% of the country’s greenhouse gas emissions. West Virginia, Wyoming and North Dakota were among the states with the highest per capita, healthcare-related emissions, reflecting heavy reliance on fossil fuels.

Mississippi, South Carolina and Alabama have the highest emissions related to healthcare worker commutes, linked to limited public transit options and longer travel distances for staff. These emissions, the report noted, significantly contribute to the sector’s carbon footprint.

The report highlighted opportunities for policies at the federal, state and health system levels. The authors recommended that policymakers strengthen clean energy and energy efficiency policies. They urged them to support healthcare facilities in assessing climate risks and preparing for extreme weather. They also recommended requiring standardized reporting of healthcare sector emissions to guide improvements and helping healthcare organizations invest in climate-resilient infrastructure, clean power and low-emission transport options for patients and staff.

“Extreme weather is no longer a distant threat—it's happening more often and disrupting care across the nation,” said Matthew Eckelman, Ph.D., Northeastern University associate professor and associate chair for research of civil and environmental engineering. “No state is spared, and every community is vulnerable. But action matters. Our scorecard shows that states with strong clean energy and resilience policies are doing a better job protecting health and health care infrastructure, while other states leave patients exposed during potential crises.”",https://qtxasset.com/quartz/qcloud5/media/image/GettyImages-2077603530.jpg?VersionId=z.X_Sq0002eRzmae21OsS.Xx69iwVNVu,N,,2025-09-27 14:01:53.149715

Also on today's episode: we dig into Volvo's recent technology woes, and what it's doing to fix its next-generation cars.","We anticipated that if the federal electric-vehicle tax credits were to disappear, we'd see a slowdown in EV sales here in the United States. What we did not anticipate was the rapid-fire retreat from this space that we're now seeing from some automakers. It's enough for EV aficionados to ask: Was any of it ever real? Does America still have a shot at an electric future, or are we as a country in our ""back to gas"" era?

That's what my co-host Tim Levin and I are diving into on this week's Plugged-In Podcast. In just the past couple of weeks, we've heard of EV cancellations, slowdowns and delays from Porsche, Nissan, Volkswagen and Acura, just off the top of my head. More moves are coming, I'm sure.

But here's how to think about this current moment.

As we'll dive into on the show, a lot of this also has to do with the added complication of tariffs. When automakers are facing billions in added costs every quarter, unprofitable EVs that aren't selling at rates they were projected to are first to go. And then there's what I believe to be the real issue: the loss of any real fuel-economy regulations or penalties here in America.

With no ""carrot"" to entice customers to go electric and no ""stick"" to punish them if they don't, it's back to business as usual—which is objectively bad news for America's climate, clean air, technological competition with China, and even what I'd say is customer choice. A lot of folks were choosing these cars. What options will they have a few years from now?

BMW, for one, is responding by saying ""all of them"": the next X5 will come with gas, diesel, plug-in hybrid, electric and hydrogen powertrains. Talk about playing the spread.

But Tim and I also believe that when you look at worldwide trends around electrification, autonomy and the rise of electric mobility, this field can't be stopped. Not forever. And we have reasons to be optimistic, which we'll dig into today.

That's contingent on automakers getting new technologies right, of course. Also on today's episode: we dig into Volvo's recent technology woes, and what it's doing to fix its next-generation cars.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/P3MMQA/s1/nko-pzxshok.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 05:57:58.035281

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Nuclear Energy Institute President and CEO Maria Korsnick gave an expansive overview of the nuclear industry’s growth in May at the Nuclear Energy Policy Forum.
Advanced nuclear technologies had long been confined to research labs, but between 2015 and 2022 the number of commercial nuclear ventures tripled.
Out of that grew the nation’s first nuclear engineering degree program and one of the earliest university-based nuclear reactors.","Nuclear energy is in the midst of its largest expansion in three decades, with 70 reactors under construction in 15 countries as of this summer. Interest in the carbon-free power source has grown in recent years as nations work to expand dependable, domestic energy supplies to support rising electricity demand.

In the U.S., bipartisan federal support that ramped up in the Biden administration has continued under President Trump, with a pilot program to fast-track testing advanced reactor designs and executive orders that aim to quadruple nuclear energy capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050. Utilities are finding ways to extend the lives of operating plants beyond their initial charters. And the private sector is investing in startups that are developing small modular reactors and making big discoveries for future fusion technology.

Appetites for nuclear energy have ebbed and flowed since even before the technology first connected to the grid in the 1960s. The University of Michigan has been at the forefront all along, from establishing the first university-based initiative dedicated to the peaceful uses of nuclear technology to the technological, educational, and diplomatic leadership its faculty and alumni provide today in labs, classrooms and communities around the world.

Todd Allen is the Glenn F. and Gladys H. Knoll Department Chair of Nuclear Engineering and Radiological Sciences—the nation’s No. 1-ranked department of its kind. In this Q&A, he discusses the past and future of nuclear energy and how U-M is working to facilitate safe deployment.

Michigan Engineering: What brought about the resurgence of interest in nuclear energy?

Allen: Several factors led to the surge we’re seeing today, which is truly unprecedented. The first is the climate. Nuclear energy has always been free of carbon emissions and so as countries and companies have sought to rein in emissions, nuclear has become increasingly attractive. Other major factors are the need for energy security coupled with the rising demand for electricity. In the US, this is driven in part by electric vehicles and data centers for AI.

We’ve also seen exciting technological advancements in areas like small modular reactors, microreactors and other advanced reactor designs that can offer safe, cheaper, and more flexible options than traditional plants, and that has led to more private sector interest. As just one example, in early 2025, Amazon led a $500 million funding round for X Energy, a small modular reactor company. Nuclear Energy Institute President and CEO Maria Korsnick gave an expansive overview of the nuclear industry’s growth in May at the Nuclear Energy Policy Forum.

How has fusion progress—such as the first fusion ignition in a 2022 experiment led by alum Annie Kritcher—contributed to renewed nuclear interest?

Allen: The physics breakthroughs that got us a step closer to fusion energy are certainly contributing now, but the resurgence of interest in traditional nuclear fission energy was already well underway. Advanced nuclear technologies had long been confined to research labs, but between 2015 and 2022 the number of commercial nuclear ventures tripled.

There’s a lot of excitement about fusion’s potential to provide abundant clean energy and we’ve seen significant investment in fusion startups. Our alumni are playing lead roles in that space and we’re very proud of them. I think it’s important to manage expectations about the timeline for deployment. And in the meantime, we’re going to see a lot of advancement and deployment in fission technology.

Tell us more about nuclear fission advancements and what’s happening at the University of Michigan.

Allen: I mentioned smaller nuclear reactors. Microreactors are the size of a shipping container and would use around 1,000 times less land than a traditional large reactor. They’d be simpler to maintain and operate and could serve as energy sources in remote areas or for specific loads such as dedicated power for a military base. Larger advanced reactors that might support a data center are also smaller than traditional reactors. We have researchers working on various aspects of these advanced technologies and their components. We’re also developing hand-held radiation detectors to streamline plant maintenance and ensure nuclear materials stay secure. We’re working to identify the best materials for fusion reactors, and much more.

It’s important to recognize that technology is just one of the pieces needed to accelerate nuclear deployment. Community support is another critical factor, and historically that’s been challenging to maintain. At U-M we’re working closely with communities to understand their needs.

I think one of the most important things we’re doing here is helping to develop the nuclear workforce of the future. We do that in our own labs, classrooms and communities and also by leading efforts to convene educators from around the country and the world. Next week on campus we’re hosting the first ever symposium of the Nuclear Energy Agency’s Global Forum on Nuclear Education, Science, Technology, and Policy. It brings together academic, industry, and policy leaders from around the world to shape strategies for educating the next generation of nuclear experts.

Building the workforce to quadruple nuclear energy by 2050 is a tall order. How else is U-M contributing?

Allen: It’s certainly ambitious. The executive orders that set this goal include a mandate to create tens of thousands of jobs in that timeframe. I wrote about some of this in the memo Building the Nuclear Workforce: Unleashing American Nuclear Home and Abroad for Third Way. The nation’s engineering schools have their work cut out for them.

At U-M, we recently launched a minor in nuclear engineering and radiological sciences so more engineering students can be exposed to the field and its opportunities. We run a host of outreach programs for students in high school and even younger. And those in our programs, we prepare for the nuclear industry of the future, which is very different from what it was in the past.

If you go back to the first generation of commercial nuclear technology, we had large, custom-built electricity generation stations. But today new companies are working to build reactors of lots of different sizes and for different purposes. The first ones were just for electricity, but that’s changing. Dow Chemical, for example, wants them just for the heat they produce. There are so many different deployment scenarios possible and with that there are a lot more and varied opportunities for jobs. You can go work for a startup company. You can be involved in business development or putting out a new product. You can work for the regulator.

At U-M, we’re uniquely suited to prepare students for this wide range of options as well as the extended range of knowledge the field now requires. That’s because of the breadth of expertise on our campus. We’re working with our Department of Naval Architecture and Marine Engineering on opportunities in nuclear for maritime shipping. There are opportunities in advanced manufacturing. Those are just a couple examples.

The good news is young people are getting the message. Undergraduate enrollment this fall in nuclear engineering is up 25% from where it was five years ago. I think the zero-carbon nature of the technology attracts a lot of students.

We’ve talked about the future of nuclear energy, but can you touch on U-M’s role in its past?

Allen: Certainly—the University of Michigan was really one of the founders of the field. Way back in 1948, just a few years after World War II, U-M established the Michigan Memorial Phoenix Project to advance peaceful uses of nuclear technology. Out of that grew the nation’s first nuclear engineering degree program and one of the earliest university-based nuclear reactors. Our professors have gone on to win Nobel Prizes. Our alumni have served in leadership roles in government and industry.

From the earliest days, the University of Michigan has treated nuclear energy as a topic that requires discussion across our campus and beyond, and that continues today.",https://news.engin.umich.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/2022-michigan-memorial-phoenix-project.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 04:57:44.404010

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers — a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible. For instance, it’s unclear exactly how much the social media giant will pay toward the cost — more than $3 billion — for new electrical infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing to create a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags other states in efforts to insulate regular power consumers from costs tied to data centers.

There is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals, said Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for environmental advocacy group Earthjustice.

“You can’t follow the facts; you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” she said.

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option and if the project will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to lost revenue totaling “tens of millions of dollars or more each year.”

Meta has agreed to pay for about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commissioner Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of its contract or not renew it, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish, and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic is frustrating residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington said.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

In recent years, the signs of climate change have become impossible to ignore. From record breaking heatwaves sweeping across Europe to devastating floods in Asia and prolonged droughts in Africa, the Earth is sending clear warnings. At the center of the crisis is one undeniable fact: our reliance on fossil fuels is heating up the planet. The question now is not if we must act, but how.

The Promise of Renewables: One of the most promising answers lies in renewable energy. Unlike coal, oil, and gas, renewable sources such as solar, wind, hydropower, and biomass offer clean, sustainable alternatives. They don’t just promise to reduce greenhouse gas emissions; they also carry the potential to transform economies, create jobs, and secure a healthier future.

Solar and Wind Power: Take solar energy, for instance. Once dismissed as too costly, solar panels are now becoming a common sight on rooftops and fields. The cost of photovoltaic technology has plummeted in the past decade, making solar one of the most affordable sources of power worldwide. In sun-rich regions, entire communities are powering homes, schools, and businesses with

nothing more than rays of light. Wind power, too, is making waves literally. From the expansive plains of Texas to offshore farms in the North Sea, giant turbines are harnessing gusts of wind to feed national grids. These projects don’t just deliver clean electricity; they also generate thousands of jobs in manufacturing, installation, and maintenance.

Hydropower and Biomass: Hydropower remains a cornerstone of renewable energy, particularly in countries blessed with powerful rivers. While large dams often spark environmental debates, small-scale hydropower systems are gaining popularity as sustainable solutions for rural areas. Biomass energy, meanwhile, is quietly revolutionizing waste management, turning agricultural residues and organic waste into usable fuel.

Policy and Community Action: Governments and businesses are central to this transformation. Across the world, policy incentives from tax breaks to renewable energy targets are encouraging innovation and investment. In some African and Asian countries, community led mini-grids are bringing affordable electricity to villages for the very first time, replacing smoky kerosene lamps with clean, reliable light.

Challenges Ahead: Yet, challenges persist. High upfront costs, inconsistent government policies, and inadequate infrastructure continue to hinder progress, particularly in developing nations. There are also concerns about balancing renewable expansion with environmental protection, such as land use for solar farms or the impact of dams on ecosystems.

A Future Powered by Clean Energy: Despite these obstacles, the momentum is clear: the renewable revolution is no longer a distant dream, but a present reality. Global investments in renewables have outpaced fossil fuels for several years, and more nations are pledging to achieve net-zero emissions within the coming decades. The benefits extend beyond tackling climate change. A shift to renewables strengthens energy security by reducing dependence on imported fuels. It improves air quality, lowering the burden of respiratory diseases caused by pollution. Most importantly, it offers hope to younger generations that the world can still chart a sustainable course. As the world grapples with the urgent need for climate action, renewable energy stands out as both a practical and powerful solution. By embracing the sun, the wind, water, and even waste, humanity has the tools to rewrite its energy story. The challenge now is to accelerate the pace, overcome the barriers, and ensure that clean energy is not a privilege for a few, but a right for all.

There’s nothing like a shared frustration to bring people together. For a group of Mid-Atlantic and Midwestern states, that’s rising power prices on the grid operated by PJM Interconnection. Both Republican and Democratic governors are calling out PJM’s management and demanding change — a repeat of a cycle that’s been going on for years and has no easy solution.

The U.S. is home to seven regional transmission organizations and independent system operators that are each responsible for managing power transmission and operating energy markets among utilities in their area. PJM is the largest, serving more than 65 million customers across D.C., Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia, and 10 other states. And for years, leaders in those states have said it’s not doing a great job.

The crux of the issue is rising electricity prices. This summer, PJM announced a new record in its annual capacity auction, which it uses to secure power resources for the grid. Prices hit $16.1 billion, up from $2.2 billion in 2023, Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reported in July.

There are a few reasons for the spike in costs. For one, PJM expects that it will need a ton more power-generation capacity in the coming years as data centers come online — though experts dispute just how big the AI energy-demand bubble will actually be. PJM does have a massive backlog of clean-power and battery projects looking to connect to the grid and meet that demand. But the operator hasn’t undertaken reforms that critics say could speed interconnections, and is instead campaigning to keep expensive, dirty fossil-fuel power plants online.

PJM member states’ longstanding dispute with the grid operator reemerged this week as 11 of their governors met in Philadelphia. There, Pennsylvania’s Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro and Virginia’s Republican Gov. Glenn Youngkin both said they would leave PJM if states don’t get a bigger role in the grid operator’s governance.

“This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence,” Youngkin said. ​“It’s this crisis that demands real reform, real reform immediately — and at the top of the list is that states must have a real say.”

PJM President and CEO Manu Asthana acknowledged that his organization needs to take cost-cutting steps like improving its load forecasting and interconnection processes, but he also put the onus on states to better their own infrastructure siting and permitting rules.

Washington Analysis researcher Rob Rains is doubtful that states will follow through and depart PJM. He said doing so could actually cost customers more in the short term, as the states may have to negotiate their own power procurement at rates even higher than what PJM has secured. Rains predicts that instead of cutting ties with the grid operator, governors will pull other levers to pressure PJM to establish stronger power-market safeguards to keep prices low. Meanwhile, analysts at ClearView Energy Partners suggest states should keep up their push to get more electricity generation developed as soon as possible.

On Wednesday, around 120 countries announced new emissions-reduction plans and climate commitments. That included China, the world’s top carbon polluter, which declared it would aim to cut emissions at least 7% from its peak by 2035. New pledges also came from other major emitters, including the European Union, and from countries with smaller populations and lower gross domestic product.

But the U.S. wasn’t among them. Instead, in a speech on Tuesday, President Donald Trump railed against all things green, clean, and climate-friendly. Climate change is ​“the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” Trump said — a scientifically unsound statement, to say the least.

The summit came just days after U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres said the Paris climate agreement is at risk of ​“collapsing” and that countries needed to ramp up their emissions goals to get things back on track.

Utilities are failing on climate, Sierra Club says

For the past four years, the Sierra Club has annually graded the U.S.’s biggest utilities on their clean-energy progress. The marks haven’t been stellar, but utilities were at least taking steps in the right direction. That is, until this year, when the Sierra Club granted utilities a collective ​“F,” Canary Media’s Jeff St. John reports.

The ​“Dirty Truth” report examined 75 of the nation’s biggest utilities to see whether they intend to close their coal plants by 2030, whether they plan to build new gas plants, and how much clean energy they expect to build by 2035. In a spot of good news, 65% of utilities have increased their clean-energy deployment plans since 2021. But they’ve slid backward on fossil fuels, increasing their intended gas-plant additions and walking back plans to shut down coal plants.

TOP NEWS IN THE FIGHT AGAINST CLIMATE CHANGE

STATE NEWS

U.S. CLIMATE ALLIANCE TACKLES CLIMATE POLLUTION AND BOOSTS THE ECONOMY: The U.S. Climate Alliance, a coalition of 24 governors supporting climate action, released new data this week showing that collectively, their states have reduced greenhouse gas emissions 24% below 2005 levels while increasing their GDP by 34%. The alliance is also reducing emissions faster than the rest of the U.S. through actions like employing clean energy workers, lowering air pollutants, and planning for disasters.

ALLIANCE TAKE: U.S. Climate Alliance Executive Director Casey Katims said, “While the federal government moves to stop measuring pollution, deny science, and obstruct climate action, the Alliance and its members are relentlessly pressing forward. These new pollution reduction figures show that when we come together, set big goals, and take bold action, we build healthier communities and a stronger economy.”

CAMPAIGN FOR GEORGIA PUBLIC SERVICE COMMISSION HEATS UP: Climate and environment organizers gathered in Atlanta at the “Watts at Stake” event to strategize and mobilize voters ahead of November’s election for two seats on the Georgia Public Service Commission, responsible for regulating utilities. Groups like Georgia Conservation Voters, one of the organizers of the summit, said they are holding both virtual and in-person town halls to educate voters. With energy costs rising across Georgia and around the country, and the Trump administration doing everything it can to ban and undercut clean energy, it’s critical that the PSC has commissioners who will protect Georgians and put their interests above polluters.

STATES TAKE ACTION TO ACCELERATE CLEAN ENERGY BEFORE FEDERAL TAX CREDITS EXPIRE: Governors around the country including Gavin Newsom of California, Kathy Hochul of New York, Jared Polis of Colorado, and Katie Hobbs of Arizona have recently issued orders to focus resources and expedite clean energy projects to take advantage of federal tax credits enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act before they expire, after being slashed by President Trump’s “Big Ugly Bill.” Regulators and utilities in additional states have taken similar actions, such as in Maine, Minnesota, and Oregon. These efforts to increase clean energy development will help meet rising energy demand and save customers money.

ILLINOIS EXPANDS ELECTRIC VEHICLE CHARGING NETWORK: After winning in court to restore funds illegally frozen by the Trump administration, Illinois will dedicate over $18 million towards building 25 new electric vehicle fast charging stations. The stations, which can service more than 150 vehicles at once, will be installed along highway corridors, expanding the state’s electric vehicle infrastructure and network.

130+ JOIN CHISPA NEVADA’S SOL Y SOUL HIKE: This past Sunday, Chispa Nevada united with over 130 community members and partners for Sol y Soul: Black & Brown Unity Hike to celebrate Latino Conservation Week. It was a day of community, connection, and shared commitment to protecting our tierra. View pictures of the event here!

CHISPA ARIZONA RISES WITH THE SUN TO PROTECT IRONWOOD FOREST NATIONAL MONUMENT: On Sunday, Chispa Arizona brought community members together at Ironwood Forest National Monument for a powerful Latino Conservation Week sunrise gathering. Participants grounded themselves on sacred land, heard from Indigenous leaders and local advocates, and lifted up the importance of defending public lands from threats that endanger both culture and ecology. With reflections, postcard writing, and a shared breakfast, the event highlighted a collective message: our public lands are not for sale. View pictures from the event here!

NATIONAL NEWS

CHISPA CELEBRATES 10TH ANNIVERSARY: Chispa, a program of the League of Conservation Voters, celebrated its 10 year anniversary during Latine Heritage Month. To honor a decade of Latine and communities of color advocating for climate justice, Chispa released a new bilingual video highlighting their journey, achievements, and the critical work ahead.

OUR TAKE: Chispa Senior Director Estefany Carrasco-González said, “As our Latine communities face growing threats and attacks, it’s important that we acknowledge our work so far, and our commitment to the future and fight ahead. Our Promotoras and Lideres are family and community members who boldly step up, organize for their neighborhoods, learn how to demand and create change, and become climate champions. We would not exist without them, and we wanted to celebrate their work and tell the world about it.”

ADELITA GRIJALVA WINS ARIZONA SPECIAL ELECTION: Climate champion Adelita Grijalva won the special election for the U.S. House of Representatives in Arizona’s 7th district. Representative-elect Grijalva will be the first Latina to represent Arizona in Congress, and has committed to fighting to protect the environment and democracy.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said, “Adelita Grijalva is a climate champion who will now continue to fight for Arizona communities in Congress! Trump and extreme congressional Republicans are continuing to attack protections for our health and safety and raise costs for families with their latest threats to shut down the government unless critical programs are gutted. We look forward to working with Adelita Grijalva to fight back against these attacks on our environment and democracy, and to protect our public lands, address the climate crisis, and fight for environmental justice and future generations.”

CHISPA AZ TAKE: Chispa Arizona Executive Director Vianey Olivarría said, “We are extremely proud that Arizona is sending its first Latina to Congress! Adelita Grijalva is a climate champion and Earth protector with deep roots in the communities she has been serving for decades. We are excited to see her take that leadership to the national stage and put the interests of her constituents at the forefront. ¡Felicidades!”

LCVAF ENDORSES ROY COOPER FOR SENATE: LCV Action Fund (LCVAF) endorsed Roy Cooper for election to the U.S. Senate representing North Carolina. As governor, Cooper worked to protect North Carolina’s climate and clean energy, and will fight to keep North Carolina safe and healthy as a U.S. Senator.

OUR TAKE: LCV Senior Vice President of Government Affairs Tiernan Sittenfeld said, “North Carolinians know firsthand the devastating impact of extreme weather and pollution on families, and Roy Cooper will fight to protect North Carolinians in the Senate as he did as governor. People across the country are facing rising energy costs and continued threats to our environment and our fundamental rights — it’s more important than ever to have champions like Roy Cooper in the Senate who will help ensure we all can have a more healthy and just future.”

NCLCV TAKE: North Carolina LCV Executive Director Carrie Clark said, “As we approach the anniversary of Hurricane Helene, we appreciate Roy Cooper’s strong leadership during and after that devastating disaster. We need someone in Washington who understands the increasing threat extreme weather poses to lives and livelihoods across our state. At the same time, he led the creation of North Carolina’s thriving clean energy economy and made us the top state in the country in rural clean energy jobs. These are just a few of the many reasons Roy Cooper is the leader North Carolina needs in the U.S. Senate.”

CLIMATE AND DEMOCRACY ATTACKS FROM THE TRUMP ADMINISTRATION AND CONGRESS

REPUBLICANS PUSH COUNTRY CLOSER TO SHUTDOWN: As the government funding deadline looms, Trump and Republicans in Congress have refused to negotiate on a budget bill and continue to threaten a government shutdown. LCV joined environmental groups including Climate Action Campaign, Climate Power, Earthjustice Action, Evergreen Action, Friends of the Earth Action, NRDC Action Fund, and Sierra Club to urge Republicans to take action and pass a bipartisan funding bill that will lower costs and protect our environment.

OUR TAKE: LCV and environmental groups said, “President Trump and Congressional Republicans have spent this year raising costs for working families, from energy to groceries to health care, while rolling back programs that help families deal with those costs. Now, Donald Trump and Russell Vought clearly want to shut down the government and continue illegally gutting essential services that make people’s lives more affordable. Given the fact that the administration and Republicans in Congress are already ignoring the funding levels set by law that protect clean air and water, and a healthy climate, it is plainly false to call the GOP’s continuing resolution ‘clean.’ Without real commitments, a deal isn’t worth the paper it’s written on.

“Republicans who voted to raise energy and health costs in the Republican Rate Hike have a choice to make: they can start to side with their constituents desperate for relief and come to the negotiating table to pass full-year bipartisan funding bills that help lower costs and protect our environment, as the Senate has shown is clearly possible, or they can continue to cower to Trump and shut down the government.”

TRUMP DOJ SUES SIX STATES TO OBTAIN SENSITIVE DATA FROM VOTER ROLLS: The Department of Justice has filed lawsuits demanding that California, New York, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Minnesota, and New Hampshire share unredacted voter rolls, which include sensitive data like drivers license numbers and the last four digits of Social Security numbers. It is highly unusual to release voter rolls without redacting this information. Last week, similar lawsuits were filed in Maine and Oregon as well.

CVPA TAKE: Conservation Voters of Pennsylvania Executive Director Molly Parzen said, “This lawsuit from the Trump Administration is just the latest blatant attempt to intimidate voters and undermine our elections. The voter rolls requested contain sensitive, personal information for Pennsylvania voters, and handing that information over to the Trump Administration does nothing to make our elections more safe or secure.

“The Trump Administration has repeatedly tried to sow doubt and create fear around our elections. This lawsuit takes their political game a step further – breaching the trust of all Pennsylvanians and putting our privacy at risk.

“The first step in protecting our environment is protecting our democracy and ensuring all Pennsylvanians can participate in free, fair, and secure elections. Lawsuits like this undermine our core systems of democracy and represent a blatant abuse of power for political gain.

“We look forward to supporting Pennsylvania leaders as they fight this overreach and work to protect our rights and freedoms.”

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Geothermal energy generally involves drilling holes deep into the Earth's crust, pumping water into the holes, and allowing the Earth's natural heat to boil the water.
Besides being clean, geothermal energy is renewable, and it can significantly lower energy bills.
Enerdrape's geothermal panels work a little differently from the average geothermal energy project: there's no drilling involved.
Enerdrape is looking to expand its reach into things like installing panels in underground tunnels for large-scale energy generation.","A Swiss startup will soon be bringing its innovative geothermal panel technology to the United States for the first time.

According to Think Geoenergy, Enerdrape will be installing the panels in downtown Chicago's Millennium Parking Garages, which contain over 9,000 parking spaces. The panels harness the Earth's natural geothermal energy and use it to heat and cool buildings.

Geothermal energy generally involves drilling holes deep into the Earth's crust, pumping water into the holes, and allowing the Earth's natural heat to boil the water. That water is pumped up to the surface where the steam spins a turbine and generates energy. The water is then pumped back below the surface to start the process again.

It's a clean form of energy that doesn't create the same planet-overheating pollution as oil, gas, and coal. Besides being clean, geothermal energy is renewable, and it can significantly lower energy bills.

Enerdrape's geothermal panels work a little differently from the average geothermal energy project: there's no drilling involved.

It's a closed-loop system where piping within the panels contains heat transfer fluid that the Earth's warmer underground temperature heats up. That absorbed heat is then transferred to a heat pump that's used to heat or cool a building. It's then sent back to the panels to get heated again.

Geothermal panels like the ones that will be installed in Chicago are already being used in parking garages in France and Switzerland. According to Enerdrape, the company has installed 864 panels so far. They produce 275 megawatt hours of electricity a year and prevent 46 tons of carbon pollution from entering our atmosphere every year.

Besides Chicago, the company is also looking into projects in New York. They mainly involve hotels, housing complexes, and residences.

""At this stage, everything is preliminary, but the situation is promising,"" said Enerdrape co-founder and CTO Alessandro Rotta.

Claim: At the UN, President Donald Trump declared that renewable energy sources such as wind and solar “don’t work,” are “too expensive,” and represent a “joke.” He argued that clean energy harms the economy, drives higher energy costs, and cannot sustain infrastructure.

The Fact: Independent analysis contradicts Trump’s claims. In 2024, 80% of global electricity generation growth came from renewables and nuclear, with renewables cheaper than fossil fuels. Solar and wind surpassed coal in the US, providing 16% of power and driving millions of jobs.

President Donald Trump used his September 23 speech at the United Nations General Assembly to launch a sweeping attack on renewable energy, dismissing solar and wind as ineffective, expensive, and incapable of powering modern economies. His remarks directly challenged the overwhelming scientific consensus on climate change and came at a time when clean energy is rapidly transforming both the global energy mix and the US job market.

Trump claimed that renewable technologies “don’t work” and are “a joke,” warning they drive up consumer costs and undermine economic stability. He argued that fossil fuels remain the backbone of reliable power generation. But his assertions were quickly contradicted by independent data and fact-checks.

According to the International Energy Agency and ABC News, renewable and nuclear power supplied 40 percent of the world’s electricity in 2024, with renewables alone responsible for 80 percent of global generation growth. In the US, solar and wind now provide 16 percent of electricity, surpassing coal. Projections show renewable energy will meet 95 percent of global demand growth through 2027, highlighting its growing dominance in power markets. Cost competitiveness has also flipped against Trump’s claims. The International Renewable Energy Agency reported last year that more than 90 percent of new renewable projects were cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. Solar photovoltaic systems averaged 41 percent lower in cost than the cheapest fossil option, while onshore wind was 53 percent cheaper. These figures show that clean energy is not only viable but increasingly the more economical choice.

The workforce story is equally striking. Clean energy has become one of America’s fastest-growing employment sectors, with more than 3.5 million people employed—more than nursing, cashiering, food service, or elementary school teaching. Jobs range from wind turbine technicians to solar installers, both among the fastest-growing occupations nationwide. In 2024 alone, nearly 100,000 jobs were added in solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, and electric vehicles.

Still, growth is slowing. The US added 50,000 fewer clean energy jobs compared with 2023. Analysts point to economic headwinds and policy uncertainty. Critics argue that Trump’s administration has fuelled this uncertainty by cancelling projects, reducing tax credits, and imposing new regulatory hurdles. In the first half of 2025, E2 reported that businesses cancelled $22 billion worth of projects that would have created more than 16,500 jobs—many in Republican-leaning states.

Trump’s UN remarks underscore a widening gap between political rhetoric and energy realities. While he portrays renewables as costly and ineffective, evidence shows they are cheaper, cleaner, and central to future economic growth.","https://static.toiimg.com/photo/imgsize-38996,msid-124166483/124166483.jpg",N,,2025-09-27 12:02:50.774369

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration’s emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration’s focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump’s transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it’s practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms. However, the latest recalled projects didn’t have fully funded grant agreements in place, which would have made reversing them far trickier.

The transportation department’s press office didn’t respond to emails requesting comment.

Prioritizing Roads, Not Trails

Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.

Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant’s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn’t move forward. The agency wants “multimodal grant programs” to focus on “projects that promote vehicular travel,” the letter explained.

“They’re defining quality of life for Americans as enhancing automobile operations,” Dunne said.

The same reason was given in a letter sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pulling $11.5 million in funding for a leg of a rail trail cutting through the city’s core. It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.

“We are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. “We will see you in court.”

Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts “an affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans’ demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.”

DOT also withdrew a $20 million grant awarded in 2022 to transform three streetscapes in Boston. The reversal was based in part on the project’s electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting “traditional forms of energy and natural resources,” the Boston Globe reported.

No Project Too Small to Cut

Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department’s changing priorities.

One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ “creative roadway features” such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county’s Land Use and Environment Group.

But Trump’s transportation officials flagged it as “hostile to motor vehicles” in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn’t affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.

“We’re kind of at a standstill now until new funding sources become available,” he said.",https://news.wttw.com/themes/wttwnews_b5/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-27 05:58:25.617941

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

""We believe in the long-term … that nuclear power wins,"" said Wilkes.","While Alberta may be best known for its oil and gas industry, a conference in downtown Edmonton this week is hyping another form of energy: Nuclear.

""The potential is tremendous here,"" said May Wong, a senior vice-president with power generator Capital Power, which is exploring the possibility of building small modular reactors (SMRs) in Alberta.

""We have a moment in time where we can transform our industry and create a new industry.""

Smaller in scale and output than a traditional nuclear reactor, SMRs are built in a factory; in theory, they are cheaper, safer and quicker to construct, and can be used in less-populated regions.

Nuclear power already exists in New Brunswick and Ontario, with Ontario relying on nuclear for more than half of its electricity. The province also has plans to ramp up its nuclear capacity through the use of SMRs — an initiative that made Ottawa's recent list of fast-tracked ""nation-building projects.""

Now the buzz has made its way to Alberta; the province recently set up an expert panel to explore the possibility of building reactors, and Premier Danielle Smith, who has expressed reservations about renewables such as wind and solar, has said ""there's a lot to like about nuclear.""

Alberta has been here before. In 2008, it also set up a panel to explore the potential of nuclear power, but a decade and a half later, there are no nuclear reactors to be seen.

So what's changed this time around?

'Ideal' timing

The appeal of nuclear power is that it can provide a lot of reliable electricity on a long-term basis without much in the way of emissions, said Nathan Neudorf, Alberta's minister of affordability and utilities, in an interview on the sidelines of the SMR Forum in Edmonton.

Part of the appeal is that Alberta isn't going it alone, he said. Instead, the province would be jumping on a global bandwagon.

Countries around the world are scrambling to ramp up their nuclear capacity as a way of securing a stable, low-carbon source of electricity. And big-name tech companies, such as Microsoft, Google and Amazon, are signing large procurement contracts to secure a steady supply of nuclear power for their growing AI and cloud services.

""All of those things work together to create this timing … making it ideal,"" said Neudorf.

The renewed urgency around nuclear power is driven in part by expectations that demand for electricity will skyrocket globally in the decades ahead due to growing demand for everything from air conditioning to electric cars to AI data centres.

Alberta, in particular, is also contending with demand driven by a steep increase in population and the province's plan to become a hub for AI data centres.

Scott Henuset, the CEO of Energy Alberta, made a similar point. His company plans to build a nuclear power station in Northern Alberta, though with a more traditional CANDU-style reactor rather than with SMRs.

""We feel that it does have a place in all of Western Canada, securing the power [supply] and increasing grid stability,"" Henuset said in a Zoom interview this week.

But the economics of nuclear power in Alberta could pose a challenge; the upfront capital costs are high, which could make it a tougher sell in a province where natural gas is abundant and already provides the bulk of electricity.

The projected cost to develop four SMRs at Ontario's Darlington power plant is about $21 billion, while a large-scale nuclear facility in Georgia cost $35 billion US for two built-from-scratch reactors.

""Right now, natural gas use is obviously more cheap,"" said Dustin Wilkes, president and CEO of Calgary-based Nucleon, an SMR project developer. ""Short term, it's very difficult.""

Competition from natural gas

History has shown that to be the case.

In the early 2000s, Energy Alberta — then led by Scott Henuset's father, Wayne — was exploring the possibility of building reactors near Peace River. The company was later bought by Ontario-based Bruce Power, but when the price of natural gas plummeted a few years later, the project was scrapped, Henuset said.

While the price of natural gas remains low today, the global appetite for nuclear power has created a much different investment climate, Henuset said. Upfront costs may be high, he said, but the long-term payoff will be worthwhile given how long nuclear plants can run and how much demand for electricity is expected in the decades ahead.

""There is economic viability for nuclear power; we wouldn't be looking at it if it wasn't there,"" said Henuset.

When it comes to SMRs, in particular, Wong, with Capital Power, says the costs of the small, prefabricated reactors will likely go down significantly over time — a prediction echoed by industry observers and researchers.

Wilkes said that while nuclear power is new to Alberta, the province's advantage is its deregulated electricity system, which allows private operators to build and compete to sell power into the market.

Still, there are plenty of details that need to be ironed out before anyone starts splitting atoms.

Wong said while the appeal of nuclear is that a power plant can run for a long time — once built, the equipment is relatively easy to maintain or upgrade — it also means the costs of operating it and the necessary safety protocols must too be factored in over many decades.

And the nuclear waste produced by the power plants must be considered; there has been heated debate in Ontario when possible sites are chosen to store the material.

""Because it's very long duration, from a development perspective, as well as an [operational perspective], that uncertainty increases much more than traditional technology,"" said Wong.

Utilities Minister Neudorf said the province must first hear from Albertans whether they want nuclear power in the first place. An online survey seeking public input and information from industry and local governments is open until Oct. 25.

Public opinion and social acceptance could be a sticking point, considering concerns around the safe storing of nuclear waste and some high-profile problems with nuclear power plants in the past.

A 2009 report commissioned by the Alberta government made no recommendations about whether the province should proceed with developing a nuclear power plant industry, while detailing how every form of electricity production has its trade-offs, such as emissions, water use and overall expense.

At the COP28 UN climate conference in 2023, Canada and several other countries made a pledge to triple the amount of nuclear electricity around the globe by 2030.

As for Henuset and Wilkes, the two CEOs expect it will take somewhere around a decade for their respective projects to get up and running.

By that point, they say, the demand for electricity will be even greater — and the case for nuclear will be more compelling.

First, we had a tremendous victory at the LA Convention Center last week on the most recent stop-and-start Convention Center expansion project that has been ongoing for the past decade. If you count all the other efforts over the years to modernize and expand the LA facility, it goes back even longer. But now, through hard work, perseverance and grit, we’ve finally done it. The powerful labor and business coalition we helped organize finally got this project over the finish line.

There’s no doubt LA has lost many conventions over the past decade to other large cities because our Center wasn’t large enough, had enough contiguous space, or modern enough to get the attention of the large conventions our downtown needs to help revitalize. The timing was never right, Council members always said. And now, because of our hard work and dedication, we got the job done. This is the power of coalition.

Kudos to our Political Director Antonio Sanchez and his team for their instrumental help in pushing this through. Who will benefit? First, our members. The project will result in dozens and dozens of job calls starting in the next few weeks. That will ramp up to several hundred jobs over the next few months. But the other huge beneficiaries of the project will be the residents and businesses in the LA region. We can expect more tourism, more events, better city services and more money flowing through our economy as a result of our city becoming a first-class convention destination, starting with the 2028 Olympics.

Make no mistake, it will be an aggressive timetable to get the ambitious job done in time for the Olympics. (See our story on page 1 for more of the details about the job.) But I am confident our skilled, trained and experienced members are up to the task.

I wanted to flag another good jobs victory for our members in the Antelope Valley. We, along with our brothers and sisters in the LA/OC Building Trades Council, recently signed a Community Workforce Agreement (CWA) in Palmdale, which will begin creating more good IBEW 11 jobs in the near future. We will be writing about it in the next edition of News@11.

Tradeswomen Conference

A delegation of 26 of our members has just returned from the 2025 Tradeswomen Build Nations Conference put on by the North American Building Trades Union. Thousands of tradeswomen from around the country gathered in Chicago for two days to network, share stories, learn new skills, discover resources and get support to thrive in their careers in the trades.

The conference featured government, industry, and labor leaders, apprenticeship and training coordinators, and tradeswomen from across the country who attended and facilitated workshops, panels, and plenary sessions. The goal was to uplift tradeswomen in unions, promote recruitment and retention, strengthen leadership skills and union identity, and foster mentoring and support networks.

Diana Limon, our Director of Recruitment and Support, and I were on two panels at the conference, reaching out to attendees to promote the IBEW as a good career choice for women.

In the near future, we will be creating an all-women VEEP class for our women veterans. Look for more information on that coming soon.

Prop 50 Must Pass

In our industry, politics matters. As many of you know, Texas has redistricted the state to add five more Republican elected officials in a scheme to rig the 2026 mid-term elections. In response, Gov. Newsom has called for a Special Election on Nov. 4 where voters will decide on a Constitutional amendment to temporarily redistrict California’s maps to add five Democrats.

This is a very important election for our members, and we are urging you to vote YES on Prop. 50. By voting YES, you will be protecting jobs and infrastructure projects that the current Administration in Washington, DC has delayed or canceled. You will be voting for fair representation for all working families. And you will be securing your future by advancing clean energy and grid modernization projects that create thousands of jobs for our members.

Open access and wholesale electricity markets under FERC’s jurisdiction are under pressure as this rapid load growth compounds pre-existing stressors.","Judy W. Chang is a commissioner of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Steven Wellner and Kathleen Ratcliff serve as her advisors. The views expressed in this article are those of the authors and do not reflect the views of other FERC commissioners or any stance of the agency.

Generational change is occurring in the nation’s energy sector. While FERC is considering urgent short-term fixes, it also must evaluate longer-term solutions that shape the sector. One solution that meets this era of change is the integration of transmission planning and interconnection processes.

The current challenges facing the electric industry are multifaceted, with compounding effects. Rapid and accelerating load growth, backlogged interconnection queues, limited regional/interregional transmission buildout, ongoing supply chain issues and increasingly frequent extreme weather events are exacerbating reliability concerns and raising electricity bills for consumers.

States, utilities, grid operators, customers, and market participants grappling with these challenges are exploring short-term fixes, some of which call into question the open-access principles and market constructs this country has used to plan and build the grid’s infrastructure to date.

Open access and competitive wholesale electricity markets have been our bedrock principles because they have delivered real value to customers: They have kept energy costs affordable, met customers’ needs efficiently and ensured those who create the need for new infrastructure bear their fair share of the associated costs.

The question, then, is what reforms can meet our current demands while preserving the benefits of open access and competition? The answer is clear: Modernizing, harmonizing, and integrating our transmission planning and interconnection processes can meet those challenges.

Dramatic load growth is on the horizon

The biggest issue facing the industry is the expectation of rapid, dramatic load growth in the near term.

While previous circumstances that have driven load growth were largely distributed throughout the country, new load growth represented by data center additions is likely to be concentrated in certain geographic areas. This type of load growth could induce significant local system impacts, but the pace of growth, and where that growth will occur, are difficult to accurately project in system-wide plans.

Open access and wholesale electricity markets under FERC’s jurisdiction are under pressure as this rapid load growth compounds pre-existing stressors.

Keep up with the story. Subscribe to the Utility Dive free daily newsletter

Meeting the expected load growth will require the interconnection of a substantial amount of new generation alongside major transmission infrastructure buildout. FERC, states, and industry participants face foundational questions about how to meet this moment: How do system planners analyze new load additions, how do they prioritize project development and construction and how are costs allocated among parties that benefit from new generation and transmission?

These are hard questions playing out at the retail and wholesale level throughout the country.

The stakes are high because failure to responsibly, reliably, and cost-effectively meet new demand potentially impacts all customers. Retail customers could face higher prices, including from potential stranded investments; uncoordinated connection of new loads could exacerbate reliability risks; the grid’s inability to accommodate necessary data center growth could prevent us from realizing artificial intelligence’s potential benefits; or data centers could abandon grid interconnection and take needed generation off systems that rely on it.

Interconnection bottlenecks are hindering market response

Nearly 30 years ago, FERC issued Order No. 888, which established a building block of the modern electric grid: open, nondiscriminatory access to the transmission system. In Order No. 2003, the Commission extended that principle to the generator interconnection process. Open access has supported the expansion of wholesale market competition, increasingly through organized regional markets, on which a sizable majority of the American people rely to deliver reliable and affordable power.

At the core, well-functioning wholesale markets depend on the collective ability of investors to bring new, economic resources onto the system, both to replace retiring resources and to meet new demand. Interconnection queues are the single biggest bottleneck for getting new generation online, however. The median time for an interconnection request to move through the queue has jumped from less than two years during the early 2000s to around five years today. Markets are strongly signaling that new generation is needed, but because of these delays, a supply resource investor would have had to join the queue years ago to be able to respond.

While FERC has reformed the interconnection processes through Order Nos. 2023 and 845, the length of the rulemaking and compliance process has rendered those actions useful and necessary, but no longer innovative. RTOs have submitted – and the Commission has approved – proposals that accelerate certain generation projects through the interconnection process. These proposals are in tension with the Commission’s historic open access policies, however, and they raise the question of how FERC can uphold those policies and support well-functioning competitive markets while meeting the load growth challenge. The answer to preserving these foundational principals is better system planning.

Short-term needs are overtaking long-term planning

We know that when transmission system planners have the necessary data and resources to conduct long-term planning, it yields substantial benefits for customers. That principle is at the core of the Commission’s regional transmission planning reforms, including Order No. 1920. However, many stakeholders rightfully continue to emphasize that long-term planning is not a replacement for near-term planning, which must address facility replacements, reliability-related upgrades and upgrades constructed to interconnect new generation.

Read More in Transmission & Distribution

Because the near-term need is so great, system planners are understandably devoting as many resources as they can to meeting it, which may be to the detriment of the system’s long-term planning needs.

We cannot stay in crisis mode forever. Planning for the longer term, while also accounting for near-term drivers, is key to maximizing benefits to ratepayers.

Insufficient long-term planning for transmission system buildout is having an immediate impact on interconnection costs now, when the country desperately needs new, cost-effective generation. Interconnection customers with real proposed generators may experience unpredictable and significant cost increases – sometimes as much as hundreds of millions of dollars – halfway through the interconnection process. Those costs can lead to generation project withdrawals, cascading restudies, and further exacerbation of delays. Even the fastest interconnection study processes cannot solve this recurring and inefficient approach to connecting new resources to the grid.

Integrate transmission planning and interconnection processes

The grid is a single machine; it should not be planned and constructed in a piecemeal fashion by reacting to interconnection customers. Planning and constructing the system with an eye to both replacing aging infrastructure and meeting the needs of new generation will provide substantial efficiencies and cost savings for consumers.

With an integrated process, interconnecting resources would have more cost certainty, which should facilitate better decisions about proceeding with planned projects, both reducing queue volume and project churn. Such a process will, in turn, reduce interconnection queue timelines, allowing new resources to more quickly respond to demand growth and related price signals from markets.

While the Commission took limited steps to harmonize the two in Order No. 1920, entities in the electric sector — both public and private — can and should do more.

For instance, our grid planners, particularly the RTOs/ISOs that serve more than two thirds of the country, must truly optimize the grid that we have today, such as by using cutting-edge technologies when building out the network. Order Nos. 2023, 1920 and 881 moved the ball forward in this respect by requiring transmission developers to consider the use of advanced technologies and requiring changes to make better use of the existing grid. Utilities need not wait until full implementation of those orders to integrate these types of technologies into their planning practices.

Improving the integration of transmission planning and interconnection processes can be a substantial undertaking, particularly given the competing demands on system planners’ time, such as looming compliance obligations for Order No. 1920. Ideally, this integration would happen at the regional and interregional levels, rather than locally. Given the wide-ranging benefits of an integrated approach, RTOs/ISOs are best equipped to lead on designing and implementing coordinated and consolidated processes. Ultimately, the details matter greatly; any integration of the transmission planning and generation interconnection processes must continue to satisfy open access standards, and any reforms and advancements should provide substantial benefits to customers.

The core responsibility of electricity grid regulators, planners, and operators is to ensure that the lights stay on at a price customers can afford. Maintaining disparate planning processes for the wires needed to deliver power increases costs and delays of building new resources when we cannot afford them.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/HoL9Rm_Ms9HVL9r6039f5X04mVUH1yQicl8-5LnSaK4/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9KdWR5Q2hhbmcucG5n.webp,N,,2025-09-27 12:03:01.170216

If you are intent on getting the full $7,500 tax credit, you'd better act fast.","If you have been thinking about purchasing an electric vehicle, you should act fast! This is the last chance to cash in on federal tax credits before they expire.

Buyers across the country have been flocking to dealerships ahead of the deadline.

People have had a lot of reasons to make the switch over the years -- like embracing new technology, not buying or burning gasoline, and the speed and quietness of EVs.

For many, a $7,500 tax credit has been a strong incentive, too, especially when it came to leasing a new electric car at a low monthly payment.

""The EV tax credit that we're looking at that's going to expire has been heavily utilized. If you look at it from an adoption point of view, utilizing leasing and using that workaround is key,"" said Ivan Drury, the Director of Insights at Edmunds.com.

That incentive goes away at the end of the month, so this summer has seen a surge in EV registrations compared to last year. Some of it comes down to more model choices, but July's sales were up sharply after Congress passed the ""One Big Beautiful Bill,"" which eliminated the tax credit.

Chevrolet's EVs jumped 100%, Volkswagen saw gains of 127%, sales of Porsche's fully-electric models shot up 174%, and Audi had a staggering increase in EV sales, up 252%.

August EV sales were also up overall, and September may end up being a very good month for electric cars, too.

Right now, the Orange County Auto Show is underway, and organizers expect EVs to be getting lots of looks.

""The auto show's a perfect place to come and see a bunch of the EVs, and then get out to the dealership and close that deal before the 30th,"" said John Sackrison, who runs the auto show.

It’s not yet clear where in Kansas TerraPower would want to build a nuclear reactor.
Advanced nuclear reactors and TerraPower For decades, logistics and expenses have held nuclear energy back.
The Trump administration has thrown its weight behind advanced nuclear power, drawing a mix of praise and criticism.
“ At what point is it just too expensive for us to just keep having Evergy build and build?” Barnett said.","One of the companies leading the charge to deploy safer, smaller, faster-to-build nuclear reactors is hoping to find a site for one in Kansas.

TerraPower, cofounded by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, began construction last month on its first power plant of this kind in southwest Wyoming as a $4 billion demonstration project cofunded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Now it is interested in building one in Kansas to generate power in utility company Evergy’s service area.

TerraPower, Evergy and state officials announced this week that they have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the prospects. They issued a news release featuring enthusiastic quotes from Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and both of the state’s Republican U.S. senators.

“We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state,” Kelly said.

“Nuclear energy is the way of the future,” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall said.

But the reaction from clean energy advocates in Kansas is mixed. The news sparked some interest in emissions-free power generation, but also concern about the price tag and whether the project would attract more data centers to the region with significant needs for electricity and water. Kansas faces water sustainability challenges.

“ We want to make sure that the plans we’re making for the clean energy future are affordable,” said Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project. “ I am increasingly concerned for our friends and neighbors who are struggling to pay their utility bills.”

Kansas regulators signed off on $128 million in rate hikes for Evergy this week.

The Sierra Club said Kansas has financially smarter options for powering its economy.

“We’ve got plenty of roofs here in Kansas,” said Zack Pistora, state director for the Sierra Club in Kansas. “Or backyards that could say, ‘Hey, we’ll be glad to lease our roof or our land for solar, Evergy. You can pay us instead of paying this out-of-state company.’”

Looking for potential sites in Kansas

An official with the Kansas Department of Commerce said regional power demand is projected to more than double over the next decade. That’s according to the regional grid operator, the Southwest Power Pool.

“We need to be ready for this,” said Paul Hughes, the department’s lead on matters involving megaprojects. “And I’m not saying it has to be this (nuclear) project, but we do need to act in ensuring that Kansas isn’t effectively blocked out of future opportunities because of the availability or unavailability of power in the state.”

Asked why TerraPower is specifically considering Kansas, Hughes noted that Evergy already has experience with nuclear energy. It owns Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station 60 miles south of Topeka, the state’s only nuclear plant. By contrast, some states don’t have nuclear power and some have restrictions or outright bans.

This fall Kansas State University launched a nuclear engineering program.

It’s not yet clear where in Kansas TerraPower would want to build a nuclear reactor. The company will need to consider proximity to transmission lines and to a workforce. It will also need to find communities interested in the project, and will need to ensure that any potential sites have stable underground geology.

Hughes said the state commerce department will help facilitate the discussions.

“We can help communities articulate their interest in the project or disinterest in the project,” he said.

Communities that aren’t interested will be passed over for consideration, he said.

“These (projects) just don’t go well when you try to force feed them into a community — and all parties to this agreement understand that,” Hughes said.

Advanced nuclear reactors and TerraPower

For decades, logistics and expenses have held nuclear energy back. Conventional nuclear plants not only have high price tags but also a propensity to greatly exceed their budgets and to take longer than expected to build.

Modular advanced nuclear designs are smaller than conventional plants and represent a potential industry turning point that is decades in the making. The companies developing them say they will be safer and faster to build.

However, none of the designs like TerraPower's are yet in commercial operation in the U.S.

The Trump administration has thrown its weight behind advanced nuclear power, drawing a mix of praise and criticism. This spring it unveiled executive orders and plans to reconsider some regulations, press for approval of projects, and use the controversial Department of Government Efficiency to overhaul the nation’s independent regulator of nuclear energy.

Kansas officials said they’re aware of the development.

“ It is on our radar,” Hughes said. “We want to make sure that (Kansas is) doing this safely and that’s what we’ll do.”

TerraPower expects its Wyoming project to come online this decade. The company says that the project will create 1,600 jobs during peak construction, after which about 250 jobs will remain at the site for day-to-day operations.

The company’s design, the Natrium reactor, uses liquid sodium rather than water to envelop uranium fuel. This liquid has a far higher boiling point – 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit – which the company says adds to the reactor’s safety.

The reactor heats the liquid sodium, which in turn heats pipes full of molten salt. The pipes carry the molten salt to a storage tank that serves as a power battery. The salt heats tubes of water, creating pressurized steam. The steam turns a turbine to generate electricity. The salt then cycles back to the reactor area to be heated up again.

The battery represents a key departure from a conventional plant such as Evergy’s Wolf Creek. The facility would store the heated molten salt in a tank and draw upon it as needed to meet demand.

Wolf Creek can’t adjust its output to the ebb and flow of electricity demand or to account for sunny and windy weather generating more from solar and wind farms.

What do clean energy advocates think?

Barnett, from the Climate + Energy Project, wants to hear more details.

Generating electricity without pumping out greenhouse gases is “one of the most important things as we think about our climate future,” she said.

Additionally, her organization wants power plants to pair well with renewable energy and is interested in the efforts of advanced nuclear designs to do that.

But she’s skeptical because many people already struggle to pay their utility bills and Evergy not only got the greenlight this week from Kansas regulators for $128 million in rate hikes, it also got permission this summer to build and co-own two new natural gas-burning power plants.

“ At what point is it just too expensive for us to just keep having Evergy build and build?” Barnett said.

The Wyoming project suggests that an advanced nuclear facility would cost billions.

Also, she has questions about potential indirect effects. For example, even if the reactor doesn’t require much water because it uses liquid sodium as a coolant, data centers do. This means the reactor’s impact on water use in Kansas could depend on how the power gets used.

Pistora, with the Sierra Club in Kansas, said Evergy and TerraPower will need to answer a slew of pressing questions.

“Does this make economic sense from a cost and benefit standpoint?” he asked. “What about the water use? What about the (nuclear) waste disposal? … Where are we going to get this nuclear material and where’s it going to be mined?”

A few utility-scale battery projects have been proposed in Kansas, Pistora said, which could help store energy from renewable sources or existing fossil fuel plants for when the power is needed.

Like Barnett, he pointed to the recent approval of Evergy’s requests to hike its rates and to build new natural gas power plants.

“ Now we’re hearing about nuclear, which is the most expensive power out there,” he said. “Why are we going for these big-ticket, capital-intensive, expensive energy projects?”

Now the company has launched the Pando Smart Outlet Gen2, an EV charging platform engineered specifically for multifamily housing.

The new charger is designed to eliminate what Pando calls the three biggest barriers to EV charging adoption: power constraints, connectivity issues and maintenance failures.

Pando Gen2 does not require costly panel upgrades, dedicated WiFi/cellular networks, or ongoing servicing. “Each outlet intelligently manages building power loads, operates offline when needed, and features a modular design that eliminates maintenance,” says Pando.

Pando Gen2 can operate even in buildings without WiFi or cellular coverage—residents activate charging with a phone, watch, or fob. The device’s load management system dynamically reroutes unused building power to EV charging. Its modular design means that damaged cables can be quickly replaced, with no need for an electrician.

“Multifamily buildings have been stuck with EV solutions designed for shopping malls and restaurants,” said Aaron Li, CEO of Pando Electric. “Gen2 changes that. No WiFi. No upgrades. No maintenance.

Electricity generation and prices were up this summer, fueling parallel narratives about surging demand growth and increasing concerns over affordability.

Here’s a look at those numbers and others shaping decisions in the electric utility industry.

By the numbers

3.8%

Increase in total net electricity generation this July compared with the same month last year, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The EIA attributed the increase to hot weather, but analysts told Utility Dive this could be the beginning of an anticipated surge in demand from data centers and electrification.

$29 billion

What U.S. utilities requested in rate increases in the first half of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for pro-consumer regulatory reform.

12 years

How long the SOO Green transmission project has been under development. The 2.1-GW project would link the PJM Interconnection and the Midcontinent Independent System Operator. David Pacyna, SOO Green HVDC Link CEO, said in an interview that the project could start operating in late 2031 to mid-2032.

2.1 GW

New generation that has been added in the PJM Interconnection footprint this year. Concerns that capacity is not growing fast enough to meet anticipated demand is driving a rebellion by governors in the PJM footprint who say they will pull their states out of the organization unless given more influence in the grid operator.

AI is eating the world—and the machines behind it are ravenous.

Each ChatGPT query, each model update, each robotic breakthrough consumes massive amounts of energy. In fact, AI is already pushing global power grids to the brink.

Wall Street is pouring hundreds of billions into artificial intelligence—training smarter chatbots, automating industries, and building the digital future. But there’s one urgent question few are asking:

Where will all of that energy come from?

AI is the most electricity-hungry technology ever invented. Each data center powering large language models like ChatGPT consumes as much energy as a small city. And it’s about to get worse.

Even Sam Altman, the founder of OpenAI, issued a stark warning:

“The future of AI depends on an energy breakthrough.”

Elon Musk was even more blunt:

“AI will run out of electricity by next year.”

As the world chases faster, smarter machines, a hidden crisis is emerging behind the scenes. Power grids are strained. Electricity prices are rising. Utilities are scrambling to expand capacity.

And that’s where the real opportunity lies…

One little-known company—almost entirely overlooked by most AI investors—could be the ultimate backdoor play. It’s not a chipmaker. It’s not a cloud platform. But it might be the most important AI stock in the US owns critical energy infrastructure assets positioned to feed the coming AI energy spike.

As demand from AI data centers explodes, this company is gearing up to profit from the most valuable commodity in the digital age: electricity.

The “Toll Booth” Operator of the AI Energy Boom

It owns critical nuclear energy infrastructure assets, positioning it at the heart of America’s next-generation power strategy.

It’s one of the only global companies capable of executing large-scale, complex EPC (engineering, procurement, and construction) projects across oil, gas, renewable fuels, and industrial infrastructure.

It plays a pivotal role in U.S. LNG exportation—a sector about to explode under President Trump’s renewed “America First” energy doctrine.

Trump has made it clear: Europe and U.S. allies must buy American LNG.

And our company sits in the toll booth—collecting fees on every drop exported.

But that’s not all…

As Trump’s proposed tariffs push American manufacturers to bring their operations back home, this company will be first in line to rebuild, retrofit, and reengineer those facilities.

AI. Energy. Tariffs. Onshoring. This One Company Ties It All Together.

While the world is distracted by flashy AI tickers, a few smart investors are quietly scooping up shares of the one company powering it all from behind the scenes.

AI needs energy. Energy needs infrastructure.

And infrastructure needs a builder with experience, scale, and execution.

This company has its finger in every pie—and Wall Street is just starting to notice.

Wall Street is noticing this company also because it is quietly riding all of these tailwinds—without the sky-high valuation.

While most energy and utility firms are buried under mountains of debt and coughing up hefty interest payments just to appease bondholders…

This company is completely debt-free.

In fact, it’s sitting on a war chest of cash—equal to nearly one-third of its entire market cap.

It also owns a huge equity stake in another red-hot AI play, giving investors indirect exposure to multiple AI growth engines without paying a premium.

And here’s what the smart money has started whispering…

The Hedge Fund Secret That’s Starting to Leak Out

This stock is so off-the-radar, so absurdly undervalued, that some of the most secretive hedge fund managers in the world have begun pitching it at closed-door investment summits.

They’re sharing it quietly, away from the cameras, to rooms full of ultra-wealthy clients.

Why? Because excluding cash and investments, this company is trading at less than 7 times earnings.

And that’s for a business tied to:

The AI infrastructure supercycle

The onshoring boom driven by Trump-era tariffs

A surge in U.S. LNG exports

And a unique footprint in nuclear energy—the future of clean, reliable power

You simply won’t find another AI and energy stock this cheap… with this much upside.

This isn’t a hype stock. It’s not riding on hope.

It’s delivering real cash flows, owns critical infrastructure, and holds stakes in other major growth stories.

This is your chance to get in before the rockets take off!

Disruption is the New Name of the Game: Let’s face it, complacency breeds stagnation.

AI is the ultimate disruptor, and it’s shaking the foundations of traditional industries.

Despite having an overwhelming financial advantage, the campaign supporting Proposition 50 has tried to portray itself as the underdog in a fight to raise money against opposition campaigns with ties to President Trump and his supporters.
California’s congressional districts are drawn once every decade after the U.S. Census by a voter-approved independent redistricting commission.
And relatively few Californians pay attention to redistricting, the esoteric process of redrawing congressional districts.
There are more than 30 campaign committees associated with Proposition 50 registered with the secretary of state’s office, but only three have raised large amounts of money.","Supporters of the November ballot measure to reconfigure California’s congressional districts — an effort led by Gov. Gavin Newsom to help Democrats win control of the U.S. House of Representatives next year — have far out-raised the opposition campaigns, according to fundraising disclosures filed with the state.

The primary group backing Proposition 50 raked in $77.5 million and spent $28.1 million through Sept. 20, according to a campaign finance report that was filed with the secretary of state’s office on Thursday.

The committee has $54.4 million in the bank for the final weeks of the campaign, so Californian should expect a blizzard of television ads, mailers, phone calls and other efforts to sway voters before the Nov. 4 special election.

The two main groups opposing the ballot measure have raised $35.3 million, spent $27.4 million and have roughly $8.8 million in the bank combined, campaign finance reports show.

Despite having an overwhelming financial advantage, the campaign supporting Proposition 50 has tried to portray itself as the underdog in a fight to raise money against opposition campaigns with ties to President Trump and his supporters.

“MAGA donors keep pouring millions into the campaign to stop Prop. 50 in the hopes of pleasing their ‘Dear Leader,’” said Hannah Milgrom, a spokesperson for the Yes on 50, the Election Rigging Response Act campaign. “We will not take our foot off the gas — Prop. 50 is America’s best chance to stop this reckless and dangerous president, and we will keep doing everything we can to ensure every Californian knows the stakes and is ready to vote yes on 50 this Nov. 4th.”

A spokesperson for one of the anti-Proposition 50 campaigns, which was sending mailers to voters even before the Democratic-led California Legislature placed Proposition 50 on the November ballot, said their priority was to help Californians understand the inappropriateness of redrawing congressional boundaries that had been created by a voter-approved, state independent commission.

“We started communicating with voters early about the consequences of having politicians draw their own lines,” said Amy Thoma, a spokesperson for a coalition that opposes the ballot measure. “We are confident we’ll have the resources necessary to continue through election day.”

A spokesperson for the other main anti-Proposition 50 group agreed.

“When you’re selling a lemon, no amount of cash can change the taste. We’re confident in raising more than sufficient resources to expose Prop. 50 for the blatant political power grab that it is,” said Ellie Hockenbury, an advisor to the No on 50 - Stop Sacramento’s Power Grab campaign. Newsom “can’t change the fact that Prop. 50 is nothing more than a ploy for politicians to take the power of redistricting away from the voters and charge them for the privilege at a massive cost to taxpayers.”

The special election is expected to cost the state and the counties $282 million, according to the secretary of state’s office and the state department of finance.

If approved, Proposition 50 would have a major impact on California’s 2026 congressional elections, which will play a major role in determining whether Trump is able to continue enacting his agenda in the final two years of his tenure. The party that wins the White House frequently loses congressional seats two years later, and Republicans hold a razor-thin majority in the House.

After Trump urged GOP-led states, notably Texas, to redraw their congressional districts to increase the number of Republicans elected to Congress in next year’s midterm election, Newsom and other California Democrats responded by proposing a counter-effort to boost the ranks of their party in the legislative body.

California’s congressional districts are drawn once every decade after the U.S. Census by a voter-approved independent redistricting commission. So Democrats’ proposal to replace the districts with new boundaries proposed by state lawmakers must be approved by voters. The state Legislature voted in August to put the measure before voters in a special election on Nov. 4.

Polling about the proposition is not definitive. It’s an off-year election, which means turnout is likely to be low and the electorate is unpredictable. And relatively few Californians pay attention to redistricting, the esoteric process of redrawing congressional districts.

There are more than 30 campaign committees associated with Proposition 50 registered with the secretary of state’s office, but only three have raised large amounts of money.

Newsom’s pro-Proposition 50 effort has received several large donations since its launch, including $10 million from billionaire financier George Soros, $7.6 million from House Majority PAC (the Democrats’ congressional political arm) and $4.5 million from various Service Employees International Union groups. Former Google CEO Eric Schmidt and his wife have contributed $1 million to a separate committee supporting the proposition.

The opposition groups had few small-dollar donors and were largely funded by two sources — $30 million in loans from Charles Munger Jr., who for years has been a major Republican donor in California, and a $5-million donation from the Congressional Leadership Fund, the GOP political arm of House Republicans.",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/13bcfae/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3600x1890+0+255/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fce%2F20%2Ff602abea4d9190b0c74679c37f3e%2F1482102-me-early-voting-features-5-brv.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 22:59:05.070990

As electric cars running on rechargeable lithium-ion batteries continue to gain a larger market share of the roadways, it's becoming increasingly important for firefighters to learn how to tackle the challenges that come with keeping the public safe when things go wrong.

On Thursday and Friday, Tesla staged a training session instructing first responders on how to contain these fires.

Tesla, alongside the San Bernardino County Fire Department, held the event at the San Bernardino Airport. It's the second such event the automaker has held for first responders.

""Our goal is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy, and so we can't do it alone,"" said Tesla business development manager Jan Gromadzki.

As the world moves toward sustainable energy, tactics for handling emergencies such as fires will change. As such, Tesla brought technology that's not even included in its vehicles, like the storage systems for its lithium-ion batteries, so first responders know exactly what to do in the case of an emergency.

""How do you train the firefighters for tomorrow? And if you're just training for past events, then you're not very forward thinking as a fire agency,"" said Ben Flanders, who attended the event as a member of the Rialto Fire Department.

Lithium-ion battery fires can look scary, even Tesla admits, but the advice handed out on Friday and Saturday assured crews that sometimes, just clearing the area and allowing the fires to burn is the way to go.

""They burn safely even though they burn longer then a regular fire would,"" Gromadzki said. ""It's something controlled and easily managed by the fire department with regular gear.""

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration's emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration's focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump's transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it's practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms. However, the latest recalled projects didn't have fully funded grant agreements in place, which would have made reversing them far trickier.

The transportation department's press office didn't respond to emails requesting comment.

Prioritizing roads, not trails

Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile (71-kilometer) recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.

Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant’s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn't move forward. The agency wants “multimodal grant programs” to focus on “projects that promote vehicular travel,” the letter explained.

“They're defining quality of life for Americans as enhancing automobile operations,” Dunne said.

The same reason was given in a letter sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pulling $11.5 million in funding for a leg of a rail trail cutting through the city's core. It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.

“We are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. “We will see you in court.”

Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts “an affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans’ demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.”

DOT also withdrew a $20 million grant awarded in 2022 to transform three streetscapes in Boston. The reversal was based in part on the project's electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting “traditional forms of energy and natural resources,” the Boston Globe reported.

No project too small to cut

Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department's changing priorities.

One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ “creative roadway features” such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county's Land Use and Environment Group.

But Trump's transportation officials flagged it as “hostile to motor vehicles” in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn't affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.

“We're kind of at a standstill now until new funding sources become available,” he said.

This adds to the initial funding for FIRE Collaboratives announced in January.

According to DOE, “these investments are part of DOE’s broader mission to unleash American energy, science, and innovation, ensuring the technologies that define the future of fusion power are developed here in the United States.”

“This funding represents a major step toward establishing commercial fusion energy as a singular competitive advantage for the nation,” said Tammy Ma, director of Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory’s (LLNL) Livermore Institute for Fusion Technology.

LLNL has a prominent role in these projects. As the home of fusion ignition, LLNL is uniquely positioned to help translate the physics breakthrough into a viable source of commercial fusion energy. LLNL first achieved fusion ignition in a 2022 National Ignition Facility experiment and has since repeated the achievement multiple times.

The FIRE collaboratives will receive $128 million, awarded to seven teams focused on creating a fusion energy science and technology innovation ecosystem by forming virtual, centrally managed teams. The selected teams aim to bridge the DOE Fusion Energy Sciences program’s basic science research and growing fusion industries.

LLNL staff are involved with three of the FIRE collaboratives:

Catherine Percher: Fusion Neutrons for Integrated Blanket Technology Development Through Advanced Testing and Design, led by the University of Wisconsin-Madison. This collaborative will address a crucial gap in the development of fusion pilot plants: the development and validation of integrated blanket technology in prototypical environments, particularly under the irradiation of 14 MeV D-T neutrons and with high-magnetic fields to demonstrate representative performance of key components and systems.

Kelli Humbird and Derek Mariscal: Fusion Energy Data Ecosystem and Repository (FEDER), led by General Atomics. This collaborative will create a centralized, federated platform that integrates data from experiments, materials science and modeling, supporting both magnetic and inertial fusion research. The project aims to standardize data formats and provide advanced tools for data discovery, analysis and visualization, enhancing collaboration and accelerating progress toward practical fusion energy.

Vlad Soukhanovskii: Advancing the maturity of liquid metal plasma-facing materials and first-wall concepts, led by the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory. This collaborative will solve key technical problems with liquid metal plasma-facing materials and wall concepts so that liquid metals can be considered for fusion pilot plant designs. Research will include four main challenges: testing protective materials, understanding material properties, studying how liquid metals behave in magnetic fields and developing new metal alloys.

The INFUSE program will receive $6.1 million. With this funding, DOE selected 20 projects that accelerate private-sector fusion energy development by reducing barriers to collaboration between businesses and national laboratories or universities. LLNL’s Matt Selwood is leading the national laboratory effort collaborating with Pacific Fusion to investigate coded apertures for pulsed magnetic fusion neutron imaging.

Derrick Hollie is the founder of the Energy Poverty Prevention Project.","As the weather turns colder, millions of families are bracing for another season of high energy costs and, for many, the threat of going without heat. One truth is impossible to ignore: Energy is becoming a luxury.

In the last year, residential electricity prices have risen 6.5 percent nationwide, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Since 2022, estimates place the overall increase closer to 13 percent. Natural gas, heating oil and propane prices remain volatile, and households that struggled to keep cool this summer are now worried about how to stay warm this winter.

This is not a regional issue. From New England families dependent on fuel oil, to Midwestern households facing record utility bills, to seniors on fixed incomes in the South, the crisis of energy poverty has gone mainstream. Families are making impossible choices: between groceries and heating, or medicine and electricity.

As the leader of the Energy Poverty Prevention Project, I’ve spent nearly a decade calling out this quiet emergency. I’ve testified before Congress five times. I’ve met parents who ration electricity, seniors who wear coats indoors, and students who can’t keep their laptops charged for school. For them, energy is neither affordable nor reliable; it’s a luxury.

Who is at fault? Greedy utility executives? Commodity traders? For the answer, look no further than your nearest elected official.

For years, government policy has pushed a one-sided energy transition. Coal and natural gas plants that once provided steady, affordable baseload power have been retired in droves. In Maryland, more than 3,800 megawatts of coal-fired power generation have been taken offline since 2012. Meanwhile, subsidies flow toward electric vehicles and energy-hungry data centers, all of which compete with families for the same kilowatts.

Utility executives and commodity traders keep the lights on. Government, too often, turns them off.

That’s why I’m urging Congress and state leaders to act: Protect access to affordable, reliable energy by ending policies that raise costs and leave vulnerable communities behind.

If we put customers and providers, rather than bureaucrats, at the center of energy policy, the result will be lower bills, more growth opportunities, and greater financial freedom for families.

The Energy Poverty Prevention Project can’t do it alone. It’s time for policymakers to wake up. It’s time to measure energy policy by human costs, not carbon counts. No parent should choose between feeding a child and heating a home. No student should fall behind because they can’t keep the lights on. And no American, not one, should be forced into poverty to survive the winter.

Let’s act as if energy matters. Because for millions, it’s the difference between hardship and hope.

KAUKAUNA, WI – On Thursday, Americans for Prosperity—Wisconsin (AFP-WI) hosted a permitting reform roundtable highlighting the urgent need for Congress to modernize and streamline the federal permitting process and the impact of federal regulations on Wisconsin’s energy sector. The event featured Reps. Tom Tiffany (WI-07) and Tony Wied (WI-08) alongside industry and community leaders.

The roundtable, moderated by AFP-WI Grassroots Director of Operations Paul Schecklman, focused on how outdated federal red tape threatens local industries, raises costs for families, and undermines access to affordable, reliable energy.

Watch Rep. Tom Tiffany’s recap on energy reform from the roundtable HERE.

Rep. Tom Tiffany (WI-07) released the following statement:

“Permitting reform is common sense. Wisconsin needs clear timelines, predictable rules, and accountability so we can build the energy infrastructure that keeps costs down for families and powers new investments like data centers and manufacturing. I will keep working in Congress to streamline federal reviews, protect our environment, and get shovels in the ground faster.”

Rep. Tony Wied (WI-08) released the following statement:

“Northeast Wisconsin builds world-class products. When projects sit in limbo under layers of federal red tape, we lose jobs, we lose investment, and families pay more for electricity and fuel. We can respect local voices and environmental standards, and still move at the speed of the economy. I support reforms that set firm timelines, cut duplication across agencies, and get workers back on the job.”

AFP-WI Director of Grassroots Operations Paul Schecklman released the following statement:

“Federal permitting restrictions are holding back the reliable energy Wisconsin families and businesses need. Projects and new investments like data centers face delays and higher costs because of Washington red tape. Congress should enact commonsense reforms now so we can meet rising demand, support jobs, and ensure every community has affordable, dependable power.”",https://americansforprosperity.org/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/AFP_image-1024x536.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 20:58:58.336557

Yet the clean energy boom is beginning to cut into this pollution.
The next phase of clean energy deployment could help China to go much further than the pledges Mr. Xi announced this week and supplant in a more significant way the dirty energy the country relies on.
In practice that means systematically building infrastructure, sophisticated supply chains and a predictable domestic market for clean energy.
Mr. Trump rolled back President Joe Biden’s flagship climate initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act, and with it billions of dollars in federal investment in the clean energy sector.","President Xi Jinping of China has long taken pleasure in poking fun at the West’s short political attention span in confronting long-term challenges such as climate change. Western diplomats told me that in 2017 he regaled a delegation with a story about how President Barack Obama had traveled to Beijing to attempt to pressure China to cut its greenhouse gas emissions faster, only to be followed by President Trump, who downplayed the threat of climate change.

The point was that in contrast to the West, where election cycles have constrained consistent climate action, China plays a long game — planning decades into the future. And it doesn’t like to make promises it can’t keep.

This week, at the United Nations General Assembly, Beijing offered the world a glimpse of how it plans to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the years and decades ahead with a pledge to reduce them by 7 to 10 percent by 2035.

Such a modest commitment is frustrating to environmental advocates and Western leaders alike, who see it as falling short of what the climate crisis demands. In one sense, they’re absolutely right. China is the world’s biggest polluter and single-handedly burns more than half of the world’s coal, the dirtiest fossil fuel. According to my organization’s research, China would need to slash its emissions by at least 30 percent from peak levels by 2035 to align with the Paris Agreement’s target to limit average global warming to 1.5 degrees Celsius above preindustrial levels. Beijing’s new pledge clearly misses that mark.

Yet to judge China’s climate ambition by the new pledge alone is to miss the far more consequential economic story: China has become the world’s clean tech superpower. Its dominance in the solar, battery and electric vehicle industries should allow it to move faster on climate and help much of the rest of the world use fewer fossil fuels, too. While the West is distracted and divided, China is focused and surging ahead.

There are reasons for China’s choice to set a conservative target. Domestically, China’s economic slowdown, particularly in provinces reliant on heavy industry, has made its leaders wary of climate actions that could jeopardize growth.

Internationally, wavering commitments from key Western polluters, most sharply the United States and, to a lesser extent, the European Union, also affect China’s willingness to act boldly. In the absence of Western leadership, its self-interested approach tends to become more pronounced.

Yet in the decade since Mr. Obama visited Beijing to implore Mr. Xi to cut emissions more aggressively, China’s clean energy sector has evolved from a nascent industry into a powerful engine of its economy and a source of national pride.

Today, China manufactures over 80 percent of the world’s solar panels, around 75 percent of electric vehicle batteries and more than 60 percent of wind turbines. In 2023 alone, the clean tech sector accounted for 40 percent of China’s growth in gross domestic product, a staggering number in an otherwise sluggish economic environment. China now installs more solar panels annually than the rest of the world combined.

The clean tech sector is also becoming the core of China’s industrial future and global business expansion. Last year, China invested $72 billion in green manufacturing outside its borders, equivalent to about 40 percent of China’s total foreign direct investment.

The country still accounts for about 30 percent of climate-warming gases, with its vast industrial base and coal fleet responsible for 90 percent of new emissions globally since 2015. Yet the clean energy boom is beginning to cut into this pollution. The rapid deployment of renewable energy brought China’s carbon dioxide emissions down by 1 percent in the first half of 2025, continuing a trend that began in early 2024.

The next phase of clean energy deployment could help China to go much further than the pledges Mr. Xi announced this week and supplant in a more significant way the dirty energy the country relies on. For instance, while Mr. Xi’s government pledged that China would add six times the amount of wind and solar energy it had installed in 2020 and ensure that 30 percent of its energy came from nonfossil fuel sources by 2035, it is likely to go far beyond that.

Unlike the West, where climate targets are often ambitious but vulnerable to political cycles, China has aligned decarbonization with its economic growth strategy. In practice that means systematically building infrastructure, sophisticated supply chains and a predictable domestic market for clean energy.

In the West, temporary surges in ambition often give way to political backsliding, creating the illusion of progress without deep structural changes. Mr. Trump rolled back President Joe Biden’s flagship climate initiative, the Inflation Reduction Act, and with it billions of dollars in federal investment in the clean energy sector. Meanwhile, the European Union, once a champion of climate action, has been struggling with geopolitical distractions and internal divisions and, embarrassingly, was unable to present a climate pledge at the United Nations this week.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/28/opinion/28shuo/26shuo-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 20:00:42.789875

Beginning in 2029, AtmosClear, a subsidiary of Houston-based Fidelis New Energy, plans to generate renewable baseload power at the Baton Rouge plant using sustainable materials like sugarcane bagasse while capturing 680,000 metric tons of biogenic CO2 annually, which ExxonMobil has agreed to inject more than a mile underground. The biogenic CO2 produced could also be used as a feedstock for low-carbon natural gas or other synthetic fuels, according to AtmosClear.

ExxonMobil’s carbon capture and storage system includes a 1,300-mile CO2 pipeline network, Class VI injection wells, and monitoring systems. “We have a number of permits under review for potential storage sites,” ExxonMobil Media Advisor Margot Armentor said in a release. “We’re in the early stages of determining whether these sites will be suitable CO2 storage locations,” said Armentor.

In April, tech giant Microsoft signed a 15-year agreement with Fidelis AtmosClear for carbon dioxide removal as part of a voluntary commitment the tech giant made to become carbon neutral by 2030. Microsoft has entered into several carbon dioxide removal (CDR) purchase agreements with various companies since 2020. Other technology companies are also pursuing voluntary carbon removal strategies, often with net-zero and carbon-negative goals that rely on buying CDR credits.

Louisiana State University Professor Richard Hughes said Lousiana’s geology is almost perfect for carbon capture and storage. “The way the interaction of the rivers and the Gulf of Mexico has happened over Millenia is we’ve got these thick sands, and the river moves back and forth so that the sands are covered by shale. The shale is kind of an impermeable piece where nothing can move up or down, and the things in the sand just stay there, and we have a sequence of these sand layers from 20,000 feet down almost to the surface,” Hughes said in a YouTube video.

President Donald Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” preserved and expanded 45Q tax credits for carbon capture and storage, which were initially established in 2022 by the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump’s bill simultaneously canceled billions in Department of Energy awards to companies developing decarbonization projects, however, as reported by The Center Square.

Fidelis AtmosClear plans to begin construction in 2026 and expects to begin producing baseline power and biogenic CO2 in 2029. The company said it estimates the project will result in over $800 million of investment and approximately 75 permanent and 600 construction jobs. The plant will also support a significant revival of forestry management jobs impacted by mill closures in the area, Fidelis said.

Will Green, president and CEO of the Louisiana Association of Business and Industry, said in an op-ed Friday published by Nola.com that there is more than $20 billion in proposed CCS investment across the state.

Louisiana, North Dakota, Wyoming, West Virginia and Arizona are the only states to a have achieved primacy for carbon capture and storage from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, which means they have taken over the day-to-day responsibility of issuing permits for Class VI wells, monitoring compliance, and taking enforcement actions when violations occur.

The Louisiana legislature developed carbon capture and storage policies through numerous bills passed during the 2024 and 2025 legislative sessions.

Nancy Pelosi’s husband, Paul, for using.","President Donald Trump has used his emergency powers to keep a handful of older coal- and oil-fired power plants open past their scheduled retirements.

And he’s just getting started with his intervention into U.S. electricity markets, Zack Colman reports.

The Energy Department and the White House National Energy Dominance Council are considering new orders and a more aggressive effort to keep large, around-the-clock fossil fuel plants from closing — pushing deeper into decisions traditionally left up to power companies or state utility commissions.

Some plants might have to stay open even if they are unprofitable, potentially driving up consumers’ electric bills.

Trump and his top policy brass — Energy Secretary Chris Wright and Interior Secretary Doug Burgum — say the decadeslong transition from coal to a diverse range of power sources including renewable energy has tipped the United States into an energy crisis that can’t be undone without mining and burning more coal, as Hannah Northey reports.

Zack reports that White House officials fear Trump’s vision of an energy-hungry, tech-driven economy could come crashing down unless “baseload” coal plants slated for retirement stay open while regulators exempt others from federal air quality standards.

Coal has been on the losing end of electricity markets that dispatch the cheapest sources of power generation first. Natural gas, wind and solar power have been the cheapest sources. Old, inefficient coal plants are now among the most expensive for power companies to operate, and they pollute more than other sources.

Less complicated politically is Trump’s promise to bring down electricity prices, which continue to climb in most regions of the country.

‘There is no emergency here’

Wright confirmed at an event hosted by Reuters this week that the administration is “absolutely” exploring ways to keep baseload plants open, including more secretarial orders.

Wright has used that emergency authority to keep three power-generating units open: a coal-fired plant in Michigan and two oil-fired units of a plant in Pennsylvania. He used similar authority to keep a Maryland oil plant running and allow it to exceed its operating limit, at the regional grid operator’s request.

The Trump administration is looking at using the Defense Production Act to prop up plants financially and ordering plants to stay open in the name of preserving capacity for peak demand.

Projections for rapidly rising electricity demand is putting pressure on regional power grids. But opponents of the administration’s use of emergency power say it’s just adding costs onto consumer electricity bills.

“There’s no emergency here,” said Ari Peskoe, director of the electricity law initiative at Harvard Law School’s Environmental and Energy Law Program, who argued that Wright is assuming a persistent energy emergency in the country.

David Patton, a grid analyst, told one regional power organization — the Midcontinent Independent System Operator — this month that Wright’s order to keep a Michigan coal plant open “was costly and not needed to meet MISO’s reliability requirements.”

Ditching the science

The Environmental Protection Agency may be forced to abandon its scientific argument for scrapping the finding that drives climate regulation, Jean Chemnick writes.

That argument, drawn from a Department of Energy report that downplayed the risks of climate change, is facing pushback and a lawsuit over how the group that wrote the report was formed. The group, made up of scientists widely seen as climate contrarians who were handpicked by Secretary Chris Wright, has since been disbanded, throwing the report in limbo.

“I wouldn’t be surprised if it doesn’t play much of a role at all in the final rule,” said Jody Freeman, director of the Environmental and Energy Law Program at Harvard Law School.

“If they’re not smart and they leave it in there,” Freeman said, “they’re just inviting a court to say, ‘You ignored the overwhelming science, and under arbitrary and capricious review, you can’t.’”

US prepares to step up on nuclear fuel

DOE is set to release at least $900 million to fund domestic uranium enrichment projects to fuel the nation’s nuclear fleet before imports from Russia are cut off, Brian Dabbs and Francisco “A.J.” Camacho write.

The money could come by the end of September, sources told Brian and A.J. The U.S. imports up to a quarter of its uranium from Russia and has only one company currently producing the type of uranium that large reactors use. Some in the industry see the federal funding as just the tip of what’s needed.

Lee Robinson, chief operating officer for General Matter, a nuclear fuel enrichment company, said this week at an Atlantic Council event that the U.S. nuclear fleet could run into “shortage territory” in the coming years.

A ray of hope for plastics talks

Through the gloom of another failed global plastics treaty summit, close observers say they saw a glimmer of hope emanating from China, Leonie Cater reports.

In its closing speech, the world’s biggest plastic producer subtly changed its language on tackling the plastic crisis, acknowledging the problem has to do with the entire life cycle of plastic. It comes as Beijing moves to fill a vacuum left by the U.S. withdrawal from global engagement in environmental talks.

The plastics industry accounts for 3.4 percent of the world’s total greenhouse gas emissions. Plastic production is on track to almost triple by 2060.

Even factoring in red-state redistricting, the current numbers suggest that the Democrats have a reasonable chance of taking control of the House after the 2026 elections.

In Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl”, I’ll discuss how the midterms run-up should be used to reset the clean energy and environment debates in response to today’s political realities.","Venice has its pigeons and Capistrano its swallows. Flying over the White House and Capitol Hill these days are birds of a different feather – chickens. For the president and the GOP Congress, they’ll soon be coming home to roost.

Although all elections are important, some are more so than others. History will look back on the 2026 midterms as among the most momentous of the modern era. The reason for this can be summed up in three simple words: Donald John Trump.

The president so dominates the executive and legislative branches that the 2026 elections will be a referendum on his handling of the economy and the affairs of state. Trump claims to have won a popular mandate at the polls last November. It’s FAKE News.

Trump’s winning margin in 2024 was less than 1.5 percent of the popular vote. Although beating Harris by 16 percent in the Electoral College vote, it’s a flawed number in that it fails to reflect popular sentiment and how evenly divided the nation seems to be. The narrow majorities in both the House and Senate are further proof that America is split nearly in half between Trump supporters and everyone else.

If presidential elections are examples of regime change, then the electionof Donald J. Trump in 2024 is an example of radical culture change.

Trump doesn’t have a popular mandate. He has a license given him by the Republicans in Congress and the conservatives on the Supreme Court to do almost anything he wants. The Republican Senate has rubber-stamped its approval of what many believe to be the least competent and most ethically compromised cabinet since the Harding administration.

The House fiddles while the president impounds the monies Congress appropriates, guts agencies established by law, and stops projects that have attracted billions of dollars of private investment because he thinks wind turbines are ugly and coal “clean” and “beautiful”. (What if we were to gold plate the wind turbines, Mr. President?)

Without understanding what was actually being done, the Republicans in Congress hailed Elon Musk and his chainsaw for cutting government programs they oversee and are responsible for, because they contained words like climate, clean energy, environment, minority, vaccine, scientific or medical research, equity, and justice.

Government reform by a keyword search has predictably resulted in major gaps in the operation of federal agencies and the implementation of various programs and policies. Because weather and climate change are closely connected, the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) cut critical forecasting work. It suspended tracking programs at the National Weather Service (NWS) and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).

What does it say when an administration fires the independent inspectors general of nearly every cabinet department and doesn’t replace them? What does it tell you about the relationship of an administration to the truth when the government attempts to overwrite history to conform to nationalistic myths or censors and removes scientific information from federal websites because it conflicts with the fancies of the president?

The first nine months of Trump’s 2nd regime have turned the federal government feral.

The Department of Justice attacks any individual, group, or institution that deigns to disagree with the president and his worldview. Not to put too fine a point on it, but Trump has been able to wing his way out of most problems by crying FAKE NEWS, using misdirection, firing the messenger, or threatening to use the full might of the federal government to prosecute an opponent.

The consequences of Trumpian economics and government reforms are just now showing up in the economy. Given all that’s happened over the past eight months, it’s easy to forget that the impacts of many of Trump’s policy and program reforms, tariffs, and deportation programs are in the earliest stages of implementation.

Delays between implementation and impact are the result of various factors. In the case of rising prices, pre-tariff inventories and efforts by companies to “eat” the new import costs for as long as possible have tamped down pricing. However, companies are running out of options.

At some point, the truth catches up to all of us – Mr. Trump included.

A July survey by KPMG found that “83 percent of businesses expect to raise prices in the next six months, with nearly three quarters already passing on some of the costs.” According to the company: “The full impact on consumers is likely still to come.”

Two of Trump’s most vaunted accomplishments – tariffs and the “One Big Beautiful Bill” (OBBB) are among the reasons the president’s approval ratings are trending south. According to the Pew Research Center, 61 percent of Americans disapprove of Trump’s tariff policies, while 38 percent approve. The disapproval number for OBBB is 46 percent, while 32 percent approve, with 23 percent being unsure. (See Figure 1)

A Washington Post/IPSOS poll released on September 18th confirmed Pew’s earlier findings. Trump’s approval within Republican ranks was also shown to be dropping, especially among “younger Republican and GOP women.”

What could also prove problematic for Republicans in the 2026 congressional elections is the view of a majority of adult Americans (53 percent) that Trump “is making the federal government work worse, while only about half as many (27 percent) say he is making government better.” The numbers reflect lessening support for Trump’s handling of the federal bureaucracy.

Trump is underwater in terms of voter approval, even for his handling of immigration and crime. Both are issues he has traditionally scored high on. Although the surveys show predictable partisan splits, the loss of favorability amongst independent voters could prove the difference in 2026.

Trump’s response to the poll numbers is – as it always is – to blame the polls and the bias of organizations responsible for them. The president spares no one. In a recent interview on FOX News with Martha McCallum, he blamed FOX for bad polling.

There’s going to come a time when claims of FAKE NEWS and disingenuous pollsters will not outweigh the truth of weakening job markets, rising prices, and dysfunctional federal agencies.

The reasons behind Trump’s loss of support are real rather than theoretical. If younger Republicans lose faith in the president’s economic policies, it’s because recent graduates are being hit hardest by the softening labor market.

China’s reduced imports of US farm products are negatively impacting the nation’s agricultural economy. Not only are farmers unable to sell their soybeans, but they aren’t buying new combines, harvesters, and tractors. The loss of low-wage immigrant labor to harvest crops and pack meat means a rise in food prices.

Mr. Trump could fire every government statistician and replace them with MAGA acolytes, and it wouldn’t change the reality of rising prices and the increasing concerns of voters. Trump’s rebrand of his OBBB as the Working Families Tax Cut is unlikely to take voters’ minds off the fact that their dollar is buying less than it did a month ago, or that they’re paying more for health insurance, when they can afford it at all.

Trump and the GOP have other reasons to be anxious over the potential outcome of the 2026 elections. Historically, midterm elections are notoriously brutal to a sitting president’s party.

Known as the midterm curse, the party controlling the White House has lost an average of 28 seats in the House of Representatives and four seats in the Senate over the 22 off-year elections between 1934 and 2018. (The 2022 midterms did not follow the law of averages as the Democrats lost just six seats in the House while gaining one in the Senate.)

The generic congressional ballot shows Democrats with a lead over Republicans of between three and eight percent, indicating that partisanship is still a major factor in how Americans are likely to vote in 2026. The 2018 generic ballot showed a spread in favor of the Democrats of between seven and 13 percentage points.

The 2018 elections resulted in “a net total of 41 seats from the total number of seats they had won in the 2016 elections.” It was the Democrats’ “largest gain of House seats since the post-Watergate 1974 elections, when they picked up 49 seats.” Trump’s approval ratings at the time hovered around 50 percent.

Even factoring in red-state redistricting, the current numbers suggest that the Democrats have a reasonable chance of taking control of the House after the 2026 elections. The likelihood that the Dems will gain the net of four seats needed to flip the Senate is less.

If the overwhelming majority of economists and political analysts are right, the negative consequences of the president’s policies will only worsen between now and November 2026. If the past is prologue, then the midterm elections will return control of the House to Democrats. From an environmental perspective, Democratic control of the House is a net good thing.

Trump’s opposition to clean energy sources and environmental regulation is so virulent that it’s resulting in the administration working against itself. The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) has leveraged billions of dollars of private investments in red states – ironically, more in red than blue. One example is the recently raided, under-construction Hyundai battery plant in Georgia.

The White House has rebuffed efforts of red state Republicans to continue the programs. GOP proponents have partly argued that the administration could take credit for it. Trump had no problem taking credit for infrastructure projects contracted for by the Biden administration. Why not for the IRA? (I’ll have more to say about this in Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl” as it concerns messaging.)

Nothing is more critical in terms of federal climate policy than slowing the administration’s cancellation of renewable energy programs and the unwinding of environmental regulations back to a time before Nixon.

The 2026 midterm elections are an opportunity to effectively slow the Trump administration’s onslaught against clean energy and the environment. In the run-up to the election, the clean energy and environmental communities must keep their collective eyes on the prize – a Democratic House majority.

If I were asked to suggest a phrase that best describes what the midterm election will be about, I’d put “back to basics” at the top of my list. Even in good times, elections are about the economy.

Contrary to what Trump says and demands his administration agree with, people are worried about inflation, jobs, and whether tariffs are worth their sacrifice. Seeing your utility bill go up five percent or more in a month isn’t FAKE NEWS. It’s a problem for the average family of four.

Part of people’s core concern is whether the government will be there for them in times of emergency – personal or societal. A majority of voters believe Trump isn’t the problem solver he claims to be. In fact, they’ll soon be wondering if he isn’t the problem giver.

Voters in 2026 are going to be looking for answers to bread-and-butter issues. It will be up to the clean energy and environmental communities to help frame the debate in a manner that resonates with voters, particularly independents and conservative youth and builds a foundation for the 2028 elections.

In Part 2 of “A Government Most Fowl”, I’ll discuss how the midterms run-up should be used to reset the clean energy and environment debates in response to today’s political realities. One is that Trump has set the terms of the debate, which means keeping it simple and less philosophical.

Eric Burlison,,,,,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/op-eds/3827047/dont-bail-joe-biden-obamacare-broken-subsidies/,"I can promise you that Biden’s subsidies do not fit the bill.
And the best part is, in this case, doing so requires us to do nothing at all: Republicans must simply allow Joe Biden’s disastrous temporary subsidies to expire.
Even without Biden’s COVID subsidies, taxpayers will still cover 80% of the typical enrollee’s premium —up from 68% in 2014.
That’s because Obamacare subsidies cap what enrollees pay, fully insulating them from rising healthcare costs and shifting costs directly onto taxpayers.
The truth is that when Americans are actually presented with the facts of the issue at hand, polling shows the majority of Americans want Congress to let these subsidies expire.","Layered on top of already generous subsidies that are not going away, these Biden-era handouts force taxpayers to foot the bill for fully subsidized health care for more than nine million Obamacare recipients. Not a single Republican has ever voted for these subsidies or to extend them. None should do so now. Democrats themselves couldn’t even secure support within their own ranks to make these subsidies permanent. In fact, former Senator Joe Manchin opposed their inclusion in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, citing fiscal concerns.

The question now is whether Republicans will draw a clear line in the sand or settle for a position no stronger than Joe Manchin’s. In November, the people gave President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress a clear mandate to deliver on the conservative agenda. I can promise you that Biden’s subsidies do not fit the bill.

It is incumbent upon us to actually do the work of the people and restore some semblance of fiscal responsibility. And the best part is, in this case, doing so requires us to do nothing at all: Republicans must simply allow Joe Biden’s disastrous temporary subsidies to expire.

Much like our fight to restore work requirements in Medicaid — a deeply popular and common-sense policy — Republicans again have the opportunity to take a principled conservative stand to protect taxpayers in the face of fabricated pressure campaigns. Dubious polling pushed by Democrats and insurance lobbyists suggests that the midterms could be a bloodbath for Republicans if they allow Biden’s COVID subsidies to expire. “Premiums will double,” they say. “Millions will lose coverage.”

Here’s the reality.

42% of Obamacare enrollees are on fully subsidized plans as of 2024. Another 28% pay a premium of $50 or less. When Biden’s subsidies expire, the average enrollee (someone earning 200 percent of the federal poverty level) will only have to pay $32 a week for a plan — about the cost of a median DoorDash order. Someone earning 100% of the poverty level would only have to pay $3.45 — the cost for a cup of coffee.

Even without Biden’s COVID subsidies, taxpayers will still cover 80% of the typical enrollee’s premium —up from 68% in 2014. That’s because Obamacare subsidies cap what enrollees pay, fully insulating them from rising healthcare costs and shifting costs directly onto taxpayers.

If Republicans cave to the Left’s demands, it will be entirely clear that generous taxpayer-funded pandemic healthcare subsidies will be here to stay; almost four million Americans will lose their employer coverage, crowded out by artificially low government-backed premiums.

Free market principles be damned.

This, of course, doesn’t even scratch the surface of the systematically broken Biden subsidies, which cost taxpayers $30 billion annually in improper payments. Biden’s Covid-19 credits are direct cash payments from the United States Treasury to health insurers. Every customer is a fresh check, providing a direct incentive for insurance brokers to collect as many enrollees as possible, often without their knowledge. With $0 premium plans becoming widely available, many enrollees never see a bill.

In 2024 alone, nearly 12 million enrollees filed no claims. Between 2021 and 2024, the number of zero-claim enrollees tripled. As a result, taxpayers sent tens of billions of dollars to insurers even though no care had ever been given.

Is it our position that taxpayer money is best spent on corporate welfare for insurance companies that provide nothing in return? Do we earnestly believe that the American taxpayer will look favorably upon us for layering more waste, fraud, and abuse on an already broken healthcare system?

The truth is that when Americans are actually presented with the facts of the issue at hand, polling shows the majority of Americans want Congress to let these subsidies expire. So let them.

If Democrats want to hold the government hostage because we refuse to burden taxpayers with another trillion-dollar list of demands that would erase all the progress Republicans have made over the past eight months, let them.

SUPREME COURT TO HEAR FTC FIRING LAWSUIT TEEING UP CHALLENGE TO 90-YEAR-OLD PRECEDENT

Republicans were not sent to Washington to rubber-stamp Joe Biden’s COVID-era policies, allowing inflation to spiral further out of control. Our broken healthcare system does deserve attention, but monthly subsidy checks to insurance companies while shifting rising healthcare costs onto taxpayers isn’t “making health care more affordable.”

If politicians are genuinely interested in raising the living standards of Americans, spending measures that pile more debt onto the backs of working families, suppress free market competition, and incentivize government dependency shouldn’t even be entertained.

This agreement aims to promote the revitalization of the country’s nuclear supply chain and build on a shared vision by both companies to grow American manufacturing.
“Nucor is dedicated to rebuilding American energy infrastructure to make it more resilient,” said Leon Topalian, Nucor’s Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer.
America’s nuclear supply chain has suffered in recent years as China and Russia have aggressively built reactors and exported competing technologies.

This agreement aims to promote the revitalization of the country’s nuclear supply chain and build on a shared vision by both companies to grow American manufacturing.

“Nucor is dedicated to rebuilding American energy infrastructure to make it more resilient,” said Leon Topalian, Nucor’s Chair, President and Chief Executive Officer. “Our work with The Nuclear Company will help us continue our long-term initiatives to repower the domestic energy sector, as well as reshore manufacturing to lessen American dependence on unreliable foreign global supply chains.”

The Nuclear Company and Nucor will evaluate the promotion of steel materials and related manufacturing that meet the stringent American Society of Mechanical Engineers’ NQA-1 certification standard. The review process will also consider factors, including energy infrastructure and the available workforce, to promote reinvestment in the industrial asset base that has long made America the world’s manufacturing leader.

The partnership follows President Donald J. Trump’s series of executive orders calling for 400 GW of nuclear reactors by 2050 to ensure America has the baseload power required to lead the world in AI. The orders also call for 10 large-scale reactors to be under construction by 2030, as well as strong investments in the American nuclear supply chain for materials, components and fuel.

America’s nuclear supply chain has suffered in recent years as China and Russia have aggressively built reactors and exported competing technologies. A 2022 report by the U.S. Department of Energy found the American nuclear supply chain lacks large forges for the production of gigawatt-scale reactor pressure vessels, with current production concentrated in Asia. A study by the World Nuclear Association found that the number of American facilities certified to produce commercial nuclear-grade components has decreased by more than 40 percent over the past three decades. Over that time, the United States started and built just two nuclear reactors. By contrast, China built 37 reactors in the past decade alone.

“America is at a critical point for power,” said The Nuclear Company Co-Founder & CEO Jonathan Webb. “China is on the verge of becoming the world's largest nuclear power producer, surpassing the United States, just as it did decades ago with manufacturing. Our partnership with Nucor will protect America’s national security, help achieve energy independence and create a more resilient economy.”

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump’s administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,” said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important’ to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,” the official said, adding: “We’re trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don’t believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball, what what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin?
Uh California is one we've been watching, accounting for about 30% of EV sales last year.
and there have been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently it just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit.
Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit.","Well, August saw the highest sales of electric vehicles this year, up 19.4% from July and since January EV sales are up 61%, but some industry analysts fear those high voltage sales could be short circuited after tax credits for EV buyers expire on September 30th. Join me now is Kevin Roberts, Carguru's Director of Economic and Market Intelligence. Kevin, good to see you as always. Uh maybe start big picture, Kevin, you know, what is the story with tax credits? They've they've boosted sales so much.

Kevin, why are they going away? Explain that for us. And have folks been, you know, have you seen them rushing in ahead of that deadline?

Yeah, so as part of the big beautiful bill, uh the expiration of the tax credits was pulled ahead to September 30th. and once that was announced, we really started to see the momentum start to pick up from consumers looking to get ahead of that tax credit expiration. So that's both on the purchase of vehicles and also it's helping on EV leasing as well. So, uh we've been I I've been calling it a EV crescendo uh as consumers really look to get ahead of uh get their sales in uh before that credit expires.

And Kevin, you know, um we did see Tesla update its website, um saying, you know, order by September 30th. This included even a a countdown clock on the site. Kevin, how are how are some of the other auto makers? Do we know? Do we have line of sight there? How are they trying to kind of build awareness, get people in the door in the showroom?

Well, I mean, I can say from our data, you can see that the sales rate has picked up. and not only that, the amount of, you know, the number of EVs on dealer lots has been declining and the market day supply has dropped quite significantly. Uh from where we were, you know, at the end of June, 108 days supply and now we're under 45 days supply. So, the message is clearly getting out to consumers and they're looking to kind of snap up those EVs before that credit expires.

So now bottom line, Kevin. So, you know, now let's let's look ahead. So once we're past this tax credit, pull out your crystal ball, what what what do you think the EV market looks like ahead, Kevin? What what would you expect to see?

So, it's it's unknown. I I've been taking a look at what happened in other markets where tax credits expired. If you look to Europe, you know, you saw double digit declines uh of EV sales afterwards. Uh California is one we've been watching, accounting for about 30% of EV sales last year. and there have been talk that they would be replacing the tax credit themselves, but recently it just came out that they're not going to be replacing that tax credit. So a large EV market that we could be seeing uh a drop in sales volume in.

Are there certain EV names, Kevin, EV makers that in your opinion, hey, these guys, they they may be better positioned than others in a sort of a post- tax credit world.

So, normally, I would have assumed that automakers might be looking to plug the gap themselves, but we're in a post- tariff environment and that tariff tax bill they're currently consuming most of themselves right now. So I don't know how much automakers are going to be able to really kind of foot the bill uh as those EV tax credits go away.

And and Kevin, by the way, what what does the the used market for EVs look like? You have line of sight there?

Yeah, so there is a used EV tax credit. It's for vehicles under $25,000. So we've been seeing an acceleration in that market as well. Not as much as what we've been seeing in the new vehicle market, but there has been an uptick uh in that used EV market and we've been seeing a lot more used EVs particularly get under that $25,000 threshold. And so it's a small but growing market.

We've been talking here about EV's, but let's kind of like broaden out this discussion a bit. Look at that larger car market, uh Kevin, so gas, hybrid vehicles. I saw a JD Power site is saying, um, they think sales is expected to actually contract in September. Do you agree with that, Kevin? And if so, is that, what would be the reasons for that? Is that just high higher rates, higher prices, both?

I I mean, we've been seen almost a pull ahead in vehicle sales the past couple months. We saw that at the end of March, early April when the tariffs were first announced, there was a lot of kind of looking to get ahead of those pre-tariff prices. Uh we saw, you know, an acceleration of sales in July and August as well, um as consumers, you know, didn't see prices increase and were looking to get out there as well. So, there is a concern about potential pull ahead of sales volume. Uh but when and where that might strike is a little bit uncertain at this point.

Kevin, you you mentioned tariffs, just want to end here on that. Um, and just your sense of how they factor into this discussion because you have trade agreements, frameworks with the UK, EU, Japan. I mean, they they do provide for this um, the 15% tariffs. Is that in your opinion, Kevin, is that a, is that manageable for the industry?

So, we've already been seeing automakers uh absorb a lot more of the tariff costs than what I initially expected. I think most people were initially expecting. We can see with trade data, the tariff rates are there and the tariffs are taking effect. Uh so the trade deals that are going to be announced will help to kind of bring down that rate. uh and will provide more room for automakers to potentially absorb those tariff costs for a longer period of time than what we might have initially thought when the tariffs were initially brought out in March.

Kevin, great to see you as always. Thank you, sir.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

Those provisions are the basis of opposition from Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts, a group of 480 open shop contractors and related businesses.
“We are very aware of the extreme change in the amount of federal funding that is available now,” Murphy said.
“And one thing I just want to say on that is that we should not let the lack of federal funding stop us from implementing these, at the very least, these energy assessments.
And then see where we can actually implement the changes, or where we can get funding from.”","BOSTON – Estimating that the federal government’s turn away from clean energy projects has eliminated at least 20,000 jobs here, organized labor groups on Thursday renewed their push to create more work by requiring energy assessments in public schools and universities across Massachusetts.

Massachusetts AFL-CIO, the Climate Jobs Massachusetts Action coalition and a handful of individual locals were among those who voiced support for a bill (H 3476 / S 2275) that would require energy and air quality audits for public schools, universities and colleges.

The assessments would estimate the costs of energy improvements as well as greenhouse gas reductions that would result if improvements were made, and it would establish a new Healthy and Sustainable Schools Office within the Department of Energy Resources that could implement the recommended changes.

“Let’s identify the oldest boilers, the worst air ducts and crumbling insulation, and let’s fix them with highly-trained workers and responsible contractors that are going to do a clean job and keep costs down. Let’s find the schools that have the greatest potential for solar panels and thermal energy networks, and install high-quality systems that will save districts money over time and get their buildings closer to net zero,” Ryan Murphy, executive director of Climate Jobs Massachusetts Action, said. “These upgrades would save money. More efficient heating systems, combined with generation and heat transfer solutions like solar and geothermal, mean lower bills for schools and less demand on our grid.”

The bill would also require contractors bidding on the work to agree to comply with the prevailing wage law, any project labor agreements and to ensure their workforce includes a minimum number of workers who went through a registered apprenticeship program. Those provisions are the basis of opposition from Associated Builders and Contractors of Massachusetts, a group of 480 open shop contractors and related businesses.

“We certainly support the concept of healthy schools and the work that will be involved to create them, but we do oppose this bill because of some of the requirements that create unreasonable bidding requirements that will limit competition and workforce participation,” association President Greg Beeman told the committee. He added, “This is untenable, and will result in open shops not being able to bid on this work, reducing the overall number of bidders.”

Murphy told the Joint Committee on Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy that clean energy projects “unfortunately, have been hit hard by recent federal government decisions” and estimated that the federal government “has killed at least 20,000 planned clean energy jobs here in Massachusetts so far.” He and Chrissy Lynch, president of the Massachusetts AFL-CIO, pitched the energy audit bill as a way to replace those job opportunities.

“We do not have a worker shortage in our energy unions. We have a high-quality job site shortage,” Lynch said. “This bill would put energy workers back to work and allow training centers to take in more apprentices.”

The Telecommunications, Utilities and Energy Committee advanced a redraft of the legislation last session as part of a larger bill that focused on transportation infrastructure. The committee advanced that bill to the House Ways and Means Committee in early April 2024, and it advanced no further, according to a committee summary of the latest version.

Co-chair Sen. Michael Barrett asked Murphy and Lynch about the bill’s proposed funding mechanism. The bill simply directs the state to “appropriate funds to a revolving fund to finance activities authorized under this act” and to “apply for, receive, and accept funding from local and federal sources.”

“The one area of resistance we always get in this general domain is if we’re imposing unfunded mandates,” Barrett said.

Murphy said the Healthy and Sustainable Schools Office created under the bill would “search for or collect the available funding, whether through federal grants or state funding that might be available” and mentioned revenues from the state’s surtax on higher-income households as one potential source.

“We are very aware of the extreme change in the amount of federal funding that is available now,” Murphy said. “And one thing I just want to say on that is that we should not let the lack of federal funding stop us from implementing these, at the very least, these energy assessments. And then see where we can actually implement the changes, or where we can get funding from.”",https://i0.wp.com/atholdailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/56b26f64-da4c-4778-af22-6dd98245bc7a.jpg?fit=750%2C500&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-26 18:01:42.914681

Buyers are scrambling to secure rebates of up to $7,500 on new EVs and $4,000 on used ones, a policy originally enacted under the Inflation Reduction Act but now curtailed by recent legislative changes. This deadline has transformed showrooms into bustling hubs, with inventory depleting faster than anticipated, according to reports from industry analysts.

The rush isn’t just anecdotal; data from automakers like Tesla and Ford indicate a spike in orders, with some models selling out weeks ahead of schedule. This phenomenon echoes past incentive phaseouts, but the scale here is amplified by years of pent-up demand fostered by the credit itself. Yet, beneath the frenzy lies a deeper question: Could this short-term boom inadvertently lay the groundwork for sustained EV growth without government subsidies?

The Surge and Its Immediate Effects

Analysts at NerdWallet note that the credit’s end marks a pivotal shift, potentially pricing out budget-conscious consumers who relied on it to make EVs affordable. In states like California and New York, where adoption rates are highest, the loss could lead to a temporary dip in sales, with projections from the Internal Revenue Service suggesting a 20% to 30% drop in the immediate post-deadline period.

However, the current buying spree is flooding roads with more electric vehicles than ever, which could create a self-reinforcing cycle. As per insights from GeekWire, this influx might accelerate infrastructure development, from charging stations to grid enhancements, as municipalities respond to heightened demand. Industry insiders argue that the sheer volume of new EV owners will generate organic advocacy through word-of-mouth and real-world demonstrations of the technology’s viability.

Irony in the Incentive’s Demise

Ironically, the rebate’s expiration could force manufacturers to innovate more aggressively on cost reduction, a point emphasized in recent coverage by Detroit Free Press. Without the crutch of federal aid, companies like General Motors and Rivian are already pivoting toward cheaper battery chemistries and streamlined production, aiming to compete on price alone. This mirrors historical patterns in consumer electronics, where subsidies kickstarted markets that later thrived independently.

Posts on X (formerly Twitter) reflect a mixed sentiment among users, with some lamenting the end of rebates as a blow to affordability, while others highlight how the rush is exposing more drivers to EVs’ benefits, potentially normalizing them in everyday use. For instance, discussions point to a 15% headwind in sales for 2025 but underscore long-term resilience through technological advancements.

Global Comparisons and Domestic Ripples

Looking abroad, Canada’s experience offers a cautionary yet optimistic parallel. As detailed in Electric Autonomy, provinces like Quebec have doubled down on incentives, sustaining growth, while others scaling back saw initial slumps followed by rebounds driven by private investment. In the U.S., similar dynamics are at play, with states like Texas and Florida poised for losses in the billions, according to The News Wheel, yet this could spur localized policies to fill the void.

The broader economic implications extend to jobs and supply chains. Experts cited in CBT News warn of potential disruptions in manufacturing, but they also predict that the rebate-fueled boom will leave a legacy of skilled workers and established factories, reducing dependency on imports from China.

Long-Term Adoption Catalysts

Delving deeper, the irony highlighted by GeekWire centers on behavioral economics: The deadline creates a sense of urgency that not only boosts immediate adoption but also builds a critical mass of users who influence peers. Surveys from Cox Automotive, referenced in X discussions, show dealer expectations dipping short-term but rebounding as EVs prove their worth in fuel savings and performance.

Moreover, environmental advocates argue that this shift tests the market’s maturity. With falling battery costs—down 80% since 2010, per Kiplinger—EVs are nearing price parity with gas vehicles, potentially rendering subsidies obsolete. The rush might thus serve as a bridge to a subsidy-free era, where innovation and consumer preference drive growth.

Challenges Ahead for the Industry

Still, challenges loom. The IRS’s recent clarification, as reported by NPR, allows some flexibility for deals in progress, but post-September, affordability barriers could widen disparities, particularly in rural areas with sparse charging networks. Industry groups warn of job losses in the tens of thousands if sales falter, echoing sentiments in Pickup Truck Talk.

Yet, optimists point to Singapore’s model, where rebate extensions, as covered in The Straits Times, have sustained momentum without full reliance on incentives. In the U.S., this could translate to hybrid strategies blending private incentives with public infrastructure pushes.

A Pivotal Moment for Electric Mobility

Ultimately, the end of the EV rebate represents a litmus test for the sector’s resilience. As AInvest analysis suggests, while it reverses a decade of momentum, the last-minute rush might inject enough vehicles into the ecosystem to tip the scales toward widespread acceptance. For insiders, the key will be monitoring how automakers adapt, from Tesla’s energy storage pivot amid sales headwinds—noted in X posts—to legacy players like Ford doubling down on affordable models.

This transition, fraught with uncertainty, could redefine electric mobility, proving that sometimes, the removal of a safety net forces the industry to soar on its own merits. As one analyst put it, the rebate’s sunset might just herald a brighter dawn for EVs.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-8033c0b4-2ad8-4fb9-a049-c8f531fa4615.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 18:02:51.539133

Transcript

Stephen Lacey: Jigar, you had a birthday party last night. How was it?

Jigar Shah: It was a manufactured success.

Stephen Lacey: When is your birthday actually?

Jigar Shah: It’s August 30th, but we had this party last year and people really liked it, so we did it again this year and it was even better.

Katherine Hamilton: You’re so lucky that you have a birthday in a nice month.

Jigar Shah: It is true.

Katherine Hamilton: My birthday is the middle of February and nobody celebrates my birthday.

Jigar Shah: Oh, well, now we’re going to have to make it our mission to celebrate your birthday.

Stephen Lacey: Well, good. I’m glad you were out last night, Jigar, because the later you stay out, the punchier you are, so…

Jigar Shah: Oh, no. Not good.

Stephen Lacey: Good entertainment value.

From Latitude Media, this is Open Circuit. This week, do we need a climate reset? For the last decade and a half, the loudest voices in the climate movement treated decarbonization kind of like a moral crusade. Ban gas stoves, declare emergencies, punish fossil fuel companies. But those tactics don’t lower utility bills or win durable majorities. And now, amidst a radical shift in US politics, there’s a growing call for a pragmatic reset. We’re going to look at some of the critiques and ideas for shifting strategy, plus we’re going to talk about another reset, this one in finance, Generate Capital and Greenbacker are two of the most important clean energy investors, have swapped out CEOs and they’re rethinking their strategies. What is behind the shakeup?

I’m Stephen Lacey, executive editor of Latitude Media. Welcome, all. As always, Katherine Hamilton and Jigar Shah by my side, well, virtually by my side, I guess, staring at me through a computer screen. Katherine Hamilton is the chair of 38 North Solutions. Hey there.

Katherine Hamilton: Hey.

Stephen Lacey: You’ve got some really interesting tools behind you. It looks like you’re, I don’t know, in a shaker village or something.

Katherine Hamilton: I always think it looks like a Game of Thrones, some chamber. Yeah, I put a lot of found objects in my house.

Stephen Lacey: Nice. Where do you go find those?

Katherine Hamilton: Tool sheds on my property.

Stephen Lacey: Well, you’re not at Climate Week, but it sounded like a busy week for you. You ventured down from the mountains into the city.

Katherine Hamilton: I did very briefly, but I was so jealous because I kept seeing all the cool reports coming out of Climate Week where y’all were.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, big week. Always a big week. Jigar Shah is the co-founder of Multiplier. He’s the former director of DOE’s Loan Programs Office. How is New York Climate Week this year, Jigar? It’s often called like a mini-cop because you’ve got tens of thousands of people flocking to the city, you’ve got the UN General Assembly. Did it feel any different than past years, given the political circumstances?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I do think people are very hopeful. I think they’re probably mistaking that for defiant. When I talk to people, the level of clarity around what they want to invest in and what gives them the most sort of confidence in this moment seems lacking. And so there was a lot of great conversations around where the federal nexus is and where you can actually continue to deploy at scale and some of the things that are going on around us, like the governors who all gave big speeches at the PJM Conference on Monday. And so I think there’s a lot of those conversations. I’d say that there were less international conversations, the rooms that I were in, but it was great.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, it kind of depends on the room you’re in because you can have a choose your own adventure experience at New York Climate Week. You can go to lots of events around solutions, infrastructure, energy. A lot of the stuff that we talk about here, you could follow along with the formal UN process where countries this year were handing in their pledges late. You can get as doomery as you want too. You can go to events like the Make Billionaires Pay March that happened this week that kind of blended a coalition of anti-ICE, anti-capitalism, pro-Palestinian, and anti-fossil fuel activism. That always feels a little confusing to me. And so that actually is a good backdrop for what I want to talk about today. There’s this growing set of critiques around pieces of the climate movement and calls for a reset in how we negotiate around climate policy and actually message around this stuff.

So I want to talk about that. That’s a big part of the conversation. But I want to turn first to a story unfolding in the world of clean energy finance, a shakeup of sorts. Two of the leading firms, Generate Capital and Greenbacker have new CEOs, and they’re pledging strategic redirection. Generate is also reportedly discussing an IPO, perhaps as a new way to raise capital. Jigar co-founded Generate. And we’ve been talking about this and he says that the changes that these two companies reflect some signs of challenges in the market. Let’s start with these two firms, Jigar. Why do they matter? What is the background on how they were structured?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, it’s a good question and maybe on the outset, we should start with the fact that these companies have raised a lot of money and that money has been deployed into projects and those projects generate cash flows. So neither one of the companies is on the verge of bankruptcy or anything like that. They’re making money, people are getting paid. All of that stuff is occurring. But when you look at investment firms, they really are defined by their ability to raise more money. And right now, both of them are having a hard time raising more money. And so to get to your question, Greenbacker was created because there seemed to be a hole in the marketplace for an ability for retail investors to invest in clean energy. There were a lot of people who were banks or pension funds who could invest in renewable energy. But if you wanted to put $50,000 of your own money into something and just get a 6% dividend yield back, there was not a lot of options.

And so you had to be what they call an accredited investor to invest in clean energy. And so most people are not accredited, which is generally having a 2 to $3 million net worth, including your home value. So the way that Greenbacker did that was they filed with the SEC as if they were going public, but they never actually listed on an exchange. And so your shares are not easily traded every day. It’s not on the stock market, but you’ve gone through an SEC approval process such that you can market to retail investors. And then with Generate Capital, there was a recognition that when you have a standard GP/LP structure, general partner, limited partner structure, that you have to tell the limited partners exactly how you’re going to invest that money before they give it to you. It’s really detailed.

And in the clean energy space, being that detailed is very hard because the market changes every year. And so getting yourself the ultimate flexibility to be able to do these kinds of investments is very hard within that structure. So Generate decided to become a C corp. So in Generate’s case, all of the investors are just shareholders of Generate Capital, and that money, within reason, can be used for any purposes that Generate deems in the company’s interest. And the board, which is made up of the investors, can obviously fire the CEO or tell you you want to do something different or whatever it is. But day to day, they don’t give you detailed instructions on how to invest the money.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, Jigar. So I’m curious about Generate, because I know when you were there, you spoke a lot about the investments in fuel cells and anaerobic digesters and a bunch of other project finance that seemed really smart and seemed to really scale a lot of technologies that were working. They just needed project finance. And I just wonder how our current climate and the policy direction that our country’s been going and if that has changed how they’ve invested or if they’ve kind of stuck to what you had originally started doing.

Jigar Shah: Yeah, no, that’s a good question. And so maybe to think about when you have a company like Generate Capital, you can imagine if you invest in things that are fairly low risk that everybody is doing, then the returns are also lower. And then when you want to pay everybody’s salaries who work at the company, there’s not much left over to give back to investors. So you need higher returns. And the way that we got higher returns was to invest in leading-edge technologies. You tried to avoid bleeding-edge technologies, but you tried to be on the leading-edge. Those are people who really couldn’t get money from traditional sources of capital because like we discussed before, it wasn’t in their mandate.

So think anaerobic digesters, think battery storage, when we funded STEM back in 2014, 2015, there were a lot of different asset classes that we can go through. But part of that is also representing those asset classes into other conversations. So like with fuel cells for instance, they qualified for a 30% tax credit, but you could imagine none of the traditional tax credit investors wanted to do tax equity for fuel cells. So it took me two years to get the fuel cell companies to get tier one tax equity providers to even pay attention to them.

And as a result, Generate was able to invest at a rate that was a much higher rate of return upfront. We took the risk that we could find a tax credit buyer, and when we did, the returns that we were left with were much higher because tax equity comes in at a pretty low cost of capital. And what we were left with had a much higher cost of capital than expected, similar to anaerobic digesters where you had to figure out the renewable natural gas marketplace and the California low carbon fuel standard credits and all of this complexity. And so the question becomes, first of all, who should figure out this complexity for brand new business models? And then once you’ve figured out that complexity, can you hand it off to lower risk capital? Because when you do that, then the assets that you’re holding become even more valuable.

Stephen Lacey: Okay. So that’s really helpful background. So why are we talking about these two firms? David Crane, the former CEO of NRG, undersecretary of infrastructure at DOE when you were there, is now taking over as CEO. Greenbacker just announced a new CEO as well, Daniel de Boer, the former head of infrastructure at the firm. Both of these moves are framed as responding to a rapidly evolving market, which is often code for market pressures. Translate this for us.

Jigar Shah: So in Greenbacker’s case, they plodded along for a long time. So they were raising $10 million a month, $5 million a month. So they weren’t raising big dollars. But they made the mistake of wanting to invest in low-risk assets, so think solar and wind assets. And then by the time you paid for all the salaries at the senior level, they really could only pay a 3%, 3.5% return. But instead of telling their investors that, what they did was when solar comes back with money, they come back both in principle and in debt. So you might get 10% of your money back every year, some of which is paying back the mortgage, and some of which is the interest on the mortgage. And so if you’re paying people a 6% dividend yield out of that 10%, well, then that means you don’t have a lot left over to invest in new projects. So that means that over time, you just get smaller and smaller and smaller.

And then around 2020 with the ESG boom, they went to Morgan Stanley and Morgan Stanley just put a huge amount of money behind them. So I think it was maybe 2 or $3 billion that came in in a very short period of time and they figured out how to put it to work. Obviously, it took a little bit of time, but they also did, I think, a really large project with Hecate. And so they’re now in the process of getting that done. So Dan has come in really just to get them fixed up, like what’s working, what’s not working, which projects were maintained properly, which ones weren’t. But the fundamentals of Greenbacker are still flawed because if you actually are promising investors 6% returns, you have, let’s call it 3% of the returns that have to go to pay everybody’s salaries, well, then you need to make 9% to actually stay breakeven. And that doesn’t come from low-risk solar and wind assets.

So they recently wrote down their portfolio by 30%. So that means if it was worth 2 billion before, it’s now worth 1.4 billion. And they have to decide can they go out and raise more money? But you can imagine that one of the roles that they’re playing even in the solar and wind space is to do weird, funky stuff. So if somebody was doing a one-off wind turbine in the back of their factory, which we saw in California for years, or if people are doing new models of community solar that tried to work closely with environmental justice groups or whatever, then you can imagine very large sophisticated buyers of those assets might be like, “That’s too one off. We don’t want to deal with that $10 million project.” And so Greenbacker could play that role. But I think after 12 years or so of being in business, they still haven’t really found their way. And so they switched CEOs to try to really fix what’s broken.

Katherine Hamilton: So Daniel de Boer came from their infrastructure arm. So how does that change the way they may be thinking about their portfolio going forward?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, it doesn’t, and that’s what scares me. I think the world of Dan and I think the world of Carl Weatherley-White, who I’ve known for years, who I think has come in as CFO, but the challenge with Greenbacker fundamentally is they have to find ways of doing funky stuff, even if they’re only comfortable with solar and wind, that generates that return, which is the promised return to investors, plus the cost of running the platform. And if they can’t do that, then they’re constantly giving people money back that actually was slated to be reinvested into new projects. And so then that means that you’re not long for the world. And so I think in this moment where we’re trying to grow the market for clean energy, there is a mainstream set of boxes. So as you know, whether it’s Brookfield or an Exterra or all these other big players who buy projects, they have very sophisticated boxes and they want 100 pieces of paper that proves that you’ve done this and proves that you’ve done that, and et cetera, et cetera.

And if you’re not that person, if you’re not a developer that can give them 100 pieces of paper or it’s not cost-effective for you to put it together because your project is $10 million and 100 pieces of paper might cost $1 million to put together, then where do you go for alternative financing? And to date, it’s been family offices maybe or other people. And those people are like, “Well, I can put my money anywhere, so I think I’m going to put it over here where I can make a lot more than over here.” And so that’s why we had the GGRF, which is now obviously not in existence. And so when you think about the total amount of financing solutions that our country needs to be able to onboard all of this extraordinary effort that developers are putting forward to get to churches, to get food banks done, to get fire stations, solar systems, to get police officers what they need. Whatever it is that people are doing with this great technology we’ve invented, there has to be an appropriate investor available for them to go to.

Stephen Lacey: And can you go into a little bit more detail about what has been plaguing Generate and how that compares to Greenbacker’s challenges?

Jigar Shah: So Greenbacker never tried to do leading-edge stuff. Generate really was very successful at doing leading-edge stuff. So when you think about all the anaerobic digesters they funded, they just reopened the Cayuga facility in New York, which is the largest food waste digester that processes food waste there. I just heard that they process a lot of White Claws that were mislabeled and had to be crushed. And so there is hundreds of thousands-

Stephen Lacey: Is that White Claw, the alcoholic seltzer?

Jigar Shah: Exactly, exactly. So when I was at Generate, we used to take all the ice cream from Unilever’s facilities. They’d always have a bad batch of ice cream and then they’d have to get rid of it. And for these food companies-

Stephen Lacey: You’ve got White Claws and ice cream. Perfect for your birthday party.

Jigar Shah: That’s what we do. So there are hundreds of thousands of tons of this food waste. So most the time, the plant is running great, but one batch goes bad, what do you do with it? And for a lot of these large corporations, they’ve committed to scope two and scope three emissions reductions. And so putting food waste in landfills, which then release methane is not good for them. So they needed a place for it to get processed. And so we put in money into a bunch of facilities and there was London, Ontario, and then there was the UK and other places, and I think they probably put a couple hundred million dollars to work into what they did. Those made very, very nice returns. I think that’s great.

But over time, what happened was they ended up with 38 people in their capital markets team and their capital markets team went out to the marketplace and said, “Hey, we have all this stuff to sell.” And the people that they went to said, “Well, that’s interesting, but what we really would love is boring community solar.” And so Generate said, “Well, maybe we should do more boring community solar.”, which they did, which is great, but then they don’t get 16 to 18% returns on boring community solar. So they did some funky financial stuff, which is fine. Lots of people do that. I think it was well within the risk tolerance, and then interest rates started going up, and when interest rates started going up, your equity returns go down because the debt actually takes more of the return.

And so now, Generate Capital has made far lower returns on low-risk assets than they made on their higher-risk, higher-reward assets. And so as a result, they’ve had a really hard time raising money the last two years because people are like, “Well, you’ve invested in low-risk stuff and haven’t given us high returns, and so why would we give you more money?” And so it’s one of those things where I think that the difficulty of the business model was the point. And when their capital markets group, which got very bloated, decided that they wanted to do easier stuff and they wanted to raise money for easier stuff, well, then they didn’t meet the returns.

Stephen Lacey: So does this mean, given the changes of focus at these two companies, that we are going to see capital limitations in the market?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, most certainly. Right? And that’s why you-

Stephen Lacey: How acute are those capital limitations?

Jigar Shah: Well, you saw that Chris Anderson of TED Fame announced a big conference. Well, he announced a big fund, a $300 million fund for doing this missing middle stuff. And then he announced a big conference, I think he’s doing this weekend in California to try to get people focused on putting more money into this missing middle. But it’s a big deal. When you think about the Loan Programs Office, we probably had $350 billion or so of unprocessed loans that were submitted to Loan Programs Office for review. But when I left, so those projects are presumably real that folks were seeking debt for. And then you have all the folks who are looking for grants out of the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations or the MASC office or the Great Deployment Office or others.

And so when you think about the quantum of capital at writ large that people want for all of these sectors and clean cement and clean steel and heat batteries, and you tell me which sector, but there’s tons of them, it’s at least $100 billion if not more. And if you count up Wollemi and Spring Lane and Ultra and a few other folks, that’s maybe a billion. And so it’s not even close to the need that we have. And so all these companies have done this extraordinary work of getting through venture rounds and getting to their first of a kind project and all this other stuff, and now we need them to be part of the gigaton scale climate reductions and they’re under capitalized.

Stephen Lacey: This is an indication of why this sector is so difficult. If we continue to have trouble funding this missing middle and we have these capital constraints, what does that mean for overall carbon reduction goals and thinking about these critical sectors?

Jigar Shah: So right now, people are talking about China being the electrostate, right? But let’s be clear about what they’re really doing. They’ve scaled up solar, they’ve scaled up lithium-ion batteries and LFP batteries. They have scaled up nuclear plant deployments. These are all technologies that were shared with the Chinese during the Obama administration. And so we’re talking about electrostate technology scale up of stuff that was shared with them during the Obama administration. Now that’s awesome, and we are going to continue to grow around the world and China is selling some of those equipment to Ethiopia and Pakistan and lots of places around the world. But at some point, we’re going to need to move to heat and we’re going to have to move to clean steel and we’re going to have to move to clean cement. And you know who’s not doing that right now? China. And so the real question is when and where are all of these technologies going to scale up?

And I’m hopeful that the UK gets there with the National Wealth Fund or GB Energy. I’m hopeful that the EU figures out what it wants to do with its policies or Australia. I saw Saul Griffith this week and near Climate Week, and he’s trying to get people there. They want to do green iron because Australia is known for just selling rocks and they want to do more value added work on the continent. So making lithium processing a priority or making green iron or whatever it is. But those technology companies are all in the United States. And so the question is that do they want to scale up here? Do they want to go to Australia to scale up? Are they going to just give their technology away in bankruptcy to China? Exactly how do we roll out the next generation of decarbonization technologies, which were probably admittedly 10 years away from really getting scaled up?

Stephen Lacey: All right, let’s turn now to our main story. I think it’s the perfect time to stocktake, as the UN climate parlance goes, on how we’re talking about climate, what the climate movement looks like and pathways forward in the current environment. And to kick off our next segment, I want to play a piece of tape from Donald Trump giving his speech this week to the UN General Assembly in New York. And this was happening right as tens of thousands of people were convening around the city for Climate Week.

Donald Trump: But we’re not letting this happen in America. In 1982, the executive director of the United Nations Environmental Program predicted that by the year 2000, climate change would cause a global catastrophe. He said that it will be irreversible as any nuclear holocaust would be. This is what they said at the United Nations. What happened? Here we are. Another UN official stated in 1989 that within a decade, entire nations could be wiped off the map by global warming. Not happening. It used to be global cooling. If you look back years ago in the 1920s and the 1930s, they said, “Global cooling will kill the world. We have to do something.” Then they said, “Global warming will kill the world.” But then it started getting cooler.

So now they just call it climate change because that way, they can’t miss. It’s climate change because if it goes higher or lower, whatever the hell happens, there’s climate change. It’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world in my opinion. Climate change, no matter what happens, you’re involved in that. No more global warming, no more global cooling. All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.

Stephen Lacey: I wanted to hear that tape for a couple reasons. One, I don’t think you could ask for a more direct example of how dark and twisted the politics of climate are right now in America at the highest levels. But two, Trump is hinting at something that reflects an actual critique of a very vocal contingency, the doomers. And since the 2010s, the loudest message from progressive groups pushing policy action on climate change has been focused on worst case scenarios. And out of that, a deeply moral approach to policy advocacy. And that approach, at least among the most visible climate organizations, groups like the Sunrise Movement, 350.org, Greta Thunberg’s FridaysForFuture, the Extinction Rebellion, meant that for them, the only reasonable option was blocking fossil fuels, creating radical and social equity, and pushing this narrative that we add only 10 years to avert catastrophic impacts.

And if Donald Trump’s speech at the UN tells us anything, it’s that that strategy didn’t work. And I’m certainly not suggesting that you can draw a straight line between the election of Trump and the failure of the climate movement. Of course not. But they’re actually not that far from each other. Trump was elected in part because voters felt like they had felt like the left had abandoned kitchen table economic issues in favor of other causes, and they weren’t focused enough on solving problems. I think that is an important factor in the last election. And instead of building this kind of durable majority that activists thought they were, they were often alienating voters who have increasingly been worried about paying rent, affording gas, keeping the lights on. And this is where the idea of this pragmatic reset comes in.

Michael Liebreich has a really phenomenal essay in Bloomberg, this two-part essay. And in it, he argues that we need to stop making people feel guilty, stop obsessing over the climate apocalypse, and take a much more pragmatic approach to the framework for how we talk about and present climate change and the actual climate talks themselves. And Alex Trembath from the Breakthrough Institute had an essay out earlier this year where he argued that the era of the Climate Hawk is over. And he also argues that centering politics around existential threats and moral urgency has polarized the issue and hitched climate to progressive identity politics. And so I think this is just a really interesting time to grapple with this question. Do we need a complete reset on climate, both in coalition building and in policy? And I’ll turn to you first, Katherine. What do you think of, how do you buy the critique that I just outlined?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I’ve thought a lot about this because I listened to Liebreich, both his part one and part two of his essay, which part one tried to say, “Here’s the math we got to use to think of what’s next.” And then part two is like, “Here are the things we need to actually do for a reset.” And I also started thinking about what was happening in New York with all of the protesters, with people protesting a number of things. It wasn’t just one thing. And my sensibility has always been you need people on both sides to get to the middle. So it’s great that there’s a pragmatic approach that you can take, and we should go through and dissect what that is and what that might look like. But I don’t think you get there unless you have the left flank as well and have that pushing so that you have a middle.

Because right now, you have a president who’s out there claiming that climate is a total hoax, you have the left trying to demonstrate against a wide variety of things because there is a lot going on right now that people are protesting, and then the pragmatic approach is coming to the middle. And I think you have to have both sides to be able to come into the middle. So I think Liebreich is not wrong that this is a good time to think about that because we need to come together with what are some pragmatic solutions? That’s a good thing to think through, but you don’t get to a negotiation and a middle unless you have both sides to push back on. So for me, that’s the setup.

Stephen Lacey: I generally agree with that. I guess the question is how it filters into politics. The Democratic Party itself has a really deep problem, and many Americans felt like the Democratic Party had aligned way too closely with this progressive social agenda and rather than these kitchen table issues. And so to me, it depends on how folks who are focused on climate on the left align with the activist agenda.

Katherine Hamilton: I actually think that’s an issue of narrative and messaging because if you look at all of the bills that passed, that were essentially climate bills that passed during the Biden administration, the CHIPS Act, the Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure bill, those were all really pragmatic solutions that dealt with kitchen table issues. But that was not what the narrative was. And I think that’s where things failed because that’s not… The narrative should have been super inclusive about this is actually going to affect your price of eggs. And now we’re seeing that happen. You take the stuff away, it is going to impact everything in your life and the affordability issues. But I think that a lot of that was not about the actual content, but about the narrative and messaging.

Stephen Lacey: Definitely. Yeah, Jigar, what do you make of the premise?

Jigar Shah: Yeah, I tend to agree with Katherine as we’ve talked about, I think on our collective podcast for 10 plus years. I think that-

Stephen Lacey: Agree meaning that you need that flank?

Jigar Shah: Well, I’ll give you an example that’s extreme. I’ve never criticized Mark Jacobson over his a hundred percent wind, solar, and hydro thing, even though I know that it’s completely freaking impossible to do anything that he’s suggesting. But there’s a lot of people who are inspired by his work, and that’s how we got a lot of the renewable portfolio standards passed at the state level. And so do I need to come out and slay his message? No. But in closed doors, I’m telling people we need a lot of clean firm power generation. And so that includes nuclear and includes geothermal, it includes other stuff. So I think the part that all these Monday morning quarterbacks misunderstand is getting to 48 votes in the Senate for the Inflation Reduction Act was virtually impossible. I think people don’t understand how diverse the Democratic Party is broadly and how important the left flank was to get Sheldon Whitehouse and Bernie Sanders to agree on something.

And so yes, they fell short of 50, they only got 48. And then you had a very pragmatic negotiation that didn’t include the environmental groups or other left flank folks from January of 2022 through August of 2022, that was only Joe Manchin, and to some degree, Kyrsten Sinema. And they passed the bill that, as Katherine suggested, was really damn pragmatic. But I just think that people don’t understand how politics works. They just want to Monday morning quarterback the narrative at the end. And look, Donald Trump has been a master of narrative. Look, I don’t love that he’s a master of the narrative, but he is. And Biden in particular was not. He certainly wasn’t doing press releases every day and press conferences every day and all the things that a president frankly has to do because while I loved Secretary Granholm, she is no stand-in for the President of the United States. And so that narrative just didn’t get done because Joe Biden wasn’t giving it.

So I just think that some of this stuff is a little too much. That being said, we’ve always agreed with these two pieces on balance within our podcast. The notion that you were going to go to the American people and say, “This is only going to cost you a little bit more, but we’re going to save the planet.” was always a terrible narrative. It was terrible for Waxman-Markey and it’s terrible now. And it doesn’t have to be the case because we have all of these extraordinary technologies that actually are the most affordable way to meet this load growth moment in this particular case and the fastest way to meet this load growth moment in this particular way.

And so we don’t have to sacrifice. For the first time in my entire career, there is no sacrifice needed. You get the most affordable solution and the fastest solution. And that should be celebrated. And I think that to Katherine’s point, the left and the doomers played some role in getting the urgency there. And all of us technocrats had a very important role in actually doing the work to get the technologies lined up and the money in there and projects built on Walmart stores and whatever it is that got the cost down.

Stephen Lacey: Katherine, how do you think the progressive climate activist wing influenced policy headed toward the IRA? In 2018, the Sunrise Movement broke out with this congressional sit-in, AOC came and visited them and praised them. There was this viral moment where they were all holding up their green jobs for everyone now signs and AOC sort of gave them the momentum they needed, and the Sunrise Movement eventually became a very influential student-led group. And the argument was that they really did create, they forced Pelosi and others to start talking about climate change in the 2018-2019 era that eventually led to the negotiations around the IRA. Is that accurate to you?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I think it did really stress the urgency and also showed that there were young people who really cared and cared enough to go and try to meet with her and to make a point of it. Of course, in the end, they were not completely happy with what the outcome was. But that may have never been the case, but it did raise it as an issue, and it was something that had been percolating since Waxman-Markey had failed in favor of healthcare during the Obama administration. And that was probably the right choice. Everybody needs healthcare, so maybe that was the right choice, but the tactics had changed and also the energy had changed around it.

So I think it was really important that they did that and that they kept the pressure on because that forced the discussion. And maybe everybody didn’t get what they wanted out of the bill, but it definitely led, I think, to climate action. And I also think there are provisions in the Inflation Reduction Act that may not have happened without those folks like low-income adders and being able to focus on communities that most need the help. I don’t know that any of that would’ve happened without that pressure.

Jigar Shah: Yeah. One other thing I would say is that as somebody who has been on boards of environmental groups and other things for a long time, we are in a weird place right now, right? Because the cleantech sector has really abrogated its entire responsibility in developing its own political infrastructure. We sort of put together CEA and then AWEA and then that became ACP, but we were really borrowing the political infrastructure from the environmental groups for many, many years. So when you think about whipping votes in state legislatures or whipping votes in the federal government and in Congress, a lot of those were environmental folks who had been around for a long time, and then they had C3 organizations and C4 organizations that could lobby and all these other things. And so it’s only now that the cleantech sector is actually recognizing that borrowing the environmental group’s political infrastructure is probably not the right call.

And in some ways, I think that’s probably what Alex Trembath is really suggesting is that the cleantech sector is sort of saying that we’re in lockstep with the environmental groups, which is not always a good thing. And frankly, probably 40% of the cleantech sector’s employees voted for Trump. And so it’s not really the right methodology by which to get our stuff done. And so now you see the cleantech sector actually building its own political rails and funding its own candidates and putting all these things together and the environmental groups are going to have to figure out what it wants to do because it’s not clear to me that being pro stuff is what the environmental groups do.

In general, they raise a lot of money when they’re against stuff. That’s what activates their base. That’s how they get lots of $50 donations, is PFAS, and figuring out how to shut down coal plants, and doing all this other stuff. Building tons of batteries and solar, it’s hard for them to raise money on that stuff. And so I think part of our challenge is they have frankly been big warriors and they’ve been doing things that I’m not sure was part of necessarily their business model because the cleantech sector wasn’t doing it. Now the cleantech sector has decided it should do it, and I think we’ll be better off for the environmental groups pushing what they care about and the cleantech sector pushing what they care about.

Stephen Lacey: I want to dissect Alex Trembath’s argument quickly. So his argument is that climate hawkism failed politically. That for more than a decade, climate hawks and activists tried to put this existential threat and moral urgency at the center of politics, and that they want attention but not durable majorities. And that climate has never cracked the top tier of voter priorities, that the efforts to raise salience actually polarized the issue instead of broadening support. And then the path forward is this pragmatism we’ve been talking about, which is climate change is of course real and serious, but it’s best addressed indirectly by focusing on things that people care about, like energy abundance, affordability, resilience, innovation, and that climate outcomes should be more of a co-benefit, not the centerpiece. What do you make of his critique of climate hawkism specifically?

Jigar Shah: The thing that I worry about with that entire line of argumentation is it just feels like pontification by Monday morning quarterbacks. For folks who actually have to lift heavyweights all the way up the mountain and actually get stuff done, that is not how anything works. Going into the middle and saying, “We’re not going to talk about climate. We’re only going to talk about the benefits of our technology, and we’re just going to be a pro-technology argument, and we just want R&D and we just want innovation.” That’s why we’re 20 years behind. This is the Bjorn Lomborg crap that we’ve been dealing with for a long time, which is that the technologies aren’t ready to deploy at scale. Let’s keep investing in R&D. And it turned out that investing heavily into the deployment of technologies is what dropped the costs so precipitously. It wasn’t more R&D. More R&D is also always welcome. But what we want to do is actually get people to deploy stuff at scale.

Now, the question becomes can you get people to deploy stuff at scale while staying completely under the radar screen and not using climate as an argument? Which is kind of what Alex is saying. I don’t know. How did that work out for nuclear power? Not very well. And so now, the Trump administration is weaponizing nuclear power and maybe they’ll get 10 AP1000s under construction, maybe not. But when you think about how nuclear power has tried to stay under the radar screen since 2008, and very few of them have actually gotten deployed, it didn’t work that well. I think that some of the things that we do, you can say is a hype cycle within the capitalist system, too much money going into AI, but before too much money going into hydrogen or whatever it is.

And some of it is actually supported by the fact that climate hawks were the ones who convinced the capitalists that this was a hype cycle and that they should dump a bunch of money into it. And so I just think that he gets too cute by saying that I want this part of the menu, but not this part of the menu. And I think we would’ve had the exact same results technologically and crowding and capital and all that stuff if we just had done the stuff that fits my gluten-free vegan, sort of like [inaudible 00:43:49].

Katherine Hamilton: Hey, don’t knock gluten-free.

Stephen Lacey: I think we’re about to test it right now. No one is talking about climate, and we are going to see how the conversation progresses, given that people are going to be talking about affordability, reliability, resilience, and so all the things that-

Jigar Shah: No, that’s not a test.

Stephen Lacey: Why is it not a test? It’s-

Jigar Shah: Because remember, what I’m claiming is that we would not be in this situation where all of our technologies are fully affordable and we can get away with just the affordability message if we had not participated in climate hawkism the last 10 or 20 years.

Stephen Lacey: But you don’t think that the business community would’ve just innovated anyway? That there’s a contingency of entrepreneurs and investors who wouldn’t have been driving it forward without that messaging?

Katherine Hamilton: Oh, yeah. Who got all the regulation in place for tailpipe emissions and power plant emissions? If we hadn’t had the climate hawks, that wouldn’t have happened, and that opened up markets for clean energy. So that actually created the space for these new technologies to be able to pencil out. So I absolutely disagree with that premise. I also think there are voters who are single-issue voters. So I just don’t think it’s true that people are only going to vote on affordability. Maybe that’s the bulk right now. But there are climate voters. Just as there are pro-choice voters, there are people that that is their only issue that they care about, and I don’t think that that will necessarily change.

Now, some of the things, if you think of it like, “Oh, I’m just going to have a rational read of what Alex Trembath says, which by the way, if you read it, you’ll get very… And if you care about climate, you’ll get emotional reading it. So the best way to do it is to get ChatGPT to just summarize it because then it’s very dispassionate and it takes all of the tone that he loves to use out of it. But he’s saying that climate hawk era is over, that climate should be de-centered politically, but politics has room for a lot of issues as I just said. There are a lot of people who vote for a number of things, and climate mitigation can be a very happy side effect of driving down affordability and increasing jobs as Jigar has talked about forever. And then critiquing all the climate targets. Well, if you don’t have climate targets, what are you working for? What are you working toward?

And so it’s important for everybody to have a goal, even if it’s something you’re not going to be able to meet, you have a goal and you take steps to get there. And then this cultural backlash, making it a cultural issue is really tough because there are only certain people who want it to be a cultural issue. If you can de-culturize it and just have it be about the health and well-being of humans on this planet, I think you’ll be able to still make your arguments and still move ahead even if you just care about climate.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, but the climate activists marching at Climate Week are leaning into the culture wars. They’re making it about everything, every social justice issue possible, and I just do not see how that is at all a winning message in this current environment. And I think if Democrats take their cues from that or people who are generally supporting climate policy regardless of which party they’re in, if anyone is taking cues from that, it will not land.

Jigar Shah: Sure. But remember, at Charlie Kirk’s funeral, the president said that, “I actually hate my opponents.” versus other people. So you have culture wars on that side, which I don’t think other people should be participating in. Look, the fact that people do and say things that I don’t think is fully reasoned through your lens and my lens doesn’t mean that I hate them for expressing their free speech rights. And I just think that people don’t… Look, the weird thing is about Alex, is that I’ve probably been the most effective communicator of eco modernism without believing in it of anybody in the entire 25-year history of his institution. And so I only use economic messages or pollution messages or other stuff because it works for me in the companies that I work with and the technologies I’m putting forward. But to not recognize how the actual political process works and not how moments get created and how things become memes and things become viral like Greta, do I wish Greta never existed? Of course I don’t. Like, oh, my goodness.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I’m certainly not saying that.

Jigar Shah: No, but that is kind of what he’s saying. He’s saying, “I wish that this had never been politicized. I wish that these people had never actually broken through. I wish that these things were just completely dispassionate.” I get it. We all wish that we just lived lives of quiet-like amplitude, but that’s not the world we live in. We agreed for social media companies to exist. Now, you’ve got all this screaming going on on Facebook or on Twitter or on Bluesky or whatever it is. We live in the world we’re in, and the notion that people are like, “Gosh, I wish everyone was as boring as I am.” No. No, no, no. That is not the world we live in. And so I don’t know why I want to engage in something that just is nonsensical.

Stephen Lacey: I think it’s a really helpful conversation. I don’t think it’s nonsensical. I think it’s the perfect time to be having this conversation. So let’s go into some of Liebreich’s other views on what this pragmatic climate reset looks like. Katherine, what are some others that resonated with you?

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, I’ll tick down… He had eight things that he wants to reset on and we can dive into any of these, but resetting climate politics, we’ve talked about that. How do you get to the center on the politics without guilt-based messaging? Sure, let’s do better messaging. Resetting climate targets, he says they should be more reasonable. You got to have climate targets, so figure out what those are. Reset energy priorities. So he’s allow for some flexible gas plants so that you can at least use those for peaking and not for baseload, and you don’t have a bunch of stranded assets. He isn’t saying you need to not do renewables. I think he’s just saying to be a little more flexible. Reset hydrogen expectations. If two people are trying to decide whether to invest in hydrogen, just send Michael Liebreich into the room who will say, he will say, “This was the stupidest idea in stupidville.” Which is exactly what he said in that article. He hates hydrogen so much. Reset diplomacy, and we may want to talk about that and dig into the COPs and how do those work.

And reset science scenarios. He has some arguments about how some of those are outdated and need to be re-upped. That would be great if we can all get on the same page on that. The US right now is not in the mood to do that, but that would be great to do. Reset finance and ESG to sort of take ESGs not as a separate piece of the puzzle, but as part of the full financial system. And also make governments be more in charge of regulation. Unfortunately, right now, our government is not doing that. And then reset policy and regulation to try to have more of a value for money test where the value is in the climate reduction. These all seem really rational, pragmatic ideas. The issue is like how do we then execute on those?

Stephen Lacey: Yeah, I thought he has really good ideas for how to change the climate negotiations process, which is really relevant, given the UN assembly this week. There were a couple of ideas that stood out to me. One was basically shrink the circus of climate talks, hold it with a much smaller number of people, focus on concrete deals in very specific industries like in steel, cement, shipping, energy. Don’t try to hash out these economy-wide, one-size-fits-all targets. Take the land use and agriculture piece and forestry out of the conversation and make it its own convention because the politics and culture of land are so much different than many of the other industrial conversations.

And then really revisit this idea of loss and damages. He argues that it doesn’t make sense to create a duplicate aid system where losses from specific climate events can’t be clearly tied with emissions, with scientific certainty, and that there’s a lot of energy that goes into that system that doesn’t make sense. And I think that clearly paring down these negotiations and making them about very specific deals in specific industries really resonates with me. Jigar, were there any that stood out to you of how to change the way we’re engaging in this negotiations process?

Jigar Shah: I don’t know that I had a lot of great insights on the negotiation process, but I totally agree with the circus. Honestly, I haven’t gone to a cop since I was forced to when I ran the [inaudible 00:53:07] and good riddance, the Biden administration tried to get me to go to COPs, and I was like, “Hell no.” I don’t know why I would go. Because this is the thing, I totally agree. I’m not a negotiator. I don’t know that I necessarily even care about the text that’s coming out of the negotiations. I’m pretty sure I’ve never really read an article in the last 10 years around what’s happening in the text and what’s happening in this and that and whatever. I think in general, it is orthogonal to what I’m doing on the cleantech side.

I totally agree with Michael, which is that these processes, which are deeply consultive and very difficult diplomatic efforts are really valuable on land use. Just so important. When you think about what we do with the rainforest or palm oil in Indonesia or some of these other things that are occurring, even in the United States, when you think about what’s happening under our current administration, I do think that our protection of land is going down in a really big way. And I do think that that conversation matters a lot. And so I hope that they take him up on that offer. I think the other challenge you have, and agree with him on the loss and damage piece, is that it is most certainly the case that we are changing the way that the globe operates, whether it’s weather patterns or sea level rise or other things. And there are going to be places around the world that are less and less habitable. Even in the United States, you can’t even get home insurance anymore in the state of Florida.

And so you’re in this weird spot where we need real solutions to these challenges. And just having a transfer of money from the United States to XYZ country doesn’t solve the underlying problem, which is around insurance and how insurance markets work. We had this conversation a little bit with our friend from JPMorgan where I was like, “Well, if these are all these issues, why are you not sending a letter to all of the homeowners saying your house is definitely going to be a problem in seven years?” And she’s like, “Well, I haven’t gotten permission to do that yet.” I get it. But I just think that there’s a way to have these conversations and a way to have a positive influence on reducing the worst possible impacts on humans around the world. And I don’t think that that comes through in any way that is actionable through the current COP process.

Katherine Hamilton: Yeah, and the funds that have been set up have just been absolutely unworkable. You talk to any developing country. And the definition of developing country may need to be shifted a little bit as well, but those countries are not getting what they need and in the format that they need it. So they’re saying, a lot of smaller countries are saying, “Yeah, we would love to be able to build clean resources. We can’t build any resources right now because the fund doesn’t work for us.” So trying to figure out how to restructure that in a way that’s really workable, it’s caused a lot of people a lot of gray hair. But I think that’s something that would be really important. And Liebreich says countries should be focused on their own decarbonization and their own economic growth and benefit. Well, maybe if developing countries did that and put some muscle into it, then they would have the extra cash to be able to help to both be a leader and innovate, but also to have some extra funds to be able to show the pathway for countries that don’t have the resources that they need.

Stephen Lacey: Yeah. He basically argues that we should get rid of that entire rich-poor framework because as he argues, that many developing countries, they have skyscrapers, space programs, global companies, wealthy elites, and meanwhile, these supposedly rich countries are still full of people with stagnant wages, living in a cost-of-living crisis. And the best thing, as you said, Katherine, that we can do is having rich countries lead by example and that decarbonize their own economies while preserving standards of living. And he says I think, “If they fail at home, then no amount of climate finance will matter abroad.” And I generally agree with that.

Jigar Shah: Just to be clear though, Stephen, I don’t think the vast majority of the world believes in that, even though I think they need to make that shift. I’m a senior fellow at the World Resources Institute. They have all these people who focus on blended finance and climate finance and all this stuff. It’s been something that people worked on for 20 years. Part of why I joined as a senior fellow is to convince people that frankly, mainstream capital flows are flowing at such large rates right now that it dwarfs blended finance.

When you think about what happened in Pakistan the last two years, not a single drop of blended finance or climate finance or development bank finance went into Pakistan. All of that money was for-profit money, all of it for the last two years. And so you’re just starting to see that as Katherine’s suggesting, that a lot of these well-intentioned programs just have not worked. They have not crowded in other capital, they have not done the skills transfer that I think people expected them to do. And so at some point, we just have to throw out things that didn’t work.

Stephen Lacey: Okay. So imagine you are a young person looking at how they can make the biggest impact right now. Could be in activism, could be in business, could be anywhere. What do you think would be the highest impact way they could spend their time on something climate related? Katherine, where would you devote your focus?

Katherine Hamilton: It’s such a funny question because at Cornell, that’s exactly what they asked me. And they had students from every type of school, every discipline, and I kind of said, “Do what you do from where you are. There are a bunch of you that are engineers, engineer. There’re a bunch of you that are scientists and researchers, do that. There’s some of you who are communications people, focus on the narrative.” Or writers writing to me is the biggest, best skill you can have. But really, you can get to it from wherever you are, find your pathway from what you love and what you’re good at. So I know that’s not a definitive answer, but I think it’s something that I can’t say to everybody, “Do policy.” That’s not right for everybody.

Jigar Shah: So I think I use the same exact answer that Katherine uses when I get asked that question. But I think maybe to give you an answer from a slightly different perspective, look, I think that there has been a 30 or 40-year effort to solve problems that are really thorny by throwing money at the problem. And I, for a long time, didn’t think that worked. But now, I definitively know that it doesn’t work. And we need to be raising a group of children today that can rethink how we accomplish our goals. That whatever discipline they want to come at it from, it can’t just be throwing money at the problem. You can’t just raise taxes more and say, “Now, this time, it’ll solve it.” Whether it’s childcare or healthcare or energy policy or climate policy or whatever it is, it can’t just be, “Here’s another feed in tariff at 47 cents a kilowatt-hour.” Or “Here’s another thing.”

It has to be, what is it at the core of our systems are holding back the ability for us to innovate within the current system? And I think that we, particularly in the West, have this ability to rise to the occasion in this moment and figure it out. I don’t want to have a top-down state like China, right? I respect China greatly, they do their thing, they have had a tremendous amount of a success in building nuclear plants, building hydro dams, whatever. I think that the way in which they accomplish that are not the trade-offs that I would want to be in that society under. I think the West has to figure out what that more balanced approach looks like. Climate happens to be the area that I’m focused on. So then there’s labor and justice and some of these other things, but I think that this is a universal problem where we’ve been thinking in a group way for 40 years and we have to break out of it.

Stephen Lacey: Those are both good answers. To get more specific, if someone who was say interested in activism or politics, creating political change, were to ask me that question, I would say find a way to do serious on-the-ground work. Find a way to make your work about influencing planning boards, zoning boards, all the local politics of building clean energy and sustainable infrastructure, because we have a deep local problem when it comes to building an energy infrastructure. And you can sort of raise awareness about climate change all you want, but if people are continually resisting this stuff, if local regulatory boards are not finding ways to build this stuff, it doesn’t matter how you talk about it, it’s just not going to get built. And more and more projects are getting caught up in this web of resistance on the local level, even among communities that theoretically should support it. And I think it’s just a growing and deep problem. And that’s where I would say is focus your attention on solving that problem.

Jigar Shah: And I think that that is still related though to the systems issue. To Katherine’s point, when you think about writing and how important writing is, we’ve lost all of our local journalism. No one’s holding a city of 3,000 people accountable for their actions. So those people can do whatever the hell they want to do. And so even if the climate solution that we’re proposing is half the price of the old solution, they’re like, “Well, but the old solution is run by my cousin and so we’re going to do it that way.” I just think that when you think about what is broken at the local level, is that the best ideas are not the ones that actually get to the top. That there’s just so much embedded resistance to change because people are like, “But that person’s been running that dealership for 40 years and he doesn’t want to add electric vehicle repair technicians.” Or whatever it is. It’s one of those things where we have somehow gotten just so sclerotic.

Stephen Lacey: Well, I think we can wrap it there. This was a good one, I think a long overdue conversation, the right week to have this conversation. Jigar, good to see you. Thanks for joining us the night after your birthday. I’m saying that with air quotes. Appreciate you doing this after a late night.

Jigar Shah: Well, I’m glad to do it, and I just want to make sure everybody recognizes that I’m still as optimistic as ever. The fact that there are no trade-offs today and that we are now the cheapest solution and the fastest solution gives me great hope that I think that this is our time.

Stephen Lacey: Absolutely. And Katherine, I know you are working on this also every day with Common Charge and thinking about how to frame this in ways that are really relevant to people’s lives, so keep at it.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-09-26T110045.891.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 20:01:01.586398

Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said he hopes their commitment to the Global Fund spurs the U.S. and other countries to step up.
International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband, who reported losing $600 million in U.S. grants, said aid is being spread too thin.","NEW YORK (AP) — A passing comment in a hotel hallway at one of the many conferences on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly’s annual high-level meetings this past week may have turned into a solution.

A global antipoverty nonprofit executive, recently returned from Zambia, mentioned that a hospital there had just one incubator, warmer and resuscitator for the fifty-some babies born daily.

The conversation could’ve ended there with an empathetic response. But in this case, leaders of a corporate-nonprofit alliance providing medical equipment to those in need heard the story. And in this case, Children International President Susana Eshleman said help may come by year’s end.

“It’s very encouraging and inspiring to be here,” she said. “It feels like a shot in the arm sometimes when the work that we’re doing is hard and the global situation, given all the recent developments, is particularly hard.”

In a year marked by significant foreign aid pullbacks from the U.S. and other wealthy countries, the exchange provides a glimpse into the unique connective tissue that still draws foundations, nonprofits, corporations and international actors to what attendees call UNGA week.

The meetings at Manhattan ballrooms and intimate townhouse dinners solidify relationships and hasten coordination, made even more impactful by the sheer number of parties. This year, attendees described more pragmatic, focused and galvanizing discussions than before, placing a greater emphasis on the roles companies and philanthropies must play in shaping an uncertain future.

Conversations, in private and on stages, would generally open with the impact of aid cuts on a particular organization, but quickly move to the group’s pivots and current needs. Former President Bill Clinton began the Clinton Global Initiative annual meeting with a list of the world’s issues currently worrying him. But he ended it with the message: “Be caught trying.”

Big philanthropy embraces partners outside of government

Philanthropists’ interest in engaging with the private sector was evident in some of the heaviest hitters’ announcements.

At his global forum on Wednesday in The Plaza Hotel, billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg unveiled a new partnership with the African Development Bank Group to bring more investment to the continent.

“There’s certainly no shortage of challenges to discuss over there,” said Bloomberg, referencing the U.N. headquarters. “But the truth is, in a world that’s more interconnected and fast-moving than ever, the biggest problems can’t be solved by national governments alone.”

At the Clinton Global Initiative, which retooled this year’s meeting to focus on working groups, ballrooms across the New York Hilton Midtown were packed with hundreds of front line workers, policy experts, foundation donors and NGO representatives divided into groups of 10 to discuss specific problems and potential solutions.

The working groups yielded numerous new initiatives, ranging from a social enterprise fund from Kiva Microfunds alongside corporate foundations to a new Global Network for National Service.

At Rockefeller Foundation headquarters, former heads of state, major foundations’ leaders and global health experts gathered around a table Monday to reimagine international development systems weakened by foreign aid cuts.

The Rockefeller Foundation committed $50 million to the effort. Rajiv Shah, the foundation’s president, said that includes upgrading a critical famine early warning system, created by the U.S. Agency for International Development, and diversifying its financing so no one political party can take it away.

The Clinton Health Access Initiative announced its partnership with Dr. Reddy’s Laboratories, Unitaid, and Wits RHI to provide Gilead Sciences’ HIV prevention drug lenacapavir in 120 low- and middle-income countries. The Gates Foundation announced a similar deal with Indian pharmaceutical manufacturer Hetero Labs.

Bill Gates also announced the foundation would pledge $912 million to the Global Fund’s replenishment campaign to fight AIDS, malaria and tuberculosis.

But, for all the talk of non-governmental funders’ importance, philanthropic leaders emphasized they cannot do it alone. Gates Foundation CEO Mark Suzman said he hopes their commitment to the Global Fund spurs the U.S. and other countries to step up.

“There is no possible way any philanthropy, any combination of philanthropies, can fill the gap,” Suzman said Wednesday.

International Rescue Committee CEO David Miliband, who reported losing $600 million in U.S. grants, said aid is being spread too thin. He called on his sector to more effectively deliver assistance with new technologies and find alternative financing streams.

“We’ve got to embrace innovation. And we’ve got to persuade newly wealthy countries — like those in the Gulf would be one example — that there’s a real potential to have lifelong impact on the people we’re helping,” Miliband said. “And we also have to appeal to philanthropy in the countries where we’re working.”

Nonprofits hit Manhattan with new energy after setbacks

Whether they work in health, climate, migration or any other issue facing funding setbacks, nonprofit leaders reported a different feel to this year’s programming.

Conversations carried a heightened urgency and like-minded groups were forced to better coordinate their goals. Some advocates trod lightly between rallying their cause and avoiding any missteps that might suggest opposition to U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration. Concerns about obtaining visas prompted some to travel with fewer staff than usual.

There was real worry that “we wouldn’t have UNGA,” according to USA for UNHCR Executive Director Suzanne Ehlers.

Her nonprofit had already begun developing a $15 million campaign to fund refugee women’s scholarships. But with everything “thrown up in the air,” she said, many questioned the point of coming.

“And here we are,” said Ehlers, who announced the campaign this week. “It’s actually more consequential than ever, I would say.”

The challenge is identifying who has financial resources in this new aid landscape, said Charity Wallace, a past adviser to former first lady Laura Bush. Her consulting firm, Wallace Global Impact, focuses on cross-sector solutions to world problems.

“Frankly, some people bemoan, as if it was still February and we wish that USAID still existed,” said Wallace, adding that many now see “they have to step up in a different way” in this different reality.

Matt Freeman, executive director of Stronger Foundations for Nutrition, said previous UNGA weeks have been filled with concurrent events where advocates fight for the same limited audience. He sensed a stronger spirit of collective action this year.

“That’s been really heartwarming,” he said. “Because you could imagine in a moment of scarcity that everyone’s elbows become sharper and they’re fighting for the pie.”

Kitty van der Heijden, the deputy executive director of partnerships at the United Nations Children’s Fund, said her week on the sidelines had been a mix of disappointment and excitement. She said UNICEF, which faces at least a 20% cut in revenue next year, will cut staff and look for other ways to save money.

On one hand, she said there was both “withdrawal from governments” and “depression” the state of the multilateral system. On the other hand, she said she saw many philanthropic and private sector actors “really trying to lead now in difficult times.”

“I have no time for depression,” she added. “I only have time to build more partnerships, to be out there, to deliver, because I know that we can. And we cannot do it alone.”

This strategic move could solidify Aqua Metals' role as a cornerstone in the domestic battery supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources and enhancing national security.
As Aqua Metals gains traction, so too could its collaborators, benefiting from shared expertise and an expanded network within the industry.
Looking further ahead, the long-term possibilities for Aqua Metals are significant, contingent on its ability to scale its AquaRefining™ technology and secure widespread adoption.
Aqua Metals' AquaRefining™ technology is positioned as a key enabler in this transition, offering a cleaner, more efficient path to resource recovery.","Reno, NV – September 26, 2025 – Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQMS), a pioneer in sustainable lithium-ion battery recycling, saw its stock skyrocket by an impressive 46.75% today, making it a top gainer in the market. The significant surge comes on the heels of the company's announcement regarding its upcoming participation in The Battery Show North America 2025, where its Vice President of Commercial, David Regan, is slated to join a critical panel discussion on ""Critical Minerals and Trade Policy.""

This strategic visibility event, scheduled for October 6-9, 2025, in Detroit, Michigan, has galvanized investor confidence, signaling Aqua Metals' growing prominence in addressing the urgent need for a robust, domestic supply chain for critical battery minerals. The market's enthusiastic reaction underscores the increasing importance placed on sustainable recycling technologies and national energy independence in the rapidly expanding electric vehicle (EV) and renewable energy sectors.

The Catalyst: Strategic Visibility and a Greener Future

The immediate trigger for Aqua Metals' substantial stock gain was the September 25, 2025 announcement detailing its key role at The Battery Show North America. David Regan's participation in a panel focused on ""Critical Minerals and Trade Policy"" offers an unparalleled platform for Aqua Metals to showcase its proprietary AquaRefining™ technology. This innovative process is designed to efficiently and environmentally responsibly recover high-value materials, or ""black mass,"" from spent lithium-ion batteries and manufacturing scrap, transforming them into battery-grade materials for direct reuse within the U.S. market. Unlike traditional, high-emission smelting methods, AquaRefining™ offers a cleaner, more sustainable alternative, aligning perfectly with global environmental, social, and governance (ESG) objectives.

This recent surge is not an isolated event but rather the culmination of several positive developments for the company. Earlier in September, Aqua Metals announced on September 8, 2025, that it had regained compliance with Nasdaq's minimum bid price requirement, following a necessary reverse stock split, thereby alleviating significant regulatory concerns. Furthermore, on September 16, 2025, the company cemented its commitment to a sustainable U.S. critical minerals supply chain by signing a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with Impossible Metals. This collaboration highlights Aqua Metals' proactive approach to securing its position in the burgeoning battery recycling ecosystem. While the stock experienced some volatility in the days leading up to the announcement, including a significant technical-driven surge on September 24, 2025, and a subsequent dip, the consistent upward trajectory on September 26, 2025, firmly points to the Battery Show announcement as the primary fundamental driver for this latest rally. The event is poised to facilitate crucial engagements with leading original equipment manufacturers (OEMs), cell producers, and other industry stakeholders, potentially paving the way for new partnerships and accelerated commercial deployment of AquaRefining™ technology.

Companies Poised to Win or Lose in the Evolving Battery Landscape

Aqua Metals, Inc. (NASDAQ: AQMS) is clearly positioned as a significant potential winner from this event and the broader trends it represents. By participating in a high-profile industry event like The Battery Show North America and focusing on critical minerals and trade policy, Aqua Metals enhances its visibility and credibility among key decision-makers. The company's AquaRefining™ technology, which offers a more environmentally friendly and efficient method for recovering valuable materials from spent batteries, directly addresses the growing demand for sustainable solutions in the EV and energy storage sectors. Successful showcasing and subsequent strategic partnerships could lead to increased licensing agreements, joint ventures, and a faster rollout of its recycling facilities, thereby significantly boosting its revenue and market share. This strategic move could solidify Aqua Metals' role as a cornerstone in the domestic battery supply chain, reducing reliance on foreign sources and enhancing national security.

The ripple effects of Aqua Metals' potential success could extend to its strategic partners, such as Impossible Metals, with whom it signed an MOU on September 16, 2025, to advance a sustainable U.S. critical minerals supply chain. As Aqua Metals gains traction, so too could its collaborators, benefiting from shared expertise and an expanded network within the industry. Conversely, traditional battery recycling companies that rely on less sustainable, high-emission smelting processes might face increasing pressure. As regulatory scrutiny over environmental impact intensifies and consumer preference shifts towards greener technologies, these legacy players could see their competitive edge erode. Their slower adoption of advanced, environmentally conscious methods could put them at a disadvantage in securing contracts and attracting investment in a market increasingly prioritizing sustainability.

Furthermore, the heightened focus on domestic critical mineral supply chains, amplified by events like The Battery Show, could put pressure on companies heavily reliant on international sourcing or those without robust recycling strategies. Manufacturers of electric vehicles and energy storage systems are increasingly seeking assurances of supply chain resilience and ethical sourcing. Companies that cannot demonstrate a commitment to these principles, either through internal recycling capabilities or strong partnerships with innovators like Aqua Metals, may find themselves at a competitive disadvantage in an increasingly conscious market. The event, therefore, acts as a spotlight, highlighting the innovators and potentially casting shadows on those slower to adapt to the new, sustainable paradigm.

Wider Significance: Reshaping the Future of Critical Mineral Supply

Aqua Metals' strategic move to highlight its AquaRefining™ technology at The Battery Show North America 2025 carries significant weight within the broader industry context, aligning perfectly with several critical trends. The global push towards electric vehicles and renewable energy storage has created an unprecedented demand for critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel. Simultaneously, there's a growing recognition of the environmental and geopolitical challenges associated with traditional mining and refining processes, many of which are concentrated in a few foreign nations. Aqua Metals' focus on domestically recycling ""black mass"" from end-of-life batteries directly addresses the imperative for a secure, sustainable, and circular economy for these vital resources, reducing U.S. dependence on volatile international supply chains. This event underscores the accelerating shift towards closed-loop systems in manufacturing, a trend that is only expected to intensify.

The potential ripple effects of Aqua Metals' increased visibility and potential partnerships are substantial. Successful commercialization and scaling of AquaRefining™ could encourage other players in the battery manufacturing and recycling ecosystem to invest further in advanced, sustainable technologies. This could lead to a virtuous cycle of innovation, driving down costs, improving efficiency, and further solidifying the domestic supply chain. Partners, such as Impossible Metals, could see their collaborative efforts gain more prominence, fostering a network of companies committed to ethical and sustainable mineral sourcing. From a regulatory and policy perspective, Aqua Metals' efforts resonate strongly with current U.S. government initiatives aimed at bolstering domestic manufacturing, promoting green technologies, and enhancing national security through supply chain resilience. The Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and the Inflation Reduction Act, for instance, include provisions that incentivize domestic battery production and recycling, creating a favorable environment for companies like Aqua Metals.

Historically, major technological breakthroughs or strategic announcements in emerging industries often serve as inflection points, drawing significant investment and accelerating market adoption. Comparisons can be drawn to early advancements in solar panel manufacturing or semiconductor development, where companies that established early leadership in sustainable or efficient processes gained a lasting competitive advantage. While Aqua Metals is still in the growth phase, its current trajectory, amplified by this strategic appearance, positions it as a key player in shaping the future of battery recycling. The event not only elevates Aqua Metals but also serves as a bellwether for the increasing maturity and investment appeal of the entire sustainable critical minerals sector.

Utility-scale storage leads the charge Most of that Q2 growth came from utility-scale projects, which added 4.9 GW – enough to power 3.7 million homes during peak demand.
The Southwest Power Pool, which hadn’t seen new battery storage projects in three years, saw a comeback with three installations in Oklahoma.
“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP’s vice president of energy storage.
“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” Weis said.","The US battery storage market just had its biggest quarter ever. In Q2 2025, a record 5.6 gigawatts (GW) of new capacity came online, according to the latest US Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association (ACP) and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage leads the charge

Most of that Q2 growth came from utility-scale projects, which added 4.9 GW – enough to power 3.7 million homes during peak demand. As electricity demand climbs and prices rise, more states are turning to large-scale batteries to keep the grid stable and affordable.

Texas, California, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of new capacity. The Southwest Power Pool, which hadn’t seen new battery storage projects in three years, saw a comeback with three installations in Oklahoma. Meanwhile, Florida and Georgia are now forecast to deploy more storage than expected after major new procurements by utilities.

“Energy storage is being quickly deployed to strengthen our grid as demand for power surges and is helping to drive down energy prices for American families and businesses,” said Noah Roberts, ACP’s vice president of energy storage. “Despite regulatory uncertainty, the industry is on track to produce enough grid batteries in US factories to meet 100% domestic demand.”

Home batteries are booming

The residential battery storage market also surged, adding 608 megawatts (MW) in Q2, up 132% year-over-year and 8% from Q1. California, Arizona, and Illinois led the growth as more homeowners paired batteries with rooftop solar and adopted higher-capacity systems.

CCI market grows slowly

The community, commercial, and industrial (CCI) segment grew by a smaller 38 MW, up 11% year-over-year. California and New York made up more than 70% of Q2’s CCI capacity, while Illinois gained ground. But community-scale storage remains limited due to high costs and policy barriers.

Outlook: Resilient growth, but headwinds ahead

The ACP/Wood Mac report forecasts 87.8 GW of US storage by 2029, with residential and utility-scale projects in the lead. But growth could dip 10% in 2027 as new federal rules take effect on where battery cells can be sourced.

“Pricing and FEOC [Foreign Entity of Concern] uncertainty, and slow community storage development are expected to limit CCI growth below 1 GW by 2029,” said Allison Feeney, a research analyst at Wood Mackenzie. She added that residential storage will likely outpace solar thanks to strong incentives, especially in markets like California and Puerto Rico.

Allison Weis, Wood Mackenzie’s global head of storage, said Trump’s big bill act preserved the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) for batteries, but stricter sourcing rules after 2025 could reduce the five-year outlook by 16.5 GW.

“After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC,” Weis said. “While domestic supply is ramping up, shortages are possible, and developers may still rely on Chinese cells to fill gaps.”

The report warns that projects failing to hit certain milestones by the end of 2025 could face new permitting and regulatory risks, underscoring the urgency to build now under current rules.

The department recently sent letters to local governments in at least six states — Alabama, California, Connecticut, Illinois, Massachusetts and New Mexico — informing them it was withdrawing money awarded under the $1.1 trillion infrastructure law former President Joe Biden signed in 2021.

The reversals are among the clearest signals yet of the drastic shift from the Biden administration's emphasis on alternative transportation, such as transit and biking, to the Trump administration's focus on preserving and expanding lanes for cars and trucks.

While the new grants Trump's transportation department announced this year reflect that change, it's practically unprecedented for an administration to claw back grants awarded by a predecessor without a compelling reason, such as potential environmental harms. However, the latest recalled projects didn't have fully funded grant agreements in place, which would have made reversing them far trickier.

The transportation department's press office didn't respond to emails requesting comment.

Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile (71-kilometer) recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.

Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant’s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn't move forward. The agency wants “multimodal grant programs” to focus on “projects that promote vehicular travel,” the letter explained.

“They're defining quality of life for Americans as enhancing automobile operations,” Dunne said.

The same reason was given in a letter sent to Albuquerque, New Mexico, pulling $11.5 million in funding for a leg of a rail trail cutting through the city's core. It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.

“We are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. “We will see you in court.”

Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts “an affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans’ demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.”

DOT also withdrew a $20 million grant awarded in 2022 to transform three streetscapes in Boston. The reversal was based in part on the project's electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting “traditional forms of energy and natural resources,” the Boston Globe reported.

Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department's changing priorities.

One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ “creative roadway features” such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county's Land Use and Environment Group.

But Trump's transportation officials flagged it as “hostile to motor vehicles” in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn't affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.

Echoing Hove’s “co-evolution” framing, Sun said this “shouldn’t be a one-way process where Chinese companies pass know-how to their Global South partners.","In the past decade, China has regularly shattered clean technology records at home. Simultaneously, it has emerged as a major partner for countries of the Global South seeking to boost renewable energy capacity and pursue low-carbon development.

Domestic clean-tech manufacturers have underpinned China’s vast expansions of solar and wind power, battery capacity and electric vehicles (EVs), and they are now increasingly seeking, and finding, new markets overseas. In 2024, exports of these four technologies from China to the regions of the Global South totalled over USD 72 billion, accounting for almost half of all wind, solar and EV exports.

For many countries, these imports have brought a much-needed boost to sustainability efforts, expanding access to electricity and driving booms in renewable capacity. But ambitions among Global South nations to move beyond a trade-only relationship in these goods are being regularly voiced, including in bilateral meetings with Chinese counterparts and in international summits.

The hope is that China can be not just a source of imports for green tech, infrastructure and services, but also a provider of the technology and knowledge that can enable increased manufacturing and innovation within countries’ own borders.

At a diplomatic level, China has long been sensitive to such requests, promoting scholarships to study in China, technical cooperation platforms and “Luban Workshops” for vocational training in partner countries. Expansions of all such initiatives were pledged to nations as China hosted the recent Shanghai Cooperation Organization Plus meeting in Tianjin, for example. But they may not be enough, and such transfer of technology and knowledge is a complex, and often contentious, topic.

During China’s own rapid industrialisation since Reform and Opening Up began in 1978, Chinese companies themselves benefited from exchanges with European and American partners, as well as in the more recent development of its world-leading solar, wind and EV sectors. But analysts have told Dialogue Earth of doubts around the incentives and capacity for China’s green tech giants to share their expertise in the clean energy space. Concerning the Global South, meanwhile, they have highlighted relevant initiatives demonstrating the potential of such transfers, but also raised questions about countries’ capacity and leverage to scale up this engagement.

Defining tech transfer

Technology and knowledge transfer have long been sought by countries of the Global South, but have gained renewed attention as global efforts to build up clean energy capacity have surged. These desires are coalescing with calls from developing countries for Global North, as well as Chinese, partners and investors – often their raw material buyers – to support their industrialisation and moves up value chains.

Recommended

Issues around these transfers from China have been a key point of discussion at recent meetings co-organised by Dialogue Earth. These include a panel event held in Berlin, Germany, alongside the Heinrich Böll Foundation, and an international conference of China researchers, analysts and civil society figures, hosted by the SGAIN project at the University of Bath in England.

“There is no doubt that the sustainability transition of Global South countries will need support from China in terms of both financing and technology cooperation,” Yixian Sun, the SGAIN project’s principal investigator and the Bath conference’s lead organiser, told Dialogue Earth. “Hence, sharing, but more importantly co-developing, knowledge and technologies between China and its southern partners is a necessary step in the global sustainability transition.”

China’s own experience benefitting from such partnerships was highlighted by several attendees at the conference, with BMW’s cooperation with CATL in the early 2010s a prominent example raised by one speaker. CATL is now the world’s largest battery maker.

Anders Hove, a senior research fellow on China at the Oxford Institute for Energy Studies, described to Dialogue Earth how partnerships with western manufacturers in China’s auto industry “evolved from simple joint venture requirements in the nineties to more sophisticated policies that forced foreign automakers to ensure localisation of core technologies like batteries, electric motors and control systems”.

These exchanges have been a sensitive point in China’s trade relations with the US and the European Union, with allegations that “forced technology transfer” has been demanded of foreign investors – something that China’s 2019 Foreign Investment Law sought to explicitly prohibit.

Rather than a simple “one-way” movement, Hove emphasised that these relationships should be seen as “co-evolution” between partners. He raised the example of the development of China’s solar industry through collaboration with western partners, to now account for over 80% of global manufacturing: “[It] showed how German and American technicians worked with local manufacturers, creating a back-and-forth co-evolution process rather than one-way transfer.”

Hopes and doubts in Southeast Asia

China’s solar industry has emerged at the forefront of its clean-tech manufacturers’ overseas expansion, with significant growth in global exports of panels and other components during the past decade. In recent years, Chinese solar manufacturers have also relocated some of their production, notably to Southeast Asia, helping to establish Vietnam, Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia among the top producers and exporters outside China. These relocations have been widely read as a means for manufacturers to evade US tariffs on Chinese-made solar equipment – a trade that is now severely threatened by the Trump administration.

Recommended

However, with facilities in Southeast Asia focused largely on final assembly, the extent to which knowledge and technology transfer has taken place in these investments was questioned by experts consulted by Dialogue Earth.

According to Hove, “all the know-how remains in China, all parts come from China, and the whole supply chain is still located there. There’s essentially no knowledge diffusion happening, even though there’s solar manufacturing”.

This was echoed by Jessica Liao, an associate professor at North Carolina State University whose research focuses on Chinese foreign policy and Southeast Asia. She described local capacity-building through investments as “limited”. But she also said that calls for such support have been a “rising priority” among Southeast Asian nations.

Liao pointed to Chinese investments in EV manufacturing in Thailand and the nickel industry in Indonesia as areas in which Southeast Asian countries are hoping for support to move up value chains. Nickel is a crucial component in EV batteries and Indonesia already accounts for nearly half of its global production, but the country is also hoping to establish itself among the world’s leading battery producers. CATL recently broke ground on a USD 6 billion facility in West Java.

Recommended

However, Liao questioned the potential for transfers to occur in these sectors: “Most of this manufacturing is really not the knowledge- or technology-intensive part of the EV buildup. So, we haven’t seen any clear case where the host countries are benefitting from the more upstream knowledge, the core knowledge of any of those clean-tech industries.”

As the region’s largest market and economy, Indonesia may be better positioned than its Asean neighbours to benefit from these processes, holding, in Liao’s words, “more bargaining power”. She said that Malaysia may also have some advantages due to its manufacturing capacity, skilled workforce, and large Chinese diaspora populations with a history of doing business with China. But, she added, “most Asean countries have a modest market size and a lot of regulatory and institutional barriers, so it’s difficult for a Chinese investor to see to what extent there can be knowledge transfer”.

Lessons from Brazil

As South America’s leading industrial hub and home to a well-established clean energy market, Brazil has been a top destination for Chinese green-tech manufacturers’ overseas expansion – and arguably a frontrunner in knowledge and technology transfer partnerships.

Chinese auto giant BYD, the world’s largest EV maker, recently announced that its first Brazil-made vehicles had rolled off its production line in the north-eastern state of Bahia. Fellow manufacturer Great Wall Motors cut the ribbon on an EV factory in São Paulo in August. One of China’s largest wind turbine manufacturers, Goldwind, has also launched a base in Bahia to assemble in Brazil, which is the world’s fifth largest wind power market.

João Cumarú, a Brazil-China specialist and international advisor at Consorcio Nordeste, a development body for Brazil’s north-east region, told Dialogue Earth that knowledge and technology transfer have emerged as “one of the central pillars of the bilateral agenda”.

“During his last visit to China, President Lula pointed out that investments shouldn’t be only about infrastructure – they also need to include education, technology and training people, so Brazil can strengthen its own value chains,” Cumarú added.

In addition to the existing investments in EV and wind turbine manufacturing, Cumarú said there is “a lot of interest in Chinese expertise with critical minerals, especially in refining and processing”, which could help Brazil take advantage of its own reserves.

Several initiatives to directly foster knowledge and technology transfer in green sectors have already been established between the two countries. Both Cumarú and Sun highlighted the China-Brazil Center for Climate Change and Innovative Energy Technology (CCB) as one example. Created in 2009 via a partnership between the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro and Tsinghua University in Beijing, the centre promotes academic exchanges and joint development in bioenergy, solar and wind power, and electricity transmission. Cumarú also spoke of cooperation projects in the agricultural sector and sustainable aviation fuel, as well as CBERS, the decades-old China-Brazil satellite programme.

In Cumarú’s view, effective exchanges in these areas depend on strong government support: “You need stable policies, clear rules on intellectual property and incentives for joint ventures. Mechanisms like the China-Brazil High-Level Coordination Committee can help to set the agenda and make sure things actually move forward.” Finance, too, “is another piece of the puzzle”, and support for such programmes from federal agencies and institutions, such as Brazil’s development bank BNDES, is necessary. “Without resources, cooperation risks staying only on paper.”

Policy signals and preparedness

On the prospects for knowledge and technology transfer between China and Global South countries, experts told Dialogue Earth of barriers in host countries, but also the incentives for Chinese companies, and authorities, to engage.

Recommended

Anders Hove spoke of “concerning signals” in China’s export controls that may limit the potential for exchanges around technologies such as batteries, which he said have been designated as “sensitive technology”. On balance, he said, “It’s more than half dependent on Global South countries developing their own absorptive capacity, but China’s government policies on technology export controls are equally crucial.”

Jessica Liao, meanwhile, highlighted Chinese companies’ motivations: “Their incentive is really not to help the local economy or local industrialists to have the independent capacity to do it … their primary concern is to help solve their domestic overcapacity problem. Why [would] they have any incentives to reproduce all those as surplus in Southeast Asia again?”

Measures such as export controls signal to clean-tech companies that their core technology should “stay home”, Liao added. These companies “walk a tightrope” to balance government support while pursuing their overseas expansion, she said, “aware that this expansion should really just be at the low end of production”.

Yixian Sun highlighted a differing perspective: “I don’t think Chinese actors are unwilling to transfer or share their technologies to their Global South partners. In many cases, they haven’t done so because there are no viable mechanisms for this, with transfer not only too costly in today’s market, but also challenging due to cultural differences.”

Sun, like all other fellow interviewees, spoke of capacity constraints and a lack of coherent strategies in partner countries: “The challenges in many host countries actually lie in the lack of well-designed policies to promote this, as well as the lack of human resources to absorb relevant technological know-how.”

Hove similarly described human resources as an important factor in technology and knowledge transfer: “You can’t put skills and knowledge in a container. Even if there was some textbook or Wikipedia file that could be transferred, that wouldn’t solve the fundamental human resource challenge that developing countries face.”

The potential of overcoming such constraints and creating the environment for these exchanges may be reflected in the experiences of Brazil – though both Sun and Cumarú said tracking concrete initiatives for knowledge and technology transfer is not straightforward, neither is measuring their impact, which tends to occur in the longer term.

Echoing Hove’s “co-evolution” framing, Sun said this “shouldn’t be a one-way process where Chinese companies pass know-how to their Global South partners. Instead, it should be a mutual learning process, where Chinese actors engage with their Southern partners to develop or improve clean technologies”.

Prioritizing roads, not trails

Connecticut won a $5.7 million federal grant last summer to help design segments of a 44-mile (71-kilometer) recreational trail connecting several communities along the Naugatuck River.

Rick Dunne, executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments, said the grant’s final details were being negotiated when the U.S. Department of Transportation sent a letter this month to inform local officials that the project wouldn’t move forward.

It was among the first active transportation projects awarded under the infrastructure law, with funding announced in 2022, but it was still going through the approval process.

“We are going to stand up for Albuquerque and prevent the Trump Administration from pulling money from a project the people of Albuquerque want,” Mayor Tim Keller said in a press release. “We will see you in court.”

Kevin Mills, vice president of policy for the Rails to Trails Conservancy, called the cuts “an affront to the priorities set by Congress and Americans’ demands for safer, more convenient walking and biking routes.”

DOT also withdrew a $20 million grant awarded in 2022 to transform three streetscapes in Boston. The reversal was based in part on the project’s electric vehicle charging stations, which the administration said contradicted its preference for promoting “traditional forms of energy and natural resources,” the Boston Globe reported.

No project too small to cut

Some of the withdrawn projects were relatively small in dollars and scope but still targeted for reversal due to the department’s changing priorities.

One applied to just a single block in San Diego County, California, where the community wanted to test whether it could improve safety without disrupting traffic flow. It sought to employ “creative roadway features” such as roundabouts in place of traffic signals, with plans to expand the approach to other intersections if the model proved successful, said Donna Durckel, spokesperson for the county’s Land Use and Environment Group.

But Trump’s transportation officials flagged it as “hostile to motor vehicles” in a letter sent Sept. 9 because the project included a so-called road diet that would have reduced the stretch from four lanes to two.

On the same day, McLean County in central Illinois got a similar letter recalling federal funding awarded last year to help design a final 9-mile segment of a bike and pedestrian trail along Route 66. County engineer Jerry Stokes said the project wouldn’t affect motor vehicle travel but would promote safety by getting bicyclists and pedestrians off the road.

“We’re kind of at a standstill now until new funding sources become available,” he said.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/09/68d6f8236d6c31.55070923.jpeg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-26 21:59:48.940240

The Powering the Offshore Act Bill-149, introduced on Friday, updates legislation related to offshore wind, tidal energy, and the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick connection.
The act changes three pieces of energy legislation, including the Electricity Act, the Public Utilities Act, and the Marine Renewable Energy Act.
‘We’re unleashing Nova Scotia’s untapped potential to make our province a clean energy and economic powerhouse,” Energy Minister Trevor Boudrau said in the press release.
The areas include French Bank, Middle Bank and Sable Island Bank — all south of Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore — and Sydney Bight, northeast of Cape Breton.","The province is continuing to pave the way for clean energy projects and create jobs and investments for Nova Scotians, including an ambitious $60 billion idea.

The Powering the Offshore Act Bill-149, introduced on Friday, updates legislation related to offshore wind, tidal energy, and the Nova Scotia-New Brunswick connection.

The act changes three pieces of energy legislation, including the Electricity Act, the Public Utilities Act, and the Marine Renewable Energy Act.

‘We’re unleashing Nova Scotia’s untapped potential to make our province a clean energy and economic powerhouse,” Energy Minister Trevor Boudrau said in the press release. “This means good jobs, stronger communities, and more opportunities right here at home, and it means we can pay for the investments our province needs in areas like healthcare, highways and homes.”

This comes as the Canada-Nova Scotia Offshore Energy Regulator is starting the first phase of a licensing process to tap into Nova Scotia’s offshore wind to produce 62 gigawatts of clean energy.

“Our goal is to move this along in an appropriate fashion to make sure it’s done right, but certainly our goal is to move it quickly as well,” Boudreau said.

The announcement came nine days after Prime Minister Mark Carney said that Ottawa was prepared to work with Nova Scotia to ramp up its ambitious plans for the so-called Wind West project, which is aimed at providing power to the rest of Atlantic Canada and beyond.

Nova Scotia estimates the initial capital cost of Wind West at around $60 billion. The province said it would expect a 4 per cent royalty from offshore production and is seeking federal investment tax credits and low-interest financing through the Canada Infrastructure Bank.

The province also announced this summer that four offshore areas had been designated for offshore wind development. The areas include French Bank, Middle Bank and Sable Island Bank — all south of Nova Scotia’s Eastern Shore — and Sydney Bight, northeast of Cape Breton.

You may notice a lower electric bill next month. A special credit will automatically hit millions of accounts as part of the state’s effort to curb emissions and offset higher utility rates.

What is the credit? The California Climate Credit comes in April and October from providers who are regulated by the state’s public utilities commission. It’s funded by the state’s cap-and-trade program, which allows industries that emit greenhouse gases to buy pollution allowances.

How much could I get? More than 11 million households will get a cut this round, but the amount varies by utility. Here’s a breakdown for qualified utilities in Southern California:

Southern California Edison: $56

San Diego Gas & Electric: $81.38

Bear Valley Electric Service: $34.91

All community choice aggregators, such as the Clean Power Alliance and Orange County Power Authority, also get the credit. You can check with your utility for specific amounts.

Holyoke will become the first city in the northeast United States to adopt Veolia’s Hubgrade technology for wastewater treatment, which uses AI-enabled predictive technology, robotics, digital twins and 3D virtual reality systems to analyze system performance. It will recommend operational adjustments to Veolia’s experienced team at the site and the Holyoke Department of Public Works, which can use Hubgrade insights to reduce energy consumption and chemical use, extend the useful life of expensive equipment, and cut costs.

Holyoke Mayor Joshua A. Garcia said: “Holyoke remains committed to pioneering sustainable environmental solutions that support our community’s growth and protect our natural resources. This partnership with Veolia exemplifies our dedication to innovation, efficiency, and environmental stewardship – creating a cleaner, healthier future for all residents.”

David Connors, President of Veolia Municipal Water’s Contract Operations in New England, said: “Veolia applauds the City of Holyoke for selecting Veolia as the best option to help Holyoke transform its wastewater system for greater sustainability, improved performance and future growth. Veolia is indeed the recognized leader in America’s water industry, and as active partners with the communities we serve, we are excited to deploy the Hubgrade technology that will drive ongoing improvements.”

Veolia has served Holyoke since 2005, and the new contract will continue Veolia’s partnership with the City and its Department of Public Works through 2035, with the opportunity for an additional five-year extension. Holyoke’s leadership reached a unanimous decision to maintain the contractual relationship with Veolia following a competitive bid process.

The renewed collaboration between Veolia and Holyoke will see an even greater focus on modernization and operational efficiency – including an enhanced geographic information system to digitize the location of wastewater infrastructure, routine digital camera inspections of the system’s assets, shared energy-saving measures and a new centrifuge that will improve efficiency in hauling costs.

As part of the agreement, Veolia will continue operations and management of the conventional activated sludge plant, capable of treating as much as 17.5 million gallons of wastewater each day. Veolia will also continue to maintain 40 miles of dedicated sewer mains and 77 miles of combined sewer and stormwater mains. The Holyoke system features 13 combined sewer overflow outfalls, three interceptors, and seven remote pumping stations – all of which are held to rigorous regulatory standards by the United States Environmental Protection Agency.

Joseph Tackett, CEO of Veolia’s Municipal Water Contract Operations, said: “Partnering with Holyoke’s Department of Public Works on efficient and effective upgrades will help the City fulfill its potential for economic growth and environmental security. We appreciate the committee’s unanimous decision to renew with Veolia and its recognition of our committed staffers who serve the city every day, and we’re grateful for the opportunity to continue proving our commitment to Holyoke’s future.”

Veolia has a long-established reputation for high-quality operation of water and wastewater systems across New England, including facilities in Springfield, Westborough, and Taunton, Massachusetts. Veolia’s service to the region exemplifies its global GreenUp strategy, striving to lead the ecological transformation of the planet by accelerating water quality improvement, hazardous waste treatment and disposal, decarbonization and technological innovation.

The report looked at where utilities stood in efforts to close their coal plants by 2030, add no new natural gas and be powered by clean energy alone by 2035. Though the report doesn't specifically define ""clean energy"" — it mentions wind, solar and battery storage.

The score for CenterPoint Energy in southwest Indiana dropped the most. It went from a B to a D. The utility’s unfinished 20-year plan calls for keeping coal plants open past 2030 — at least seven years later than originally planned.

Indiana Michigan Power up north dropped one letter grade to a C. Its parent company, AEP, asked Indiana customers to pay for coal plants owned by the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, even though Michigan and Ohio pulled back some of their funding.

State to use $52 million in frozen funds to expand network

Michigan is moving forward with its revised electric vehicle charging plan after receiving federal approval. The US Department of Transportation approved the state’s plan under the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program, allocating $52 million remaining from an original $110 million. The Trump administration froze the $52 million in February.

One of the biggest challenges for electric vehicles is the limited number of charging stations. Michigan plans to fund a total of 83 stations. Two are already operational and four more are under construction. The rest are still being planned.

But that’s not a death knell for EVs in America; it’s a call to reimagine how the mobility industry can push forward. In this edition of Route Zero, my weekly newsletter on the future of mobility, I’m looking at what comes next after the end of the EV tax credit. Let's start by admitting that this incentive scheme was effective but flawed. Plus, onerous new tariffs and the end of fuel economy regulations are equally to blame for any EV plans getting dialed back right now. And the industry has some hard lessons to learn about how to sell these things. So what happens now? Well, I haven’t spoken to any serious person in the industry who truly believes EVs are going away—here in America or anywhere else. And there's another industry on the rise that will bring electrification with it, almost by default. But I also want to hear from you: How is this shift impacting your company and what you do?

General Motors Company (NYSE:GM), a leading U.S. automaker, is making strategic adjustments as it navigates evolving consumer demand and policy changes in the electric vehicle (EV) market.

In early September 2025, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) announced temporary production cuts at its Spring Hill, Tennessee EV plant, halting assembly of Cadillac Lyriq and Vistiq SUVs through December and scaling back production into early 2026. The move follows weaker-than-expected demand after the expiration of the $7,500 federal EV tax credit at the end of September.

The announcement came shortly after GM reported record U.S. EV sales in August, with over 21,000 units sold across popular models like the Chevy Equinox EV, Cadillac Lyriq, and GMC Sierra EV. While sales momentum has slowed, the corporation remains confident in its long-term EV growth, supported by demand for affordable models such as the Chevy Equinox EV under $35,000 and the upcoming Chevy Bolt EV near $30,000.

Strategically, the firm is bolstering its competitive edge through a partnership with Hyundai to co-develop new vehicles, including compact SUVs, sedans, pickups, and an electric van for North America. The collaboration focuses on shared R&D and sourcing of key materials like batteries and steel to improve efficiency and cost competitiveness, further cementing GM’s place among the best manufacturing stocks to watch in the EV space.

In a symbolic shift, General Motors Company (NYSE:GM) also announced plans to move its headquarters from Detroit’s Renaissance Center to Woodward Avenue, underscoring a new era as the company balances internal combustion and EV production. CEO Mary Barra emphasized resilience amid supply chain disruptions and regulatory changes while reaffirming GM’s commitment to delivering vehicles that appeal to a broad range of consumers.

That’s according to the group’s annual report that tracks climate commitments.

The Sierra Club said data centers with big energy needs — and Gov. Mike Braun’s focus on keeping coal plants open — are largely responsible for the changes.

The report looked at where utilities stood in efforts to close their coal plants by 2030, add no new natural gas and be powered by clean energy alone by 2035. Though the report doesn't specifically define ""clean energy"" — it mentions wind, solar and battery storage.

The score for CenterPoint Energy in southwest Indiana dropped the most. It went from a B to a D. The utility’s unfinished 20-year plan calls for keeping coal plants open past 2030 — at least seven years later than originally planned.

Indiana Michigan Power up north dropped one letter grade to a C. Its parent company, AEP, asked Indiana customers to pay for coal plants owned by the Ohio Valley Electric Corporation, even though Michigan and Ohio pulled back some of their funding.

Northern Indiana utility NIPSCO also went down one letter to a B for plans to add a small natural gas plant. That grade came out before the public knew about NIPSCO plans for another, much larger gas plant. If built, it would put out the third most greenhouse gas emissions of any large industrial facility in the state.

AES Indiana and Duke Energy’s scores stayed the same with a B and an F respectively.
