She's 84, and this summer she participated in a program to get free, energy efficient upgrades to her family home. Gloria Romano lives in a senior community in Mooresville. She got a free fan from the county during the summer’s first heat wave. Harper Ellis is a street outreach worker who helps keep Charlotte’s unhoused community safe.

These women are a snapshot of the many community members, workers and leaders I had the opportunity to interview and learn from this summer as an environmental reporting intern at WFAE, Charlotte’s NPR news source.

Working at WFAE was an education in arts, community building, and of course, public radio. I had the unique opportunity to work one on one with their climate reporter and learned to master all the buttons, cords and seemingly random sounds that came from my equipment. From there, WFAE essentially dumped me head first into the great big world (the city of Charlotte). I reported from the government center, the mountains of western North Carolina and an encampment of unhoused people living beside I-77. Mic and chunky headphones in hand, I chased stories all around the region, learning more about North Carolinians from all walks of life with every interview.

Internally, working inside of a newsroom was also a very enlightening experience. I’ve been involved with the Davidsonian since my freshman year but this was my first professional journalism experience. Participating in daily pitch meetings, sitting through edits and even just listening to chatter within the newsroom gave me a significantly deeper understanding of journalism and at the same time, it showed me how much room I have to grow. An unexpected educational experience: While I was in that newsroom, WFAE confronted the rescission of federal funding for the corporation for public broadcasting. It was a window into the challenge of sustaining local journalism and the resilience of those determined to do the work.

Sustainability Scholars made my experience possible. It is a program run by the Sustainability Office, connecting a cohort of 10 students to environmentally-minded internships.

However, while biomass energy has surged in Southern states such as Georgia, projects in California have struggled to get off the ground.","Arbor Energy is, essentially, a poster child of the kind of biomass energy project California keeps saying it wants.

The state’s goal is to reduce wildfire risk on 1 million acres of wildlands every year, including by thinning overgrown forests, which is expected to generate roughly 10 million tons of wood waste annually. Arbor hopes to take that waste, blast it through a “vegetarian rocket engine” to produce energy, then sequester all of the carbon the process would generate underground.

California has billed Arbor — and the handful of other similarly aimed projects it’s financed — as a win-win-win: wildfire mitigation, clean energy and carbon sequestration all in one.

Yet, after Arbor initially won state financial backing for a pilot project in Placer County, the El Segundo-based company’s California ambitions fell through, like many biomass projects before it.

Instead, it’s heading to Louisiana.

California, biomass energy advocates say, has struggled to get past its distrust of the technology, given traditional biomass’ checkered past of clear-cutting forests and polluting poorer communities. Further, the state’s strict permitting requirements have given residents tremendous power to veto projects and created regulatory headaches.

But many environmental groups argue it’s an example of California’s environmental and health protections actually working. If not done carefully, bioenergy projects run the risk of emitting carbon — not sequestering it — and polluting communities already grappling with some of the state’s dirtiest air.

“When you look at biomass facilities across California — and we’ve done Public Records Act requests to look at emissions, violations and exceedances ... the reality is that we’re not in some kind of idealized pen-and-paper drawing of what the equipment does,” said Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “In the real world, there are just too many problems with failures and faults in the equipment.”

There are simpler and safer uses for this wood waste, these critics say: fertilizer for agriculture, wood chips and mulch. It may not provide carbon-negative energy but comes with none of the risks of bioenergy projects, they say.

The Center for Biological Diversity and others advocate for a “hands-off” approach to California’s forests and urge management of the wildfire crisis through home hardening and evacuation planning alone. But fire and ecology experts say more than a century of fire suppression have made that unrealistic.

However, the sweeping forest-thinning projects these experts say are needed will cost billions, and so the state needs every source of funding it can get. “Our bottleneck right now is, how do we pay for treating a million acres a year?” said Deputy Chief John McCarthy of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, who oversees the agency’s wood products and bioenergy program.

In theory, the class of next-generation biomass energy proposals popping up across California could help fund this work.

“California has an incredible opportunity,” said Arbor chief executive and co-founder Brad Hartwig. With the state’s leftover biomass from forest thinning, “we could make it basically the leader in carbon removal in the world.”

A lot of wood with nowhere to go

Biomass energy first took off in California in the 1980s after small pioneering plants at sawmills and food-processing facilities proved successful and the state’s utilities began offering favorable contracts for energy sources they deemed “renewable” — a category that included biomass.

In the late ‘80s and early ‘90s, the state had more than 60 operating biomass plants, providing up to 9% of the state’s residential power. Researchers estimate the industry supported about 60,000 acres of forest treatment to reduce wildfire risk per year at the time. But biomass energy’s heyday was short-lived.

In 1994, the California Public Utilities Commission shifted the state’s emphasis away from creating a renewable and diverse energy mix and toward simply buying the cheapest possible power.

Biomass — an inherently more expensive endeavor — struggled. Many plants took buyouts to shut down early. Despite California’s repeated attempts to revitalize the industry, the number of biomass plants continued to dwindle.

Today, only 23 biomass plants remain in operation, according to the industry advocate group California Biomass Energy Alliance. The state Energy Commission expects the number to continue declining because of aging infrastructure and a poor bioenergy market. California’s forest and wildfire leadership are trying to change that.

In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom created a task force to address California’s growing wildfire crisis. After convening the state’s top wildfire and forest scientists, the task force quickly came to a daunting conclusion: The more than a century of fire suppression in California’s forests — especially in the Sierra Nevada — had dramatically increased their density, providing fires with ample fuel to explode into raging beasts.

To solve it, the state needed to rapidly remove that extra biomass on hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of acres of wildlands every year through a combination of prescribed burns, rehabilitation of burned areas and mechanically thinning the forest.

McCarthy estimated treating a single acre of land could cost $2,000 to $3,000. At a million acres a year, that’s $2 billion to $3 billion annually.

“Where is that going to come from?” McCarthy said. “Grants — maybe $200 million … 10% of the whole thing. So, we need markets. We need some sort of way to pay for this stuff and in a nontraditional way.”

McCarthy believes bioenergy is one of those ways — essentially, by selling the least valuable, borderline unusable vegetation from the forest floor. You can’t build a house with pine cones, needles and twigs, but you can power a bioenergy plant.

However, while biomass energy has surged in Southern states such as Georgia, projects in California have struggled to get off the ground.

In 2022, a bid by Chevron, Microsoft and the oil-drilling technology company Schlumberger to revive a traditional biomass plant near Fresno and affix carbon capture to it fell through after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requested the project withdraw its permit application. Environmental groups including the Center for Biological Diversity and residents in nearby Mendota opposed the project.

This year, a sweeping effort supported by rural Northern California counties to process more than 1 million tons of biomass a year into wood pellets and ship them to European bioenergy plants (with no carbon capture involved) in effect died after facing pushback from watch groups that feared the project, led by Golden State Natural Resources, would harm forests, and environmental justice groups that worried processing facilities at the Port of Stockton would worsen the air quality in one of the state’s most polluted communities.

Arbor believed its fate would be different.

Bioenergy from the ground up

Before founding Arbor, Hartwig served in the California Air National Guard for six years and on a Marin County search and rescue team. He now recalls a common refrain on the job: “There is no rescue in fire. It’s all search,” Hartwig said. “It’s looking for bodies — not even bodies, it’s teeth and bones.”

In 2022, he started Arbor, with the idea of taking a different approach to bioenergy than the biomass plants shuttering across California.

To understand Arbor’s innovation, start with coal plants, which burn fossil fuels to heat up water and produce steam that turns a turbine to generate electricity. Traditional biomass plants work essentially the same but replace coal with vegetation as the fuel. Typically, the smoke from the vegetation burning is simply released into the air.

Arbor’s solution is more like a tree-powered rocket engine.

The company can utilize virtually any form of biomass, from wood to sticks to pine needles and brush. Arbor heats it to extreme temperatures and deprives it of enough oxygen to make the biomass fully combust. The organic waste separates into a flammable gas — made of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen — and a small amount of solid waste.

The machine then combusts the gas at extreme temperatures and pressures, which then accelerates a turbine at much higher rates than typical biomass plants. The resulting carbon dioxide exhaust is then sequestered underground.

Arbor portrays its solution as a flexible, carbon-negative and clean device: It can operate anywhere with a hookup for carbon sequestration. Multiple units can work together for extra power. All of the carbon in the trees and twigs the machine ingests ends up in the ground — not back in the air.

But biomass watchdogs warn previous attempts at technology like Arbor’s have fallen short.

This biomass process creates a dry, flaky ash mainly composed of minerals — essentially everything in the original biomass that wasn’t “bio” — that can include heavy metals that the dead plants sucked up from the air or soil. If agricultural or construction waste is used, it can include nasty chemicals from wood treatments and pesticides.

Arbor plans — at least initially — on using woody biomass directly from the forest, which typically contains less of these dangerous ash chemicals.

Turning wood waste into gas also generates a thick, black tar composed of volatile organic compounds — which are also common contaminants following wildfires. The company says its gasification process uses high enough temperatures to break down the troublesome tar, but researchers say tar is an inevitable byproduct of this process.

Watchdogs also caution that the math to determine whether bioenergy projects sequester or release carbon is complicated and finicky.

“Biomass is tricky, and there’s a million exceptions to every rule that need to be accounted for,” said Zeke Hausfather, climate research lead with Frontier Climate, which vets carbon capture projects such as Arbor’s and connects them with companies interested in buying carbon credits. “There are examples where we have found a project that actually works on the carbon accounting math, but we didn’t want to do it because it was touching Canadian boreal forest that’s old-growth forest.”

Frontier Climate, along with the company Isometric, audits Arbor’s technology and operations. However, critics note that because both companies ultimately support the sale of carbon credits, their assessments may be biased.

At worst, biomass projects can decimate forests and release their stored carbon into the atmosphere. Arbor hopes, instead, to be a best-case scenario: improving — or at least maintaining — forest health and stuffing carbon underground.

When it all goes South

Arbor had initially planned to build a proof of concept in Placer County. To do it, Arbor won $2 million through McCarthy’s Cal Fire program and $500,000 through a state Department of Conservation program in 2023.

But as California fell into a deficit in 2023, state funding dried up.

So Arbor turned to private investors. In September 2024, Arbor reached an agreement with Microsoft in which the technology company would buy carbon credits backed by Arbor’s sequestration. In July of this year, the company announced a $41-million deal (well over 15 times the funding it ever received from California) with Frontier Climate, whose carbon credit buyers include Google, the online payment company Stripe and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook.

To fulfill the credits, it would build its first commercial facility near Lake Charles, La., in part powering nearby data centers.

“We were very excited about Arbor,” McCarthy said. “They pretty much walked away from their grant and said they’re not going to do this in California. … We were disappointed in that.”

But for Arbor, relying on the state was no longer feasible.

“We can’t rely on California for the money to develop the technology and deploy the initial systems,” said Hartwig, standing in Arbor’s plant-covered El Segundo office. “For a lot of reasons, it makes sense to go test the machine, improve the technology in the market elsewhere before we actually get to do deployments in California, which is a much more difficult permitting and regulatory environment.”

It’s not the first next-generation biomass company based in California to build elsewhere. San Francisco-based Charm Industrial, whose technology doesn’t involve energy generation, began its sequestration efforts in the Midwest and plans to expand into Louisiana.

The American South has less stringent logging and environmental regulations, which has led biomass energy projects to flock to the area: In 2024, about 2.3% of the South’s energy came from woody biomass — up from 2% in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, that number on the West Coast was only 1.2%, continuing on its slow decline.

And, unlike in the West, companies aiming to create wood pellets to ship abroad have proliferated in the South. In 2024, the U.S. produced more than 10.7 million tons of biomass pellets; 82% of which was exported. That’s up from virtually zero in 2000. The vast majority of the biomass pellets produced last year — 84% — was from the South.

Watchdogs warn that this lack of guardrails has allowed the biomass industry to harm the South’s forests, pollute poor communities living near biomass facilities and fall short of its climate claims.

Over the last five years, Drax — a company that harvests and exports wood pellets and was working with Golden State Natural Resources — has had to pay Louisiana and Mississippi a combined $5 million for violating air pollution laws. Residents living next to biomass plants, like Drax’s, say the operations have worsened asthma and routinely leave a film of dust on their cars.

But operating a traditional biomass facility or shipping wood pellets to Europe wasn’t Arbor’s founding goal — albeit powering data centers in the American South wasn’t exactly either.

Hartwig, who grew up in the Golden State, hopes Arbor’s technology can someday return to California to help finance the solution for the wildfire crisis he spent so many years facing head-on.

“We’ve got an interest in Arkansas, in Texas, all the way up to Minnesota,” Hartwig said. “Eventually, we’d like to come back to California.”",https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/bba8e55/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3000x1575+0+235/resize/1200x630!/quality/75/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F4c%2F22%2Fd0681eeb432e9d7c0f9d2c6c1a81%2F1516003-enviro-new-carbon-capture-tech-02-mjc.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 10:59:36.289894

The Irony Blowing Across the Plains

Donald Trump stood at the U.N. railing against wind turbines, sneering that renewables are a scam. The irony? The states with the most wind turbines are the same ones that voted for him. Texas, Iowa, Oklahoma, Kansas, North Dakota, South Dakota — all deep-red, all leaders in renewable energy production.

This isn’t liberal California’s doing. It’s geography and economics. The windiest land in America just happens to be in Trump country, and you can’t make an oil rig sprout out of cornfields.

Culture War vs. Checkbook War

Here’s the two-step GOP hustle:

Culture War: On Fox News and campaign stages, renewables are painted as “elite fantasies,” “ugly bird killers,” or part of some Green New Deal plot to control your thermostat.

Checkbook War: Back home, those same lawmakers cut ribbons at wind farms, brag about the jobs, and quietly take credit for federal dollars flowing into their districts.

The disconnect is staggering. According to the Department of Energy, Texas alone generates over 28% of America’s wind power, and rural counties are flush with property tax revenue from turbines. In Iowa, nearly 60% of the state’s electricity comes from wind. These aren’t tree-hugger policies — they’re red-state cash cows.

State-by-State: Who’s Cashing In?

Notice the pattern? The redder the state, the bigger the turbine.

By 2028, U.S. electric vehicle (EV) manufacturers are projected to produce approximately 4.7 million EVs annually. This growth will fuel demand for charging stations, infrastructure, batteries, supply chain operations and more. As the EV sector continues to grow, Governors are assessing the workforce infrastructure needed to ensure it drives economic growth, strengthens local industries and expands opportunity for their residents. Meeting this moment requires a larger, more highly skilled workforce, with opportunities that are well-paying, wide-ranging and accessible through community colleges, apprenticeships and workforce training programs nationwide.

However, persistent myths and misconceptions about EV careers are slowing progress and creating barriers for students, job seekers, educators and employers, resulting in untapped talent that could be put to work in a rapidly growing sector. Below, we unpack some of the most common EV workforce myths and share examples of real pathways that exist today.

Myth 1: EV Jobs Are Only Engineering or Highly Technical Roles

Most EV careers are hands-on and don’t require an engineering degree. This industry spans electrical work, assembly, automotive maintenance and advanced manufacturing with roles for battery technicians, machinists, assemblers, industrial production managers, electricians and power-line installers. Many of these jobs are learned through experience on the job or apprenticeships.

As EV technology and infrastructure expands, so does the demand for a broader range of skills and occupations. Growth in charging infrastructure alone is creating new opportunities for power-line installers, repairers and electricians who maintain EV systems.

The EV workforce is broad, hands-on and open to people with diverse backgrounds. It covers five key areas: scientific research, design and development, manufacturing, maintenance and repair, and charging infrastructure development. For workforce strategies, this means tapping into a wide talent pool and promoting multiple entry-points into the sector.

Myth 2: You Need A College Degree To Enter The EV Industry

Global electric car sales topped 17 million in 2024, accounting for over 20% of all new cars sold. This surge is creating high-demand, well-paying roles across the EV industry, many of which don’t require a four-year degree. Short-term training programs, apprenticeships and community college pathways provide direct access into careers ranging from EV maintenance to battery manufacturing.

From wiring and mechanical assembly to safety protocols, the industry values hands-on skills and experience often more than formal degrees. Competency-based training and industry certifications offer job seekers efficient pathways into these growing careers, saving both time and the cost of traditional higher education.

Myth 3: The Electric Vehicle Workforce Isn’t Diverse

A growing number of programs are working to diversify the EV talent pipeline. Programs like Rosie’s Girls in Philadelphia introduce high school girls to EV technology through a 63-hour pre-apprenticeship program with real-world training. In Denver, Women Who Charge fosters growth of the EV industry by hosting networking events, recognizing women leaders in the field and developing best practices on project designs that are female friendly.

ChargerHelp, a leader in EV charging technology, launched SmarterHelp to scale training for in-demand technical careers. The organization is taking an equity-centered approach to workforce training and job placement by supporting workers and learners from various backgrounds and with varying levels of skills and work experience – like youth and people with records – and training them for careers in the clean energy sector. They are starting with the EVSE Reliability Technician Training program to prepare a diverse workforce for the growing sector.

These combined efforts are helping ensure the EV workforce reflects the diversity of the communities it serves.

Myth 4: EV Training Needs Don’t Translate Across Industries

The skills required to build and maintain electric vehicles are highly transferable, spanning traditional auto manufacturing and energy sectors among others. Technical knowledge in diagnostics, data analysis, assembly, project management and quality assurance testing is equally valuable in fields like advanced manufacturing, solar and clean energy, AI and infrastructure. Learning skills for an EV job doesn’t confine someone to a singular career path.

Training providers and community colleges are responding by designing curricula that integrate skills from overlapping sectors. This effort is reinforced by national organizations working to provide structure and guidance for states. For example, Advance CTE has developed an energy and natural resources career cluster – groupings of related career areas within the energy sector that share common skills – to assist workers and learners in navigating their career options and upskilling opportunities. This approach strengthens the EV talent pipeline while providing workers with greater career flexibility in a rapidly evolving economy.

Conclusion

Dispelling myths about who can work in the EV sector is more than just setting the record straight; it’s about opening doors and helping people pursue careers that feel stable, rewarding and worthwhile. If left unchallenged, these outdated assumptions will continue to block access for many people – an issue Governors may want to weigh as they consider policies that broaden pathways into the EV workforce and ensure inclusive economic growth.

The EV Workforce Collaborative, a partnership between the National Governors Association and the National League of Cities powered by the Siemens Foundation, has already helped states and cities consider policies, funding and workforce strategies that help build an inclusive EV workforce. By addressing shared challenges, expanding training for underrepresented communities, and investing in transferable, industry-aligned certifications, the Collaborative is bringing organizations together around the shared mission of helping more people envision themselves in EV careers. Through this effort, Taskforce and Working Group members are ensuring that as the EV industry grows, the workforce grows with it, remaining diverse, skilled and ready to power the future of transportation.

When the clock strikes midnight on Oct. 1, the $7,500 federal tax credit on EVs will expire, potentially turning affordable electric carriages into showroom pumpkins.

Sales of electric cars are certain to dip. Real-world prices will rise. The only question is how much, and for how long, as President Donald Trump and his administration continue to go scorched-earth over climate change and kneecap support for electric cars and renewable energy.

With one eye on the clock, consumers bought more new EVs in August 2025 than in any other month in US history: Sales reached 146,332 cars, up nearly 18 percent year over year, according to Cox Automotive. Nearly one in 10 new cars — 9.9 percent — was fully electric, another market milestone. Used EVs, good for credits of up to $4,000, set their own record with nearly 41,000 sales.

With one eye on the clock, consumers bought more new EVs in August 2025 than in any other month in US history

Those sales came despite a stubbornly high price premium of $9,066 versus a typical internal combustion model, according to Cox. But that calculation doesn’t take credits into account, meaning $7,500 credits helped many buyers get closer to elusive “price parity” with gasoline models — precisely what credits were designed to do, to spark mainstream adoption and combat climate change. In July and August, between credits and fire-sale incentives, the average EV cost $44,908, or $600 less than the $45,521 paid for ICE models, according to J.D. Power.

Now those clean-car credits that benefited buyers and automakers, first conceived in 1992 during the George H.W. Bush administration, are sailing off into the sunset. President Barack Obama switched an existing $7,500 credit to a point-of-sale rebate, with a goal of getting 1 million EVs on the road. Rebates continued as a cornerstone of President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act, but tied to a dizzying array of domestic-sourcing rules and restrictions that created confusion for buyers.

“Without doubt we will see a sales dip, but it won’t fall off a cliff,” says Ivan Drury, director of insights for Edmunds.com. “It’s not like people aren’t going to buy EVs.”

Short-term pain

EV sales could drop as much as 27 percent after consumers lose tax breaks, according to a study from economics professors Joseph Shapiro, Felix Tintelnot, and Hunt Allcott. Coincidentally, that 27 percent sales decline is exactly what Germany experienced over the first 10 months of 2024, after the government abruptly killed incentives worth $4,900.

Many experts bemoan the sudden loss of credits here, especially with EVs already fighting hurricane-force headwinds. A phase-out over a few years would give the market time to adjust.

Short-term pain will ensue, yet some experts liken the situation to tearing off the Band-Aid. Automakers will have to step up their electric games and deliver truly affordable EVs, with no excuses or subsidies to hide behind. Optimistically, perhaps, EVs may carry less tiresome political baggage, rather than being a symbol of government overreach or an “EV mandate” that never existed.

“A lot of the murkiness goes away, and to some degree, the stigma,” Drury says. “You say, ‘Oh, the government shouldn’t be subsidizing cars’? That’s gone, and now it’s just another car. There are fewer reasons and rationales to say no.”

Leasing lessons

Consumers will also have to fully commit to the tech, buying their EV rather than leasing to take advantage of the IRA’s controversial leasing loophole — a back door that allowed even the wealthiest households to knock $7,500 off the priciest imported luxury EVs.

“We know this will change the dynamic of how people buy EVs, but it’s almost in a positive way,” Drury says. “You’ll have customers who are in it for the long haul. You’ll get more people who buy an EV on its merits, because it’s the best car in its class, not because it’s a cheap lease or the lowest price.”

Why should EV fans or carbon-conscious Americans care how people pay for their cars? When the IRA was passed in August 2022, about 7 percent of EVs were leased, according to Edmunds. By November 2024, that shot to 79 percent, and lease percentages now hover around 70 percent. No one can blame consumers for seeking the best deal on a car. But the market distortion of leasing credits has tarnished the perception and long-term value of many EVs. Most ICE automakers had internalized the lesson: If you give too many cars away via leases or rental fleets, you’ll pay a steep price later.

“A lot of the murkiness goes away, and to some degree, the stigma.”

Among 10 models with the worst residual prices after three years, eight are EVs, including the Mercedes EQS, Nissan Leaf, and popular Kia EV6, which lose more than half their original value.

Lingering, unfounded stigma over EV battery life — despite typical 10-year, 100,000-mile warranties — play some role in shaky residuals. But in a vicious circle, those battery suspicions are fed by the glut of low-mileage EVs coming off leases, herds of white (or green) elephants that dealers must offload. The takeaway is that used EVs are damaged goods, giving the oil industry or online skeptics more ammunition to scare people away.

“We have better EVs today. The batteries aren’t dying,” Drury says. “But when people see all these two- and three-year-old EVs on lots, and a $100,000 car that’s down to $50,000, they become suspect.”

Fewer choices

Without a backstop from credits, automakers are still in a tricky spot. Many will need to adjust EV prices downward or boost incentives — cash back, zero down, or low-interest deals — to soften the blow to consumers and avoid a sales collapse. If automakers can’t move EVs at current prices, they certainly can’t sell them for $7,500 more. When Tesla and General Motors faced an earlier credit phase-out in 2019, after crossing the 250,000 mark in cumulative EV sales, both responded by cutting prices.

Yet Tesla aside, every major automaker already loses money on every EV they sell, as they work to scale up and reduce battery costs. With domestic and foreign brands already swallowing massive tariff bills, without passing many price increases to customers, their bottom lines are becoming so many rolls of Bounty: They can only absorb so much.

“You’ll get more people who buy an EV on its merits”

At least temporarily, consumers will see fewer choices in EVs, as spooked automakers renew their love affairs with gasoline and play along with Trump’s bid to unwind regulations. Affordable hybrids and PHEVs, their sales already booming, look like clear winners in a post-credit world.

Reversals and do-overs are coming on a near-daily basis: Honda will stop making the Acura ZDX that GM assembles in Tennessee. Stellantis killed off its long-awaited Ram electric pickup, with its titanic, 229 kilowatt-hour battery pack and 500-mile range, before it sold even one. Tariff-tossed brands that import EVs from overseas, such as Volvo, Audi, and Mercedes, have the least wiggle room. Volvo nixed its ES90 sedan for America. Porsche postponed a three-row electric SUV flagship, and took a painful $2.1 billion writedown on its electric operations.

Drury says that, like the “compliance cars” of another era, half-hearted or fitfully competitive EVs like the ZDX or Audi Q4 e-tron will fall by the wayside. Only the strongest entries, and automakers, will maneuver through newly hostile terrain and come out whole on the other side.

“We’re going to be filtering out the crowd to see who really makes the best EVs,” Drury says.

No automaker will simply walk away from the electric game, he adds, lest they cede customers to nimbler brands. Once loyal customers are lost, as Detroit once learned against Japanese automakers, they may never return.

While Trump and co. paint the end of credits as a victory for affordability and consumer choice, their moves to wind back the clock on fossil fuels — perhaps to the days of Daniel Plainview — make clear they have no interest in a level playing field. Trump tapped men with deep ties to the fossil-fuel industry to lead his Energy and Interior departments. As The Washington Post reported, he called for $1 billion in oil-industry donations at a Mar-a-Lago fundraiser in 2024, backed by an explicit promise to roll back emissions regulations if elected. In a rambling jeremiad at the United Nations this week, the president claimed EVs and renewable energy are a road to economic ruin.

‘Like a Greek tragedy’

As former director of the EPA’s Office of Transportation and Air Quality, Margo Oge was the architect of President Obama’s landmark 2012 auto emissions rules that demanded automakers double their fuel efficiency and halve greenhouse emissions. Back then, lithium-ion batteries cost more than $800 a kilowatt-hour, about eight times what they do today. Oge and the administration figured that if just three percent of consumers bought EVs by 2025, America could meet targets that called for a 54.4mpg fleetwide average. After reaching 8.1 percent market share in 2024, EVs were brushing 10 percent of the market in August, more than three times those expectations in 2012.

“We’ve seen so much progress” Oge says, due largely to government subsidies and firm fuel-economy targets that spurred automakers to get serious about electrified models.

“Now it’s like a Greek tragedy,” Oge says. “I would hate to be the CEO of GM or Ford. Everyone is fearful and intimidated to speak out. But as politely as they can, they are saying, ‘Give us a reason to invest and have certainty.’”

“I would hate to be the CEO of GM or Ford”

Oge said one might fairly argue whether Biden’s pollution and EV targets for 2031 were too ambitious. But Washington now seeks to nullify fuel standards entirely, and even deny California’s legally affirmed right to set its own pollution and climate-change rules.

“The administration is saying standards don’t even exist, the EPA has no authority, and they’ll give the oil industry everything they’ve been looking for,” she says.

Gov. Gavin Newsom of California yesterday reversed a pledge to offer state credits to keep models more affordable, saying, “We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits.”

But Oge believes blue states especially need to step in to help offset the loss of credits, and affirm their support of EVs.

“It’s not just about climate change, but our country’s competitiveness,” Oge says. “Our domestic industry has to continue to innovate, for the long-term survival of the industry.”",https://platform.theverge.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/257977_clock_run_out_on_EVs_CVirginia-.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0%2C10.732984293194%2C100%2C78.534031413613&w=1200,N,,2025-09-30 09:00:04.946078

Signed into law by former President Joe Biden in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act, for the duration of its three-year life, the electric vehicle tax credit eased the financial burden for manufacturers and consumers as Americans embarked on the transition from fossil fuel-dependent cars to the more climate-friendly electric option.

The transition to cleaner electric vehicles is a key part of the global effort to reduce humanity’s carbon footprint and fight against climate change. But electric vehicles are a new industry, the technology is still expensive and growing, and they have a tough fight against the heavily established, and still directly and indirectly subsidized fossil fuel-dependent auto industry.

“We need incentives to help try to replace as many gasoline vehicles with electric vehicles as possible,” David Reichmuth, senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists’ Clean Transportation Program, told Gizmodo. “Transportation is the largest source of global warming pollution in the country, and passenger vehicles are the largest source within transportation. There’s really no way to make the reductions we need to make to avoid the worst damages from climate change without switching from fossil fuels to cleaner electric vehicles powered by renewable energy.”

The tax credit also helped build up the American electric vehicle industry and bring manufacturing back to North America at a time when Chinese and European competitors are running circles around the American electric vehicle industry. To qualify for the electric vehicle tax credit, the vehicles were required to have been assembled in North America.

But that all comes to an end today, as the tax credit officially expires. President Trump is to thank for that.

Trump was never shy about his distaste for the electric vehicle tax credit on the campaign trail. When elected President, it was one of his first orders of business to start the dismantling process of the incentive. That process was finalized when Trump’s “big beautiful” spending bill passed Congress and was signed into law in July.

What was the tax credit?

The electric vehicle tax credit was threefold: a new car sales tax credit of up to $7,500 and a used car sales tax credit of up to $4,000, both of which consumers could get back on their tax returns, and a leasing tax credit of up to $7,500 that was claimed by leasing companies and translated to lower costs for consumers.

Even before Biden pushed for the electric vehicle tax credit, climate-friendly policy in one shape or another had protected American electric vehicle manufacturers for more than a decade.

The predecessor of the current electric vehicle tax credits was first introduced in 2008, under the second administration of Republican President George W. Bush. But there was a cap on the number of rebates per manufacturer, so the benefits expired faster for big names like Tesla. Biden’s EV tax credit changed that and expanded the rule further to include new eligibility requirements, such as putting an income limit and requiring the final assembly location to be in North America.

What now?

The looming end of the tax credit led to a record-breaking surge in electric vehicle sales in August and September as companies tried to empty out their EV stocks, and consumers who were thinking about buying or leasing EVs rushed to get theirs before the deadline.

Going forward, experts have grim sales expectations for electric vehicles, at least in the short term, as those who would have bought EVs in, say, November or December already made the purchase.

In the longer term, though, demand is likely to pick back up again, although likely to be slower than before, at least in the foreseeable future.

Hyundai Motor CEO José Muñoz told reporters earlier this month that even though the company expects short-term demand to go down, in the mid to long-term, they are expecting electric vehicle demand to continue to grow.

Ultimately, the repeal of this tax credit is bound to disproportionately affect newcomers in the electric vehicle industry. Although big names like Tesla and Rivian will likely be hurt, to some extent, by the decrease in consumer demand, they will continue to dominate the market while other automakers pull back on EVs, and potential new competition is discouraged from entering the industry. Tesla CEO Elon Musk last year advocated for the end of the subsidies himself, saying that “it will only help Tesla.”

It is also going to disproportionately impact relatively lower-income buyers who relied on the cost cuts to buy electric vehicles, while the EVs in the luxury car market are likely to continue to see demand from higher-income buyers for whom the tax credit was less of a reason to purchase, Reichmuth said.

“It might change some decisions, but probably not a whole lot, you’re probably already interested in buying that EV for other reasons besides the tax credit,” Reichmuth said of luxury buyers.

States and companies are likely to step in

So what to do? Is it all doom and gloom for electric vehicles? Likely not.

Electric vehicles are here to stay. They are a key part of the fight against climate change, and have high adoption rates elsewhere in the world, especially where the industry has received ample government support.

Even American companies that are pulling back production in the face of an uncertain regulatory environment are vowing to return.

In response to the expiration of the EV tax credit, GM cut output at a major electric vehicle assembly plant, temporarily laid off workers, and indefinitely delayed a shift at a Kansas City assembly plant that was set to produce electric Chevy Bolts later this year. Despite that, CEO Mary Barra has said, as recently as this month, that electric vehicles are still the company’s “north star.”

The cost has to come down to make EVs more attractive to consumers. In the absence of federal leadership on this issue, Reichmuth suggests that companies that are still dedicated to an electric future will take matters into their own hands, and that state regulators are likely to step in.

Car manufacturers that have built up electric vehicle capability, like GM or Hyundai, might start offering incentives like cash-back offers, special interest rates, discounts, lease deals, and more to bring down the cost of electric vehicles, similar to those already offered for various gasoline vehicles that are deemed slow sellers.

States and other local authorities are also likely to step in. There are already numerous regional incentives available for electric vehicles, and it’s looking more likely that this will increase in the coming years.

“[California] had a state EV rebate that went away, especially when the federal tax credit was there, and I think we may see some form of that come back as well,” Reichmuth said. “I think we’re going to see a lot more happening at the state level than at the federal level, at least in probably the next three years or so.”",https://gizmodo.com/app/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_2358351943-1200x675.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 09:00:09.180128

First launched in October 2023, 24M ETOP is both an electrode- and chemistry-agnostic battery manufacturing platform that integrates electrodes directly into the battery pack, removing the limitations of traditional cell-and-module designs. By effectively eliminating cell manufacturing, 24M ETOP offers manufacturers a simpler, more cost-effective path to build compact, high-voltage batteries with maximum energy density and design flexibility.

“The pressure to compete on price, design and performance is mounting for American industries that are heavily reliant on imported batteries,” said Naoki Ota, 24M President and CEO. “The U.S. must advance battery innovation, not just scale production to close the gap with competitors overseas. Our 24M ETOP offers U.S. manufacturers the technology they need to leapfrog Asian counterparts with industry-leading energy density, first-of-its-kind design flexibility, and lower manufacturing costs.”

A Revolutionary Battery Pack and Manufacturing Process Designed for the U.S. Market

Current manufacturing processes build battery packs and modules from individual cells, which introduce a significant proportion of inactive, non-energy-carrying materials, like metals and plastics, within a cell’s casing. This outdated approach wastes space, reduces energy efficiency, increases costs, and limits design flexibility.

24M ETOP addresses these challenges and fundamentally transforms the battery manufacturing process by creating a sealed anode/cathode pair that is integrated directly into the battery pack, eliminating the need for individual cells, modules, and unnecessary materials. This innovation eliminates conventional cell structures entirely in high-voltage systems and allows manufacturers to achieve the highest energy density at the pack level for any chemistry because a higher percentage of the battery comprises electrodes and other active materials, which are the only energy-carrying components. In a traditional battery pack, electrodes comprise 30% to 60% of a battery’s volume, whereas with 24M ETOP, electrode content reaches up to 80% of a pack’s volume.

24M ETOP enables manufacturers to cost effectively compete against larger Asian manufacturers by operating simple, flexible and low-cost battery manufacturing lines in the U.S. Companies can integrate the 24M ETOP technology – which makes sealed electrodes, stacks them into the pack, wires them, and closes the pack, all from a single machine – directly into their battery pack assembly lines.

24M ETOP is especially well-suited for emerging markets like eVTOL -- projected to reach $1.75 billion by 2028 -- where compact, lightweight designs that deliver maximum power, extended range, and cost efficiency are essential. Key benefits 24M ETOP provides manufacturers include:

Unmatched Energy Density and Range: Unleashes up to 50% more electric vehicle range by packing more energy into a same-sized battery

Unprecedented Design Flexibility: Offers unprecedented design flexibility for manufacturing battery packs of virtually any size, configuration, chemistry or voltage. It can be sized to fit any application, from large-scale grid batteries to EVs to mobility applications including e-bikes two and three-wheelers, to consumer applications

Cost Efficient Offering: Allows manufactures to begin production and achieve GWh-level 24M ETOP production capabilities with relatively low capital expenditures and minimal, if any, facility investments

Significant Cost Savings and Tax Credit Advantages: Delivers substantial cost savings through a streamlined manufacturing process and eligibility for U.S. production tax credits under Section 45X of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)

For optimized results, 24M ETOP can be used in conjunction with 24M Impervio™ separator for added safety and 24M's Eternalyte™ electrolyte for fast charging down to minus 40° temperatures. Together with 24M ETOP and Impervio, manufacturers can deliver a cost-effective and safe 1,000-mile-per-charge battery pack, overcoming previous challenges with solid-state electrolytes.

As they prepare to collectively spend hundreds of billions of dollars in build-outs, there's one glaring bottleneck: labor.

In the manufacturing, construction and electrical trades, there's a dearth of talent as skilled laborers age out of the workforce without being replaced by younger workers. The U.S. could face a shortfall of 1.9 million manufacturing workers by 2033, according to data earlier this year from the National Association of Manufacturers, which described the matter as an ""economic and national security issue.""

In construction, Associated Builders and Contractors, or ABC, projects nearly half a million workers will be needed in 2025 alone. Add to the worker shortages the uncertainty that comes with new tariffs and changes to immigration policy, and the problem begins to appear potentially insurmountable, experts say.

""I think these projects are likely to go over budget and miss their deadlines, but that is typical in U.S. construction, even for not-so-complicated, large projects,"" said Anirban Basu, chief economist for ABC. ""Now you add this layer of complexity, this need for precision, that would not exist in a typical apartment building or office building. ... Do we have the workforce for that? Not in abundance, that's for sure.""

ABC's construction backlog data shows that 14% of the group's members are under contract to perform work on data centers, a level that's held steady since the question was first posed in June, and indicates there's a backlog of 8.5 months on projects.

Meanwhile, the construction unemployment rate sank to 3.2% in August, tied for a record low, from 3.4% a month earlier, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

George Carrillo, CEO of the Hispanic Construction Council, told CNBC the worker shortage is already impacting data center development. Carrillo said Hispanic-owned firms are the fastest growing in construction. A recent study from his group called for reforms that would cut permitting timelines, speed up payments to small contractors and create a lawful work pathway for trained people.

""These projects represent trillions in investment but require more than steel and concrete,"" Carrillo said in an email, citing a projected shortage in construction workers of 3.2 million by 2030.

""Retirements, restrictive immigration policies, and deportation threats are shrinking the labor pool, creating the risk that data centers become stranded assets, billion-dollar buildings that cannot go online,"" he said.

Mike Bellaman, CEO of ABC, told CNBC that speed of service is critical for data center builds because of the immediate demand.

That could present a big opportunity for younger workers or those new to the industry to enhance their skills and advance in rank, taking advantage of the need for people who are trained across a variety of areas.

""They can become quickly masters of the trade of installing that work,"" Bellaman said. ""They have a huge opportunity to get a lot of on-the-job training and practical training where they become masters, so we can get apprentices up to journeyman level and specific tasks.""

Many of the jobs can last from three years to a decade given the size of the projects, said Pat Lynch, executive managing director and global lead of CBRE's Global Data Center Solutions. Lynch compared the projects to the building of railroads or large oil and gas deployments.

At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.
In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early?
But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.
So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected.","The Republican tax and spending package that passed in early July brought an early end to federal EV tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used ones. The credits end on September 30. Specifically, buyers need to have a binding contract in place by that time — the vehicle itself can be delivered later.

Anybody who was thinking of getting an EV soon-ish suddenly had a four-figure incentive to get one fast.

The result was pretty predictable: Sales of EVs shot up.

""The past couple of weeks — even in the past several days — EV sales just exploded,"" says Matt Jones, the senior director of industry relations at the auto marketplace TrueCar. ""It's been bonkers.""

Surveys have shown that many Americans were not even aware the EV tax credits existed. But some dealers and carmakers have been trying to raise awareness with ads focusing on the new deadline. For example, if you were shopping for a new Tesla this week, you would have seen a countdown clock on the website ticking away second by second to the last moment on Tuesday that you could place an order and still get the tax credit — if you met all the requirements.

The automotive services and tech company Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales in the third quarter — July, August and September — are up 21.1% from the same period last year, and up 30% from this spring. J.D. Power, another auto data giant, reports that EV sales made up more than 11% of the U.S. market in August — hitting a level ""only achieved once before in December of 2024."" At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.

Used EVs are also selling quickly, and Cars Commerce, the company behind Cars.com, reports that vehicles under $25,000 — the ones that are potentially eligible for the used vehicle tax credit — are the fastest-selling EVs on the used market.

The bump in EV sales was big enough to boost the entire auto market. According to the auto website Edmunds, this quarter will likely see the strongest Q3 new vehicle sales since before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020.

But there's a flip side, of course.

""The end of the tax credit created a rush in September, but it could also trigger an EV hangover in the months ahead,"" writes analyst Ivan Drury of Edmunds.

In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early? Well, now they won't be buying one later this year. So the EVs that didn't get snapped up before the deadline might have a harder time finding a buyer.

Like the rush, the hangover is expected to be temporary. Major automakers are still investing in EVs (partly out of a desire to compete with China), and the appeal of a quiet, low-maintenance vehicle that never needs a fill-up is unaffected by tax policy.

J.D. Power reports that more than half of new-vehicle shoppers say they're very likely or somewhat likely to consider buying an EV in the next year, and that number has stayed fairly consistent.

But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.

The research firm Rhodium Group has estimated that the early end to the tax credits will reduce EV sales by 16 to 38% compared to how sales might have grown — and that's on top of other policy changes, like major changes to emissions rules, that are also expected to slow EV sales.

So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected. How much slower, exactly, no one knows.

Automakers will be waiting to see what ""natural demand"" for their electric offerings actually looks like without the incentive of a big tax break.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims3/default/strip/false/crop/4799x2699+0+500/resize/1400/quality/100/format/jpeg/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fb3%2F4d%2F625ee8f44b02bcbedd280ba64d13%2Fap25199767055970.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 08:59:36.102093

That means after Tuesday, people can no longer use a $7,500 federal tax credit to buy an EV.

Up until now, The Colorado Automobile Dealers Association (CADA) said there was more of a rush to buy EVs before the deadline, but sales are expected to decline. Despite that, CADA CEO Matthew Groves said Colorado is still expected to remain ahead of others when it comes to EV sales.

""We were at 25% where most of the states around us are at six or seven. So we've got a ways to fall,"" Groves said.

As for what comes next, Groves thinks dealerships and manufacturers could offer deals to make up the difference, but he said it won't happen right away. He advised watching for changes, starting in about a month.

Groves also said manufacturers are already showing signs of changing their strategy over the next several years.

""Manufacturers are changing their strategy and redirecting a little bit from pure battery electric towards a traditional hybrid vehicle,"" he said.

Outlook for electric vehicle sales after federal tax credit expires Tuesday

""Traditional hybrids were at 14% so they're doing very, very well organically,"" he added. ""And we think that probably some of the loss will transition back to hybrids. Because one, they're better for the environment. You're getting 40 plus miles a gallon, and two, they're significantly cheaper. You know, the amount of rare earth metals it takes to make a lithium ion battery is about nine times what it takes to make a traditional hybrid. So you can manufacture more of them and continue to keep them affordable for consumers.""

Tax credits, interest rates and tariffs all play a role in EV purchases and trends, and data continues to be collected.

Groves said he knows some people who own EVs already are worried about infrastructure for their cars but wanted to reassured them.

""Dealers in Colorado made investments several years ago to be able to help consumers operate and maintain those vehicles, and nothing's going to change there,"" Groves said.

Groves also shared some additional insight CADA just received from the IRS, which indicates if you are buying an EV, the deal has to be done by September 30.

""As long as the deal is contracted by by the deadline, you don't actually have to take possession by the deadline,"" Groves said. ""If you've ordered a vehicle that's not in yet, so long as you have a deposit down and a contract on it, it can come through on, you know, the sixth or the seventh or the 15th, you'll be okay.""",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7ad74ef/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1280x672+0+48/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fbf%2Ff0%2F7ae71a20408eb3fb563dd2194da6%2Fanusha-ev-rebates.png,N,,2025-09-30 08:59:40.494009

Ford and GM are using dealer programs to extend the $7,500 federal EV tax credit beyond its September 30 expiration, allowing leases to continue with the subsidy included.

The programs involve automakers’ financing arms making down payments on EV inventory to secure the tax credit before transferring the vehicles to consumers via leases.

Industry analysts warn that EV sales and leases could fall sharply after the subsidy ends, making these programs a critical tool for sustaining demand in the short term.

Ford and General Motors are rolling out programs for their dealers that effectively extend the $7,500 federal tax credit on electric vehicle leases past the September 30 expiration, according to an exclusive Reuters report.

The programs use the automakers’ financing arms to make down payments on EVs in dealer inventories, allowing the vehicles to qualify for the tax credit. Dealers can then offer leases to customers for several more months with the subsidy included.

Additionally, the initiatives are designed to mitigate the expected decline in EV sales and leases following the expiration of the subsidy, which has encouraged EV adoption for over 15 years. GM confirmed the program in a statement to Reuters on Monday, but Ford has not commented publicly on the program.

Industry executives and analysts had predicted a sharp slowdown in EV sales after the credit ended, especially following a recent surge in purchases from buyers rushing to meet the September 30 deadline.

Under the programs, the automakers’ financing arms effectively “purchase” vehicles in dealer stock through down payments, securing the $7,500 credit. Dealers then offer leases to customers as usual, with the tax credit factored into the monthly payments. Both companies developed the programs in consultation with officials from the Internal Revenue Service (IRS).

The federal EV tax credit, enacted more than 15 years ago, applies to vehicles acquired by September 30, according to guidance from the IRS. Acquisition is demonstrated through a binding written contract and a payment on the vehicle by that date.

More price peaks and dips throughout the day also allowed higher earnings for traders and increase the demand for even better forecasts, trading systems, and financial instruments to cover the more detailed pricing scheme.","The upcoming change to 15-minute-trading intervals on Europe’s electricity market on 1 October has been hailed by energy companies as a leap forward in the region’s efforts to transition towards renewable energy supply. Energy provider Vattenfall said the change on the day-ahead-market from one hour to quarter-hourly pricing shifts would herald “a new era” that better reflects weather dynamics shaping renewable energy output, thereby allowing more flexibility and a market design that truly integrates wind and solar power production.

“The reform opens an opportunity to make the integration of electricity from wind and solar power installations even more efficient,” said Jörg Seidel, head of short-term output optimisation at Vattenfall. The “rigid” structure of hourly trading so far had led to inefficiencies and re-adjustments, which should become a thing of the past with the new and more granular system in place.

“Supply and demand can now be reflected much more accurately,” which would allow for a more efficient use of batteries or pumped-storage systems, Seidel added. Power customers could benefit from this by combining smart meters and dynamic power tariffs to receive electricity when it is cheapest. “Flexibility more and more is becoming the energy transition’s currency,” Seidel said.

“Price differences become more clearly visible,” Schall said, which would incentivise investments in flexibility.

Schall said smart metering and systems that launch electric appliances such as heat pumps, batteries or wallboxes for charging electric vehicles when prices are lowest are needed to let customers truly benefit from the changes. “Those who don’t use flexible devices or don’t have a dynamic tariff won’t immediately take note of the switch,” he added.",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-09-30 09:58:09.664708

But they’ll have to overcome environmental advocates and other Democrats hostile to that phrase and all it entails. They are pushing instead for a quick move away from all fossil fuels to address global warming.

Despite such hurdles, many Democrats see an opening to embrace all energy sources in the face of attacks from Hill Republicans and the Trump administration on wind and solar.

“We have an energy crisis, electricity prices for homeowners and businesses have gone up over 20 percent in New Jersey,” Energy and Commerce ranking member Frank Pallone (D-N.J.), said in an interview. “The only answer is all of the above.”

Party leaders have urged Democrats to pin rising energy costs on President Donald Trump and Republicans, citing the phaseout of Inflation Reduction Act tax incentives that were bolstering renewable energy projects around the country.

Republicans are betting on the administration’s work to expand drilling, mining and nuclear, and prevent coal plants from shutting down.

But for Democrats, reviving “all of the above” dovetails with their focus on abundance and affordability. Their pitch: They’ll lower costs, no matter the energy source.

“To meet American energy needs, we need an all-of-the-above energy approach. Wind, solar, geothermal, you name it,” said Sen. John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.) in a post on the social media site X. “Yet, Congressional Republicans voted to shut clean energy projects down, which is already skyrocketing energy bills for working families.”

And, Pallone adds, “We’re not looking to cut off fossil fuels, but we have to emphasize renewables. The problem is that Trump just wants everything to be fossil fuels.”

The center-left group Third Way has been pushing the slogan as well, arguing natural gas is part of the “pragmatic policies Americans want” as Democrats work toward decarbonization.

The shift from Democrats could also lay the groundwork for nascent permitting overhaul talks. Any deal would need to balance Republican goals of increased fossil fuel infrastructure with Democratic dreams of transmission build-out.

For their part, Republicans were all about “all of the above” following Trump’s election last year, and some still utter the magic words, like Energy and Commerce Chair Brett Guthrie (R-Ky.) at a recent hearing.

But the administration has broken with that framing, emphasizing that “energy dominance” can only be achieved with “baseload,” at-the-ready power sources like fossil fuels and nuclear, while throttling solar and wind projects via executive actions.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright stunned some lawmakers at a June hearing when he said he has “never been for ‘all of the above.'”

And earlier this month, a Department of Energy official told lawmakers the administration was focused on the “best of the above,” putting an official stamp on its hostility to renewables. Republicans in Congress are already falling in line with a narrower definition.

“We have an energy deficit and it’s only going to grow further,” said Sen. Steve Daines (R-Mont.). “I’m not opposed to intermittent renewables, but baseloads have to have the highest priority.”

‘Rethink our energy policy’

The big question for Democrats, who spent Joe Biden’s presidency de-emphasizing fossil fuels in favor of renewables, is how many will be on board for such a revival, which carries with it the implicit endorsement of oil, gas and coal.

During last year’s vice presidential debate with JD Vance, Minnesota Gov. Tim Walz unleashed the phrase in touting the Biden administration’s energy record, earning a clap back from the League of Conservation Voters.

“We don’t like that expression,” Tiernan Sittenfeld, senior vice president for government affairs, said at the time.

The concept first appeared in BP marketing materials in 2006 and gained traction under President Barack Obama, who promoted diversifying energy sources without eliminating oil, natural gas or coal.

Obama and many Democrats, however, increasingly moved away from coal as environmental groups adopted a “keep it in the ground” mantra to fossil fuels.

“I think there’s a lot of us that have been advocating [for all of the above], but we certainly don’t want to add more coal power plants to the grid,” said Sen. Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.). “That’s not the way we should go.”

Trump’s DOE moved twice to extend the life of a coal plant in Michigan and has announced a suite of initiatives to bolster new coal generation.

And while Democrats mostly agree coal is a bridge too far, it’s unclear how many will back increased natural gas production. They used to call it a bridge fuel on the road to cleaner sources.

According to an analysis by the Rocky Mountain Institute, utilities are currently looking to build twice as much natural gas capacity as they were 18 months earlier.

“I think there’s some different opinions within the caucus” said Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.). “I don’t know that there is a single Democratic position on natural gas.”

Many Democrats argue that they’ve never really been that antagonistic against natural gas or oil. Under the Biden administration, oil and natural gas output reached record highs — surpassing 13.5 million barrels of crude per day and more than 103 billion cubic feet of gas.

Still, Biden moved to limit oil and gas leases — particularly offshore — and placed a pause on new liquefied natural gas export terminals.

“Natural gas is the next nuclear energy, to where people 15 years ago absolutely hated it and now everybody seems to be on board,” said Texas Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey. “It’s going to be a part of us being able to do things around AI, to be able to handle that load on the grid.”

Some Democrats are quietly exploring bipartisan solutions. Sens. Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.) and Bill Cassidy (R-La.) have introduced a bill authorizing $200 million annually to modernize and repair municipally owned natural gas distribution systems.

Progressive Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) said, “I am unenthusiastic about putting billions of dollars into new gas pipelines that will force us in that direction for decades.”

Still, Warren, the top Democrat on the Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, allowed, “But that doesn’t mean there aren’t places that we could stop and rethink our energy policy. We need to get costs down and the Trump administration’s approach is a disaster.”

Permitting talks

When asked if Democrats should embrace an “all of the above” strategy, Sara Chieffo, vice president of government affairs at LCV, said the party should be focused on promoting renewables.

“The question we should be asking is, ‘Why are President Trump and congressional Republicans pushing fossil fuels above all else, when clean energy is widely supported and the most affordable and fastest to deploy?'” Chieffo said.

Indeed, the four states where wind and solar produce the greatest share of electricity — Iowa, South Dakota, Kansas and New Mexico — are among the 20 cheapest states for electricity, according to federal data.

An upcoming litmus test for whether Democrats want to go down an “all of the above” approach could be bipartisan permitting overhaul.

For years, lawmakers have been looking for the right mix of concessions to secure a permitting deal for energy projects stuck in bureaucratic processes both sides claim to want.

Already, Rep. Scott Peters (D-Calif.) released a bipartisan permitting framework in September with Republicans for “all of the above sources.” That includes provisions for natural gas pipelines and transmission lines.

That framework of a “technology neutral” approach could show industry players that Democrats are a steady hand on energy policy, unlike what’s going on with the Trump administration currently, said strategist Frank Maisano at the law firm Bracewell.

“I think the Trump actions only create more reason and impetus for Democrats to want to jump in and help create a structure that can prevent this type of back and forth,” Maisano said.

But House Natural Resources Committee ranking member Jared Huffman (D-Calif.) said, “I think that’s folly. If anything, this is a moment to reaffirm the clean energy path forward, it’s much more compelling than this high cost, high pollution chaos agenda.”",https://static.politico.com/dims4/default/55a1666/2147483647/resize/1200/quality/100/?url=https://static.politico.com/c6/1a/3791bc764080bb5c31634b712183/u-s-congress-61460.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 08:01:13.883585

About Walker & Dunlop Walker & Dunlop (NYSE: WD) is one of the largest commercial real estate finance and advisory services firms in the United States and internationally.","Walker & Dunlop, Inc. announced today that the firm has successfully closed over $820 million in sales and financings across Central Texas between January and August 2025. This underscores the region’s resurgence of demographic and economic growth.

Since the start of 2025, Walker & Dunlop Capital Markets has arranged over $320 million in conventional property and land sales and over $500 million in acquisition financing, refinancing, and equity capitalization transactions across conventional and affordable properties.

“This performance underscores Walker & Dunlop’s ability to connect buyers and sellers, place capital, and execute in a complex market,” said Matt Pohl, managing director of Capital Markets. “Our integrated platform has helped clients move quickly on opportunities as the market pivots from an interest rate focus to fundamentals-based underwriting. Capital is returning to core growth markets like Austin and San Antonio as investors meet an entry point defined by tightening supply, strong absorption, and forward rent growth. The development pipeline has dropped to lows not seen in this market in decades, and absorption stats continue to set records. Market sentiment has shifted, and we are poised to pair investors with investment opportunities supported by Central Texas’ job and population growth.”

As of mid-2025, Central Texas is showing clear signs of stabilization and a shift toward balance. Property sales and financing volume is climbing, even in a volatile interest rate environment, fueled by rising capital demand and renewed lender activity in the multifamily sector.

Patrick Short, senior director of Capital Markets added, “Lenders are leaning into Central Texas with renewed conviction, taking a more disciplined approach to underwriting and competing aggressively for high-quality deals in Austin and San Antonio—growth markets supported by significant outside investment and institutional sponsorship.”

While cost relief has been seen in certain sectors, developers are still not seeing the relief some had hoped for which has caused challenges for new development in Central Texas to persist. This has provided an opportunity to purchase new construction class-A product well below replacement cost. While underwriting remains a challenge in today’s environment, the accelerating demand for multifamily paired with the attractive basis opportunities in the market have pushed buyer underwriting in anticipation of the growth to come.

Key factors fueling this sector include:

Continued expansion from firms like Apple, Tesla, and Nvidia is fueling demand for both talent and office space across Central Texas.

Mega-projects like Samsung’s $45B Taylor fabrication facility and the EV supply chain are driving long-term job growth and industrial absorption.

Billions in upgrades to highways, transit, and airports are unlocking new submarkets and enhancing regional connectivity.

Rising median household incomes, paired with lower unemployment rates.

Walker & Dunlop remains at the center of this activity, demonstrating the strength of its platform and its role in driving the growth of Central Texas commercial real estate asset class. From growth-stage developers to long-term institutional owners, clients continue to rely on our guidance and capital relationships to transact in today’s market.

Walker & Dunlop is a leader in multifamily property sales, having completed over $57 billion in property sales volume since 2021. The firm is also one of the top providers of capital to the U.S. multifamily market. In 2024, Walker & Dunlop originated over $30 billion in debt financing volume, including lending over $25 billion for multifamily properties.

New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users.
Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, LA. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_559380220MainWEB.png,N,,2025-09-30 08:01:36.610673

“If we’re able to build the plants we want, we can convert Delaware into the hydrogen capital of the East Coast,” Cottone said.
“We’re not going to store the hydrogen,” Cottone explained.
A clean energy option for the future Looking ahead, hydrogen could support the mid-Atlantic’s biggest infrastructure needs, including those data centers requiring round-the-clock energy.","Aternium founder and CEO Andrew Cottone resisted the idea more than once, but hydrogen kept proving itself too powerful, practical and well-suited for Delaware to ignore. This was underscored with a new $1 million investment from the state.

Founded in 2023, Wilmington-based clean hydrogen company Aternium aims to produce and supply energy needs across the mid-Atlantic. Its vision is ambitious, including building compact plants with essentially no direct emissions and minimal waste streams, supplying existing industries already using hydrogen and, ultimately, shifting Delaware from a state that imports virtually all of its energy into a regional exporter.

“Our focus here is to produce profitable and responsible clean hydrogen for the mid-Atlantic future,” Cottone told Technical.ly, a goal that would potentially bring lower energy costs and new jobs, while leaning into Delaware’s long legacy in chemical manufacturing and engineering.

Delaware’s $1 million investment in Aternium, granted on Sept. 25, comes from the Delaware Accelerator & Seed Capital Program (DASCP), one of four programs awarded under the State Small Business Credit Initiative (SSBCI) from the US Treasury Department.

It’s part of a $60.9 million SSBCI award aimed at providing access to capital for startup and early-stage businesses, administered by the Delaware Division of Small Business.

Delaware as a hydrogen hotbed

Nearly 97 million metric tons of hydrogen are used worldwide each year in industries like steelmaking, pharmaceuticals and refining. For Aternium, that means it doesn’t have to invent new markets; it can supply existing demand while preparing for hydrogen’s next chapter as a cleaner, more flexible power source for things like vehicles.

According to the US Energy Information Administration, Delaware currently consumes about 100 times more energy than it produces, importing nearly all of its energy.

“If we’re able to build the plants we want, we can convert Delaware into the hydrogen capital of the East Coast,” Cottone said.

Delaware may be small, but with its location at the heart of the mid-Atlantic corridor, it’s close enough to New York and Washington to access massive markets. Just as importantly, Delaware has a healthy pipeline of engineering and chemical manufacturing talent.

“Our workforce is strong. Chemistry, manufacturing and clean is in our DNA in this region,” Cottone said. “We have some of the highest levels of PhDs and engineers here,” as well as partnerships with Del Tech, Delaware State and Wilmington University to train new talent through certification programs.

A personal streak runs through it

Cottone founded Aternium after nearly two decades leading manufacturing as the founder, president and CEO of Adesis.

At first, he called the company First State Hydrogen. In early 2024, Cottone brought on Dora Cheatham, former executive director of the Delaware Sustainable Chemistry Alliance, as vice president of sales and commercialization.

They decided that the company needed a name that reflected both science and its regional goal beyond Delaware. Having shared a love of Roman history and Latin with his late father, Cottone combined “eternal” with the suffix “-ium” (from deuterium) to form Aternium.

That personal streak runs through the way he talks about the company today. Cottone insists on showing up in communities directly, introducing himself and asking for support.

“I’ll take any speaking engagement because I want to build in your community,” he said. “If you don’t like my idea, that’s okay. We can still go have a whiskey or a coffee together. We’ll be friends, and I’ll move on to the next community.”

Building trust in safety

With proposals like a 6-million-square-foot data center in Delaware City, residents are paying closer attention to potential safety and health risks when it comes to new energy facilities.

Unlike fossil fuel refineries, Aternium’s planned hydrogen plants are designed to be compact, low-impact facilities that blend into the landscape. Cottone said a single site would cover just four to five acres, with no stacks, no gas flares and nothing rising above the tree line.

“It’s essentially no waste,” he said. The process produces only hydrogen and oxygen, without direct emissions.

The company plans to partner with industrial technology firm Honeywell to wrap facilities in AI-driven predictive maintenance software, using ultrasonic sensors to detect microscopic leaks before they happen.

“We’re not going to store the hydrogen,” Cottone explained. “We make the hydrogen, we put it in the trucks, and we move it out. That’s a responsible way to do this.”

Aternium is also an anchor partner in Mach2, the mid-Atlantic Clean Hydrogen Hub, a network of producers, users, distributors and stakeholders within the hydrogen ecosystem that was designated a Clean Energy Hub by the US Department of Energy in 2023.

A clean energy option for the future

Looking ahead, hydrogen could support the mid-Atlantic’s biggest infrastructure needs, including those data centers requiring round-the-clock energy. By using surplus solar or wind power to create hydrogen, Cottone said, that energy could be stored and later used to “firm” the grid during peak demand.

“There’s no such thing as energy transition. There’s only energy addition,” Cottone said. “This is about adding a reliable, clean source that can make Delaware stronger.”",https://technical.ly/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/aterniummockup.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 09:58:13.321621

Regulators would review costs to Wisconsin energy providers and ratepayers if the facility or power from the facility is purchased by state utilities.
According to Clean Wisconsin, the Badger Hollow Wind Project is the first large-scale wind farm approved since 2011.
According to Invenergy, the Badger Hollow wind farm is expected to create up to 200 local construction jobs.
He also said that wind energy can be harnessed reliably in the winter, when daylight hours are shorter.","State utility regulators approved a pair of renewable energy projects last week, including Wisconsin’s first large-scale wind farm in more than a decade.

The Badger Hollow Wind Project in Iowa and Grant counties and the Whitewater Solar Project in Jefferson and Walworth counties received approval from the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin, or PSC, on Thursday.

The Badger Hollow Wind Project is a 118-megawatt wind farm that will be able to generate enough electricity to power more than 30,000 homes, while the Whitewater Solar Project is a 180-megawatt solar farm that will be able to generate enough electricity to power more than 21,000 homes, according to the developers.

Because both were proposed by developers and not state electric utilities, they were not required to provide their project cost to the PSC. Regulators would review costs to Wisconsin energy providers and ratepayers if the facility or power from the facility is purchased by state utilities.

Clean energy and environmental groups framed the approvals as wins for the renewable energy sector.

“Renewable energy generally is facing a lot of threats nationally. Our federal government is taking a lot of creative paths to putting up hurdles for renewables,” said Chelsea Chandler, climate, energy and air program director for the nonprofit Clean Wisconsin. “It’s encouraging to see that projects are still getting permitted here in Wisconsin.”

The federal One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed this summer by President Donald Trump, phased out tax credits for wind and solar energy that were expanded in a Biden-era climate law. In August, the Trump administration ordered construction to stop on a nearly completed wind farm being built off the coast of Rhode Island, and it canceled $679 million in funding for offshore wind projects.

For the new projects in Wisconsin, Chandler said there are a few “limited routes” the federal government can interfere with, depending on whether permits are needed related to federal regulations around air traffic and sensitive species.

“Generally speaking, it’s a lot easier to permit an onshore wind project than offshore,” she said. “I’d say these projects moving forward through our process in Wisconsin indicates that they’re in good shape.”

Andrew Kell, policy director for the nonprofit RENEW Wisconsin, said the projects approved by the PSC will be on private property, with farmers choosing to lease their land for solar or wind.

“It’s really an issue of private property and something that allows farmers to continue their businesses here in the state of Wisconsin,” he said.

According to Clean Wisconsin, the Badger Hollow Wind Project is the first large-scale wind farm approved since 2011.

Chandler said there have been some smaller wind projects in recent years, but Badger Hollow is the first to be more than 100 megawatts.

“It’s been 14 years since we’ve seen a project of this size,” she said. “We expect that there will be more similar projects that will be proposed, and that’s really important.”

The wind farm is being developed by Chicago-based Invenergy, the developer behind the Badger Hollow Solar Project in Iowa County and the Paris Solar Energy Center in Kenosha County. Invenergy also has plans to build a pair of natural gas plants in Kenosha and Walworth counties.

According to Invenergy, the Badger Hollow wind farm is expected to create up to 200 local construction jobs.

In its application to the PSC, Invenergy said it hoped to begin construction in summer 2026 and complete the project by the end of 2027.

“We are grateful to the Commissioners for their consideration and approval, and to the hundreds of landowners, community leaders, and Wisconsinites who participated in the permitting process,” Brandon Davis, lead developer of Badger Hollow Wind, said in a statement. “Invenergy is proud to support Wisconsin’s domestic energy industry, bringing good-paying jobs and long-term investment to local communities across the state.”

Kell with RENEW Wisconsin said the Badger Hollow wind project would complement the similarly named solar farm nearby because wind tends to blow harder and more consistently at night, while solar panels are most effective during the day.

He also said that wind energy can be harnessed reliably in the winter, when daylight hours are shorter.

“Both seasonally and during the day and night, (these are) very complementary resources in terms of renewable energy development,” Kell said.

The Whitewater Solar project is being developed by Whitewater Solar LLC, an affiliate of New York-based DESRI. It’s a spinoff from the D.E. Shaw group, an investment and technology development firm. The developer estimates the project will create hundreds of local construction jobs.

In a statement, Aileen Kenney, principal of project management and development at DESRI, said the developer is pleased that the project received approval from utility regulators.

“(DESRI) looks forward to working with the communities in Jefferson and Walworth Counties further as the development is finalized and the project is constructed,” the statement reads.",https://www.wpr.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/aerial_wis_farmland18_0638.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 08:00:57.071414

Its projects keep going South,Noah Haggerty,,,,,https://www.yahoo.com/news/articles/california-needs-biomass-energy-meet-100000310.html,"Arbor Energy is, essentially, a poster child of the kind of biomass energy project California keeps saying it wants.

In theory, the class of next-generation biomass energy proposals popping up across California could help fund this work.
Today, only 23 biomass plants remain in operation, according to the industry advocate group California Biomass Energy Alliance.
However, while biomass energy has surged in Southern states such as Georgia, projects in California have struggled to get off the ground.","Arbor Energy is, essentially, a poster child of the kind of biomass energy project California keeps saying it wants.

The state's goal is to reduce wildfire risk on 1 million acres of wildlands every year, including by thinning overgrown forests, which is expected to generate roughly 10 million tons of wood waste annually. Arbor hopes to take that waste, blast it through a “vegetarian rocket engine” to produce energy, then sequester all of the carbon the process would generate underground.

California has billed Arbor — and the handful of other similarly aimed projects it's financed — as a win-win-win: wildfire mitigation, clean energy and carbon sequestration all in one.

Yet, after Arbor initially won state financial backing for a pilot project in Placer County, the El Segundo-based company’s California ambitions fell through, like many biomass projects before it.

Instead, it’s heading to Louisiana.

California, biomass energy advocates say, has struggled to get past its distrust of the technology, given traditional biomass’ checkered past of clear-cutting forests and polluting poorer communities. Further, the state’s strict permitting requirements have given residents tremendous power to veto projects and created regulatory headaches.

But many environmental groups argue it's an example of California's environmental and health protections actually working. If not done carefully, bioenergy projects run the risk of emitting carbon — not sequestering it — and polluting communities already grappling with some of the state's dirtiest air.

“When you look at biomass facilities across California — and we've done Public Records Act requests to look at emissions, violations and exceedances ... the reality is that we're not in some kind of idealized pen-and-paper drawing of what the equipment does,” said Shaye Wolf, climate science director at the Center for Biological Diversity. “In the real world, there are just too many problems with failures and faults in the equipment.”

There are simpler and safer uses for this wood waste, these critics say: fertilizer for agriculture, wood chips and mulch. It may not provide carbon-negative energy but comes with none of the risks of bioenergy projects, they say.

Read more: To solve the wildfire crisis, we have to let the myth of ‘the wild’ die

The Center for Biological Diversity and others advocate for a “hands-off” approach to California’s forests and urge management of the wildfire crisis through home hardening and evacuation planning alone. But fire and ecology experts say more than a century of fire suppression have made that unrealistic.

However, the sweeping forest-thinning projects these experts say are needed will cost billions, and so the state needs every source of funding it can get. “Our bottleneck right now is, how do we pay for treating a million acres a year?” said Deputy Chief John McCarthy of the California Department of Forestry and Fire Protection, who oversees the agency's wood products and bioenergy program.

In theory, the class of next-generation biomass energy proposals popping up across California could help fund this work.

“California has an incredible opportunity,” said Arbor chief executive and co-founder Brad Hartwig. With the state’s leftover biomass from forest thinning, “we could make it basically the leader in carbon removal in the world.”

A lot of wood with nowhere to go

Biomass energy first took off in California in the 1980s after small pioneering plants at sawmills and food-processing facilities proved successful and the state’s utilities began offering favorable contracts for energy sources they deemed “renewable” — a category that included biomass.

In the late '80s and early '90s, the state had more than 60 operating biomass plants, providing up to 9% of the state’s residential power. Researchers estimate the industry supported about 60,000 acres of forest treatment to reduce wildfire risk per year at the time. But biomass energy’s heyday was short-lived.

In 1994, the California Public Utilities Commission shifted the state’s emphasis away from creating a renewable and diverse energy mix and toward simply buying the cheapest possible power.

Biomass — an inherently more expensive endeavor — struggled. Many plants took buyouts to shut down early. Despite California’s repeated attempts to revitalize the industry, the number of biomass plants continued to dwindle.

Today, only 23 biomass plants remain in operation, according to the industry advocate group California Biomass Energy Alliance. The state Energy Commission expects the number to continue declining because of aging infrastructure and a poor bioenergy market. California's forest and wildfire leadership are trying to change that.

In 2021, Gov. Gavin Newsom created a task force to address California’s growing wildfire crisis. After convening the state’s top wildfire and forest scientists, the task force quickly came to a daunting conclusion: The more than a century of fire suppression in California’s forests — especially in the Sierra Nevada — had dramatically increased their density, providing fires with ample fuel to explode into raging beasts.

To solve it, the state needed to rapidly remove that extra biomass on hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of acres of wildlands every year through a combination of prescribed burns, rehabilitation of burned areas and mechanically thinning the forest.

McCarthy estimated treating a single acre of land could cost $2,000 to $3,000. At a million acres a year, that’s $2 billion to $3 billion annually.

“Where is that going to come from?” McCarthy said. “Grants — maybe $200 million … 10% of the whole thing. So, we need markets. We need some sort of way to pay for this stuff and in a nontraditional way.”

McCarthy believes bioenergy is one of those ways — essentially, by selling the least valuable, borderline unusable vegetation from the forest floor. You can’t build a house with pine cones, needles and twigs, but you can power a bioenergy plant.

However, while biomass energy has surged in Southern states such as Georgia, projects in California have struggled to get off the ground.

In 2022, a bid by Chevron, Microsoft and the oil-drilling technology company Schlumberger to revive a traditional biomass plant near Fresno and affix carbon capture to it fell through after the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency requested the project withdraw its permit application. Environmental groups including the Center for Biological Diversity and residents in nearby Mendota opposed the project.

This year, a sweeping effort supported by rural Northern California counties to process more than 1 million tons of biomass a year into wood pellets and ship them to European bioenergy plants (with no carbon capture involved) in effect died after facing pushback from watch groups that feared the project, led by Golden State Natural Resources, would harm forests, and environmental justice groups that worried processing facilities at the Port of Stockton would worsen the air quality in one of the state’s most polluted communities.

Arbor believed its fate would be different.

Bioenergy from the ground up

Before founding Arbor, Hartwig served in the California Air National Guard for six years and on a Marin County search and rescue team. He now recalls a common refrain on the job: “There is no rescue in fire. It’s all search,” Hartwig said. “It’s looking for bodies — not even bodies, it’s teeth and bones.”

In 2022, he started Arbor, with the idea of taking a different approach to bioenergy than the biomass plants shuttering across California.

To understand Arbor's innovation, start with coal plants, which burn fossil fuels to heat up water and produce steam that turns a turbine to generate electricity. Traditional biomass plants work essentially the same but replace coal with vegetation as the fuel. Typically, the smoke from the vegetation burning is simply released into the air.

Arbor’s solution is more like a tree-powered rocket engine.

The company can utilize virtually any form of biomass, from wood to sticks to pine needles and brush. Arbor heats it to extreme temperatures and deprives it of enough oxygen to make the biomass fully combust. The organic waste separates into a flammable gas — made of carbon monoxide, carbon dioxide, methane and hydrogen — and a small amount of solid waste.

The machine then combusts the gas at extreme temperatures and pressures, which then accelerates a turbine at much higher rates than typical biomass plants. The resulting carbon dioxide exhaust is then sequestered underground.

Arbor portrays its solution as a flexible, carbon-negative and clean device: It can operate anywhere with a hookup for carbon sequestration. Multiple units can work together for extra power. All of the carbon in the trees and twigs the machine ingests ends up in the ground — not back in the air.

But biomass watchdogs warn previous attempts at technology like Arbor’s have fallen short.

This biomass process creates a dry, flaky ash mainly composed of minerals — essentially everything in the original biomass that wasn’t “bio” — that can include heavy metals that the dead plants sucked up from the air or soil. If agricultural or construction waste is used, it can include nasty chemicals from wood treatments and pesticides.

Arbor plans — at least initially — on using woody biomass directly from the forest, which typically contains less of these dangerous ash chemicals.

Turning wood waste into gas also generates a thick, black tar composed of volatile organic compounds — which are also common contaminants following wildfires. The company says its gasification process uses high enough temperatures to break down the troublesome tar, but researchers say tar is an inevitable byproduct of this process.

Watchdogs also caution that the math to determine whether bioenergy projects sequester or release carbon is complicated and finicky.

""Biomass is tricky, and there's a million exceptions to every rule that need to be accounted for,"" said Zeke Hausfather, climate research lead with Frontier Climate, which vets carbon capture projects such as Arbor's and connects them with companies interested in buying carbon credits. ""There are examples where we have found a project that actually works on the carbon accounting math, but we didn't want to do it because it was touching Canadian boreal forest that's old-growth forest.""

Frontier Climate, along with the company Isometric, audits Arbor's technology and operations. However, critics note that because both companies ultimately support the sale of carbon credits, their assessments may be biased.

At worst, biomass projects can decimate forests and release their stored carbon into the atmosphere. Arbor hopes, instead, to be a best-case scenario: improving — or at least maintaining — forest health and stuffing carbon underground.

When it all goes South

Arbor had initially planned to build a proof of concept in Placer County. To do it, Arbor won $2 million through McCarthy’s Cal Fire program and $500,000 through a state Department of Conservation program in 2023.

But as California fell into a deficit in 2023, state funding dried up.

So Arbor turned to private investors. In September 2024, Arbor reached an agreement with Microsoft in which the technology company would buy carbon credits backed by Arbor’s sequestration. In July of this year, the company announced a $41-million deal (well over 15 times the funding it ever received from California) with Frontier Climate, whose carbon credit buyers include Google, the online payment company Stripe and Meta, which owns Instagram and Facebook.

To fulfill the credits, it would build its first commercial facility near Lake Charles, La., in part powering nearby data centers.

“We were very excited about Arbor,” McCarthy said. “They pretty much walked away from their grant and said they're not going to do this in California. … We were disappointed in that.”

But for Arbor, relying on the state was no longer feasible.

“We can't rely on California for the money to develop the technology and deploy the initial systems,” said Hartwig, standing in Arbor’s plant-covered El Segundo office. “For a lot of reasons, it makes sense to go test the machine, improve the technology in the market elsewhere before we actually get to do deployments in California, which is a much more difficult permitting and regulatory environment.”

It's not the first next-generation biomass company based in California to build elsewhere. San Francisco-based Charm Industrial, whose technology doesn't involve energy generation, began its sequestration efforts in the Midwest and plans to expand into Louisiana.

The American South has less stringent logging and environmental regulations, which has led biomass energy projects to flock to the area: In 2024, about 2.3% of the South’s energy came from woody biomass — up from 2% in 2010, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Meanwhile, that number on the West Coast was only 1.2%, continuing on its slow decline.

And, unlike in the West, companies aiming to create wood pellets to ship abroad have proliferated in the South. In 2024, the U.S. produced more than 10.7 million tons of biomass pellets; 82% of which was exported. That’s up from virtually zero in 2000. The vast majority of the biomass pellets produced last year — 84% — was from the South.

Watchdogs warn that this lack of guardrails has allowed the biomass industry to harm the South’s forests, pollute poor communities living near biomass facilities and fall short of its climate claims.

Over the last five years, Drax — a company that harvests and exports wood pellets and was working with Golden State Natural Resources — has had to pay Louisiana and Mississippi a combined $5 million for violating air pollution laws. Residents living next to biomass plants, like Drax’s, say the operations have worsened asthma and routinely leave a film of dust on their cars.

But operating a traditional biomass facility or shipping wood pellets to Europe wasn’t Arbor’s founding goal — albeit powering data centers in the American South wasn’t exactly either.

Hartwig, who grew up in the Golden State, hopes Arbor’s technology can someday return to California to help finance the solution for the wildfire crisis he spent so many years facing head-on.

“We've got an interest in Arkansas, in Texas, all the way up to Minnesota,” Hartwig said. “Eventually, we'd like to come back to California.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/la_times_articles_853/f1c525e8d4381931e9a6483e51e543ea,N,,2025-09-30 06:58:19.960884

Following the successful results, CFS received $8 million from the DOE's Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program, the largest amount paid to any company in the program, which aims to accelerate innovation and the commercialization of fusion power.

DEVENS, Mass., Sept. 30, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Commonwealth Fusion Systems (CFS), the largest and leading private fusion company, announced that the results of rigorous performance tests of its toroidal field (TF) magnet, a key component at the heart of the company's SPARC fusion power machine, have been successfully validated by an independent panel of reviewers under the U.S. Department of Energy's Milestone-Based Fusion Development Program.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright visited CFS' headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts, where the company is manufacturing their proprietary high-temperature superconducting (HTS) magnets and completing construction of SPARC. The visit followed the successful completion and validation of the TF milestone, and gave Secretary Wright the opportunity to observe the assembly of the SPARC fusion machine. Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey also joined the delegation to witness CFS' progress towards commercializing fusion power.

""Fusion has the potential to be transformative for the world's energy security,"" said U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright. ""The Department of Energy is committed to ensuring American leadership in fusion power by accelerating innovation and collaboration across the government, our National Labs, and the private sector.""

""Fusion is the future of affordable, reliable energy — and it's being made right here in Massachusetts,"" said MassachusettsGovernor Maura Healey. ""Congratulations to Commonwealth Fusion Systems on this incredible milestone and thank you to Secretary Wright and the U.S. Department of Energy for recognizing the enormous potential of fusion power here in Massachusetts.""

""DOE's Milestone program is designed to promote progress in the development of commercial fusion energy through a rigorous review process of key technical milestones that will build confidence in this nascent industry,"" said Bob Mumgaard, CEO and Co-founder of Commonwealth Fusion Systems. ""Fusion will ultimately help to define the future of global energy security, economic competitiveness, and human development for generations to come. American ingenuity has helped lay the groundwork, and ongoing DOE support will help to accelerate the full realization of this groundbreaking technology.""

DOE's Milestone program leverages public-private partnerships to catalyze the development of a new commercial fusion power industry. The milestones and completion criteria that are selected represent key achievements to de-risk the technologies, and to demonstrate real and tangible progress towards the advancement of commercial fusion. The milestones are assessed by an independent board of technical experts from national labs, and the DOE reimburses costs only upon satisfactory technical milestone achievement

The recent award to CFS provided confirmation that the company's first production high-field D-shaped TF magnets passed a battery of acceptance tests for inclusion in the SPARC machine. These magnets use proprietary design and manufacturing processes and are based on Nobel-prize winning High Temperature Superconductors (HTS). Over a month of rigorous performance tests were performed that mimic operational modes in SPARC; the results were reviewed and validated by a team of DOE magnet experts experienced in fusion, high energy accelerator, and material science magnets. As a result of this success, the DOE awarded CFS $8 million — the biggest amount given to any company to date in its Milestone program. The magnet technology was previously validated in a series of record-settingTFMC tests in 2021, and these tests showed that the full production magnets installed in CFS'SPARC demonstration fusion machine are meeting requirements. The magnets are now in regular serial production at the manufacturing facility. The same design is anticipated for theARC power plant.

CFS is eligible to receive$15 million from the first budget period of the DOE Milestone program, the most of the eight participating companies. The TF magnet award is the third milestone that CFS has achieved in the program. The Milestone program currently has $46 million appropriated for the first budget period.

The DOE fusion milestone program is modeled on a successful NASA effort, called theCommercial Orbital Transportation Services (COTS) program, which used public-private partnerships to reduce the cost of space flight and catalyze a new commercial space industry. CFS, the Fusion Industry Association, the Special Competitive Studies Project Commission on Scaling Fusion Energy, and others are calling for an expanded, demonstration phase of the Milestone program to support the first commercial demonstration fusion pilot plants, like the ARC power plant. Support for this expanded program in order to accelerate fusion's deployment and compete with other competitor nations, was recently covered at aHouse Science, Space, and Technology Committee hearing.

At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.
In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early?
But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.
So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected.","The Republican tax and spending package that passed in early July brought an early end to federal EV tax credits, which are worth up to $7,500 for new electric vehicles and up to $4,000 for used ones. The credits end on September 30. Specifically, buyers need to have a binding contract in place by that time — the vehicle itself can be delivered later.

Anybody who was thinking of getting an EV soon-ish suddenly had a four-figure incentive to get one fast.

The result was pretty predictable: Sales of EVs shot up.

""The past couple of weeks — even in the past several days — EV sales just exploded,"" says Matt Jones, the senior director of industry relations at the auto marketplace TrueCar. ""It's been bonkers.""

Surveys have shown that many Americans were not even aware the EV tax credits existed. But some dealers and carmakers have been trying to raise awareness with ads focusing on the new deadline. For example, if you were shopping for a new Tesla this week, you would have seen a countdown clock on the website ticking away second by second to the last moment on Tuesday that you could place an order and still get the tax credit — if you met all the requirements.

The automotive services and tech company Cox Automotive forecasts that EV sales in the third quarter — July, August and September — are up 21.1% from the same period last year, and up 30% from this spring. J.D. Power, another auto data giant, reports that EV sales made up more than 11% of the U.S. market in August — hitting a level ""only achieved once before in December of 2024."" At that time, buyers were also racing to lock in the tax credits before the Trump presidency began.

Used EVs are also selling quickly, and Cars Commerce, the company behind Cars.com, reports that vehicles under $25,000 — the ones that are potentially eligible for the used vehicle tax credit — are the fastest-selling EVs on the used market.

The bump in EV sales was big enough to boost the entire auto market. According to the auto website Edmunds, this quarter will likely see the strongest Q3 new vehicle sales since before the coronavirus pandemic hit in 2020.

But there's a flip side, of course.

""The end of the tax credit created a rush in September, but it could also trigger an EV hangover in the months ahead,"" writes analyst Ivan Drury of Edmunds.

In other words: All those people who raced to buy an EV early? Well, now they won't be buying one later this year. So the EVs that didn't get snapped up before the deadline might have a harder time finding a buyer.

Like the rush, the hangover is expected to be temporary. Major automakers are still investing in EVs (partly out of a desire to compete with China), and the appeal of a quiet, low-maintenance vehicle that never needs a fill-up is unaffected by tax policy.

J.D. Power reports that more than half of new-vehicle shoppers say they're very likely or somewhat likely to consider buying an EV in the next year, and that number has stayed fairly consistent.

But without tax credits, EVs may be less appealing to cost-conscious shoppers.

The research firm Rhodium Group has estimated that the early end to the tax credits will reduce EV sales by 16 to 38% compared to how sales might have grown — and that's on top of other policy changes, like major changes to emissions rules, that are also expected to slow EV sales.

So higher EV sales are probably still coming, but more slowly than expected. How much slower, exactly, no one knows.

Automakers will be waiting to see what ""natural demand"" for their electric offerings actually looks like without the incentive of a big tax break.

And car shoppers, for their part, will be waiting to see whether automakers can manage to cut prices and keep vehicles competitively priced despite increased pressure from tariffs — and without the largesse of the federal government.

Indonesia holds some of the world’s largest reserves of nickel, copper, cobalt, and other minerals crucial to clean energy systems. Nickel, in particular, is essential for battery technologies used in electric vehicles and renewable energy storage.

Recognizing this strategic value, Indonesian leaders aim to move beyond exporting raw materials toward becoming a processing and manufacturing center. Their national strategy includes smelting, refining, and battery assembly.

But those goals face significant headwinds. The national grid still relies on coal for nearly 60 percent of electricity generation. Renewable energy investments remain limited by low tariffs, fossil fuel subsidies, and regulatory uncertainty. Indonesia also lacks a transparent wholesale electricity market and has limited domestic capacity in high-tech manufacturing.

Still, the government has pledged to generate 44 percent of electricity from renewable sources by 2030. This target reflects both climate goals and efforts to draw international investment, particularly from countries looking to secure resilient supply chains.

China’s embedded influence in Indonesia’s minerals and energy sectors is already deep and expanding

China moved early and decisively. State-linked Chinese firms have invested billions in Indonesian smelters, industrial parks, and mining infrastructure. These projects span the entire supply chain, extraction, processing, and in some cases, manufacturing.

By 2023, Chinese companies had signed over $50 billion in energy and mineral deals with Indonesia. Many smelters operate within special economic zones and are powered by coal, raising concerns over emissions despite their alignment with clean energy inputs.

For Indonesia, the advantages are clear: capital inflows, infrastructure development, and job creation. But China’s influence also brings drawbacks. Transparency and environmental safeguards remain limited. Critics say some investments have led to deforestation, land conflicts, and excessive reliance on one geopolitical partner.

Moreover, Chinese dominance makes it difficult for Indonesia to meet sourcing requirements for Western markets. Many US and EU policies mandate that clean energy inputs originate outside of China, which complicates Indonesia’s plans to enter those supply chains.

The US strategy is high in ambition but low in delivery

The US-backed Just Energy Transition Partnership was launched in 2022 with a $20 billion funding package to help Indonesia retire coal plants and scale renewables. But to date, only a small portion of that funding has been disbursed. The US has since pulled back from some components of the agreement, weakening its influence.

Other initiatives have emerged. The US has pushed for Indonesia’s participation in the Minerals Security Partnership, designed to build secure, China-free supply chains. Indonesia has also proposed a joint venture between its sovereign wealth fund and American partners focused on critical minerals.

These moves show strategic intent, but implementation has lagged. Complex environmental, legal, and financial requirements have slowed projects. And while Washington emphasizes clean governance and environmental standards, it has yet to offer Indonesia the same speed or scale of support China already provides.

Indonesia’s nonalignment strategy offers leverage but demands careful balance

Jakarta continues to pursue what it calls “active and independent” foreign policy. Rather than choosing sides, Indonesia seeks to extract value from both China and the United States. Domestic processing mandates now require foreign companies to refine minerals in-country rather than export raw ore.

This policy has attracted investment but also sparked legal challenges and raised environmental questions. Enforcement varies, and safeguards are still evolving. Balancing domestic interests with international expectations remains a tightrope walk.

Indonesia also uses its leverage to bargain for better terms, pushing for technology transfer, infrastructure development, and job creation. But with growing dependence on external capital, the country faces long-term risks if one partner becomes too dominant.

The stakes are global. If Indonesia succeeds, it could become a model for other mineral-rich nations. It would show that countries can shift from raw material exporters to clean energy producers while protecting national interests.

If it fails due to environmental damage, political missteps, or overdependence on one power, the consequences would extend beyond Indonesia. It could discourage investment, reinforce extractive models, and delay progress toward net-zero goals.

The goal is to fully utilise the facility’s 150,000-vehicle annual capacity, a move that promises sharper cost efficiencies in a sector battered by supply chain volatility. Operational since 2015, the plant currently produces the electric EX90 SUV and Polestar 3 but runs below potential.

By introducing XC60 mid-size SUV production from late 2026, Volvo capitalises on a model that sold over 27,000 units in the US in the first eight months of 2025, up nearly 20 per cent year-on-year. This shift may also counter rising tariffs on Chinese imports, which have disrupted global automotive trade since 2024.

Before 2030, a US-specific hybrid model, likely a next-generation XC90, will join the line-up, blending petrol and electric power to appeal to buyers hesitant about full EVs. This reflects Volvo’s regionalisation strategy, tailoring products and production to local markets to mitigate risks from geopolitical tensions and supply bottlenecks.

“Our investment plans once again reinforce our long-term commitment to the US market and our manufacturing operations in South Carolina,” said Håkan Samuelsson, chief executive. “This year, we celebrate 70 years of Volvo Cars presence in the United States. We have sold over 5 million cars there and plan to sell many more in years to come.”

South Carolina’s automotive edge

Volvo rebalances production geography due to US tariffs

Like many European OEMs, Volvo is facing additional costs to import vehicles into the US. This challenge is seeing production strategies being quickly revised and manufacturing of some models relocated.

South Carolina’s status as a US automotive powerhouse, leading in vehicle exports, is bolstered by Volvo’s plans. The state’s skilled workforce and port access have drawn over $2 billion in auto-related investments since 2020, with Volvo’s expansion poised to add jobs and supplier activity, though exact figures remain undisclosed.

Nearby, Magna’s $200 million investment created 200 roles, hinting at the ripple effects Volvo’s move could trigger. Yet, the shift to electrification demands new skills in battery systems and software, areas where South Carolina lags behind tech hubs like California.

“Volvo Cars' decision to further invest in Ridgeville reinforces South Carolina's position as a national leader in automotive manufacturing,” said Henry McMaster, Governor of South Carolina. “It highlights the strength of our workforce and the confidence the world's top companies have in our state. We're proud to continue our partnership with Volvo Cars and look forward to the company's ongoing success in South Carolina.”

The plant’s ability to handle multiple platforms and technologies offers agility in a turbulent market. Still, South Carolina’s reliance on foreign manufacturers like Volvo and BMW, whose exports exceed $10 billion annually, raises questions about economic sovereignty if trade policies harden.

Volvo navigating a tricky EV landscape

Volvo’s US strategy aligns with its global network, including plants in Europe and China, to deliver region-specific products while pursuing net-zero emissions by 2040. Yet, recent financial turbulence, including a $1 billion loss in Q2 2025, has forced a recalibration.

Volvo now targets 50 to 60 per cent electrified sales by year-end, down from earlier ambitions, as EV demand wanes amid sparse charging networks and reduced subsidies. Hybrids, outpacing pure EVs in US sales, make Ridgeville’s planned hybrid a pragmatic bet.

“The Charleston plant is foundational to our strategic growth plan for the US,” said Luis Rezende, Volvo Cars’ president of Americas. “By adding another model into production here, we’ll take a big step toward realising the full potential of our local manufacturing investments and workforce, and accelerate progress toward our ambitious commercial targets in the coming years.”

The challenges and opportunities of production investment

Volvo’s 2024 performance, with a core operating profit of $2.87 billion, and revenue of $42.5 billion, supports its investment push. Global sales of 763,389 vehicles provide a solid foundation, but rising material costs and a softening premium market pose risks.

Localising production in Ridgeville may ease reliance on China’s EV supply chain, a strategy mirrored by rivals like BMW. Success will depend on hybrids bridging the gap to full electrification, as consumer caution and infrastructure gaps slow the transition. Volvo’s regional focus could prove a deft move in a fragmented global market.",https://image.automotivemanufacturingsolutions.com/675404.jpg?imageId=675404&x=0&y=34.85&cropw=100&croph=65.15&panox=0&panoy=34.85&panow=100&panoh=65.15&width=1200&height=683,N,,2025-09-30 08:01:31.617712

The renovation will begin once the hall closes to the public on Tuesday. The updated space, expected to open in spring 2026, will be named the Nancy Stueber Natural Sciences Hall after OMSI’s former president and CEO; she retired in 2020 after 38 years at the museum.

Bearing Architecture designed the project. The team also includes structural engineer VALAR Consulting Engineering and general contractor Walsh Construction.

The hall’s current Science on a Sphere exhibit will return. Also, access through the hall to the museum’s upstairs labs will remain. The museum’s prenatal exhibit will reopen in a different area of the hall. The remainder of the space will be renovated, including construction of new walls, additions of murals, and installation of new lighting to lower energy costs. Key activations in the hall focusing on renewable energy, sustainable living and conservation were developed in partnership with Portland General Electric, a sponsor of the renovation.

A new permanent, interactive exhibition will illustrate the relationship between humans and the environment. “Climate of Change/Clima de Cambio” will feature narratives from the communities in Oregon most affected by climate change.

“We want to invite visitors to explore in hands-on participatory ways how climate change is affecting our region here in the Pacific Northwest, both in our ecosystems and in our communities,” said Ciera Iveson, OMSI’s creative director.

Key climate science concepts and climate solutions will be presented, she said.

The climate impact message carried through the project’s design. OMSI is working with Timberlab to create an entrance using reclaimed yellow cedar left over from construction sites. Inside, tan oak will be used. The team will use mainly reclaimed wood that otherwise would have become waste, Iveson said.

The project’s theme is reclaiming waste, sourcing local building materials, and minimizing use of anything that in the long run would be discarded, she added.

Hall features will include: an immersive multimedia experience developed by Tellart that highlights the interconnectedness of humans and the natural world; design showcasing the beauty of the Pacific Northwest through landscapes, textures, and ecosystems; and other interactive, hands-on elements and education modules.

“We’re putting in a story theater where we’re sharing some documentary films we’ve been shooting of local communities here in the Pacific Northwest and their solutions,” Iveson said. “That’s going to be a really beautiful part of this installation.”

Donors, trustees and sponsors in the past few years have provided support for the project, Iveson said.

The museum’s “Accelerated” campaign raised $6.75 million from 2020-2025 in support of OMSI District plans. Approximately $2 million was allocated for the Nancy Stueber Natural Sciences Hall. Officials also garnered approximately $2 million in federal grants (from the National Science Foundation and the Institute of Museum and Library Services), of which $1.5 million was rescinded, Iveson stated in an email. When the grants were terminated, OMSI reduced the project scope and allocated operational funds to its partners to ensure key exhibition elements of the exhibitions could be preserved, she added.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Museum.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 08:01:26.696229

Starting Wednesday, Americans who purchase a new or used electric vehicle, or EV, will no longer be eligible for a federal tax credit of up to $7,500.

But in Connecticut, those who purchase after the deadline can still enjoy statewide EV rebates of up to $4,000.

Republicans’ One Big Beautiful Bill Act defunded the federal EV tax credit program in July as a part of the Trump administration’s efforts to roll back long-standing federal green initiatives. However, federal investments in charging infrastructure passed under the Biden administration’s Inflation Reduction Act remain intact, leaving local officials optimistic that EV use will continue to rise.

“Cars and trucks contribute more than 40% of our climate pollution and the majority of ozone-forming emissions in the state. Expanding EV adoption is key to addressing air quality challenges that have impacted Connecticut residents for decades,” James Fowler, a spokesperson for the Connecticut Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, or DEEP, wrote to the News.

Which EV incentives remain?

After the federal tax credit expires on Oct. 1, Connecticut residents will still be eligible for rebates through the Connecticut Hydrogen and Electric Automobile Purchase Rebate — or CHEAPR — program.

Effective Oct. 1, any resident who purchases or leases an eligible battery EV from a licensed Connecticut dealership will receive $1,000 in rebates. The increase from the current $500 incentive was announced by the state last week and aims to help Connecticut residents buy EVs after federal tax credits expire, according to a DEEP press release.

The standard rebate for plug-in hybrids will remain at $500. Prequalified low- and moderate-income families can also obtain additional incentives for a total rebate of up to $4,000, according to DEEP.

Earlier in July, DEEP lowered standard incentives for both battery EVs and plug-in hybrids to conserve their budget in light of an “extreme jump” in EV rebate demand, officials said in a July 29 meeting explaining the CHEAPR cuts.

After Trump signed the tax-and-spending bill that cut federal tax credits on July 4, Connecticut consumers rushed to purchase EVs. The state’s average daily spending on CHEAPR incentives was 33 percent higher in the 30 days before July 29 than the 2025 year-to-date average, according to data shown at the meeting.

This far exceeded the target range of what the budget provided by the Connecticut General Assembly could support, DEEP official Paul Farrell said in the meeting.

While Barry Kresch, president of the EV Club of CT, expects EV sales to slow for a period of time after federal incentives expire, he is optimistic that sales will recover soon.

“I can’t tell you exactly when: it might be a year, it might be two years, but electric is the technology of the future, and all of the manufacturers know it,” Kresch said. “In fact, everybody knows it, except the president.”

As battery technology and charging infrastructure improves, EV prices will continue to drop, making EVs a more obvious choice for consumers in the near future, Kresch said.

Electric vehicles can offer a lower total cost of ownership, are far more efficient than comparable internal combustion engine vehicles and help reduce emissions in the transportation sector, DEEP spokesperson James Fowler wrote.

Connecticut has committed to bringing at least 125,000 EVs to the state by 2025. As of July 1, which predates the passage of Trump’s spending bill, there are only 67,656 registered EVs in the state, according to DEEP.

How convenient is an EV in New Haven?

Limited charging options are the largest barrier to expanding EV adoption among New Haven residents, Steve Winter ’11, executive director of New Haven’s Office of Climate and Sustainability, said.

Gaps in charging infrastructure are especially prohibitory in residential areas, where lack of access to a dedicated charging port at home or at an off-street location can dissuade residents who would otherwise purchase an EV, Winter said.

While the state’s “right-to-charge” law allows renters to install chargers in their residential space, renters may not choose to take up that cost if they’re not staying long-term, Winter added.

According to data from ChargeHub, there are 311 Level 2 and 3 charging ports in New Haven. But some charging stations in the city, such as the Tesla fast chargers at Long Wharf, may be restricted to a certain type of vehicle, Winter said.

While the New Haven Parking Authority offers EV chargers across 10 of its lots and garages in New Haven, these chargers might not be the most convenient if drivers aren’t planning to otherwise use those facilities, Winter said.

New charging stations

One of the city’s first priorities in EV adoption is to increase residential charging availability, Winter said.

Last November, Connecticut was awarded $14.6 million through the federal Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Grant Program to expand EV charging stations in seven communities, including New Haven.

New Haven’s portion of the grant will fund 24 new fast charging stations in two residential areas: 12 stations will be built next to the Wilbur Cross Athletic Complex in East Rock, and 12 will be installed on Chapel Street near Wooster Square, Winter said.

“Even if you’re not in one of those neighborhoods, they should be fairly easy to get to,” Winter said. “They’re both close to the highway and in the center of the city.”

As of early September, the state had already selected a vendor to provide support and implementation services for the grant and is working on drafting a contract, Winter said.

Those planning on driving their EV outside New Haven will also see nine more charging locations on major Connecticut highways, funded by the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula Program — or NEVI.

Meriden and Hartford will each have 4 new fast charging ports on Interstate 91 between New Haven and the Massachusetts border.

On Friday, the Connecticut Department of Transportation announced that the Federal Highway Administration approved Connecticut’s plan to utilize the NEVI funds for the new charging stations, allowing the state access to $52.5 million to build out charging infrastructure.

In February, the Trump administration had frozen NEVI funds indefinitely. The Department of Transportation decided to unfreeze all NEVI funds in August after a federal judge ordered the money to be distributed to more than a dozen states in June.

New Haven hopes to lead by example by purchasing and deploying electric vehicles in the community, Winter said.

“We hope to show that they reduce the city’s operating costs in terms of fuel and maintenance, and they provide cleaner air,” Winter said.

Last year, the city purchased more than 30 electric Chevrolet Bolts but experienced a lag in charging infrastructure to accommodate deploying all of them, Winter said. The city has since installed a bank of charging stations, including on State Street, on Chapel Street and at Board of Education facilities.

Now, the city electric fleet includes the Chevrolet Bolts, a refuse truck, a Parks Department truck that supports the charging of equipment like leaf blowers for ranger crews and two police vehicles, among others.

As of July 1, there are 1,264 registered EVs in New Haven, according to DEEP data.",https://yaledailynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/evcredits_kv_AlexHong_05-2-scaled-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 06:58:11.889843

Creativity and efficiency are becoming the new operating models for economic and community development, defining which regions will lead in the next chapter of the energy transition.

This was made clear earlier this month at the International Economic Development Council (IEDC) conference in Detroit, where RMI convened a panel of leaders to explore how US regions can capture advanced energy opportunities as federal support wanes but energy demand heats up. The discussion built on RMI’s recent insights, Scaling Clean Energy with Regional Financing Ecosystems, which highlights how capital providers with a stake in local economic development pursue aligned goals, but too often in silos.

Panelists included Scott Beckerman, Senior Vice President and Director of Corporate Sustainability at Comerica; Martha Campbell, Chief Program Officer at Michigan Saves; John Moon, President of LISC Green LLC; and Amanda Taylor, Vice President of Business Investment at Greater MSP Partnership.

The panel discussion elevated three lessons on this moment and what lies ahead for economic development leaders.

Lesson 1: Today’s strong pipelines require new strategies to overcome uncertainty

In recent years, unprecedented federal incentives have revealed a strong pipeline of clean energy projects across the United States. John Moon shared that LISC used an interest form for the Greenhouse Gas Reduction Fund (GGRF) to measure demand and identified nearly $1 billion in potential projects, with around $150 million ready to move this year. Even without GGRF grants, LISC plans to deploy $100 million in sustainable finance over the next three years– but reaching the lowest-income communities without concessional capital will be difficult and dependent on strong city and state incentives.

Michigan Saves faces a similar challenge. Over 15 years, the green bank has enabled more than $600 million in residential energy efficiency loans by leveraging loan-loss reserves to attract private capital. A GGRF subaward would have enabled an expansion into direct commercial lending. With those funds on hold, Michigan Saves is working to raise private capital and sharpen its value proposition to compete without subsidies.

Panelists cautioned that today’s strong project pipeline faces uncertainty from expiring solar and wind tax credits and impending Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) regulations. Developers and capital providers nationwide are scrambling to complete or safe harbor projects, but what comes next is less clear. Technologies whose credits have longer runway, such as geothermal and storage, could emerge stronger.

Lesson 2: Competitiveness will be shaped by demand

Policy-driven uncertainty isn’t the only factor shaping market outlook. Rising energy demand, grid needs, and long interconnection queues will be just as decisive. Globally, AI is accelerating the need for electricity and water for data centers. In the United States, meeting that demand is vital to maintaining resilient, competitive economies. If investment lags, businesses and households will face higher costs and reliability risks.

As Beckerman observed, banks don’t like uncertainty, yet it has defined 2025. Comerica initially entered clean energy financing because the deals were sound business opportunities, not pure sustainability plays. That still holds true. “We’ll be forced to deploy our creativity,” he said, emphasizing that while capital stacks may evolve, advanced and clean energy projects will continue — driven both by investors’ pressure on global companies to decarbonize and by the sheer growth in energy needs.

The Minneapolis–Saint Paul region offers an example of how local leaders can respond strategically to corporate demand. After hearing airline CEOs express interest in Sustainable Aviation Fuel (SAF), the region began building a value chain that connects feedstock, technology providers, and buyers. As Taylor advised, economic developers should listen closely to what Fortune 500 companies need, and work collaboratively across their region to align solutions with local strengths. That alignment of corporate demand with regional capabilities positions places to compete globally.

Lesson 3: Regions must balance short-term competitiveness with long-term resilience

Economic developers must act as the “strategic brains” of their regions, helping communities balance near-term competitiveness with long-term resilience. Campbell suggested a dual-track strategy: on the one hand, expansively pursuing growth opportunities by attracting foreign direct investment, scaling advanced and cleantech energy clusters, and aligning with global megatrends; at the same time, planning for long-term shifts by hedging against worst-case scenarios such as slowing population growth, and by rethinking infrastructure and city design for sustainable growth.

Panelists acknowledged the challenge of holding near-term needs together while advancing a long-term vision like decarbonization. Data centers illustrate this tension in real-time, as communities wrestle with how to weigh potential tax revenue against impacts on power and water systems. More constructive approaches to data center development are possible, including negotiating with companies to secure workforce training programs, infrastructure investment, or other commitments that build long-term resilience alongside competitiveness.

From uncertainty to regional leadership

The panel discussion in Detroit underscored that while federal uncertainty looms, the regions best positioned to thrive are those building robust financing ecosystems by designing public incentives to attract private dollars, aligning with corporate demand, building coalitions to de-risk projects, and sharpening strategies to deliver dollars more efficiently.

Clean and advanced energy projects will continue. The real question is which regions will rise to meet the moment, using creativity not only to attract investment but also to secure durable, inclusive benefits for their communities.

This is despite the cost-optimal pathway requiring a higher total fixed expenditure of $168 billion over 2024 to 2037.
Despite factoring in higher EV charging and data centre electricity demand than the RPDP, our cost-optimal pathway finds that more solar and batteries can reliably meet the demand.
Despite these demand additions, our cost-optimal pathway does not add about 2 GW of new gas capacity.
Cost-optimal pathway offers greater energy security and defence from gas market volatility The cost-optimal pathway can significantly reduce Thailand’s gas use, compared to the RPDP.","Rising electricity demand from data centres and electric vehicle (EV) charging could place significant pressure on an energy system still heavily reliant on fossil fuels. Expanding renewable energy can help accelerate the transition, attract clean investment, lower costs and emissions, and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels.

Thailand’s draft revised power development plan (RPDP), released in 2024, is an important signal of the country’s ambition in energy transition. It seeks to reduce the country’s historical reliance on fossil fuels, especially natural gas, by aiming for 51% renewable energy generation by 2037. To achieve this, the plan targets to reduce 8 GW of net fossil fuel capacity and add 64 GW of renewables and energy storage. We estimate that implementing the plan will require a total fixed expenditure of $153 billion between 2024 and 2037.

The RPDP, formulated on the principles of energy security, economic efficiency and environmental sustainability, underscores the country’s commitment to carbon neutrality by 2050. While it is a big step in the right direction, Ember’s cost-optimal pathway finds that Thailand saves billions in electricity generation costs by aiming for an even cleaner power system.

Our model finds that raising the plan’s solar capacity targets by 89% and battery storage by 60% can help Thailand save $1.8 billion in power generation costs by 2037. This is despite the cost-optimal pathway requiring a higher total fixed expenditure of $168 billion over 2024 to 2037. But, given that it cuts gas imports equivalent to almost two times Thailand’s 2024 consumption, it saves nearly $16 billion in fuel costs. At the same time, the country’s ambitions of becoming a hub for EVs and data centres remain unaffected.

Ember’s proposed cost-optimal pathways also fit well with Thailand’s economic goals, as its export-oriented manufacturing strategy, rising demand from data centres and EV adoption require more clean energy. Global markets increasingly seek products with low carbon footprints. Aligning the power system with such trends is imperative to maintaining global competitiveness.

Despite factoring in higher EV charging and data centre electricity demand than the RPDP, our cost-optimal pathway finds that more solar and batteries can reliably meet the demand. Instead of adding more fossil fuel capacity and locking in capital with a stranded asset risk, diverting it to solar and batteries will better serve the country’s interests.

The pathway is achievable with the right policy changes that prioritise solar and battery storage, plan for flexible power systems, reduce fossil fuel imports and improve demand forecasting.

Adding 32 GW more solar and 6 GW / 15 GWh more battery storage capacity beyond RPDP targets can help reliably meet additional data centre and EV charging demand

We estimate 10 terawatt-hours (TWh) of additional electricity demand from the data centre boom and an extra 3.3 gigawatts (GW) of peak load from EV charging by 2037, compared to the RPDP projection. Despite these demand additions, our cost-optimal pathway does not add about 2 GW of new gas capacity. Instead, it recommends building an additional 32 GW of solar and 6 GW/ 15 GWh of battery storage by 2037, beyond the RPDP’s targets, to meet the higher demand reliably.

Cost-optimal pathway offers greater energy security and defence from gas market volatility

The cost-optimal pathway can significantly reduce Thailand’s gas use, compared to the RPDP. It cuts the power system’s gas use by 1,815 billion cubic feet by 2037, 11% lower than the RPDP trajectory or almost two times the consumption in 2024. This strengthens energy security and reduces exposure to gas price volatility. It also helps save nearly $16 billion over 2026-2037 in fuel costs compared to the RPDP.

Up to 6 GW/ 15 GWh of additional battery is required by 2037 to ensure a reserve margin of 15% throughout the timeframe

Our analysis uses reliability-adjusted reserve margin to optimize capacity expansion to ensure reliability in systems with high variable renewable energy penetration. Thailand’s peak load interval falls in the evening when there is no sunlight, making planning for reserve even more critical to ensure system reliability. The study shows that an additional 6 GW/ 15 GWh of battery can help the system meet the 15% reserve margin target throughout the planning horizon.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2025/09/thailand-solar-panels-forest-mountain-renewable-energy.jpeg,N,,2025-09-30 09:58:18.039406

California led with more than 70,000 jobs, supported by manufacturing and adoption incentives. Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee also remained major hubs due to their existing auto industry supply chains.

Outlook

At the start of 2025, the clean energy sector was expected to remain the fastest-growing segment of the U.S. economy.

Jobs as wind turbine technicians and solar installers are projected to be among the fastest-growing occupations in the U.S., according to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics.

However, it noted that recent policy changes surrounding the energy sector could put a strain on the continued growth of clean energy jobs in the U.S.

The report noted that, according to a separate research by E2, in the first half of 2025, companies canceled major clean energy-related factories and projects valued at more than $22 billion in the U.S. The policy changes also eliminated 16,500 previously announced jobs in the clean energy sector.

The same report by E2 also noted that the policy changes are placing U.S. workers and businesses at a competitive disadvantage in the global clean energy marketplace, which is on track to reach $2.2 trillion by 2025.

According to another report by E2, businesses in the U.S. have canceled or delayed over $14 billion in investments in clean energy and clean vehicle factories since January 2025, due to rising concerns surrounding the future of federal clean energy tax credits and policy.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/NHPC-Invites-Bids-for-1.2-GW-Wind-Solar-Hybrid-Power-Projects.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 01:58:24.556933

Transform Byproducts into Power – XCF and Posh Energy intend to deploy Flex-Fuel Gensets at New Rise Reno, converting SAF and renewable diesel byproducts into zero-carbon electricity and unlocking new revenue streams.

Layered Credit Advantage – Hydrogen produced is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Tax Credits, while the clean power generated can reduce the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno’s fuels, boosting the value of its 45Z and LCFS credits, or be sold into the local energy grid to meet rising demand for renewable energy.

Scalable Roadmap – The project is expected to begin with a 100-kW pilot and expand to modular 250-kW units, building toward multi-megawatt capacity.

HOUSTON, TEXAS / ACCESS Newswire / September 26, 2025 / XCF Global, Inc. (“XCF”) (Nasdaq:SAFX), a key player in decarbonizing the aviation industry through Sustainable Aviation Fuel (“SAF”), announces that it has signed a Letter of Intent (“LOI”) with Posh Robotics (“Posh” dba Posh Energy), an advanced clean energy company founded by Stanford alumni and backed by Y-Combinator, through its subsidiary New Rise Renewables Reno, LLC (“New Rise Reno”) to explore deploying Posh Energy’s Flex-Fuel Gensets at the New Rise Reno renewable fuels facility.

Posh’s Flex-Fuel Gensets are expected to be installed at New Rise Reno to convert byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into clean, renewable electricity. Its proprietary reforming and fuel cell platform can process propane-rich byproduct streams and transform them into zero-carbon electricity. In the coming weeks, XCF and Posh plan to publish a white paper outlining how Flex-Fuel Gensets can transform byproducts from SAF and renewable diesel production into scalable sources of renewable electricity.

By integrating Posh’s Flex-Fuel Gensets, XCF expects to unlock a combination of tax incentives that enhances both facility economics and sustainability metrics. Hydrogen produced by the system is expected to qualify for the federal 45V Clean Hydrogen Production Tax Credit, while electricity generated from that hydrogen is expected to produce Renewable Energy Credits (“RECs”). When used to power on-site operations, the RECs can be retained and retired to lower the lifecycle carbon intensity of New Rise Reno’s SAF and renewable diesel, thereby boosting the value of the 45Z and LCFS credits.

Alternatively, the electricity and RECs can be sold into the Nevada power grid to serve the growing clean energy demands of the region’s expanding data center hub. Located in the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center, where some of the world’s largest technology companies operate major facilities, New Rise Reno could supply renewable power through wheeling arrangements that help operators meet both regulatory requirements and corporate sustainability goals.

The project is expected to be rolled out in two phases:

Pilot Deployment: Installation of a 100-kW Flex-Fuel Genset to validate performance using New Rise Reno’s byproduct streams.

Modular Scale-Up: Expansion of the project through a modular approach targeting a total capacity of up to 10-MW, providing significant upside in both credit capture and revenue growth.

Mihir Dange, CEO of XCF Global commented:

XCF’s mission to lead the transition to carbon-neutral aviation will be achieved not only by producing SAF, but by reducing carbon emissions throughout the supply chain to create a future-proof energy ecosystem.

“Teaming up with Posh Energy highlights how next-generation fuels and power can converge to deliver impact at scale. Converting byproducts into renewable electricity strengthens our sustainability profile while unlocking new revenue streams that enhance profitability, growth, and long-term shareholder value.”

Wesley Zheng, Co-founder and CEO of Posh Energy commented:

Posh Energy’s Flex-Fuel Gensets are designed to convert challenging, non-standard fuel streams into reliable renewable power.

“Working with XCF at New Rise Reno gives us a first-of-its-kind opportunity to demonstrate how our platform can help decarbonize industrial facilities while supplying clean energy to meet the rising demand from grids and data centers.”

The LOI is non-binding, and project execution remains subject to mutual due diligence, technical validation, and final agreements.

In a letter to shareholders included in its annual report, the company called 2024-’25 a “challenging year” characterized by geopolitical, economic and regulatory uncertainties.
In its 2024-’25 annual report, Verbio said the company is continuing to invest in the South Bend facility on a progressive basis.
Ethanol production reached 582,610 metric tons in 2024-’25, up from 521,407 metric tons in 2023-’24.
Verbio reported EUR 672.1 million in revenue from its ethanol and biomethane operations, up from EUR 656.5 million for 2023-’24.","Germany-based Verbio SE on Sept. 25 announced the company produced a record 1.2 million metric tons of biodiesel and ethanol during its recently concluded 2024-’25 fiscal year. Biomethane production reached 1,190 gigawatt hours (GWh).

The company primarily attributed the increase in ethanol and biomethane production volumes to operations at its biorefinery in Nevada, Iowa, where production has risen continuously since the beginning of the year.

The Nevada biorefinery is located at the site of the former DuPont cellulosic ethanol plant. Verbio acquired the facility in 2018 and in late 2021 began producing renewable natural gas (RNG) at the biorefinery using corn straw feedstock. The plant commenced commercial production of corn-based ethanol in mid-2024. At that time, Verbio reported the Nevada biorefinery had the capacity to produce 60 MMgy of corn ethanol, along with 2.3 MMbtu of RNG.

Verbio’s 2024-’25 fiscal year began July 1, 2024 and concluded June 30, 2025. In a letter to shareholders included in its annual report, the company called 2024-’25 a “challenging year” characterized by geopolitical, economic and regulatory uncertainties.

While the Nevada plant commenced ethanol production during the previous financial year, Verbio reported that technical problems forced the facility “to stop the ramp-up of ethanol production in order to adjust the processes again.” Operations at the facility, however, are “now back on track.” Verbio also confirmed “the investments in Nevada have been completed” and the company is now focused on optimizing the plant’s capacity and bringing its products to market.

The annual report also briefly discusses operations at Verbio’s biorefinery in South Bend, Indiana. Verbio acquired the South Bend ethanol plant in May 2023, announcing plants to integrate RNG production at the facility. The company in May 2024 broke ground on a conversion project at the facility to enable the biorefinery to produce at least 85 MMgy of corn ethanol and 2.8 billion cubic feet of RNG annually.

In its 2024-’25 annual report, Verbio said the company is continuing to invest in the South Bend facility on a progressive basis. “The process of converting the plant to a combined ethanol and biomethane production plant has begun, and will be implemented on a step-by-step basis,” Verbio said in its report. “In the medium term this will not only result in an increase in production capacity, but will also make it possible to achieve synergy effects and efficiency gains.”

Verbio produced 619,250 metric tons of biodiesel during the 2024-’25 financial year, down from 637,283 metric tons during the previous fiscal year. Biodiesel plant utilization was at 87.2%, down from 89.9%, and biodiesel revenues reached EUR 894.2 million, up from EUR 987.5 million.

Ethanol production reached 582,610 metric tons in 2024-’25, up from 521,407 metric tons in 2023-’24. Ethanol plant utilization was at 72.8%, up from 65.2%. Biomethane production reached 1.19 million megawatt hours (MWh), up from 1.1 MWh. Biomethane utilization reached 60.1%, up from 65.2%. Verbio reported EUR 672.1 million in revenue from its ethanol and biomethane operations, up from EUR 656.5 million for 2023-’24.

The company reported total revenues of EUR 1.58 million for the 2024-’25 fiscal year, down from EUR 1.66 million in 2023-’24. EBITDA was EUR 14.2 million, down from EUR 121.6 million. Verbio attributed the decrease to lower profit margins for ethanol and biomethane due to declining greenhouse gas (GHG) quota prices and to impairment write-downs on inventories.",https://bbi-strapi.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Verbio_Aug24_62dab94c38.jpg,N,,2025-09-30 01:58:44.773377

It’s about government not as the nemesis of the American Dream, as Republicans would have it — but as its partner.
This is not simply about trade or diplomacy; it marks a new phase of U.S. economic warfare.
In Venezuela, U.S. sanctions contributed to tens of thousands of excess deaths in a single year.","Almost daily, we are regaled with stories about Americans who overcame hardship or adversity through grit and determination — and reaped the rewards of living in the United States. Nary a politician doesn't weave it into their persona and candidacy.

However, there's a flip side to the American Dream – one with profound cultural and political implications. Because if success in America comes from hard work, then if you haven't succeeded, it's likely that you haven't worked hard enough.

In other words, if you're poor or struggling, it's all on you, a result of your laziness or lack of initiative. We rarely discuss this aspect of the American Dream narrative, but it is deeply embedded in our approach to government and poverty. And it may be why Republicans have been ascendant and Democrats have struggled to capture the imagination of voters.

Think about the political consequences, all favorable to Republicans. Because if we are all wholly responsible for our success, then it's natural for voters to ask why they should give the fruits of their labor — their hard-earned money — to those who they say are sitting around and haven't worked for it. “If you are able to work in America, well then you should not be sitting at home playing video games and collecting a check,” said Representative Lauren Boebert (R-CO), echoing the sentiments of GOP colleagues during the recent debate over President Trump's tax and spending bill.

According to this line of thinking, when government aids those less fortunate, it enables their moral failings by giving them something they haven't earned – which makes them dependent on government and drains their individual initiative. It explains why Republicans have long sought to impose work requirements on government programs.

It's also the key to understanding white working-class grievance — and why so many have migrated to the GOP. To them, they worked hard, they built America, but as they see it, instead of praising them and protecting their jobs, liberals have created social programs for the undeserving at their expense. It’s why Ronald Reagan’s “welfare queen” trope resonated – that their hard work put food on the table while the poor were using government benefits to buy T-bone steaks.

So it wasn't on them that their standard of living flatlined in recent decades; rather, they were getting squeezed so the government could give away what they earned with sweat and toil to those who hadn’t worked for it. They may be caricaturing liberal intentions and programs, and their perspective may be based on stereotypes about the disadvantaged, particularly minorities, but it's firmly rooted in their understanding of the American Dream.

From the New Deal to the Great Society and onward, Democrats have offered a different interpretation of the American Dream. Yes, they say, it's through individual initiative that Americans can attain success. However, they also argue that there are many reasons beyond individual effort that contribute to someone's failure to succeed — among them bigotry, family circumstances, social conditions, inequality, and historical injustices. Even people who work hard and hold down two jobs, Democrats note, are often unable to free themselves from the weight of these burdens.

As Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote, "" if a man is entered at the starting line in a race three hundred years after another man, the first would have to perform some impossible feat in order to catch up with his fellow runner.""

The Democratic approach is to level the playing field, creating laws and programs that enable everyone to reach the starting line and prove their merit. Affirmative action was one remedy, but Republicans successfully framed it not as a moral solution to generations of injustice but as an unfair benefit that advantages minorities and women at the expense of white men.

It was in the 1960s that liberalism reached its heyday, when its message resonated most deeply with the American spirit. Through programs such as food stamps, job training, Head Start, low-interest student loans, and Medicaid, President Johnson sought to help what he described as the many Americans who ""live on the outskirts of hope – some because of their poverty, and some because of their color, and all too many because of both.” He made it the nation's moral mission to “replace their despair with opportunity.”

At the time, these programs were very popular – and aligned with the American Dream. But in the decades since, Democrats have been unable to defend them against Republican rhetoric that frames them as giveaways of hard-earned tax dollars to people who haven't worked for it, as violations of the American Dream. Democrats tried to respond by calling these programs ""investments,"" but that's a sterile economic term far from the moral heart of the American voter.

Suppose the Democrats want to regain the majority. In that case, they will need to show that theirs is the party of the American Dream, that anyone who works hard should have a shot at a better life. Most importantly, the government is a moral force that mitigates the disruptions of capitalism, addresses injustices, supports our pursuit of a better life, and provides everyone with a fair chance to succeed, regardless of their background or circumstances.

They need to show that the American social contract is all about lowering the ladder so everyone can climb it — and not, like the Republicans, pulling it up and leaving fellow Americans behind. It's not about giveaways; it's about opportunity. It’s not about each of us looking out only for ourselves; it’s about all of us looking out for each other. It’s about government not as the nemesis of the American Dream, as Republicans would have it — but as its partner.

It may be what’s behind Mamdani’s appeal: his relentless focus on affordability is essentially a message of making the American Dream more accessible through government action.

Perhaps it's not identity politics or wokeness that cost Democrats the 2024 election. It may simply be a matter of how we define the American Dream.

Leonard Steinhorn is a professor of communication and an affiliate professor of history at American University and the former CBS News Radio political analyst.

In effect, Washington is attempting to coerce a foreign court into reversing a domestic legal process. For a U.S. president to sanction another country’s judges for convicting his political ally is unprecedented—and a direct attack on sovereignty and the rule of law. As a scholar whose work explores the intersections of law, colonialism, and crisis throughout history, I can tell you this charts a dangerous path.

The U.S. has long relied on economic warfare as an instrument of coercion in Latin America and the Caribbean. Cuba, Nicaragua, and Venezuela have endured decades of sanctions, embargoes, and restrictions under the banner of promoting democracy. In practice, these measures have devastated civilian populations while failing to produce meaningful political change. The U.S. embargo on Cuba, now over 60 years old, has deprived generations of basic goods and medicines without bringing about the regime change Washington once promised.

But Trump’s Brazil tariffs point to something new. Tariffs, traditionally tools of trade policy, are now being openly weaponized as instruments of political punishment and coercion worldwide. This is not simply about trade or diplomacy; it marks a new phase of U.S. economic warfare.

Supporters of sanctions and tariffs argue that economic pressure is preferable to direct military intervention. However, this framing obscures the reality: sanctions do indeed kill. They disrupt access to food, medicine, and critical supplies, plunging populations into crisis. In Venezuela, U.S. sanctions contributed to tens of thousands of excess deaths in a single year. In Cuba, restrictions blocked humanitarian aid during the COVID-19 pandemic, exacerbating suffering at the height of a global health emergency.

By 2024, one-third of the world’s population lived under some form of sanctions regime, with the U.S. responsible for more than 80% of unilateral measures.

These sanctions are rooted in emergency powers, which entail an anti-democratic decision-making process. The International Emergency Economic Powers Act of 1977 (IEEPA) allows the president to declare a “national emergency” and impose sanctions without congressional approval. The IEEPA has been invoked nearly 70 times, with 39 ongoing declarations still in effect. Courts have recently found that tariffs imposed under IEEPA are unconstitutional, yet the Trump administration continues to rely on this tool to justify sweeping interventions.

The legality of economic warfare remains contested in international law as well. Legal scholars have noted that sanctions violate the UN Charter, the Organization of American States Charter, Word Trade Organization rules, and international human rights law. More importantly, they erode the very idea of international legality by replacing global norms with U.S. domestic law.

Economic warfare is often framed as targeted, aimed at individuals or specific sectors. In reality, its effects are broad.

Exclusion from the U.S. banking system deters global financial institutions from engaging with sanctioned nations, effectively forcing international compliance. The result is over-compliance: banks and corporations cut off even legitimate or humanitarian transactions out of fear of U.S. penalties. The chilling effect leaves hospitals without medical equipment, schools without supplies and families without remittances.

Brazil now risks being pulled into this machinery of economic warfare. Tariffs and sanctions in retaliation for a domestic judicial ruling signal a dangerous expansion of U.S. contemporary interventionism. This is a form of collective punishment meant not only to discipline Brazil, but to send a message across the hemisphere: Prosecute U.S.-aligned leaders, and you will pay the price.

U.S. interventionism in Latin America is neither new nor accidental. From the Monroe Doctrine to Cold War interventions, Washington has repeatedly subordinated regional sovereignty to its own interests. What is different today is the legal form. Where once the U.S. sent Marines or backed coups, it now uses sanctions, tariffs and financial coercion to achieve geopolitical control over the region.

For Brazil, the stakes are immense. Its judiciary has acted to hold a former president accountable for attacks on its democracy. To punish that decision is to undermine not just Brazil’s sovereignty but the principle of judicial independence everywhere. For Latin America, this episode is another reminder that U.S. interventionism never disappeared; it has been refashioned through the tools of economic warfare.

Sanctions kill, and yet they persist as key instruments of U.S. foreign policy and economic warfare. To challenge their legitimacy requires moving beyond the legal and political fiction that sanctions and tariffs are legitimate tools of foreign policy. They are weapons of economic coercion that harm the most vulnerable, erode international law, and perpetuate a system of global inequality.

For too long, the U.S. has claimed the right to decide the political futures of Latin America and the Caribbean. The latest tariffs and sanctions on Brazil make clear: unless confronted, this cycle of intervention will continue. But history offers another lesson: Latin America has resisted before, and it will resist again.

The clock is ticking to claim tax credits for clean-energy home improvements.

Green-energy tax credits for cars and homes are wilting fast. Here's how to claim these tax breaks before they're gone.

Time is not on the side of anyone seeking help from Uncle Sam with their electric-vehicle purchase or their home's clean-energy upgrades.

Tax breaks subsidizing these purchases are going away, after President Donald Trump's megabill this summer shortened the time to claim the Biden-era credits.

Car buyers have until the end of the day Tuesday to claim a credit worth up to $7,500 for a new EV, or a tax break on used EVs that would pay up to $4,000.

Homeowners have until the end of the year to claim tax credits connected to solar panels, certain heat pumps, windows and doors.

In some cases, these home-improvement credits may save someone thousands of dollars. That is, if they follow the Internal Revenue Service's rules for the dwindling time to claim the breaks.

These fast-expiring tax credits cut a person's tax bill dollar-for-dollar, said Tom O'Saben, director of tax content and government relations for the National Association of Tax Professionals. That's a powerful tax-cutting tool, he said.

Speed counts, yet a wrong move could be costly at tax time. If you make a mistake when you claim the credit, and the IRS ""wants to take it back, that's going to hit hard real fast,"" he added.

People may still be eligible for EV and clean-energy tax incentives through their own state income-tax rules. But that's going to differ across the country.

Here's what to know:

You don't have to drive off in an EV, but you need this

In the final hours of the EV tax breaks, one key issue is when the vehicle was ""acquired.""

To the IRS, ""a vehicle is 'acquired' as of the date a written binding contract is entered into and a payment has been made,"" the agency said. ""A payment includes a nominal down payment or a vehicle trade-in,"" the IRS added.

In other words, drivers need to ink a deal by Tuesday. To be clear, the ""acquisition"" is a first step but it doesn't immediately guarantee the credit. The vehicle still has to be ""placed in service."" So owners can claim the credit once they have the car, the IRS said. People should still press for delivery as soon as possible, O'Saben said. But there's more.

First, the credit only goes to eligible vehicles. Here's a place to check which cars qualify. Second, the credit is applied at the point of sale, and buyers have to confirm the dealer can apply the credit.

The buyer should be able to get an IRS ""time of sale"" report they can use at tax time, Ingrid Malmgren, Plug In America's senior policy director, previously told MarketWatch.

Finally, buyers need to understand that the income rules for the EV tax break are ironclad. The IRS can take away the whole credit if a buyer is even slightly over the income caps.

The new EV credit goes to individuals with modified adjusted gross income up to $150,000 and $300,000 for married couples. With used EVs, the cap is $75,000 for individuals and $150,000 for married couples.

The IRS gives some leeway. A household can apply the income they made in 2025 or 2024 if one amount is over the limit, but one amount is under it.

Even if car buyers can't claim the Biden-era EV-related credits, there is another break they could get: a new $10,000 deduction on car-loan interest for eligible buyers. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill"" allowed the deduction on cars with final assembly in the U.S. That could include eligible electric vehicles, said O'Saben.

Here's a National Highway Traffic Safety Administration link to determine a car's final assembly, using its vehicle identification number.

There's more time to get breaks on solar panels and home upgrades, but the clock is ticking

There are two different clean-energy tax credits expiring after Dec. 31.

One is a credit geared at big-ticket projects like solar panels, sun-powered water heaters and geothermal heat pumps. The other vanishing break applies to home upgrades that include windows, doors and sealants that can better insulate a home from high and low temperatures.

It's not enough to just pay for these projects and improvements before Dec. 31, said O'Saben. These projects have to be installed, up and running by then.

That means people who want to claim the break need to consider whether contractors can get the job done in that short span, he said.

Sharvil Sheth, Armanino's director of credits and incentives, has been fielding client questions on the residential clean-energy tax breaks and sometimes dialing back their expectations of getting them.

There may be factors beyond their control, like the availability of parts, he said. There's also the risk of moving too quickly, he said. That could backfire if the speed to claim a credit now means extra work - and extra money - to fix a hasty project later, Sheth noted. ""Don't rush into anything,"" he said.

If a newly built home isn't ready for use by the end of the year, that might sink eligibility - even if clean-energy features like solar panels are running, Sheth added.

It's critical to keep good records, Sheth and O'Saben said. That includes contracts and even the stickers on newly-installed windows and pumps. O'Saben said. Utility bills might help too, Sheth said.

The IRS is not going to expect people to submit contractor paperwork with a tax return when they claim the credit, O'Saben said. But the IRS will expect documentation if it questions a claimed credit once a tax return has been submitted, he said.

The examination would likely happen via mail, but in extreme cases, O'Saben said the IRS could dispatch an agent to check whether a taxpayer's solar panels are up and running. That's ""only in cases where they think it's something that doesn't seem right.""

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

Washington, D.C. – The Small Business & Entrepreneurship Council (SBE Council) called on Congress to immediately act on a continuing resolution (CR) to keep the federal government open, warning that a shutdown creates more challenges and uncertainty for small businesses. As noted by SBE Council President & CEO Karen Kerrigan about the impact of a shutdown and how business owners are still being challenged to find their footing following years of policy instability and inflationary pressures:

“Small business owners have grown weary of disruption and instability generated by government actions and policy. The failure of Congress to act on a key responsibility means added burdens for entrepreneurs and their employees in terms of stalled loans, halted contracts, delayed permits, and access to federal government agencies so they can resolve important labor or tax-related matters. Moreover, such carelessness drives uncertainty and further erodes confidence in Congress, which already ranks at the bottom in terms of how Americans view key U.S. institutions. Those opposed to the common-sense CR that passed the U.S. House are plainly posturing for political gain. They need to get serious about supporting a stable environment for Main Street businesses and entrepreneurs. Advancing the House-passed CR is a reasonable step to keep the federal government functioning while discussion continues. Entrepreneurs are calling on the saboteurs of stability in Congress to do what’s right by their small business constituents, drop their outlandish demands, and vote favorably on the reasonable plan to keep the doors of the federal government open.”

Trump has clamped down on renewable energy

Environmental groups said Trump was wasting federal tax dollars by handing them to owners of the oldest, most expensive and dirtiest source of electricity.

“Subsidizing coal means propping up dirty, uncompetitive plants from last century – and saddling families with their high costs and pollution, said Ted Kelly, clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. “We need modern, affordable clean energy solutions to power a modern economy, but the Trump administration wants to drag us back to a 1950s electric grid.''

Solar, wind and battery storage are the cheapest and fastest ways to bring new power to the grid, Kelly and other advocates said. ""It makes no sense to cut off your best, most affordable options while doubling down on the most expensive ones,” Kelly said.

EPA eases pollution rules

The EPA said Monday it will delay seven deadlines related to wastewater pollution from coal-fired power plants. The industry has complained that regulations imposed under the Biden administration were costly and designed to speed the closure of coal plants.

Coal ash, the waste from burning coal, can leach into groundwater and spread toxins. The Biden administration said the rules were aimed at keeping arsenic and lead out of well water, lowering cancer rates and avoiding disastrous spills.

""Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are giving big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways, with no care for how many Americans will suffer from drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food,'' said Laurie Williams, who directs the Sierra Club's Beyond Coal Campaign.

The EPA also said it will open a 60-day public comment period on potential changes to a regional haze rule that has helped reduce pollution-fueled haze hanging over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations. Zeldin announced in March that the haze rule would be among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that he plans to roll back or eliminate, including a 2009 finding that climate change harms human health and the environment.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America’s Power, an industry group, said the EPA rule changes and other administration actions would help to “protect America’s electric reliability and preserve its fleet of coal-fired power plants.”

Coal production has dropped steeply

Burgum, who also chairs Trump's National Energy Dominance Council, said the actions announced Monday, along with the tax law and previous presidential and secretarial orders, will ensure ""abundant, affordable energy while reducing reliance on foreign sources of coal and minerals.''

The Republican president has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

Coal once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production, but its share dropped to about 15% in 2024, down from about 45% as recently as 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.

Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper, and there’s a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.

Carrboro, North Carolina, is a town with about 21,000 residents located just west of Chapel Hill. It is nowhere near any oceans but claims it has suffered millions of dollars in damages to its 47 miles of roads and town buildings because of more frequent and extreme weather events related to an overheated environment. CleanTechnica readers would not be terribly surprised if that were true. Carrboro is seeking to recover damages for those past harms as well as future ones.

Rather than take its lumps like every other community affected by rain, hail, drought, or wildfires, Carrboro is trying something different. Last December, it sued Duke Energy, alleging the utility has funded and promoted a decades-long deception campaign to diminish the connection between fossil fuels and climate change.

Recently, it amended its lawsuit to add a claim for at least $20 million in damages to its buildings, equipment, and vehicles suffered when Tropical Depression Chantal swept over the town in July of this year, leaving more havoc in its wake. “When you’re dealing with something like the existential threat of climate change, that requires us to make bold moves,” Carrboro’s mayor, Barbara Foushee, told The Guardian.

Decades Of Deception

The idea to bring a lawsuit followed a report by the Energy and Policy Institute last November, which found some of the utility companies that comprise today’s Duke Energy Corporation — including Duke Power, Carolina Power & Light, and Public Service Indiana — were warned about the climate crisis decades ago.

“Although Duke has understood the dangers of climate change for decades, the company actively participated in a far reaching, decades long campaign of deception reinforced the public’s reliance on coal and natural gas. That reliance by the public led to higher greenhouse gas emissions that became the condition precedent to heat waves, heavier rain, more powerful storms, and flooding,” according to Inside Climate News.

Last week, lawyers for Carrboro and Duke Energy spent more than six hours arguing their positions to state court judge Mark A. Davis, who is considering a motion to dismiss the matter filed by attorneys for Duke Energy. The question Davis has to answer is whether the case should proceed to a trial before a jury.

Matthew Quinn, an attorney representing Carrboro, claimed the case is similar to tobacco litigation. “Our theory is that Duke’s massive deception got everybody hooked on fossil fuels, like Philip Morris” and cigarettes, he told the court. At trial, he said the town would present climate attribution scientists — experts who study the link between extreme weather events and climate change — to prove causality to a jury.

Not surprisingly, Duke Energy argued the complaint is baseless and should be dismissed. “There are other emissions sources. There is no way to trace a statement by Duke to a pothole in Carrboro,” its attorney, Hunter Bruton, told the judge. “These are novel claims.”

A Deliberate Campaign Of Lies

The alleged deception began in earnest in the 1990s, Carrboro says in its complaint. That’s when several energy groups, funded in part by Duke Energy, knew fossil fuel emissions were warming the planet but launched a public relations campaign designed to mislead the public into believing that climate change was not real.

Duke was an influential member of the Global Climate Coalition, which falsely claimed in a 1994 edition of Climate Watch Bulletin that “new scientific evidence” showed fossil fuels might help maintain “an essential atmospheric balance” and that “cutbacks in fossil fuel use may actually enhance the greenhouse effect,” the complaint says.

It also alleged that Duke was an active participant in the Edison Electric Institute, a trade organization which knew as early as 1968 that fossil fuels were altering the planet’s atmosphere. In 1991, the Edison Electric Institute ran ads in magazines disputing climate change with messages like, “How much are you willing to pay to solve a problem that may not exist?” and, “If the earth is getting warmer, why is Kentucky getting colder?”

The Edison Electric Institute commissioned a study in 1984 that included two hypothetical news stories from the future — one in which fossil fuel emissions continued unabated and caused devastating impacts, and another in which emissions were reined in and a safer future was secured, the lawsuit says.

Despite these warnings, Duke continued to build out fossil fuel infrastructure, oppose legal limits to planet heating pollution, and support efforts to promote doubt about climate science, the complaint filed by Carrboro alleges.

Duke Energy & Climate Confusion

“They tried to sow confusion about climate change and the fact that there’s a threat that we face in the future,” Howard Crystal, legal director of the Energy Justice Program at the Center for Biological Diversity, told The Guardian. Crystal is an advisor to the town of Carrboro. “The deception continues to be a problem today, now in the form of ‘greenwashing’,” he said.

On social media, Duke has portrayed itself as a leader in bringing on “cleaner energy solutions” despite having one of the largest planned gas buildouts of any company in the US. “They’re still expanding fossil fuels and suppressing renewables — in flat defiance of scientists demanding that we do the exact opposite,” said Jim Warren, executive director of NC Warn. According to one study, Duke Energy in 2021 had the third-largest emissions footprint of any business in the United States.

In the day-long arguments to Judge Davis, attorneys for Duke pursued the useful kitchen sink defense — throw everything you can think of against the wall and hope some of it sticks. “The only way to get exacerbated climate change is to have exacerbated emissions,” they argued. “They have to prove the campaign caused someone to increase emissions.”

Creative Legal Theories

Carrboro’s legal team is breaking new ground in the climate litigation space. It is alleging that damage done to town property constitutes a public and private nuisance because the town no longer has the “use and enjoyment of its property.” The utility’s actions also amount to trespassing by Duke Energy because the floods, wind, heat waves, and storms from climate change “enter and damage” town property.

ICN reports that the lawyers for Duke Energy seemed exasperated by such claims. “We don’t control the weather or the rain or the heat, which they’re alleging is the trespass,” they said.

Matthew Quinn, the attorney representing the town, said Duke Energy must be held responsible for the consequence of their devious behavior, Quinn concluded. “Their position is there are no legal consequences and they can say anything about their business model and parties like Carrboro can’t pursue damages. There is legal redress,” Quinn argued. “Causation should not be misunderstood, and Carrboro’s extreme damages should not be minimized.”

The Proper Role Of Courts

Climate litigation is becoming fairly common these days, with several states and many cities having made legal claims similar to those by the town of Carrboro. The basic information about how the fossil fuel industry suppressed information about carbon emissions is well known.

The industry conspired, colluded, and schemed to hide the truth from the public and disparage climate scientists whenever possible. Almost everyone is now aware of the extent of the lying that has gone on for decades. But the question in a court of law is not whether industry executives are a bunch of despicable shitheels. That is no longer an issue. The question in this case and many others is whether the courts are the right place to have this debate.

Many judges are gun shy about these cases because they feel the questions presented are policy issues that should be addressed by the legislative and executive branches of government. During the hearing last week, Judge Davis asked pointedly whether the case was about monetary damages or actually a legal maneuver designed to get the court to do what the North Carolina legislature and governor should do.

Davis issued no ruling last week. Instead, he asked attorneys for both sides to submit legal memos that address the issue of “traceability,” that is whether the damages suffered by Carrboro can be linked to the deception campaign outlined by the town in its complaint.

That’s a smart move. He is fully aware that his decision will be appealed no matter what he decides. An appeals court will look to see whether the trial judge covered all the bases properly before rendering a decision.

It is one thing to say that Duke Energy has been run by a bunch of scumbags for decades. It is quite another to say their despicable actions were a proximate cause of Tropical Depression Chantal dumping Biblical amounts of rain on Carrboro earlier this year.

""You were a good patriot, and you lived a tragically short life,"" Mike Murphy, a Republican strategist who leads an effort to make EVs less political, said of the program. ""I'd say goodbye to you in Chinese if I could.""

The tax credit was popular and significant in more ways than one. It has been widely adopted to bring down price tags for new and used EVs, and it has been widely debated as a signature policy emblematic of the U.S. auto industry's rocky road to electrification.

The program was a darling of affluent and eco-minded consumers, elected officials eager to steer the U.S. economy toward greener technologies and some China hawks like Murphy who are wary of the rival nation's dominance in the global EV sector. It was also a target for Republicans eager to dismantle all aspects of what they called an ""EV mandate"" from former President Joe Biden.

The credit, according to economists and analysts, had its tradeoffs but was ultimately successful in achieving two main goals: Sparking growth in a nascent product category and helping domestic automakers to keep pace with their foreign rivals. Now the industry faces an EV transition — which most experts say is inevitable — without one of its key federal supports.

""I don't think we're going to have a collapse. I'm not that much of a pessimist,"" Murphy said in a phone interview. ""I'm not sure next year will be a growth year like all the past years have been. But if it's negative, I think it'll be low single digits (EV market share), which will then lead to more growth.""

The growth Murphy referred to was most significant between the start of the Biden administration in February 2021 and the beginning of 2024, when EV sales figures started to become less consistent. Market share has since hovered around 9% but spiked to an all-time high of 11.5% in August with the impending end of the program.

The federal government expanded tax credits for EVs via the Inflation Reduction Act during the middle of that Biden-era growth window, gaining heightened national attention in the process. But the program's story began more than a decade before.

Credit 1.0: Sparking early growth

There were two main phases of the tax credit, according to Corey Cantor, research director for the Zero Emission Transportation Association. The first began in late 2008 and second began in 2023.

""In its early iteration and form, the credit helped jump-start the kind of EV transition here in the U.S., encouraging more and more consumers to consider electric vehicles,"" Cantor said.

Lawmakers established the federal EV tax credit — also known as the 30D credit — at the end of the George W. Bush administration amid a deepening collapse of the American auto industry. The program offered a $7,500 credit for the purchase of plug-in electric vehicles.

There was bipartisan support for legislation that led to the program, with the effort led in the U.S. Senate by Sen. Maria Cantwell, D-Washington, then-Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, and then-Sen. Barack Obama, D-Illinois. The credit was folded into a larger clean energy tax incentive package that passed the chamber with overwhelming bipartisan support in October 2008.

That version of the credit, after a legislative tweak in 2009, had a 200,000-vehicle cap for eligibility. Automakers making forays into electrification like Tesla Inc., General Motors Co. and Nissan Motor Corp. could benefit from the incentive only while establishing a foothold with their electrified offerings.

The results — and resulting taxpayer costs — were not immediate. The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office wrote in a September 2012 report that ""no manufacturer is near the threshold at which the tax credits will begin to be phased out."" Then-President Obama at one point that year proposed raising the credit to $10,000.

EV momentum developed over time, though, and research points to the tax credit playing an important role. One study from 2016, which surveyed about 2,900 plug-in vehicle owners, attributed ""more than 30% of the (EV) sales to the federal tax credit, with an impact of up to 49% for the Nissan LEAF.""

GM and Tesla were first to hit the ceiling in 2018, triggering a phase-out process that saw the number of tax credits they could offer falling by half every six months until they hit zero. GM found success with the Chevrolet Volt, and Tesla began building its dominance of the U.S. electric vehicle market with the Roadster and Model S.

Ford Motor Co. and Toyota Motor Corp. also eventually hit the credit limit, according to the Internal Revenue Service.

By the end of 2018, plug-in models accounted for 2% of U.S. new vehicle market share for the first time and brought renewed scrutiny to the credit originally designed to foster early growth. GM and Tesla called on Congress to lift the 200,000 cap, and many lawmakers agreed with their position.

Democrats in Congress introduced a bill to remove the cap. So did Republican then-U.S. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, where Tesla has a major presence. Meanwhile, U.S. Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming, now the No. 2 Republican in the chamber, introduced legislation to terminate the credit.

""The electric vehicle tax credit largely benefits the wealthiest Americans and costs taxpayers billions of dollars,” Barrasso said at the time. “My legislation levels the playing field for all drivers across America.""

Credit 2.0: Pushing U.S. manufacturers

Supporters of the EV credit won out in the summer of 2022 when Biden and his allies in Congress lifted the cap and set the credit to expire in 2032, though there were new strings attached meant to promote U.S. manufacturing. The expanded incentive succeeded at doing just that, according to economists and analysts.

""The way the credits were constructed really did have an eye specifically towards not just enhancing EV adoption in the U.S. market, but specifically enhancing the adoption of EVs made in the United States,"" economist Reigner Kane said in a phone interview. Kane was one of five co-authors on an October 2024 working paper examining the expanded tax credit.

Kane continued: ""And that does seem to be something, according to our estimates, that the IRA did fairly well at. A lot of the benefits, in terms of additional EVs added to the market, were really coming from these domestic firms — so Tesla, GM, Ford, etc. — and relatively few from foreign firms.""

The Biden administration restructured the credit by splitting it into two parts worth $3,750 each: One for critical minerals sourcing and the other for battery component sourcing, with domestic content requirements getting stricter over time. The administration also required that final vehicle assembly take place in North America for a car or truck to be eligible and set an income cap for buyers — albeit with a big loophole.

Beyond the headline-grabbing 30D credit, the government created an additional $4,000 tax credit for used EVs and another for qualified commercial vehicles, both of which also disappear after Tuesday.

The tax credits boosted new EV registrations by 300,000 in 2023, according to the October study. The researchers estimated that domestic brands sold about 835,000 EVs that year, but would have sold only 525,000 without the credit. That represents a nearly 60% jump.

Foreign firms, by contrast, enjoyed a much smaller boost of about 7,000 units from the credits. They would have sold between 340,000 and 350,000 EVs regardless.

The study also estimated that the credit caused a roughly 3 percentage point increase (8.3% to 11.2%) in EV market share and a 10-point jump (59.9% to 70.5%) in the percentage of U.S.-sold EVs that were assembled domestically.

Those numbers indicate that the Biden administration's expanded version of the EV credits did what the former president and his allies hoped, though critics like Barrasso and Senate Majority Leader John Thune, R-S.D., have called out the multibillion-dollar price tag to achieve those results.

Republicans' move to repeal the EV credits through their One Big Beautiful Bill Act will save the federal government about $189.7 billion over the next decade, according to the Congressional Budget Office.

""The hard-earned money of taxpaying Americans should not cover the cost for the luxuries of the nation’s elite,"" Barrasso said in a February statement after again introducing legislation to end the credits. “Repealing these reckless tax credits from the Biden administration once and for all will stop Washington from giving handouts to our adversaries and high-income individuals.""

His statement was a reference to the fact that EVs are more popular with affluent consumers and that a critical loophole in the credits allowed buyers and automakers to get a $7,500 boost on leased vehicles without any of the income or domestic sourcing restrictions.

The impact of that loophole was significant. That policy design resulted in a 17-point jump (12.2% to 29.3%) in the share of new EVs that were leased rather than purchased, according to Kane and the other researchers.

Murphy, the Republican strategist, said the Biden administration was certainly aware of the loophole. But he guessed that officials decided not to patch it because leases — especially given many buyers' hesitance to commit to a new and unfamiliar powertrain — have become a driver of EV adoption. They also have the power to create longer-term impacts on the market than outright purchases.

""I'm very curious to see how the leasing provision is going to affect the used vehicle market in the next few years,"" said economist Max Maydanchik, one of the October study's co-authors. He pointed out that the U.S. used vehicle market (about 37.4 million units last year) is significantly larger than the new vehicle market (about 16 million).

""The typical lease term is about three years, and a lot of those leased vehicles are going to enter the used vehicle market,"" Maydanchik said. ""Maybe used vehicles that are cheaper are going to be the entry point for a lot of people into EVs.""

For that reason, he said the full story of the EV tax credits is ""not yet written.""

Roll credits: What comes next

Republicans' sweeping election wins last November quickly created a difficult political environment for federal EV support, even as a short-lived bromance between Tesla CEO Elon Musk and Trump provided some hope for the credits and other programs.

In the new environment, Murphy explained, automakers shifted priorities to issues that better aligned with GOP leaders: ""They did do some lobbying for (EV supports). You know, they called up and said, 'We think this is really important. And by the way, we want to save our subsidy for our specific plant.' But did they really go to war? They did not.

""Their theory was: 'We're going to get the fuel economy standards lifted and we're not going to have to pay Elon billions of dollars a year in carbon credits. We'd love to keep the credit because we're losing money on EVs, we don't want to piss off Trump on the other stuff.' This was nothing like the kind of full-scale push they're capable of putting on. And I think that was a choice.""

Automakers, especially without stringent Biden-era emissions targets, can now transition to electric vehicles at a more comfortable pace. Several have shown signs of doing just that by scrapping or delaying certain electrified product offerings while still committing to long-term EV manufacturing projects. Many of those projects will rely on the separate federal 45X tax credit — which survived the Trump transition — for production of EV batteries.

In the very short term, demand for electric vehicles has spiked to record levels in the dying days of the EV credits. However, analysts widely expect a lull without those financial incentives.

""Growth moving forward will be slower than many advocates hoped, though continued innovation in battery technology, improved transparency in battery health and expanding infrastructure give reason for optimism. The road ahead will be challenging, but progress will continue,"" Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights for Cox Automotive, wrote in a Sept. 23 blog post.

Cantor, the ZETA research director, pointed to Germany and the United Kingdom for reference points on what might happen in the U.S. market. Both countries ended their national EV credits in recent years, though the U.K. restarted a similar program in July.

""You basically see a correction in the quarter following, weaker demand than you otherwise would have seen. And then it takes a couple of quarters to get back on the growth track,"" he said of those examples. Cantor also pointed to some places in the United States, like Colorado, that will help buoy EV sales with existing state-level credits.

Dealers around the country, in touch with their automakers and heeding industry predictions, said they are riding out the EV sales highs while preparing for a slowdown.

""We're a little bit nervous because we're not sure exactly how it's going to work out,"" said Walt Tutak, the dealer trade inventory manager at Matthews-Hargreaves Chevrolet in Royal Oak.

""We're watching the inventories. We don't want to go crazy trying to sell them now, because there's still going to be a market for (EVs). But we're sort of playing it by ear because we're waiting to see whether GM is gonna slow down production on anything,"" he added.

Tutak said his dealership usually sells about 90% traditional-gas powered vehicles and 10% plug-ins, but that split has looked more like 70/30 over the last two months. The dealer manager also noted that around 80% of the electric models driven off the lot recently have been leased.

Tutak predicted that ""we're going to probably see a decrease in sales, but it's not going to be as big as some people think."" He added that ""there's a lot of two-year leases out there. And people really enjoy these EVs, so I think they're going to stick with them."" His top-selling EV models have been the Chevy Blazer and Equinox.

Scott Gruwel, president and CEO of Courtesy Automotive Group, painted a similar picture in discussing dealerships for nine different car and truck brands near Phoenix and San Diego.

""We are seeing an uptick in leads, and we are doing a good job of selling this last week and a half — definitely more than normal. But people aren't coming and blowing down the doors and waiting in lines to try to take advantage of this EV tax credit,"" he said.

Gruwel noted that the Phoenix market typically does not have high lease penetration, but ""astoundingly good"" deals meant to offload EVs have caused leases to double above usual levels. ""The idea is to not have too much inventory when this thing goes away,"" he said.

""But we still anticipate having EVs to stock and to sell, and I support that. It might not be as much of a focus, but it's still a part of the game plan,"" Gruwel added. ""It's not like everything drops off a cliff.""

Jim Walen, who owns and operates Stellantis and Hyundai Motor Corp. dealerships in Seattle, said he had mixed feelings about the end of the EV credits.

Walen did not like that the credits largely went to ""rich people"" who could already afford more expensive electric vehicles. He was also frustrated that exclusive EV-makers like Tesla and Rivian Automotive Inc. were eligible for the credits while also collecting, in Tesla's case, ""billions and billions of dollars"" from emissions credits sold to other automakers.

However, Walen also lamented that losing the $7,500 credit would slow industry progress toward making EVs accessible and ""depress sales"" at a time when the car business has already been ""under assault by the Trump administration from Day One"" via tariff policies.

""I'm the largest volume Hyundai dealer in the state of Washington, as well as the largest by retail volume for Stellantis,"" he said. ""My job is to deliver affordable transportation to the masses. And I will say that, overall, this is going to hurt us.""

The state’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal program that allows drivers of zero-emissions vehicles to drive alone in the high occupancy vehicle (HOV) lane expires, effective at 12:01 a.m. Wednesday.

With rush-hour traffic jams and clogged freeways a fact of life in California, the stickers act as an incentive for people to buy electric vehicles, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell cars. It’s estimated that 465,000 vehicles across the Golden State have active decals attached to them.

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, 13 other states have similar incentives in place.

But since the interstate highway system is funded by the federal government, the HOV initiative for zero-emissions vehicles requires federal authorization to keep the program going.

A 10-year extension was passed by Congress in 2015 but it expires at the end of September, and lawmakers on Capitol Hill have yet to pass a new extension.

So what happens now?

An official with the California Highway Patrol said the CHP will offer drivers a grace period before issuing tickets.

“The California Highway Patrol’s goal is always to educate the motoring public when there’s a change in the law,” Lt. Matt Gutierrez recently told the Orange County Register. “State law provides a 60-day transition period beginning Oct. 1, during which drivers with a valid clean-air decal will not be cited for driving alone in the carpool lane. After that, driving solo in the carpool lane could result in a citation.”

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, a trade group for the U.S. auto industry, is lobbying to bring the state decal programs back.

“According to consumer surveys, it is one of the primary motivators for consumers to choose an electric vehicle,” said Curt Augustine, the group’s senior director for state affairs. “So maintaining a popular incentive for folks to buy these new cars is important.”

Others say the HOV lanes should be reserved, as originally intended, for car pools and vehicles carrying multiple passengers — especially in light of the adoption of EVs and plug-in hybrids in California.

Some 21.6% of all light-duty new car sales in the Golden State in the second quarter came from vehicles that qualify as zero-emissions, according to the California Energy Commission. California has more than 2.3 million EVs, plug-in hybrids and hydrogen fuel cell vehicles on the roads, by far the most of any U.S. state.

There’s been some movement on Capitol Hill to revive the sticker program.

In August, Rep. Mark DeSaulnier, D-Walnut Creek, in August introduced H.R. 4948, the HOV Lane Exemption Reauthorization Act.

The $212 million project, known as Strengthening Coastal Resilience and the Economy (SHORE), is intended to help India protect its marine ecosystems. These ecosystems, which are vital for industries like fishing and tourism, while also serving as important habitats for plants and wildlife, have been under threat due to coastal erosion, pollution, and urban expansion, according to Good News Network.

The project has shown how international organizations, governments, and the private sector can join forces to protect the environment and local industries while also spurring employment. The project will cover 6,200 miles of coastline in lower India, on which an estimated 250 million people rely for jobs and a place to live, per Good News Network.

""The SHORE MPA program will support India's vision for Integrated Coastal Zone Management while ensuring that the coastal zone's environment, landscapes, and natural values are in harmony with economic development,"" the program's website said.

If successful, the program could serve as a model for coastline management around the world.

Increasing global temperatures and rising seas, along with plastic pollution and overfishing, have posed a unique threat to coastal areas.

In the U.S., approximately 40% of the population lives in coastal counties, according to the EPA.

""U.S. coastal counties face permanent inundation and flooding threats from sea level rise, intense rains, high tide flooding and severe storms,"" the EPA said on its website.

""Many communities are taking steps to protect coasts from climate change. For example, some communities are elevating buildings or constructing barriers to shield people, businesses, and property from flooding and storm surge,"" the EPA continued. ""Others are restoring coastal habitats and using nature-based features to build coastal resilience.""

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In 2025, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier in 2025 granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. in 2024 sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”",https://wisconsinpublictv.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ap-economy-energy-utilities-blackrock-newyork-20230314.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 20:59:47.634320

Multiple BESS plants are currently under construction in Staten Island, including one on Nelson Avenue The site used to be a home office.
Some battery plants have caught fire before.
""Imagine if this happens in the middle of the night where we're all sleeping,"" said Thomas Oriol who works near one in Staten Island.
Supporters say the batteries used for energy storage have stricter regulations than those consumers can buy from a store.","NEW YORK (WABC) -- We've seen how an e-battery can catch fire and explode in a matter of seconds. That's from a single battery on an electric bike or scooter.

People living in some neighborhoods are now worried about what could happen with hundreds of lithium-ion batteries that are being stored in metal containers near their homes and businesses.

They're called Battery Energy Storage Systems or BESS plants. Power companies are filling metal containers the size of tractor trailers with e-batteries to help supplement the power grid. The batteries store energy and release the energy back to the grid during peak hours.

There are more than 6,000 facilities in New York alone.

Multiple BESS plants are currently under construction in Staten Island, including one on Nelson Avenue The site used to be a home office. It was demolished and replaced with metal containers full of e-batteries and it's located between homes and a gas station.

""I think it's disgraceful and I think it's dangerous,"" said Christina D'Angelis who lives nearby.

""That is a danger in a nice residential neighborhood with a school around the block, people all over and a gas station next door that can explode the entire neighborhood and I can't believe they got it improved,"" said D'Angelis.

Some battery plants have caught fire before. From a large fire in California earlier this year, to multiple fires in New York including one upstate in Jefferson County to another in Orange County in 2023. They burned on and off for days.

""Imagine if this happens in the middle of the night where we're all sleeping,"" said Thomas Oriol who works near one in Staten Island.

By 2030, New York wants to increase the amount of energy it stores from 359 all the way up to 6,000 megawatts. That would be enough energy to power all of New York City for a day.

""It's an absolutely critical source of meeting our electric needs,"" said Kyle Rabin of Alliance for Clean Energy New York.

Supporters say the batteries used for energy storage have stricter regulations than those consumers can buy from a store.

And the state recently revised its fire and building code to regulate battery plants.

""I think people would feel very comfortable with this technology, they are some of the best fire codes standards in the country,"" said Rabin.

The new code requires each site to have large scale fire testing to help ensure a fire is contained to its metal enclosure. They also have to have a gas detection system, and a hazmat team on standby in case of an emergency amongst other revisions.

""The systems are no longer set and forget, they're set and maintain,"" said Paul Rogers, a former firefighter who now works for Energy Safety Response Group.

The new state code allows plants to be built 10 feet away from another property.

That's too close for comfort for some people.

Supporters of the new energy technology say that's a minimum distance and local communities can decide whether to change local laws to increase the distance.

That's what the Staten Island Borough President says he's fighting for.

""Accidents can happen, they have happened and we just want to prevent that from happening here this time,"" said Vito Fossella, Staten Island Borough President. ""We're standing in front of a recipe for disaster and an accident waiting to happen.""

The FDNY released the following statement in regards to the energy storage systems:

""Let's be clear, keeping New Yorkers and our first responders safe will always be our top priority - it's what the brave men and women of the FDNY do every single day. At the same time, we are committed to a greener, more sustainable future for all. That's why our fire code for energy storage systems is widely regarded as one of the most robust and strongest in the country - it's considered a national benchmark for safety. We test facilities, enforce standards, and prepare for any potential emergencies like no other city, making our regulations the best fire code for energy storage in the nation.""

The Olkaria EV Plant is among the high-tech projects announced for Olkaria, the other one being a large-scale data center.

Aquilastar has an aim of producing 50,000EV units every year. Additionally, the company seeks to create 13,000 both direct jobs and indirect jobs. This will be achieved with the support of UAE-based Alsayegh Group. Alsayegh Group is a conglomerate with investors in technology, financial services, education, automotive, and oil and gas.

Project Factsheet

Project type: Electric Vehicle (EV) manufacturing and assembly plant

Location: Olkaria Geothermal Area, Naivasha, Kenya (Within a designated Geothermal Special Economic Zone)

Cost: $150 million

Company: Aquilastar

Unique feature: The plant is seeking to negotiate long-term power contracts with KenGen to be tethered directly to baseload geothermal renewable energy supply. This would make it one of the world’s few EV plants powered by consistent, carbon-free geothermal energy.

Economic implication: Consistent geothermal power supply is expected to offer predictable production costs, potentially giving Kenyan-made EVs a cost advantage over imports.

Location and Size of Project’s Site

The upcoming EV plant will be located in KenGen’s Green Energy Park. This park covers a total of 845 acres at the Olkaria Geothermal field.

Also, the park has been designed to host industrial and non-industrial activities which include offices, data centres, research and development hubs, hospitality amenities, visitor experience facilities, and commercial services.

According to Mr. Alsayegh, the plant will produce up to 50,000 units every year. Furthermore, it will be able to directly employ 3,000 Kenyans and generate another 10,000 indirect jobs while developing a local supply chain for EV accessories in Kenya.

Benefits of EV Adoption to Kenya

Additionally, Aquilastar Managing Director and CEO Barbara Modani Alwena, highlighted that the adoption of EV offers Kenya an opportunity to reduce its dependence on fossil fuel imports. These imports usually cost Ksh600 billion to Ksh700 billion every year.

“This EV plant project is not just unveiling a new product but lighting up a bold vision for the future of mobility, sustainability, and innovation in Kenya,” she stated.

Significance of the Olkaria EV Plant

Lastly, the CEO of KenGen Peter Njenga stated that the EV plant would assist in driving Kenya’s industrialisation goals.

“This is not just breaking ground on a new plant. We are breaking ground on a new chapter of industrialisation in the continent. Its is a chapter powered by clean energy, durable jobs, and local innovations,” Njenga stated.

Also, he affirmed the investors that KenGen is revamping its installations. This is in order to make sure there is uninterrupted power supply, targeting generation of 1,500MW by 2034. 834MW is expected to be generated from geothermal energy.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/KenGen-park-ev-scaled-1.avif,N,,2025-09-30 02:59:20.071191

In the US, power demand from data centers is set to double by 2035, to almost 9% of all demand, according to BNEF.
A comic strip taped to his office door makes a dark joke about AI causing the power grid to collapse.
Distance from data centers Next, we determined each LMP node’s proximity to significant data center activity using data from DC Byte.
Cells deemed as being far from data centers were ones in which the LMP nodes had an average distance greater than 50 miles from significant data center activity.","Data centers are proliferating in Virginia and a blind man in Baltimore is suddenly contending with sharply higher power bills.

The Maryland city is well over an hour’s drive from the northern Virginia region known as Data Center Alley. But Kevin Stanley, a 57-year-old who survives on disability payments, says his energy bills are about 80% higher than they were about three years ago. “They’re going up and up,” he said. “You wonder, ‘What is your breaking point?’”

It’s an increasingly dramatic ripple effect of the AI boom as energy-hungry data centers send power costs to records in much of the US, pulling everyday households into paying for the digital economy.

The power needs of the massive complexes are rapidly driving up electricity bills — piling onto the rising prices for food, housing and other essentials already straining consumers. That’s starting to have economic and political reverberations across the country as utilities and local officials wrestle over how to divvy up the costs. Yet those same facilities are a linchpin of US leadership in the global AI race.

A Bloomberg News analysis of wholesale electricity prices for tens of thousands of locations across the country reveals the effects of the AI boom on the power market with unprecedented granularity. Electricity now costs as much as 267% more for a single month than it did five years ago in areas located near significant data center activity.

About two-thirds of the power consumed in the US runs off of a state or regional grid, where the system operator manages the trading of energy. These wholesale commodity costs are passed on to households and businesses on their utility bills, which then include other charges to maintain and expand the network. That can affect even customers who aren’t in close proximity to a data center, since their energy relies on the same grid.

Every day, wholesale electricity prices are measured in real time by Locational Marginal Pricing points on the power grid, called nodes. LMPs are primarily made up of the cost to produce the energy and congestion. Analyzing data from 25,000 nodes used by seven regional transmission authorities, Bloomberg News estimated how much wholesale prices in the lower 48 states have changed since 2020.

Tech companies, now among the biggest and most powerful forces in the world, have staked their future on AI. Data centers — some with a footprint large enough to cover much of Manhattan — are chock full of racks of servers delivering computer power and storage needed to train and run models.

Their power needs are only set to accelerate. In recent weeks alone, Nvidia Corp. said it will invest as much as $100 billion in OpenAI to support new data centers, while Microsoft Corp. struck a multiyear deal worth almost $20 billion to get cloud computing power from Amsterdam-based Nebius Group NV using a New Jersey data center. OpenAI and Oracle Corp. forged a partnership to build 4.5 gigawatts’ worth of data center capacity, enough energy to power millions of American homes.

“The reliability crisis is here now; it’s not off in the distance somewhere,” said Mark Christie, a former chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission who also served as a long-time Virginia regulator. He said that load forecasts — the expected demand for power on electricity grids — are a key factor pushing up costs, driven by the data center interconnection requests.

The affordability problem extends beyond US borders. Power auction prices in Japan hit all-time highs amid government expectations of an AI boom, while Malaysia is lifting electricity rates for data centers as new facilities tighten supply. In the UK, a report from Aurora Energy Research found that higher demand from data centers could push power prices up 9% by 2040.

Globally, data centers are expected to consume more than 4% of electricity by 2035, according to BloombergNEF. Put another way: If the facilities were a country they’d rank fourth in electricity use, behind only China, the US and India.

In the US, power demand from data centers is set to double by 2035, to almost 9% of all demand, according to BNEF. Some predict it will be the biggest surge in US energy demand since air conditioning caught on in the 1960s. That comes as the grid is already struggling to update aging infrastructure and adapt to climate change.

“Without mitigation, the data centers sucking up all the load is going to make things really expensive for the rest of Americans,” said David Crane, chief executive officer of Generate Capital and a former energy official in the Biden administration. All that demand risks brownout situations in some US power markets within the next year or two, he said.

President Donald Trump, who won election in part because of Americans’ dissatisfaction with higher consumer costs, said on the campaign trail that he would cut electricity prices in half within 18 months of taking office. Yet prices have only risen since his inauguration. His energy chief said this month that soaring power bills are now his biggest concern.

The president has championed America’s AI dominance while also stripping support for new sources of energy like solar and wind farms with his One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which some experts say will increase average household energy bills. BNEF forecasts that annual deployment of new solar, wind and energy storage facilities in 2035 will be 23% lower than it would have been without the bill.

Trump has instead focused on unlocking power through expanding the use of coal, natural gas and nuclear energy. In a statement, White House spokeswoman Taylor Rogers blamed the Biden administration’s climate agenda and “destructive” policies for driving up energy prices.

“President Trump’s actions to unleash American energy are the only reason our country has not experienced blackouts and grid failures that would have occurred” under the prior policies, she said.

PJM Interconnection, the operator of the largest US electric grid, has faced significant strain from the AI boom. The rapid development of data centers relying on the system raised costs for consumers from Illinois to Washington, DC, by more than $9.3 billion for the 12 months starting in June, according to the grid’s independent market monitor. Costs will go up even more next year.

Demand tied to the cryptocurrency boom, new factories and the electrification of the economy, including vehicles and home heating, are also pushing up power bills. The cost of natural gas, the No. 1 power-plant fuel in the US, is increasing thanks to all of this demand. And in the zone that includes Baltimore, the planned retirement of coal plants has increased the price of power by decreasing projected supply.

Baltimore residents saw their average bill jump by more than $17 a month after a power auction held by PJM reached a record high, according to Exelon Corp.’s Baltimore Gas & Electric utility. This year’s auction set another record, which will boost the average power bill in Baltimore again by up to $4 starting in mid-2026.

AI Is Already Wreaking Havoc on Global Power Systems

AI Needs So Much Power, It’s Making Yours Worse

AI Is Draining Water From Areas That Need It Most

There has been a “massive outcry about high energy bills” in the area, said David Lapp of the Maryland Office of People’s Counsel, an independent state agency that advocates for residential utility customers. His office fields about 50 calls a week and recently hired a new staffer to help manage the requests for help. A comic strip taped to his office door makes a dark joke about AI causing the power grid to collapse.

Nicole Pastore, who has lived in her large stone home near Baltimore’s Johns Hopkins University campus for 18 years, said her utility bills over the past year jumped by 50%. “You look at that and think, ‘Oh my god,’” she said. She has now become the kind of mom who walks around her home turning off lights and unplugging her daughter’s cellphone chargers.

And because Pastore is a judge who rules on rental disputes in Baltimore City District Court, she regularly sees poor people struggling with their own power bills. “It’s utilities versus rent,” she said. “They want to stay in their home, but they also want to keep their lights on.”

Stanley’s neighborhood is a mix of well-tended houses like his and those that are condemned or abandoned, with broken windows and holes in the walls. He used to work as a hotel manager but glaucoma took his vision almost 20 years ago, leaving him with few employment options.

“They can say this is going to help with AI, but how is that going to help me?” he said from his front steps. “How’s that going to help me pay my bill?”

The analysis of 25,000 LMP nodes examined the relationship between the change in wholesale electricity prices and the nodes’ distance from data centers. The analysis reveals that LMP nodes with increases are more likely to be concentrated near data centers.

The boom highlights a stark trade-off: Data centers devour electricity and water, but also are required for the tech-driven conveniences of the modern era, whether it’s using ChatGPT for queries, getting matched with an Uber driver or seeing streaming recommendations on Netflix. Even some activists who protest widespread development of the facilities acknowledge that their digital lives rely on them.

In 2024, the three biggest US cloud providers — Amazon.com Inc., Microsoft and Alphabet Inc.’s Google — spent more than $200 billion on capital expenditures, most of it to construct data centers. To ease the pressure, tech companies are working on ways to speed additional power capacity to the grid while developing better techniques for cooling data centers and chips that use less energy. Hyperscalers are collectively bringing back old reactors, spurring upgrades at existing plants and investing in next-generation nuclear power.

In some US regions it’s clear that data centers are a major influence on the surge in energy costs. They are the largest source of new power consumption in Texas by far. Dominion Energy Inc. — which serves northern Virginia’s Data Center Alley — forecast that its peak demand would rise by more than 75% by 2039 with data centers. It would be just 10% without. Against that backdrop, power costs have become a key issue in this year’s gubernatorial elections in Virginia and New Jersey.

Utilities across the US say they are trying to ensure tech firms pay a fair share for the electricity and infrastructure upgrades their data centers require. Some power companies have moved to require tech firms to put up more collateral or pay for specific amounts of electricity, even if they end up using less.

“We believe data centers should pay for the full cost of their power,” Dominion spokesperson Aaron Ruby said in an email. “That’s how we design our rates, and it’s the standard our regulator uses in reviewing them.” Ruby added that infrastructure costs are allocated based on how much it costs to serve each group of customers, with data centers paying an increasingly large percentage of transmission costs.

Calvin Butler, the CEO of Exelon, said the company is pushing for long-term solutions that are fair and bring peace of mind to customers. “While we can’t control every factor driving up prices, we refuse to stand by,” he said in a statement.

For local officials, the effects are becoming urgent. Last week, Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro convened the first-ever meeting of representatives from all 13 states served by PJM. Shapiro, a Democrat, warned that if PJM didn’t tackle changes to reign in consumer costs, Pennsylvania could withdraw from the system. New Jersey regulators are studying this and Maryland may do the same.

PJM has said that supply and demand conditions are driving up prices. A spokesman declined to comment further.

As a regional grid operator, PJM not only runs daily markets to trade electricity but is also responsible for transmission planning, and costs for those projects are socialized within the grid. It approved $5.9 billion in new transmission projects in February, attributing the load growth primarily to data centers. PJM also runs a capacity auction to contract to procure power supplies where consumers pay billions of dollars a year to generators to ensure they are available.

“The PJM capacity market will be at its maximum price for the foreseeable future, it could be five or 10 years,” said Joe Bowring, president of Monitoring Analytics, the grid’s official watchdog. He said data centers need to bring their own generation, and those projects should get a speedy approval process.

Some local governments are now rethinking how utility costs are shared and who should pay. In Oregon, lawmakers in June passed the POWER Act, a law designed to help utilities strike fairer deals with data centers and crypto miners.

The issue is especially pronounced in the Portland suburb of Hillsboro, where 15 major data centers are located. Nearly all of Portland General Electric’s load growth has come from commercial customers, said Bob Jenks, executive director of the Oregon Citizens’ Utility Board. Yet over the past decade, residential rates climbed by 8 cents per kilowatt-hour, compared with just 2 cents for large users, he said. Rising home power costs contributed to a wave of electricity shutoffs during a frigid winter last year.

Portland General said there are numerous factors in rate increases. The utility is hoping to have new rates based on the POWER Act for the commission to approve next year “to keep prices as low as possible for our residential and small business customers while supporting growth of data centers as they continue to come online,” said John McFarland, vice president and chief commercial and customer officer.

The POWER Act was designed to give regulators sharper tools to hold large electricity users accountable, said State Representative Pam Marsh, who introduced the bill. She noted that Amazon was collaborative on the legislation, though it ultimately withheld final support. Google did as well.

An Amazon spokesperson said the company works closely with utilities and grid operators to plan for future growth. When special infrastructure is needed, “we work to make sure that we’re covering those costs and that they aren’t being passed on to other ratepayers,” the spokesperson said.

Google supports paying its fair share for electricity to data centers and helping to protect other rate payers, according to a spokesperson. The company said it has been working to use less electricity even as it expands data centers, with Google’s operations delivering more than six times more computing power per unit of electricity than they did five years ago.

A similar debate is underway in the political battleground state of Wisconsin, where Microsoft is developing a massive data center on land once meant to be a plant for Foxconn, until the iPhone supplier dramatically scaled back its highly touted plans. Local residents are already paying higher bills tied to power lines built for Foxconn, according to Tom Content, executive director of the state’s Citizens Utility Board.

Now, with Microsoft’s site requiring 900 megawatts — and an even larger 1.3-gigawatt facility that could go up to 3.5 gigawatts approved for construction farther north — utility We Energies and its parent company told investors it will need to boost its power capacity by about 20% through 2029. The utility, which plans investments to bring 6 gigawatts of new generation online in that time period, has proposed tariffs that force “very large” customers to shoulder the costs of infrastructure built for them, even if they later give up on the project.

Microsoft says it collaborated with the utility in structuring the proposed tariffs.

“We recognize that it’s literally our responsibility to make sure that when we come to a community, when we get connected to a grid, that the cost of the infrastructure that is being dedicated to us, that those costs of service, get allocated to us,” said Bobby Hollis, Microsoft’s vice president of energy.

Still, Milwaukee resident Montre Moore, first vice president at the county chapter of the NAACP, is worried about the impact of future rising prices on the area’s poor and communities of color. His own home heating bill rose from around $118 a month to $160 last winter, and he expects another hike this year. “We are in for a world of hurt that is coming from a rate perspective and from an environmental perspective,” he said.

We, in a statement, said its typical bills are in line with other Midwest utilities, and that its most recent rate approved by regulators wasn’t tied to data centers and instead was related to issues including programs for severe weather and costs from previous projects.

In northern Virginia, Dominion Energy cited data center demand, inflation and higher fuel costs when asking regulators to raise its customer bills by about $20 a month for the average residential user over the next two years. Customers wrote Dominion’s regulators to complain.

One woman from Hampton said she’s an 81-year-old widow with limited income and can’t afford the increase. Another from Virginia Beach said she and her husband are already living paycheck to paycheck. A man in Midlothian said data centers shouldn’t push up bills if they’re not paying their fair share.

Mary Ruffine was shocked to see her monthly bill increase to around $260 from roughly $200. She lives in Arlington, Virginia, an affluent Washington suburb with tree-lined streets shading homes. Her monthly bill increases don’t mean she has to skimp on medication or skip meals. But she doesn’t like that poorer people are shouldering higher bills while some of the richest companies in the world profit.

“I just feel like we are sharing the burden in an uneven way with these corporations that have billions of dollars,” she said. “And so we the people are the ones who are absorbing the costs for these data centers.”

Back in Baltimore, Antoinette Robinson leaned on her walker during a recent afternoon stroll to complain that her high power bills leave her with less than $100 in her bank account at the end of each month. “It’s killing my pockets,” she said.

Stanley says the trees that used to grow on his street were cut down. Without their shade his home gets even hotter in the summer, forcing him to rely more on expensive air conditioning.

The rise in his power bills has him reusing disposable razors 20 times and stretching the supplies for his diabetes and sleep apnea. Sometimes he goes to food banks.

“People shouldn’t have to decide between their gas and electric bill and food,” he said.

Methodology

Change in electricity prices

To examine the impact of data centers on power grids, we first analyzed real-time electricity prices for so-called Locational Marginal Pricing (LMP) nodes, using data provided by Grid Status, for the seven Regional Transmission Organizations (RTO) where wholesale electricity markets operate in the US. Some areas of the country do not participate in these markets and were not included in the analysis.

LMP nodes are points in a power grid, including substations, power generation facilities and connections between transmission lines, where wholesale electricity is being auctioned off, either in real time or for the day ahead. The analysis only included nodes that had electricity-price data for both 2020 and 2025, as well as a known location so that distance from data centers could be measured. In total, our analysis captured about 25,000 nodes.

For each node, we calculated the difference between the median electricity prices recorded at five-minute intervals for the months of April 2020 and April 2025. We focused on the month of April because US grids generally don’t face additional pressure from extreme weather during that month, like they tend to do during winter and summer months. We replicated the analysis for the months of January and July to confirm that the same pattern held true: the median distance from significant data center activity is shorter for nodes that recorded the highest price increases.

Wholesale electricity prices can be positive or negative. Negative prices generally occur when the supply of electricity is greater than the demand. We considered nodes where prices switched from positive in 2020 to negative in 2025 to have recorded a decrease in prices. Conversely, we considered prices that switched from negative to positive as having increased.

Distance from data centers

Next, we determined each LMP node’s proximity to significant data center activity using data from DC Byte. To define what constitutes significant activity, we used a dynamic threshold of data center live capacity around each node after speaking with power-modeling experts, who indicated the price impact of a data center on a given node varies depending on how much capacity is already operating in the area. To calculate the level of data center activity, we first divided the US into grid cells using H3, a well-established geospatial indexing system, at resolution 4 to create equal-sized areas that cover about 683 square miles. We then calculated the total live capacity within that area as of July 2025, and the distance of each node from 20% of that total capacity.

For the purposes of mapping the data, we split the country into hexagonal cells of 100 square miles each. Only cells where LMP nodes exist are shown. For each cell, we calculated the average wholesale electricity price for April of each year between 2020 and 2025, based on the median prices of all nodes included in the cell. For areas where the electricity price switched from positive to negative, we considered the change as –100%. Cells deemed as being far from data centers were ones in which the LMP nodes had an average distance greater than 50 miles from significant data center activity.

Electricity consumption by state

To estimate data centers’ share of a state’s electricity consumption, we adjusted the total live capacity of data centers in each state to account for utilization and energy efficiency. We converted the capacity values to energy consumption estimates using the following formula: MWh = (capacity) (hours in a year) (utilization rate) * (Power Usage Effectiveness) where capacity is the installed IT capacity, utilization rate is 70% and Power Usage Effectiveness (PUE) is equal to an average of 1.5.

The calculation assumes that data centers are running 70% of the time and that their PUE — a ratio to determine a data center’s efficiency — is 1.5 on average. These numbers can vary from facility to facility.

Cox’s report also showed that new EV sales set a record at 146,332 units, but grew just 17.7 percent from 2024.
Electric vehicles are no longer viewed solely as cutting-edge or luxury purchases.
Consumers are also more confident about purchasing secondhand electric cars.
Electrek reported that while the company still leads in overall EV sales, its U.S. share dropped to 38 percent in August, the lowest on record.","Used electric vehicles are now the fastest-selling cars in the United States, according to new data from Cox Automotive, marking a milestone for a market that has long hovered on the edge of mainstream adoption. In August, sales of used EVs hit a record 40,960 units, a 59 percent increase compared to the same month last year. Cox’s report also showed that new EV sales set a record at 146,332 units, but grew just 17.7 percent from 2024.

The numbers highlight a shift in consumer behavior. Electric vehicles are no longer viewed solely as cutting-edge or luxury purchases. They are increasingly practical choices for everyday drivers, and buyers are showing a strong preference for the affordability of used models. According to Cox, August’s surge also gave used EVs their largest market share ever, representing 2.4 percent of all used-vehicle sales in the U.S.

Why buyers are turning to used EVs

Price is the biggest driver. While new EVs can still come with steep sticker prices, older models are entering the resale market at significantly lower costs, making them accessible to a wider audience. Many of the EVs sold over the past three years were leased, and Cox data shows those lease returns are now adding to the supply of used vehicles.

Consumers are also more confident about purchasing secondhand electric cars. Worries about battery life and expensive repairs haven’t vanished, but diagnostics and warranties are improving. Recurrent, a company that tracks EV battery health, reports that transparency tools and service programs are making buyers more comfortable with pre-owned purchases. Cox’s Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index also showed wholesale values for used EVs rising 0.8 percent in August, compared to a 0.7 percent increase for the overall used-car market — a sign that demand is outpacing supply.

Federal tax credits have further fueled demand. Buyers are eager to secure incentives that apply to certain used EVs, and analysts told Electric Cars Report that looming changes to those credits have created urgency. For price-sensitive shoppers, the combination of incentives and lower purchase prices has made used EVs far more appealing than new ones.

Meanwhile, new EV growth is showing signs of leveling off. Automakers continue to expand their lineups, and total sales remain strong, but many consumers are cautious about committing to higher monthly payments at a time of elevated interest rates. Hybrids and traditional gasoline models are still widely available, often at lower prices, which keeps new EV adoption from accelerating more quickly.

Tesla’s market share has also slipped as competition grows. Electrek reported that while the company still leads in overall EV sales, its U.S. share dropped to 38 percent in August, the lowest on record. A broader range of choices from established automakers and startups alike is pushing more shoppers into the used market, where multiple brands and models compete for attention.

Looking forward, analysts expect the used EV market to maintain its momentum. More vehicles are scheduled to come off leases, adding to inventory, and consumers who may have been waiting on the sidelines are finding compelling options. That influx could put downward pressure on prices, especially for older models with shorter ranges, but it also means buyers will have a wider selection, from compact sedans to family SUVs. Cars with stronger battery performance, faster charging capability, and transferable warranties are likely to command higher resale values.

New EV growth, by contrast, is likely to moderate once the current rush to lock in tax credits subsides. Automakers are still investing heavily, but buyers may hesitate until charging networks expand further and overall affordability improves. Policy decisions at the state and federal levels will also be critical in shaping the pace of future adoption.

For now, the August sales figures point to a pivotal moment. Used EVs have moved beyond niche status and into the mainstream, attracting buyers who once might not have considered them. The coming year will test whether this momentum is sustainable, but one thing is clear: the second life of the electric vehicle is proving every bit as important to the market as the first.

The grant—titled “Westchester for the Future”—will fund clean energy career training for 50 local individuals, with a focus on creating equitable pathways to employment in the region’s rapidly expanding clean energy sector.

The funding, administered by NYSDOL and supported by the New York Power Authority (NYPA) through its Office of Just Energy Transition, is part of a $5 million statewide initiative to support high-quality pre-apprenticeship and training programs that prepare workers for jobs in renewable energy, building electrification, electric vehicle charging infrastructure, and other green industries.

Westchester County Executive Ken Jenkins said: “Westchester is committed to preparing our residents for the jobs of the future, and this grant is a powerful investment in that vision. By expanding training in clean energy, we are not only opening doors for jobseekers — especially those in disadvantaged communities — but also ensuring our local employers have access to the skilled talent they need to grow. This is about equity, economic opportunity and building a more sustainable future for all of Westchester.”

“This grant allows us to deliver high-impact training that not only meets the needs of the clean energy economy but also ensures underserved populations across Westchester have direct access to these career opportunities,” said WPWDB Executive Director Thom Kleiner. “It’s a win for local jobseekers, for employers, and for the region’s environmental goals.”

The WPWDB will issue a Request for Proposals (RFP) this fall to select qualified training providers who will deliver industry-aligned programming and wraparound services—including career counseling, case management, and job placement support. At least 35% of program participants will be recruited from Disadvantaged Communities (DACs), in alignment with NYSDOL equity guidelines.

To ensure job placement pipelines are strong, the WPWDB is partnering with Sustainable Westchester and the Business Council of Westchester’s Clean Energy Action Coalition to identify employment opportunities for graduates. These organizations will help bridge connections between program completers and employers across the region who are seeking skilled talent in the clean energy space.

This initiative builds on Westchester’s commitment to workforce equity and climate resilience and aligns with Governor Hochul’s climate goals under the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act (CLCPA).

Regulations finalized under President Joe Biden that assumed more than 50 percent of the US auto market would be composed of fully electric models by 2032 “are a lawful exercise of authority Congress provided to EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles,” Tesla said in a regulatory filing posted online by the US Environmental Protection Agency last week.

The comments come as the EPA considers rescinding a key finding that greenhouse gas emissions from cars and other sources pose a threat to public health. The so-called endangerment finding provided the legal basis for the federal government’s most ambitious efforts to slash planet-warming emissions, including those from automobiles.

It also provided a regulatory framework to support Tesla’s investments in product development and production, the automaker said in its comments.

Tesla said it “respectfully encourages EPA not to rescind the Endangerment Finding, as that finding is lawful, based on a robust factual and scientific record, and has been an established part of federal law for more than fifteen years.”

Other carmakers have urged the EPA to roll back the Biden-era emissions rules, calling them “simply not achievable,” in separate comments submitted by the Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents nearly all major manufacturers except Tesla.

The EPA’s effort to repeal the endangerment finding is part of a series of actions under President Donald Trump to curtail federal support for electric vehicles, of which Tesla is the nation’s largest seller.

Christian continued, “Coal isn’t going away — it’s a critical part of our energy mix. While U.S. energy policy should be to eliminate all subsidies and let the free market compete, it’s not the reality we live in and not all subsidies are equal: coal production for power provides profits that wind and solar simply cannot. It’s cheaper, more reliable and provides vastly more baseload power per price than wind/solar. In fact, according to the Texas Public Policy Foundation, ‘Wind has received 48 times more subsidies per unit of electricity generated than oil and gas, while solar has garnered a staggering 168 times more.’ With smart investments in sources like coal, we can modernize plants, cut red tape, and ensure coal remains a backbone of American prosperity for generations to come.”

Deadline Extensions Proposal and Companion Direct Final Rule Summary

With this action, the EPA is extending compliance deadlines for the effluent limitations guidelines (ELGs) that apply to coal-fired power plants. This will allow facilities to respond to increases in demand and provide energy reliability for Americans. At the same time, the EPA will gather more information on implementation of the ELGs to evaluate feasibility and ensure a practical approach to protecting water resources while meeting critical energy demand.

The EPA estimates that the proposal would reduce costs by approximately $30 million to $200 million per year.

Q&A

Why is the EPA taking this action?

This action advances the goals of President Trump’s Unleashing American Energy Executive Order by ensuring the country has reliable, affordable electricity while protecting our nation’s water resources under the Clean Water Act (CWA). A national energy crisis is impacting the U.S. electric power sector in the form of extraordinary increases in electricity demand driven in part by the artificial intelligence (AI) and datacenter revolution, as well as an industrial and manufacturing resurgence.

The existing compliance deadlines are simply unworkable in this dynamic reality and the EPA is taking action to relieve pressure on electricity producers and the grid. The Agency is committed to giving utilities more time to evaluate and plan for rapidly evolving electricity demand to ensure economic prosperity for the nation now and in the future and ensuring that reliable, high-performing, domestic sources of energy can continue to be counted upon.

Which provisions of the existing ELGs would change and which would not change?

This action would change compliance deadlines for the Steam Electric Power Generating category. It would also add new rule provisions that would allow permitting authorities flexibility to extend compliance deadlines on a site-specific basis due to unexpected electricity demand. While this action would not change the zero-discharge requirements themselves, the EPA is requesting information on technology-based implementation challenges related to the 2024 ELG rule to inform potential future rulemaking to support practical, feasible, on-the-ground implementation of wastewater pollution discharge limits.

How will this action impact the economy?

The EPA’s proposed rule would strengthen America’s position as the AI capital of the world while bolstering industrial competitiveness. At the same time, it prevents higher costs for local businesses, creating opportunities for new investments and growth. When implemented, the proposal would save between $30 and $200 million each year. This means more money in the pockets of American families and more investment and growth opportunities for American businesses.

Will this action make electricity more affordable for Americans?

If finalized, this action would reduce costs for facilities and help with electricity reliability and affordability. The EPA’s current ELGs for wastewater discharges from steam electric power plants are potentially costly to an electric power sector that is struggling with increasing demand as AI is booming, data centers are being constructed and operated around the country, and American industry and manufacturing is resurgent. This action would give utilities more time to evaluate and plan for evolving energy demand for their customers/ratepayers.

Will this action make American electricity more reliable?

This action would keep existing steam electric power plants open and producing electric power, thereby making energy more reliable in America. This helps ensure adequate reserves of energy and reduces the risk of electricity blackouts.

How will this action impact the environment?

The EPA remains committed to ensuring that Americans have access to clean water. For more than 50 years, the EPA has partnered with States, Tribes, and stakeholders to implement the CWA and there have been significant reductions in pollution entering our Nation's waterways. Before the CWA, our surface waters suffered from pollution, with the Cuyahoga River becoming symbolic for catching fire at least a dozen times. Under the CWA, our Nation's waterbodies are now cleaner and safer and support recreation, wildlife, and economic opportunity. The Agency will continue to advance progress under the CWA, including by supporting practical and implementable standards for steam electric power plants.

What pollutants are found in wastewater from coal-fired power plants?

The ELGs for the Steam Electric Power Generating category apply to power plants that burn coal to create steam and generate electricity. These power plants use large volumes of water in their operation and maintenance. Their wastewater is treated before it is returned to the environment to reduce pollutants including selenium, mercury, arsenic, bromide, chloride, iodide, nitrogen, and phosphorus.

How will this action inform future rulemakings?

The EPA is requesting comment on real-world implementation challenges with the 2024 rule. The EPA will evaluate this on-the-ground information about implementation challenges of the 2024 rule to inform future action that could include rulemaking. Additionally, the Agency is seeking comment to ensure that rulemaking efforts incentivize continued coal-fired generation.

The report compares resource plans for 75 utilities across the U.S.

The environmental group’s Mikaela Curry said the companies rely too heavily on natural gas and not enough on solar and wind energy. She said the utility would need to transition new and existing natural gas generators to hydrogen fuel or implement carbon capture to meet North Carolina’s 2050 carbon neutrality deadline.

Neither technology is currently commercially viable in North Carolina, and existing research does not show that natural gas pipelines can transport hydrogen without major modifications.

“We have proven, available technologies, and we’re not seeing Duke bring them on the grid at the pace and scale that we need,” Curry said.

Across all its territories, Duke Energy ranks second among utilities for the most new natural gas planned by 2035. It's North Carolina and South Carolina companies placed third, behind Georgia Power and Tennessee Valley Authority, with plans to add 3,620 megawatts of natural gas generation during the next seven years.

Curry said the poor grade also reflects risks for ratepayers. Fuel prices caused two-thirds of electric bill increases for Duke Energy Carolinas ratepayers over the last seven years, according to a 2024 report by the Environmental Defense Fund.

“The customers bear those fuel costs, not the utility,” Curry said. “Whereas if you’re bringing solar and battery storage online, there’s no associated fuel costs with those.”

Duke also lost points for not retiring its coal plants by 2030. Last year, state regulators ordered Duke to retire its remaining coal-powered plants by 2036.

The rise of artificial intelligence (AI) data centers is reshaping America’s energy landscape and national security priorities. These facilities are instrumental in enabling America to maintain its position as a global superpower. Stifling growth in this industry is not an option. We cannot allow an adversary, like China, to lead the world in AI development. The Chinese Communist Party already uses AI to advance its military and geopolitical ambitions. To be clear, this is a race we cannot afford to lose.

Data centers use enormous amounts of energy, placing greater strain on an already over-exerted energy grid. The United States Department of Energy notes that data centers used a little more than 4% of the nation’s electricity in 2023. By 2030, that number is expected to triple to a staggering 12% of domestic electricity use.

Make no mistake, I am fully behind America’s push to remain the world’s AI leader, and I applaud the Trump administration’s efforts to make that possible. This sector can bring thousands of high-paying jobs to America, stimulating our economy and keeping the country competitive in the global marketplace. However, we need a robust energy grid to seize this opportunity. Rolling blackouts and brownouts are becoming more common in markets where poor policy decisions have prioritized renewable pipedreams over reliable sources. If we maintain the status quo, we will be living up to Einstein’s definition of insanity: doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results.

There is no silver bullet when it comes to solving our energy grid crisis. However, a good starting point would be to advance policy solutions that prioritize dispatchable 24/7 energy sources over intermittent ones. We are doing just that in the House Committee on Energy and Commerce. A diversified national energy portfolio is the key to longevity, but it must be reliable. While natural gas, coal, and hydropower (region-dependent) can all help to meet this demand, there is another energy source that has the potential to propel our nation into a new generation of global leadership.

Allow me to introduce the nuclear option (no, not the Senate procedural motion). I believe that nuclear energy will have the largest role to play in fueling American AI development, and the time to act is now.

However, for nuclear energy to reach the pinnacle of American energy dominance, two things must happen: debunking the myths of the dangers of nuclear energy and fostering a financial ecosystem that encourages long-term, serious investments in the industry.

Ask anyone to name an incident involving nuclear power, and I guarantee they can cite Chernobyl. That happened nearly 40 years ago and was caused by faulty reactor design and operator error. That Soviet-designed RBMK reactor was destined to fail; we do things a little differently here in the U.S. Our reactors are pillars of stability. The domestic nuclear fleet consists of 54 plants hosting 94 reactors across 28 states. This fleet boasts a remarkable safety record, enabling the industry to operate at the highest levels of reliability and performance.

Private industry has driven innovation in the nuclear space. Partnered with a commonsense regulatory environment, support from milestone-based development programs at the DOE, implementation of the ADVANCE Act, and the reorganization of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, we are well-positioned to expand our nuclear fleet. However, we cannot support this advanced technology with antiquated systems and procedures.

We need a reliable fuel supply chain to power this revolution. Investments in mining, processing, and enrichment are critical to the growth of nuclear power. It would also be irresponsible not to address the storage of spent nuclear fuel and the need for reprocessing. With all the spent nuclear fuel currently sitting across our nation, we could power our current fleet for over 100 years with the right reprocessing.

We can build the fleet of the future, consisting of large reactors, small modular reactors (SMRs), and microreactors, the latter two of which can be scaled depending on demand. SMRs and microreactors also enable the industry to meet consumers where they are and where they will be going forward.

The current political climate, no pun intended, is poised perfectly for expanding our energy capabilities, and nuclear energy will be the catalyst for American excellence for generations to come. For us to achieve this goal, we cannot sit around while our adversaries take advantage of our inaction. Time is of the essence, and I hope my sense of urgency is shared across our great nation.

From the sidewalk, there's nothing to distinguish this house from its neighbors. But there's a tiny clue that something is a little different: a sticker on the electric meter with a Solarize Philly logo.

The owner, Liz Robinson, is the current executive director at the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association, a volunteer-based nonprofit that works to increase solar adoption in Pennsylvania. She's been involved in renewable energy policy in the city and on the state level for decades. Almost 10 years ago, Robinson had solar panels installed on the roof of this house, which she bought as a rental property.

Wearing an ""electrify your future"" T-shirt, Robinson pointed at the digital readout on the meter. ""This is telling me how much electricity is being produced, and even on a cloudy day like today, I'm getting a fair amount of electricity,"" she said. Her small system covers the electricity bills for this property and 60 percent of the bill at her house down the street.

""I thought it would pay for itself in 10 years, but because electricity prices have been rising, it paid for itself in less than nine years,"" she said. ""It's the best defense against a rising electric bill.""

Robinson remembers a time when the dream of widespread renewable energy for Pennsylvania, and not just for scattered individual households, felt within reach. In the early 2000s, the state was a renewable-energy pioneer, passing a law that required a certain percentage of the state's electricity generation to come from alternative energy sources.

In 2010, then-Gov. Ed Rendell boasted about this Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, calling it ""one of the most ambitious of its kind in America"" and praising Pennsylvania as ""a national leader in the field of alternative energy."" Since 2006, Rendell said, the state had made ""remarkable progress,"" citing growth in wind and solar generation.

""The Rendell administration did a lot of work to bring manufacturing into the state,"" said Laurie Mazer, co-founder of Formation Energy, a Philadelphia-based solar developer. ""There really was this moment where Pennsylvania was well ahead of the curve.""

But even as Rendell touted the state's investment in renewable energy, the landscape was changing. In 2004, the same year the state enacted the AEPS law, drilling began on the first gas well in Pennsylvania to use hydraulic fracturing.

The fracking boom birthed a new way of thinking about energy. By 2013, in a speech about climate change, President Barack Obama was hailing natural gas as a ""transition fuel that can power our economy with less carbon pollution,"" phrasing that was popular in messaging on natural gas at the time. It was a ""bridge"" from dirty coal to cleaner renewables, a temporary solution that would lower emissions and secure energy independence.

Fifteen years later, that bridge extends endlessly into Pennsylvania's future, with no glimpse of the other side in sight.

Natural gas production is still rising in the United States, and 60 percent of Pennsylvania's electricity generation now comes from natural gas. It's so tied to electricity in some Pennsylvanians' minds that they can't imagine how the state could run without it. State Sen. Camera Bartolotta, a Republican who represents a heavily fracked district in the southwest, appears on a billboard on the turnpike with this message: ""No fossil fuels, no electricity. Wake up America!""

Only 4 percent of Pennsylvania's electricity comes from renewable energy. Since 2015, that number has only increased by one percentage point, even as states such as Texas, Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota and Maine saw significant gains in renewables.

Pennsylvania now ranks second to last in the country when it comes to the percentage of its electricity generated by renewables, and in 2024, the state ranked 49th for renewable energy growth in the U.S. For utility-level solar, Pennsylvania ranked 41st, supplying just over 1 percent of the state's electricity. For residential solar systems like Robinson's, a separate metric from utility-level power generation, Pennsylvania is a middling 26th.

Pennsylvania's reliance on gas is one of the problems at the root of the state's soaring electric bills, experts say, because it means local consumers pay more whenever global gas prices go up.

In Texas, the only state that produces more gas than Pennsylvania, renewable energy's share of the electric market has grown from 12 percent in 2015 to 34 percent in 2024. And residential electricity rates in Texas are about 20 percent lower than Pennsylvania's, according to June federal figures.

Electricity prices in Pennsylvania continued to rise in 2025, following a sharp increase over the last few years that has hit Pennsylvania households hard. One reason for the most recent surge: data centers and the stress they are likely to put on the grid. New data centers are expected to drive soaring increases in electricity demand over the next five years, according to forecasts from Pennsylvania's Public Utility Commission. To power them, investors want to build even more natural gas power plants.

""We have become over-reliant on gas as a transitional fuel, and we continue to argue that it's a transition, yet we are not transitioning,"" said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project. ""We continue to build out our delivery system for gas, and we are locking ratepayers in to pay for that system for 30 more years.""

""Clean Energy Now""

Robinson traces the origins of Pennsylvania's failed promise as a leader in renewables to one big shift over the past 15 years.

""The change in the Republican Party is really the story here,"" she said.

When she first started working in the field, moderate Republicans in Philadelphia's collar counties were passionate advocates for conservation initiatives and open-minded about ideas like green energy. As Tea Party candidates and increasing polarization pushed this older generation of Republicans out of office, the legislature became more partisan, more contentious and less willing to compromise.

""It surprises me, in this day and age, how many climate deniers you have in the legislature. There's this almost visceral disdain for solar and wind,"" said Rep. Greg Vitali, a Democrat from suburban Delaware County who has served in the state legislature for more than 30 years and is considered an environmental leader at the capitol. ""It goes beyond an intellectual disagreement.""

Vitali, the chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, said there was effective negotiation and ""give and take"" when the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard passed in 2004. That isn't happening now.

One component of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro's Lightning Plan for energy reform is a bill to allow community solar, where customers can buy shares in a solar project even if they can't host panels on their own roofs. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House in May, but it's now stuck in the Senate, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority. Republicans have controlled the Pennsylvania Senate since 1994.

Elowyn Corby, the mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, an affordable-solar advocacy group, said this state of affairs on renewables doesn't reflect the feelings of the public. ""It's less about what Pennsylvanians want, because we've seen time and time again that when asked, Pennsylvanians like renewable energy. Pennsylvanians love solar,"" she said.

The state legislature's paralysis has effectively ceded leadership of energy policy to other forces, said Mazer, the solar developer. ""We haven't played as much of a role as we could have in deciding what our energy future looks like,"" she said.

There's another kind of energy gridlock at PJM Interconnection, the company that manages the electricity grid in all or parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. When it comes to Pennsylvania's emphasis on natural gas generation, PJM is a significant part of the problem, said David Masur, the executive director at PennEnvironment, an environmental organization in Pennsylvania that has closely tracked the state's lagging investment in renewable energy.

""There's just hundreds of projects in the queue, and something like 98 percent of them are renewables,"" he said.

PennEnvironment estimated that PJM's backlog of unapproved electricity projects could cost Pennsylvanians $12.5 billion in just one year. In January, after filing a complaint against PJM, Shapiro settled with the operator to stop a rate hike that could have tripled energy prices for Pennsylvanians.

If the system were working the way it's supposed to, more solar and wind projects would have been coming online as their costs drop compared to gas. Instead, PJM's delays have created a bottleneck.

""New competition is being blocked by this outmoded, vastly delayed interconnection system,"" Corby said. ""New energy is not able to come online quickly enough to keep our bills down. PJM needs to move a lot more things through the queue a lot more quickly.""

In a statement to Inside Climate News, a spokesperson for PJM, Jeffrey Shields, said the company has reformed its interconnection process, processing 140 gigawatts of capacity since 2023, with 63 more due to be processed in 2025 and 2026. PJM blames the slowdown on permitting and supply chain backlogs, ""none of which are related to PJM,"" and nationwide trends that are beyond the company's control.

""Electricity supply is decreasing while demand is increasing, primarily from data centers, not only in PJM but across the country,"" Shields said.

On a rainy day in May, protestors stood in front of PJM's headquarters outside Philadelphia. Dressed in rain slickers and clutching umbrellas, the protestors held hand-painted signs reading, ""Clean Energy Now"" and ""PJM, lower our electric bills. Connect clean energy.""

As cars zoomed behind him, state Rep. Chris Rabb spoke to the protesters and members of the press about his bill to increase transparency in PJM's decision-making. Rabb, a Democrat, said he believed his bill could attract bipartisan support, a rare feat in Pennsylvania's split legislature.

""The reason I think this might have some legs is because so many of our constituents–rural, urban, suburban–are struggling to pay their utility bills. And it's only going to get worse if PJM continues to operate in this fashion,"" he said. ""I think it can garner some Republican votes, because they have ratepayers, too, who are not happy about the coming hikes. People are going to be mad as hell, right? They're going to wonder who to blame.""

Powering the Future

Data centers built to power electricity-hungry artificial intelligence technology are projected to consume enormous quantities of power, and in Pennsylvania, gas producers see an opportunity to keep extending the ""bridge.""

At Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick's Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh in July, $90 billion in data center deals between tech companies and natural gas and pipeline companies were announced. These investments could lock in gas as the state's primary electricity generator for another generation.

EQT, a natural gas company headquartered in Pittsburgh, said it would become a partner in a plan to convert the old coal-fired Homer City Generating Station into a 3,200-acre artificial intelligence campus with the country's largest gas-fired power plant.

""This agreement ensures long-term energy security for the data center campus, while demonstrating our commitment to powering the future with Pennsylvania gas,"" Corey Hessen, one of the leaders of the Homer City project, said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the costs of drilling for gas are going up. ""There's a slowing of production growth happening here in the United States, and the so-called shale revolution is in the later innings,"" said Trey Cowan, an oil and gas energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. ""It's getting more and more expensive to drill.""

It's also getting more expensive to build natural gas power plants, said Sean O'Leary, senior researcher in energy and petrochemicals at the Ohio River Valley Institute: ""The cost of building a gas-fired power plant has gone up by about two-and-a-half times.""

That could pose problems if all of the gas power plants that PJM thinks it will need to meet growing demand over the next decade are built. Trump's massive tariffs on steel are likely to further inflate costs, said Christopher Doleman, an LNG and gas specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

And the premise that the bridge was originally built on–that natural gas made sense as a transition to renewables because it emitted fewer greenhouse gases than other fossil fuels–turns out to be far more complicated than the politicians of the 2010s claimed.

Although it's true that burning natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases than coal, evidence is growing that its production and transport damages the earth's atmosphere more than previously thought. Methane is a far more potent driver of global warming than carbon dioxide.

Despite all that, both Corby and Robinson see reasons for hope. One of them is residential solar systems like Robinson's, which are small enough to bypass the clogged PJM queue.

""It can come online incredibly quickly. It also takes much less time to build,"" Corby said. ""That's a really intuitive and easy place to look, where we would see the results quickly.""

More Pennsylvanians are clamoring to install solar panels of their own, especially as electricity prices go up. Residential solar installations increased in Pennsylvania in 2022 and 2023, according to the most recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. George Otto, a retiree in State College, said he decided to do so after years of watching Pennsylvania politicians fail to make progress on environmental or climate issues.

""It's like pushing a rope to get those guys to move on any of this stuff. And so I figured, if we're not going to be able to do it through them, then each of us can do what we can within our sphere of influence,"" he said.

While nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon form of energy generation, it’s not considered renewable energy since it still relies on uranium as a fuel source.
Kim Reynolds has also noted nuclear energy expansion as one of her priorities in advancing Iowa’s energy systems.

Safer also asserted there is a connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons.","Researchers and environmental advocates said nuclear energy plants, like the Duane Arnold Energy Center that may restart in Linn County, have environmental, health and economic concerns that other renewable energy projects don’t carry.

Speaking at a press conference Monday with the Sierra Club Iowa Chapter, researchers from across the country said wind and solar energy projects would be cheaper, come online faster and pose fewer risks to Iowan’s health and the environment than reinvesting in nuclear energy sites.

NextEra Energy, which operated the nuclear facility that began decommissioning in 2020, recently received approval from federal regulators to transfer its grid connection rights from three slated solar projects to the nuclear plant. NextEra is still waiting on several permits and licenses before operations to restart the plant can begin.

Mark Jacobson, a professor of civil and environmental engineering at Stanford University, said in the press conference that solar and wind generation are more cost effective than nuclear, and have lower carbon footprints.

Jacobson said in general, nuclear energy facilities are more costly than wind or solar projects and can take 10 to 20 years to start new projects, while solar and wind infrastructure can be built and online in a fraction of that time.

While nuclear energy is considered a low-carbon form of energy generation, it’s not considered renewable energy since it still relies on uranium as a fuel source.

While Duane Arnold would be a restart rather than a from-scratch project, Jacobson said it “just makes no sense to go backwards into an albatross technology like nuclear.”

Bill Orlove, a spokesperson for Duane Arnold Energy Center, said in a statement that the possible restart of the plant would help power “Iowa’s growing economy and to help meet America’s surging power demand.”

Some metrics predict U.S. energy demand could grow as much as 25% by 2030.

Orlove said the plant would contribute 600 megawatts of generation, which fits with the Trump administration’s goal of adding 5,000 megawatts of nuclear energy by 2030.

Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds has also noted nuclear energy expansion as one of her priorities in advancing Iowa’s energy systems.

Duane Arnold began operations in Iowa in 1975. Orlove said it “operated safely for decades” and provided “reliable energy to Eastern Iowa homes and businesses.” It remains the only nuclear energy site in Iowa.

Safety concerns

Joseph Mangano, the executive director of the Radiation and Public Health Project, a non-profit dedicated to the research of low-level radiation impacts on public health, said proximity to a nuclear power plant can lead to higher rates of cancer, infant mortality and pre-term and low-weight births.

“In a discussion about what to do with Duane Arnold in the future, one thing has been missing, and that is, what is the effect on the health of people living near Duane Arnold,” Mangano said during the press conference.

According to statistics Mangano compiled from the Iowa Cancer Registry, rates of cancer in Linn and Benton counties from 1999-2022 were more than 10% above the state average for infants through 39 years old, while rates prior to 1975 when Duane Arnold began operations, were more than 5% below the state average rates.

Research conducted by Mangano’s organization also found that following the closures of eight nuclear power plants, including Duane Arnold, infant mortality rates declined in the area.

“The key point here is that these are just early statistics … there should be no final decision on the future of Duane Arnold unless these statistics, and additional ones, (are) thoroughly analyzed and thoroughly understood by officials and shared with the public,” Mangano said.

Orlove said nuclear plants have “rigorous monitoring protocols” including radiation monitors, to “ensure the safety of employees and the public.”

“The health and safety of the public is always our top priority,” Orlove said in the statement. “… Highly trained experts run America’s nuclear plants. With the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s) oversight and layers of safety precautions, a nuclear plant is one of the safest industrial environments in the United States.”

Don Safer, a small modular reactors specialist and the co-chair of Sierra Club’s Nuclear Free Team, said in the call that additional safety concerns exist in the operation of the plant. Safer said the risk for serious accidents due to aging and disused reactors pose “a huge threat.”

Sierra Club report gives Iowa utilities an F for clean energy plans

“About the Dwayne Arnold reactor: restarting it, I can’t say how much of a mistake it would be, how ambitious it is, and how unlikely that they really will be able to get it going again,” Safer said in the call.

Safer said in addition to the risks of operation, nuclear power plants also generate nuclear waste that has been difficult to find storage for across the country.

Safer also asserted there is a connection between nuclear power and nuclear weapons.

“If nuclear power does not exist, nuclear weapons have a lot harder time, even in the United States and the other nuclear weapons countries, of keeping itself going, because that’s not a big enough industry to train people,” Safer said.

Duane Arnold is not the only decommissioned plant that might restart. Other projects in the works include Three Mile Island Nuclear Generating Station in Pennsylvania, which would reopen to power Microsoft data centers; Palisades Nuclear Generating Station in Michigan and Indian Point Energy Center in New York.

Driving this trend, according to researchers is an increase in government funding toward nuclear energy projects, which while initiated under the Biden administration, was protected in the Republican mega-bill that was enacted in July.

Orlove said restarting the plant is a “serious undertaking.”

“We have a dedicated team working diligently to pull together all the necessary pieces to return Duane Arnold Energy Center to service,” Orlove said. “The plant’s possible restart will bring millions of dollars in revenue to the county, the Cedar Rapids Community School District and other districts to fund critical programs and services for residents. It would also bring hundreds of permanent, high-quality, well-paying jobs to the area.”

Many locals, labor unions and communities welcome the economic benefits anticipated with the plant reopening, the Cedar Rapids Gazette reported.

Wally Taylor, Sierra Club Iowa Chapter’s conservation and legal chair, opposed the restart of the plant, which he lives near, and said Iowans “should not let that happen.”

“Nuclear power is not the answer to our 21st century energy needs,” Taylor said.",https://iowacapitaldispatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/gettyimages-2177851416-2048x1535.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 18:02:25.476583

He recently launched the American Energy Dominance Caucus, aiming to enhance the U.S. role in global energy markets while fostering job creation and economic growth.","OPINION:

I got into this work partly because I know energy policy isn’t just some debate for folks in Washington, D.C. It’s about good-paying jobs for workers in Texas and across the country. It’s about the price you pay at the pump, what it costs to heat or cool your home, and whether your lights stay on when the grid is strained. For families, energy isn’t abstract it’s part of daily life. And right now, our energy security is being threatened.

That recent meeting between Russia, China, and North Korea with our friends in India sitting at the tableshould be a five-alarm fire for all of us. A new team is forming, and they want to be the ones who call the shots on the world’s energy. China, especially, has been playing the long game. For years, they’ve worked to corner the market on the minerals and materials that go into batteries, solar panels, and other clean energy technology. They want the world hooked on their supply chains. If we’re not careful, we’ll be buying our energy future from them and paying whatever price they decide to set.

That’s why I recently sat down with India’s ambassador. We talked about how Texas, and America, can be a partner. Texas has always been an energy powerhouse. We pump oil and gas, but we’re also leading the way in wind and solar. That all-of-the-above mix is exactly what India is looking for. By teaming up, we can sell more American energy abroad, create good-paying jobs here at home, and keep India from getting hooked on China’s supply chains.

But we can’t keep shooting ourselves in the foot. When we slap heavy, across-the-board tariffs on friendly nations like India, we don’t just hurt their industries we make it harder for them to buy from us. That pushes them right into China’s arms. Our trade policies need to be smart and aimed at our real rivals, not our friends. This is a tough fight, and we can’t afford to stumble over our own mistakes.

First, we’ve got to unleash our own energy workers. America produces oil and natural gas cleaner and safer than just about anyone else. Our allies want it, and we’ve got plenty to share. But too often, projects to build pipelines or export terminals get tied up for years in red tape. Every delay is a missed paycheck for American workers and an open door for countries like Russia to sell their fuel instead. Every tanker of American LNG shipped overseas is more money in a Texas worker’s pocket and less money in Putin’s war chest. That’s what energy security really looks like.

Second, we need to double down on invention and production here at home. Nobody in the world can out-innovate America. We’ve got the best scientists, engineers, and builders. Let’s put them to work on the next generation of energy: better batteries, safer nuclear, cleaner fuels, smarter grids. And here’s the key: let’s not just design it here, let’s build it here. That means factories, supply chains, and jobs on American soil. If we keep outsourcing production to China, we’ll never be truly secure. If we build it here, we own our future.

This isn’t about choosing between oil and gas or renewables and nuclear. We need it all. Texas has shown that you don’t have to pick sides we’re leading in oil and gas and in wind and solar. That “all of the above” approach is how we keep energy affordable, reliable, and homegrown.

Being the world’s energy leader puts America in the driver’s seat. It means our workers get steady paychecks, our families get lower bills, and our country is safer because we’re not relying on adversaries for what we need.

At the end of the day, this isn’t rocket science. It’s about letting American workers do what they do best: build, innovate, and win. If we unleash American workers, if we work with our friends instead of punishing them, and if we compete head-on with China, there’s no doubt in my mind that America can stay the world’s energy leader and keep our homes running affordably.

That’s not just good policy. That’s peace of mind for every family that wants a fair shot, steady work, and a secure future.

Despite the federal change, the Mayor and BED are continuing their commitment to the City’s Net Zero Energy goal and electrification strategy by sharing that BED will be boosting EV rebates on the purchase or lease of new EVs to $5,000, and $5,700 for income-qualified customers.

These are increases from the current levels of $2,300 and $3,000, respectively. BED plans to make these boosted incentives available through the end of 2026 or as long as incentive funds remain, whichever comes first.

The funds to be used for the boosted rebates are available through Act 44 of 2023 and Act 142 of 2024 -- State of Vermont legislation that enables BED to utilize a portion of its efficiency funds and Thermal Energy Process Fuel funds to bolster electrification programs.

As part of its 2025 planning, BED had reserved funds to increase EV incentives in the event the federal government ended its support for EVs.

BED also has worked collaboratively with the Vermont Department of Public Service to include support for rental weatherization policy implementation in its updated plan for use of the TEPF funds, which was submitted via letters and updates to the Vermont Public Utility Commission on June 18, 2025, August 14, 2025, and most recently August 29, 2025.

In the last two decades, coal mining in the U.S. has steadily declined due to innovations of renewable energy sources, and public opposition to coal due to the myriad of negative impacts coal production has on public health and the environment.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration delayed compliance of health protections for coal miners, and cut free black lung screenings for miners. The Trump administration has also begun rolling back a number of safeguards that limit toxic pollution from coal-fired power plants.

In response, the Sierra Club issued the following statements:

“Georgia already suffers from some of the highest energy bills in the nation. Propping up these outdated coal plants will do nothing but make those bills even higher and add more pollution to our air and water. Georgia Power cannot be allowed to tie our future to the coal industry of the past. We must fight for affordable, clean energy for all of Georgia,” said Sierra Club Georgia Chapter Director Adrien Webber.

“The Trump administration’s reckless actions announced today will hurt the American people, all to prop up the aging and outdated coal industry,” said Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender. “Coal power is now not only the dirtiest form of electricity, it is one of the most expensive, contributing to the rising cost of Americans’ energy bills.

“Donald Trump’s plan doesn’t just saddle us with higher bills, he wants to lease millions of acres of public lands to mining companies and further slash protections for our clean air and water. Rather than investing in clean, affordable energy to power our country, more coal will increase deadly air pollution, poison our water with harmful heavy metals, and drastically worsen the health of our loved ones.

But it still reported a fall in revenues of more than £500m to £6.5bn, according to accounts filed in Singapore.

Sluggish economic growth and flagging consumer confidence were compounded by one-off issues, the company said, including the strength of the pound against the currencies of economies in Asia, where it sells many of its products.

The bagless vacuum cleaner and hand dryer company also incurred one-off costs associated with a global reorganisation that included about 1,000 job cuts in the UK.

The result was a 47% plunge in pre-tax profit to £561m for 2024.

The company’s chief executive, Hanno Kirner, said 2024 had been a “difficult but necessary year of transformation” for the company. As well as axing staff, Dyson also slashed the annual dividend it pays to the family’s holding company.

The payout to Weybourne Holdings, which also houses the Dyson family’s fast-growing investments in agricultural land and farming, declined from £700m to £200m in 2024.

However, notes attached to the accounts reveal that Dyson has since topped up the payments with £225m of dividends spread over January and February of the current financial year.

Dyson founded the company in Malmesbury, Wiltshire, in 1991. While it makes most of its products overseas, it does most of its research, development and design of products in the UK, at the company’s facility in the town.

Amid criticism of his decision to move the company to Singapore, particularly in the light of his vocal support for Brexit, Dyson has previously said that the UK will remain a major research and development hub for the company.

The 78-year-old entrepreneur, is among the largest landowners in the UK after investing heavily in farming and cutting-edge food production, while two of his children, Jacob and Sam, are on the board of Dyson Holdings. All three are described as “permanent residents” of Singapore in corporate filings.

The entrepreneur and his family came fourth in the 2025 Sunday Times Rich List, with an estimated fortune of £20.8bn.

In a statement accompanying the results, Dyson pointed to new products launched in 2024, which include a “complete reinvention of the hairdryer” and a haircare-meets-styling range that uses chitosan, a plant-based polymer from oyster mushrooms.

He said: “We are hugely excited about our launches in 2025 and beyond, which bring significant innovations into people’s homes including new wet and dry floor-cleaning technology, robotic technology and purification technology, as well as complete reinventions of our hairdryer and vacuum cleaner formats.”

Products launched this year include the “slimmest vacuum in the world”, which has a diameter of 38mm.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/71b182eee3abe3504123d0d755ced281a95296f6/144_0_2917_2333/master/2917.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=e69999a3823a4c2a4e2a03e3c549b455",N,,2025-09-29 20:59:37.648507

September 29, 2025

TOPEKA — Big utility companies nationwide lost ground this year in their plans to meet minimum climate targets, and Kansas’ Evergy received an F for a “multi-year backslide” from renewable investments, a Sierra Club report said.

Evergy received 9 points out of 100 this year, dropping from 12 last year. The company earned a spotlight because of its move toward delaying the closure of a coal-burning plant and plans to build new gas-burning plants, the Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges report said.

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035 and transition to clean energy through 2035, a press release said.

“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club. “The average score was 15. The purpose of the report was to inspire utilities to move us forward towards a livable future. We didn’t expect to see it go backwards.”

Gorman said Evergy’s decisions about natural gas plants and delaying closure of coal plants is part of a national trend. The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said.

Planning for a clean energy transition requires that utilities shift to running everything off of clean electricity, he said.

“There’s a good reason to increase load, but that’s at a steady pace that brings a lot of other benefits to the economy, to jobs, to ratepayers,” he said.

Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said. The Kansas Sierra Club was part of the work at the Kansas Corporation Commission recently to determine how utilities like Evergy should make sure costs associated with new customers, like data centers, aren’t borne by other customers, he said.

“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said. “I’d say that Evergy customers need to hold these large loads, these data centers, accountable to keep our bills low and lower our pollution by demanding that they use renewable energy.”

Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman, said the company is delaying its expectations of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.

“The reasons for this include growing demand growth because of the record economic growth in our service area and the need for new dispatchable generation, which is generation that can be turned on and off when our customers need it,” Penzig said. “The only sources of that would be natural gas, coal and potentially nuclear.”

Evergy announced last week that it is partnering with TerraPower to explore the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in Kansas, using advanced technology designed by TerraPower.

Penzig said Sierra Club has a narrow mission of retiring all fossil-fuel generation as soon as possible.

“At Evergy, we have to first ensure that it’s reliable, so it’s there when our customers need it. And what is the least cost combination of resources that we can use to get there,” she said. “If you look at our long-term plan, it has a considerable amount of renewables also being added to serve customers. The only reason we can do that is by combining it with traditional energy sources so that we can ensure we have reliable service.”

Penzig said the new generation of natural gas plants has advanced technology that makes them more efficient and cleaner than older plants.

Gorman said focusing on decreasing fossil fuel use is critical because of the effects of the climate crisis.

“We see them all across the country, the extreme weather, extreme heat, extreme cold,” he said. “They’re causing utility infrastructure to fall apart, especially gas and fossil fuel infrastructure. In response, these utilities in order to increase their profits are doubling down on that same gas and coal infrastructure that’s the most expensive.”

Gorman said it’s clear the utilities are going in the wrong direction.

“(Evergy CEO) David Campbell is taking Evergy backwards, trying to increase fossil fuel product pollution and shareholder profits by spending as much as they can on expensive fossil fuel infrastructure, as much as the Kansas Corporation Commission will allow them to,” he said. That’s making our climate crisis worse. It’s making our bills higher, and it’s making our health worse.”",https://i0.wp.com/sunflowerstateradio.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Evergy-Lawrence.jpg?fit=1200%2C800&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-29 20:02:14.212775

Save up to 40% on energy bills with new heat pumps, one system for heating & cooling, rebates & tax credits make them affordable.

Heat pumps are a year-round smart solution. Our guide explains savings, comfort, environmental benefits, and incentives that make them affordable for homeowners.”

— Charles Schoonmaker

NJ, UNITED STATES, September 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Genuine Heating & Cooling has published a new, easy-to-understand guide for consumers. It explains how new air-source heat pumps can significantly cut down on energy costs. These systems also offer both heating and cooling from one unit. The guide points out that highly efficient heat pumps can lower utility bills by 20–40 percent. This is compared to old oil heaters or electric resistance heaters. This applies to heat pumps with SEER ratings of 18–20+ and Heating Seasonal Performance Factors (HSPF) above 9. These systems can reverse their operation. This means they warm homes in winter and cool them in summer. You won't need separate furnaces and air conditioners anymore.

“Many homeowners still think heat pumps are only for mild weather,” the guide explains. “But new models for cold weather now provide full heating even when it's very cold outside, below –13 °F.” This technology works by moving heat, not by creating it. This makes it much more efficient than burning fuel or using electric coils. Heat pumps run on electricity. In New Jersey, more and more electricity comes from renewable sources. So, heat pumps also reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This helps shrink a home’s carbon footprint.

Besides saving energy, the guide shows many life advantages of heat pumps. Modern units run quietly, typically 40–55 decibels outdoors. They don't need oil deliveries or propane tanks. Homeowners might qualify for good financial help. The New Jersey Clean Energy Program gives rebates of up to $2,000 for certain heat pump installations. Federal tax credits cover 30 percent of costs, up to $2,000. The guide also says installation usually takes 1–3 days. This includes a professional calculation of your home's needs, picking the right system, and handling permits.

The costs are clear. Installing a single-zone ductless heat pump can cost $4,000–$7,500. Multi-zone systems for an entire home can range from $10,000–$20,000 or more. Replacing an old furnace and central AC with a ducted heat pump costs about $12,000–$18,000. Prices depend on the system's size, how efficient it is, how many zones you need, and how complex the installation is. However, rebates and tax credits significantly reduce these upfront costs.

Following the Love Canal environmental disaster, the U.S. Congress passed the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act1 (CERCLA), laying the legal groundwork for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to investigate, list, and clean up contaminated sites. In 1986, amendments to the CERCLA, known as the Superfund Amendment and Reauthorization Act2 (SARA), stressed the need for permanent solutions and innovative rehabilitation strategies. Several strategies were implemented (e.g., increased stakeholder participation and improved existing tools) to focus on risks to human health. Over time, the EPA’s approach to Superfund cleanup has evolved across different administrations. The first formal emphasis on EJ dates back to 1994 with Executive Order 12898, which directed federal agencies to identify and address disproportionately high and adverse environmental and health impacts on minority and low-income populations3. More recently, between 2021 and 2024, a suite of executive orders has required federal agencies to further integrate environmental justice considerations into policy development and implementation4,5,6,7,8,9. For example, Executive Order 140086 in January 2021 led to the development of the EPA’s Environmental Justice Action Plan. Superfund remediation efforts incorporated an environmental justice lens underscored in the National Environmental Justice Advisory Council report10 of May 2021. However, in 2025, Executive Order 1415111 terminated some of these initiatives, including directives to dismantle Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) offices and to eliminate screening tools and datasets developed to support environmental justice and equity efforts. Despite these changes, the underlying environmental inequities faced by vulnerable communities remain persistent. This highlights the critical need for independent, data-driven methodologies to guide equitable cleanup and policymaking, regardless of shifting political priorities.

The environmental injustice implications of Superfund sites have always been at the center of attention and controversial debates. These sites pose substantial health and environmental risks to communities, disproportionately impacting historically underserved and socially vulnerable communities (HUSVCs) who may already face additional systemic challenges. Past studies show significantly higher proportions of Black and minority populations adjacent to Superfund Sites12,13,14. Tract-level analysis of the nation showed that Superfund sites in predominantly Black neighborhoods were less likely to receive National Priority List (NPL) designation15. The U.S. EPA has implemented several initiatives to address and adhere to environmental justice principles. In this context, EPA, along with other federal agencies and state governments, has developed a range of tools to support environmental justice analysis and inform decision-making related to site remediation, risk screening, and community engagement. Notable tools include EJScreen16, EnviroAtlas17, CalEnviroScreen18, MyEnvironment19, and Climate Resilience Screening Index20, among others, to protect human health and prioritize HUSVCs. In its latest strategic plan, the EPA delineates its priorities and outlines a roadmap toward addressing climate change and promoting environmental justice21.

Funding for the remediation of a Superfund site is made smoother if that site is listed on the NPL or through the Superfund Alternative Approach (SAA) program. The NPL is defined as “the list of sites of national priority among the known releases or threatened releases of hazardous substances, pollutants, or contaminants throughout the U.S. and its territories”22. The EPA primarily prioritizes NPL sites for cleanup funding and timeline. A Superfund site is included in the NPL through three primary methods: (i) Receiving a Hazard Ranking System (HRS) score of 28.5 or higher, (ii) designation of a site by a state, and (iii) issuance of a public health advisory by the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry (ATSDR)22. The HRS score is a quantitative risk measure based on a scoring framework that considers several factors, including the likelihood that the site has released or potentially will release hazardous substances, the nature of waste, and the exposed people and the environment. There are several gaps in the calculation of the HRS. First, the cutoff score of 28.5 was originally set to cap the initial NPL list at 400 sites23 but remains the selection threshold today. The efficacy and accuracy of the cutoff score of 28.5 in distinguishing high-priority sites from lower-priority ones in the present context remain unverified24. Second, the HRS does not account for variations in community vulnerabilities and capacities.

Superfund sites not on the NPL may potentially receive funding for cleanup using the SAA. Superfund remediation funding is primarily sourced through four mechanisms: (i) funds provided by the Potentially Responsible Party (PRP), who is held liable for the cleanup25; (ii) funds provided by the Superfund when the PRP is unable to pay; (iii) federal appropriations, which contribute to cleanups26; and (iv) state government funding, which may include revenues from the excise tax on chemical manufacturers. It is important to note that listing a site on the NPL or addressing it through the SAA opens a pathway for federal involvement and potential access to cleanup resources. However, this designation does not guarantee immediate or full funding. The process of identifying and securing contributions from potentially responsible parties (PRPs) is often lengthy and legally complex. For sites without viable PRPs, federal funding becomes essential. Although the Superfund tax was reinstated to support such efforts, recent reports indicate that revenues have been lower than expected, and funding for orphan sites remains constrained27. These limitations contribute to delays in remediation and prolonged exposure risks for nearby communities.

Environmental justice concerns also arise in the processes of selecting and remediating Superfund sites. For example, some studies24 highlight that sites with cost-effective remediation measures may be excluded from the NPL, while less cost-effective sites are prioritized for inclusion. This exclusion can delay remediation efforts for certain sites, leaving HUSVCs near these locations exposed to hazardous conditions for prolonged periods. Such disparities underscore the need for more equitable prioritization frameworks that consider the unique vulnerabilities of affected communities, irrespective of their NPL status.

Despite continued efforts over the past few decades, critical gaps remain in current practices regarding a practical and standardized system that enables operationalizing environmental justice for listing and cleaning up Superfund sites while accounting for environmental and socioeconomic metrics. The allocation of an additional $3.5 billion to the Superfund through the Infrastructure Investments and Jobs Act7 offers an opportunity to clean up more sites. However, while the current screening approaches and scoring systems are comprehensive in assessing environmental risks, they fall short in considering the different capacities of vulnerable populations to cope with the risks they face. Here, we propose integrating environmental justice metrics to facilitate informed decision-making. Such integration can inform decision-making frameworks for enlisting Superfund sites in the NPL by prioritizing sites that directly affect HUSVCs.

We conducted spatial analyses of 13,453 Superfund sites across the U.S. to address the following key questions: (1) To what degree are disadvantaged communities overrepresented in blocks hosting Superfund sites relative to non-host blocks at the same geographical scale? (2) Does the extent of overrepresentation of disadvantaged communities in proximity to Superfund sites vary based on the cleanup status of these sites? (3) How can we integrate environmental justice metrics to provide opportunities for sites that do not have adequate funding (not listed in the NPL), allowing for the equitable distribution of resources? Answers to these questions guide the study toward its primary objective, which is to develop the Action Priority Matrix (APM) to support equitable decision-making for allocating resources for cleanup activities.

We spatially analyzed 1336 sites identified as NPL sites, 439 sub-sites within NPL locations, and 66 sites on the SAA program. In addition, we examined 11,612 sites, which comprised both non-NPL and proposed NPL sites. We classified the sites into two distinct categories. The sites listed in the NPL, part of an NPL site, or part of the SAA program were categorized under “Active cleanup” based on their cleanup status. Sites not included on the NPL or proposed to be on the NPL were classified as “No cleanup.” The categories were established to investigate whether disparities vary based on cleanup status. While acknowledging the potential existence of cleanup protocols at non-NPL sites, it is assumed that NPL sites generally receive a substantial portion of the Superfund’s resources.

The results from our analysis are organized into three principal sections. The initial section delineates the composition of communities residing in Superfund host blocks at the national, regional, and state levels. The second section presents the results of the nationwide disparity analysis, where we estimate the overrepresentation of HUSVCs in Superfund host blocks at national, regional, and state geographical levels. Third, we present our proposed APM to facilitate decision-making for prioritizing cleanup and Superfund resource allocation.

Composition of communities residing in Superfund host sites

An estimated 254 million individuals, constituting nearly 80% of the U.S. population in 2015–2019, resided within a 10 km buffer around at least one Superfund site. Almost 60% of these people (148 million individuals or 45% of the US population) lived in blocks where cleanup activities were lacking. These population estimates were derived using a 50% areal containment method, where a block was included if at least 50% of its area fell within the 10 km buffer surrounding a Superfund site. We compared the sociodemographic and socioeconomic composition of populations residing in host blocks to those in non-host blocks at the EPA regional and national levels. The EPA consists of 10 regions, each responsible for the oversight and execution of the EPA’s programs. The regions with their corresponding states are shown in Fig. 1a.

First, we examined sociodemographic attributes such as Black, Hispanic or Latino, Asian, and AIANNH (American Indian/Alaska Native/Native Hawaiian) populations. The median population of Black and Hispanic people was consistently higher in Superfund host blocks nationally and across most regions (Fig. 1b and Supplementary Table S1). Notably, we observed higher medians of the Black population at the national level and in EPA Regions 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. Similarly, the median of the Hispanic population in host blocks exceeded that of non-host blocks in all regions, with the largest regional difference observed in Region 9. In terms of socioeconomic characteristics, the median proportion of the population with low educational attainment was also higher in Superfund host blocks, particularly in Region 9. Due to data sparsity (i.e., blocks with zero values), comparative analysis for Asian and AIANNH populations was limited in several regions.

We examined the racial composition based on cleanup status, that is, NPL (active cleanup) or non-NPL (no cleanup) blocks. The results (Fig. 1c) show a notably higher mean proportion of AIANNH in blocks lacking cleanup activities. Specifically, in Regions 6, 8, 9, and 10, the proportions are more than twice as high as those of blocks with ongoing cleanup activities. Similarly, the proportion of the Black population was also observed to be higher in blocks without cleanup activities across EPA regions. A similar trend is observed for the Asian population across all EPA regions.

Disparities in the exposure of vulnerable populations

We examined disparities in the exposure of vulnerable populations using two metrics: the percent difference disparity metric (Dp) and the ratio disparity metric (Dr). As explained in the “Methods” section, Dp is defined as the absolute difference in the proportion of a population group (e.g., low-income, racial/ethnic minority) between host blocks and the reference geography (e.g., state, region, or nation), expressed as a percentage (Eq. 1). This metric helps indicate the magnitude of over- or under-representation. The disparity ratio (Dr) is calculated as the ratio of the proportion of a population group in host areas to that in reference to the population (Eq. 2). A ratio greater than 1 indicates overrepresentation, while a ratio less than 1 indicates underrepresentation. While Dp and Dr are often correlated, each offers distinct interpretive value, and we report both throughout the analysis to provide a more nuanced understanding of disparity patterns. Disparities were assessed across three categories: (1) all Superfund sites, (2) NPL sites (active cleanup), and (3) non-NPL sites (no cleanup).

Our findings (Supplementary Tables S2–S6) reveal notable disparities in the racial and ethnic composition of Superfund host communities at both national and regional levels. At the national scale, Asian populations exhibit the greatest overrepresentation around all Superfund sites (Dp = 198.6%, Dr = 2.99), followed by the Black population (Dp = 100%, Dr = 2.00). Moving down to the EPA-region level, disparities for the Black population were even more pronounced in comparison to other racial groups. At this EPA regional level, our findings show a pronounced overrepresentation of the Black population in Region 1 (Dp = 857.5%, Dr = 9.58), Region 5 (Dp = 514.6%, Dr = 6.15), and Region 7 (Dp = 428.8%, Dr = 5.29). Meanwhile, regional disparities were also identified among Asian and Hispanic populations. At the state level, overrepresentation was found again to be highest among the Asian population, Particularly in Massachusetts (Dp = 1029.3%, Dr = 11.29), New Jersey (Dp = 872.9%, Dr = 9.73), New York (Dp = 685.4%, Dr = 7.85), and Oregon (Dp = 455.1%, Dr = 5.55). Some notable state-level disparities include the Black population in Massachusetts (Dp = 950.7%, Dr = 10.51), Connecticut (Dp = 606%, Dr = 7.06), and Nebraska (Dp = 596.3%, Dr = 6.96). Notable disparities were also observed among the Hispanic population.

Focusing only on NPL (active cleanup) sites produces a similar hierarchy. At the national scale, the Asian population (Dp = 267.8%, Dr = 3.68) remains the most overrepresented race/ethnicity group, followed by the Black population (Dp = 112.3%, Dr = 2.12) and Hispanic population (Dp = 68.7%, Dr = 1.69). No disparities were observed for AIANNH populations. Disparities at the EPA regional levels were pronounced for Black and Asian populations. Our findings show a pronounced overrepresentation of Black populations in Region 1 (Dp = 929.8%, Dr = 10.30), Region 7 (Dp = 579.7%, Dr = 6.80), and Region 5 (Dp = 547.4%, Dr = 6.47). Regional disparities among Hispanic, Black, and Asian populations were largest in regions 1 and 2. State-level disparities where most pronounced overrepresentation was found among the Black population in Massachusetts (Dp = 1110.7%, Dr = 12.11), Nebraska (Dp = 983.4%, Dr = 10.83), Connecticut (Dp = 593.7%, Dr = 6.94), and Minnesota (Dp = 583.8%, Dr = 6.84). Some notable state-level disparities include the Asian population in Oregon (Dp = 683.3%, Dr = 7.83), and Utah (Dp = 435.2%, Dr = 5.35), Hispanic population in New York (Dp = 412.4%, Dr = 5.12), and AIANNH population in Indiana (Dp = 95%, Dr = 1.95).

By contrast, non-NPL (no-cleanup) sites reveal a different emphasis: the Asian population are still nationally overrepresented (Dp = 207.9%, Dr = 3.08), yet the most striking regional disparity is for the Black population in Region 1 (Dp = 1269.1%, Dr = 13.69) and the Hispanic population in the same region (Dp = 864.1%, Dr = 9.64). Region 10 is the lone area where the Asian population overrepresentation is not observed.

We illustrated these sociodemographic disparities based on cleanup status (Fig. S2). The scatter plot illustrates the disparity percentage for each geographical region on two axes: NPL (active cleanup) on the x-axis and non-NPL (no cleanup) on the y-axis. The 1:1 line of equality serves as a benchmark for parity; in an ideal scenario, observations would cluster at or near this line, signifying negligible differences between the two cleanup statuses. Deviation from the line, therefore, indicates inequity, with points situated above it revealing regions in which disparities are more pronounced around non-NPL sites, an outcome representing the most acute environmental justice concern. Our results show that most points (geographical regions) cluster well above the diagonal for AIANNH populations. Among the Hispanic population, a majority of points are also above the line but spread more evenly, except for a few points, such as Region 2 and Maryland. Among the Black communities, most points sit below the line of equality except for some notable geographical regions (e.g., South Dakota, Region 10, Wyoming, Kentucky, and Idaho). Finally, for Asian populations, most points cluster along the line of equality.

We also examine the disparities in the representation of populations identified as “disadvantaged” between Superfund host blocks and non-host blocks. Our findings (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Tables S7–S11) reveal significant disparities in the presence of disadvantaged communities within Superfund host blocks at the state level.

Nationally, the analyses identified no overrepresentation of disadvantaged populations in all Superfund categories. At the EPA regional levels, the disparity (all) was particularly pronounced in Region 4 (Dp = 52.7%, Dr = 1.53) and Region 1 (Dp = 42.6%, Dr = 1.43). Substantial disparities at the state level were found in Nevada (Dp = 251.4%, Dr = 3.51) and Vermont (Dp = 183.1%, Dr = 2.83).

The disparity analysis for NPL (active cleanup) also showed no overrepresentation of disadvantaged populations nationally. At the EPA regional levels, the most significant disparities were found in Region 5 (Dp = 55.3%, Dr = 1.55), followed by Region 2 (Dp = 50%, Dr = 1.50) and Region 9 (Dp = 37.5%, Dr = 1.38). Notable state-level disparities for this category were found in Maryland (Dp = 241.1%, Dr = 3.41), Vermont (Dp = 214.3%, Dr = 3.14), Nebraska (Dp = 166.8%, Dr = 2.67), Indiana (Dp = 146.5%, Dr = 2.47), and South Dakota (Dp = 102.4%, Dr = 2.02).

Lastly, disparity analysis for non-NPL (no cleanup) was performed. At the national level, the disadvantaged population was overrepresented by 5.8% (Dp = 5.8%, Dr = 1.06). Notable disparities at the regional level were found in Region 5 (Dp = 59.2%, Dr = 1.59), followed by Region 9 (Dp = 19.1%, Dr = 1.19), and Region 7 (Dp = 10.8%, Dr = 1.11). The largest state-level disparities were found in Nevada (Dp = 251.4%, Dr = 3.51) and Minnesota (Dp = 137%, Dr = 2.37).

Proposed action priority matrix (APM) for allocation of cleanup resources

We adopted the Eisenhower (importance-urgency) matrix to develop a multi-attribute APM (Fig. 3) that incorporates environmental justice into decision-making for Superfund site cleanup. Madani28,29 proposed using this matrix for public policy agenda setting and identifying the most prioritized policy actions and interventions with respect to the resource (e.g., financial, time, political capital, public support) limitations in the real world. By considering the disproportionate risk that disadvantaged communities are facing, our proposed APM facilitates a more equitable agenda-setting regarding the cleanup of Superfund sites. Each geographic unit (e.g., state, region) is placed into one of the four distinct cleanup classes based on the Superfund Exposure Score (SES) it receives and disparity, i.e., the degree of the overrepresentation of disadvantaged populations in blocks with Superfund sites relative to those without Superfund sites at the same geographical scale (disparity). These classes are as follows (Fig. 3): (1) balanced cleanup (Low-Low: low superfund exposure score and low disparity percentage), (2) focused cleanup (Low-High), (3) broad-based cleanup (High-Low), and (4) urgent cleanup (High-High). The quadrant boundaries are designed to be dynamic to ensure the cleanup strategy is adaptive, responding to the nuanced differences across geographical units. This flexibility allows policymakers to calibrate the matrix based on the scale of analyses, the level of resources available, and the socioeconomic and sociodemographic characteristics of the targeted geographic scale and community engagement. Considering these factors in delineating quadrant boundaries allows for targeted strategies for cleanup. Several studies from a wide range of sciences, including geography, health, and climate adaptation, have adopted the Eisenhower matrix, specifying their own approaches to dividing quadrants, providing decision-makers with a framework to effectively prioritize tasks30,31,32,33,34. In this study, states are included within the matrix as an initial step to present an overarching framework. However, for targeted actions, it is essential to conduct the analyses at a higher resolution (i.e., county level) by recalculating both SESs and disparity percentage accordingly. Including counties within the matrix allows for more granular assessments that may be utilized to ensure resources are allocated to local areas where Superfund site cleanup is needed most.

In addition, we propose action items for each classification within our matrix at the local, corporate, academic, and federal levels (Table 1). This multi-level approach is designed to emphasize the importance of engaging multiple actors in addressing environmental justice concerns in Superfund remediation. While we highlight the potential value of collaboration, we acknowledge that Superfund cleanups are frequently marked by stakeholder conflict and competing priorities. As case study research has shown31, PRPs often have financial incentives to contest liability, delay remedial action, or challenge stringent cleanup standards, which can limit the speed and scope of remediation. Despite these constraints, the action items in our matrix are intended to provide a structured starting point for discussion and policy coordination, even in settings where consensus is difficult to achieve. Geographical regions in the urgent cleanup quadrant require the highest level of prioritization within the APM. At the local level, once the EPA investigation reports are disseminated to the state and communities, the CERCLA mandates an opportunity for public participation, particularly in the planning and selection of remedial actions35. In addition, state and local government officials are encouraged to bolster preparedness and provide venues for education to ensure informed feedback. Finally, two-way communication should be established, and education on contaminants and remediation methods should be provided through partnerships with different organizations. Specifically, partnerships between researchers and community members can enhance the effectiveness of educational workshops and support community-driven research. At the corporate level, private companies in charge of remediation should be incentivized to hire locally. Finally, at the federal level, transparency should be a primary focus to share progress regarding cleanup efforts and streamline funding and permitting processes.

In the analysis, we defined the boundaries of the quadrants based on the national medians of the disparity percentage (59.7%) and the SES (0.74%). Figure 4 illustrates the relationship between disparity percentage and SESs aggregated at the state level across the U.S. The findings reveal seven states within the urgent cleanup quadrant. Among these, Nevada (SES = 0.82, Dp = 251.4%), Maryland (SES = 0.84, Dp = 141.1%), Illinois (SES = 0.87, Dp = 71.7%), and Indiana (SES = 0.80, Dp = 73.5%) yield the highest disparity percentage and SESs. These high SES values reflect the extensive presence of Superfund sites near population centers. New York, Illinois, Wisconsin, and Indiana were found to be the most populous states within this quadrant. The same states were found to be home to a substantial proportion of the disadvantaged population in Superfund host blocks. Our results suggest that prioritizing sites in these states could help address racial disparities through the equitable allocation of resources. For instance, in Nevada, the total population characterized as disadvantaged is approximately 1 million individuals, or 30.6% of Nevada’s population. In Maryland, approximately 0.9 million individuals, or 14.4% of Maryland’s population, are identified as disadvantaged. New Jersey yields a disadvantaged population of 2.1 million, constituting 22.1% of New Jersey’s population.

Within the focused cleanup group, Vermont (SES = 0.41, Dp = 182.1%) yields the highest disparity percentage and SESs. However, the disadvantaged population within 10 km of a Superfund site in this state was relatively low, with 0.09 million individuals. Wisconsin and Iowa emerged as the most populous states within this quadrant, home to 0.94 million (16.2% of Wisconsin’s population) and 0.49 million (15.6% of Iowa’s population) disadvantaged individuals, respectively.

States that fall within the Broad-based Cleanup quadrant exhibit high SES but lower Dp. This combination suggests that while disadvantaged populations may not be disproportionately affected in relative terms, a significant segment of the overall population, including both disadvantaged and non-disadvantaged groups, is exposed to potential environmental hazards. These are states where exposure is widespread and systemic, requiring broad, coordinated, and sustained intervention strategies. For example, California, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Hampshire all fall within this category. California has an SES of 0.89 and a Dp of 7.1%, while Florida has an SES of 0.82 and a Dp of 29.2%. These states also have some of the largest absolute numbers of disadvantaged individuals living near these sites: 14.7 million people in California, which represents 37.4% of the state’s population, and 8.4 million in Florida, accounting for 40% of its population. Although the relative disparities may be moderate or low, the scale of exposure highlights the urgency of broad-based action. States in this quadrant would benefit from strategies that combine technical cleanup with inclusive engagement and education. Expanding voluntary cleanup programs and providing incentives for local governments and private stakeholders to take proactive roles can accelerate progress. Incorporating environmental justice education into public school curricula can raise awareness and foster long-term advocacy. Enhancing local emergency preparedness efforts is crucial, particularly in regions where Superfund sites are vulnerable to additional risks from natural hazards, such as flooding or wildfires. Transparent, accessible communication platforms can help ensure that affected residents are kept informed and involved throughout the remediation process. Public-private-academic partnerships may also be especially valuable in these states, where scale and complexity demand both technical expertise and grassroots collaboration.

In contrast, the Balanced Cleanup quadrant comprises states with both low SES and low DP values. This indicates relatively minimal exposure and low disparity. States like Montana (SES = 0.57, Dp = 0), Arkansas (SES = 0.35, Dp = 0), and Wyoming (SES = 0.42, Dp = 0) fall within this group. Although these states may not face immediate or severe environmental justice challenges related to Superfund sites, it is critical that this does not lead to complacency. These areas can take proactive steps to preserve environmental quality and promote long-term community resilience. Recommended actions in these states include maintaining robust environmental monitoring systems to detect any emerging risks. Proactive outreach and community engagement, despite the current low levels of exposure, can foster awareness and build trust, laying the groundwork for rapid response if future issues arise. Supporting community-led initiatives, such as citizen science programs or local advisory committees, can strengthen local capacity and foster environmental stewardship. Finally, these states should work to integrate Superfund site information into broader planning efforts, such as climate resilience strategies or hazard mitigation plans, to ensure long-term sustainability and equity.

The disproportionate exposure of HUSVCs to Superfund sites is often the result of a combination of historical, social, economic, and political factors. These factors include historical discrimination and segregation practices such as redlining and discriminatory zoning laws that have systematically pushed HUSVCs to less desirable areas, often in proximity to Superfund sites36. The limited economic capacities of members of HUSVCs often restrict their housing options, reducing their ability to relocate and increasing their likelihood of residing in areas with low property values37. In addition, members of HUSVCs often lack the political power and representation necessary to influence decision-making processes. Although many Superfund sites originated from historical leaks, spills, or illegal dumping that predated modern hazardous-waste siting regulations, these legacy releases continue to have long-lasting impacts on surrounding communities.

Our study aimed to develop an APM that provides a robust and practical basis for equitable decision-making in allocating resources for cleanup activities. We propose that the initial step towards equitable distribution of resources for Superfund site remediation involves identifying HUSVCs that may benefit the most from cleanup activities. To achieve this goal, we calculated disparity percentages and SESs to position U.S. states within our matrix.

We not only highlight the prevalent environmental justice issues but also underscore the need for an equitable approach to resource allocation for remediation. The development of the APM, as proposed in the study, is a step toward advancing such an approach. From the findings of this study and similar studies, we raise a critical question: why has the overrepresentation of AIANNH, Black, and disadvantaged populations’ proximity to Superfund sites remained unaddressed in resource allocation? Traditional approaches, where NPL designation determines funding allocation, are insufficient in addressing challenges faced by HUSVCs. The APM we propose here offers a practical mechanism for addressing these existing issues by integrating environmental justice and equity attributes. We provide an equity-based tool for the just and equitable allocation of resources for Superfund remediation.

The study’s findings can inform a wide range of policies aimed at preventing future forms of inequity. For instance, our study findings can enhance the effectiveness of several EPA equity priority actions38 by providing data-driven insights that can inform decision-making. By integrating the disparity percentage and superfund saturation scores, agencies can better assess community impacts, target capacity-building efforts, and engage with HUSVCs more effectively. Additionally, our metrics can inform civil rights compliance and strengthen community science initiatives.

The findings from this study provide actionable insights for developing policies aimed at reducing environmental inequities. Agencies could utilize the metrics along with the APM proposed in this study to design policies that identify and prioritize communities disproportionately burdened by Superfund sites. These metrics and APM could be used to determine areas requiring immediate remediation or to inform preventive measures that address systemic disparities. This data could be integral in shaping equitable resource allocation strategies within federal programs, including Justice40, as well as at the state and local levels.

In addition to policy development, the findings can enhance decision-making processes for entities involved in NPL listing and remediation. By integrating the disparity percentage and SES into resource allocation frameworks, agencies can ensure remediation efforts are directed toward communities with the greatest need, based on both environmental and socioeconomic vulnerabilities. Our metrics can also facilitate the development of new HRS scores that are scaled for the varying vulnerabilities and capacities of communities. Adjustments to the existing HRS scores could incorporate these metrics to better reflect cumulative impacts and the unique challenges faced by underserved communities. Practical implementation could involve the development of geospatial tools or dashboards that visualize these metrics, thereby supporting transparent and equitable decision-making.

The results also provide a framework for equity-focused community engagement. By leveraging these metrics and the APM, agencies can better align their capacity-building efforts and funding with the specific needs of disadvantaged communities. For instance, targeted outreach programs could involve HUSVCs in the decision-making process, empowering them to advocate for their priorities. Strengthening partnerships with local organizations and stakeholders would ensure that interventions are both culturally sensitive and community-informed, fostering trust and collaboration between communities and agencies.

Beyond their immediate application to Superfund remediation, these metrics and the APM have broader implications for addressing systemic environmental justice issues. These metrics and the APM could inform climate adaptation strategies, helping to address the cumulative impacts of environmental hazards and climate change in disadvantaged communities. They may also advance civil rights compliance by identifying areas where potential systemic discrimination exists and supporting the development of targeted strategies to address inequities in environmental decision-making.

Applying the proposed APM could lead to several measurable outcomes for HUSVCs. By identifying areas with the most pressing needs for Superfund remediation, the matrix can potentially mitigate health disparities resulting from prolonged exposure to hazardous substances. It can inform strategies to address the cumulative impacts of climate change, particularly in communities already facing vulnerabilities due to their proximity to Superfund sites. The matrix also supports targeted resource allocation, enabling decision-makers to prioritize interventions that provide the greatest benefit to disadvantaged populations.

Future research should address the practical challenges of implementing the APM, including the complexities of intergovernmental coordination necessary for Superfund remediation on Tribal lands. These challenges encompass jurisdictional conflicts, cultural considerations, and resource constraints, which require a nuanced understanding and collaborative approaches to overcome. We recommend future research to refine the APM for site-by-site decision-making, enabling more precise prioritization at finer spatial scales. This approach could enhance its utility for addressing localized disparities and tailoring remediation strategies to specific community needs. Further studies should also explore barriers to implementation, such as logistical, institutional, and policy-level constraints, and identify strategies to overcome them.

Although our results are informative, they are not without limitations. The presence of military bases among Superfund sites potentially complicates substantive interpretations of our results becuase the active-duty military population and civilian population in a given area may differ with respect to their demographic attributes. Our analyses do not consider the spatial distribution of Superfund sites, which could be located away from population centers, and our results may be sensitive to the buffer distance used in the study. To maximize consistency with the measurement approach used in EJScreen, we applied a 10 km buffer distance in our analysis. Future research should assess the sensitivity of our results, which are based on high-quality publicly available data sources, when alternative buffer distances are applied. However, it is important to note that the consistency between our results and those found in previous studies suggests that our substantive results would be robust to alternative buffer distance specifications.

Input data

The 2015–2019 American Community Survey (ACS) data was used to examine demographic compositions at the Census block group geographical level. In this study, “blocks” will be used as a shorthand throughout the paper to refer to Census block groups. Census data extracted from the ACS includes the proportion of the population in each respective block that is non-Hispanic Black (Black), non-Hispanic American Indians, Alaskan Natives, and Native Hawaiians (AIANNH), non-Hispanic Asian (Asian), Hispanic (any race) (Hispanic), low-income (personal income 200% below the federal poverty threshold in the last 12 months), and without a high school education (persons ages 25+ without a high school diploma). Here, we consider racial minority groups, including Blacks, Asians, Hispanics (any race), and AIANNH, as HUSVCs. The HUSVC indicators align with those used in previous literature. They are available via various screening tools used to assess social vulnerability, such as the Social Vulnerability Index by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention39. The analysis included a total of 217,289 blocks within the contiguous U.S.

In addition to census data, we employed the Climate and Economic Justice Screening Tool (CEJST)40 to identify “disadvantaged communities”. This tool assesses regions nationwide, evaluating significant burdens across categories, including climate change, energy, health, housing, legacy pollution, transportation, wastewater, and workforce development. The CEJST employs a ranking system based on percentile thresholds, where the 90th percentile is a cutoff for most burdens. According to the CEJST, a census tract is designated “disadvantaged” if it meets one of the following criteria: (1) resides in a tract that surpasses thresholds for at least one burden, or (2) is in land within federally recognized tribal boundaries. CEJST employs a ranking system based on percentage thresholds to identify disadvantaged communities. Specifically, communities are considered disadvantaged if they are located in a census tract that meets the thresholds for at least one of the tool’s categories of burden. The threshold is typically set at the 90th percentile for most burdens, meaning the top 10% of census tracts for each burden are designated as disadvantaged. Each category of burden in the CEJST tool (e.g., air pollution, water pollution, energy burden) has its own distinct threshold criteria based on available data. For example, in the case of air pollution, the threshold is based on the 90th percentile of particulate matter concentration in census tracts. For energy burden, it is the top 10% of census tracts with the highest percentage of household income spent on energy costs. The CEJST disadvantaged designation is assigned at the census tract level. To apply this designation at a more granular level, we assumed that all blocks within a disadvantaged Census tract are considered disadvantaged. While this assumption introduces some generalization, it enables a meaningful comparison and spatial overlay between social disadvantage indicators and the exposure-based metrics used in APM. Moreover, communities located within federally recognized tribal boundaries are automatically designated as disadvantaged, regardless of whether they surpass the thresholds for individual burdens. While these automatic designations are aligned with federal priorities and commitments, it is important to consider the potential implications of bias within the analysis. Automatically designating tribal lands as disadvantaged could result in skewing results by inflating the representation of burdens or masking heterogeneity within tribal lands. For instance, some tribal areas may not meet the same burden thresholds as other disadvantaged tracts but are still included in the analysis due to the automatic designation. Moreover, a study argues that current federal screening tools, including CEJST, often fail to capture Indigenous-specific environmental justice concerns adequately41. Conversely, the automatic designation does not differentiate between levels of burden among tribal lands, potentially obscuring areas that require greater intervention. Nevertheless, this automatic designation is a recognition of systemic inequities faced by tribal lands.

Data on active Superfund sites in 2023 was sourced from the Superfund Enterprise Management System (SEMS) Database42, an official repository of Superfund site data. The SEMS database consists of the locations of all sites, given by either their address or latitude and longitude. They were geocoded based on available addresses using Geocodio43 for sites consisting of only addresses. The generated corresponding coordinates were then plotted onto a map using the XY table-to-point tool in ArcGIS Pro (version 3.1.3). From the database, we analyzed a total of 13,453 sites consisting of 1,336 sites identified as NPL sites, 439 as sub-sites within NPL locations, 66 sites on the SAA program, and 11,612 sites, which comprised both non-NPL and proposed NPL sites.

Host block selection

Three distance-based approaches are widely used in environmental justice scholarship to approximate the number of people living in close proximity to environmental burdens. These include (i) the 50% areal containment method, (ii) the Boundary intersection method, and (iii) the areal apportionment method37,44,45. These methods use the locations of facilities to assess the sociodemographic and socioeconomic characteristics of all geographical units within a uniform specified distance. However, each method has its own limitations. In this study, we apply the 50% areal containment method to classify blocks as either a host or a non-host (Fig. S1). Specifically, blocks in which at least 50% of the area is intersected within a 10 km buffer are designated as hosts. While the selection of buffer distances is inherently subjective, we use a 10 km radius, aligning with the proximity scoring approach used by EPA’s EJScreen 14. All spatial analyses were performed using ArcGIS Pro (version 3.1.3).

Disparity analysis

We analyzed block-level data for superfund host blocks at the state, EPA regional, and national levels and compared them with non-host blocks on the same geographical scales. We used EPA regional levels in our analyses to inform the EPA regional offices regarding disparities found in their respective regions.

The disparity percentage calculations used in the study are consistent with the method previously employed by Vahedifard et al.46. In our analyses, the disparity percentage (Dp) represents, in percentage terms, the extent to which each vulnerable group of interest is disproportionately overrepresented in host blocks relative to non-host blocks within the same geographical scale. For instance, to calculate the disparity of the disadvantaged population in State A, we use the following equation:

$${D}_{p}(\%)={\left[\frac{\%\,{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,\left({{\rm{host}}}\right)-\%\,{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,({{\rm{non}}}-{{\rm{host}}})}{\%\,{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,({{\rm{non}}}-{{\rm{host}}})}\right]}_{{{\rm{State}}}\; {{\rm{A}}}} \times 100$$

(1)

Equation 1 quantifies the disparity in disadvantaged population proportion between host and non-host blocks, within a specific state (State A). The disparity is calculated by dividing the difference in the percentage of the population in the host that is disadvantaged and the percentage of the population in the non-host that is disadvantaged within a given state (State A) by the percentage in the non-host that is disadvantaged within the same state. This approach was used to calculate Dp at each geographical level used in the study. Here, we calculate the disparity for two additional categories of Superfund sites. Disparities for blocks hosting NPL sites relative to non-host blocks (Active cleanup) and disparity for blocks hosting non-NPL sites to non-host blocks (No cleanup).

In addition to quantifying percentage differences between host and non-host blocks, we also calculate a disparity ratio. This ratio compares the percentage of a population in host blocks to the percentage in non-host blocks within a given geographical region, as defined by:

$${D}_{r}={\left[\frac{\%\,{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,\left({{\rm{host}}}\right)}{\%{{\rm{Disadvantaged}}}\; {{\rm{pop}}}.{{\rm{in}}}\,({{\rm{non}}}-{{\rm{host}}})}\right]}_{{{\rm{State}}}\; {{\rm{A}}}}$$

Superfund exposure score

The study introduces the SES, a metric designed to assess the proportion of the population in a given geographical region that resides within the combined buffer zones when multiple Superfund sites are present. A higher SES indicates a great level of exposure for the population relative to the total population of the region, thereby providing an equitable measure to compare regions with potentially heightened exposure. The SES for state A is calculated using the following equation:

The EIA attributed the decline to rising mining costs, increasingly strict environmental regulations and competition from other sources of electric power generation.
As part of Monday’s announcement, the EPA proposed a rule to give coal-fired power plants extended deadlines to comply with environmental guidelines for mercury emissions.","WASHINGTON — More than 13 million acres of federal land is open for coal leasing, the Interior Department announced Monday as part of a coordinated effort with the Environmental Protection Agency and the Energy Department to increase the domestic production and use of a fuel source that’s been declining in the U.S. for years.

The amount of land the Interior Department made available for coal extraction is triple the amount called for in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that President Donald Trump signed in July.

Trump has long prized coal as “beautiful,” “clean” and “abundant” despite much of the world moving away from the fossil fuel in favor of cleaner sources of energy such as natural gas, wind and solar. In April, he signed four executive orders — to end the moratorium on leasing federal lands for coal mining imposed during the Biden administration, to exempt some coal plants from various emissions standards, to legally challenge state laws obstructing energy production and to promote coal's use as a power source for artificial intelligence data centers.

According to the International Energy Agency, coal power plants generate 20% of global greenhouse gas emissions and are the largest single source.

“President Trump promised to put American energy workers first, and today we’re delivering,” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said in a statement Monday, in which he also announced a reduction in the royalty rate coal producers have to pay for mining operations along with a plan to recover mining waste infused with critical minerals.

In accordance with the tax and spending bill the president signed over the summer, the royalty rate for coal producers dropped to 7% from the previous rates of 12.5% for surface-mined coal and 8% for underground coal. The Interior Department is also working with the U.S. Geological Survey to map mine waste and speed up projects that could help recover critical minerals like uranium, zinc and tellurium, which are used in defense technologies and manufacturing.

“We are strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs,” Burgum said.

Environmental groups immediately decried the federal agencies’ moves.

“The Trump administration’s reckless actions announced today will hurt the American people, all to prop up the aging and outdated coal industry,” Sierra Club Chief Program Officer Holly Bender said in a statement Monday, shortly after the Trump administration’s coal announcement.

“Rather than investing in clean, affordable energy to power our country, more coal will increase deadly air pollution, poison our water with harmful heavy metals and drastically worsen the health of our loved ones,” she said. “If this dangerous agenda continues to advance, years from now we will look around at failing health outcomes, skyrocketing bills and a decaying environment, and there will be one man to blame: Donald Trump and his Republican enablers.”

Intended to strengthen domestic supply chains and increase the production of American energy, the expansion of federal lands for coal mining was announced Monday during a meeting of the National Energy Dominance Council, where the EPA and Energy Department also announced actions to spur coal's production and use as an electricity source.

The Energy Department announced it will invest $625 million to “expand and reinvigorate America's coal industry,” according to a press statement. Of that, $350 million will go toward recommissioning and retrofitting coal-powered electricity plants.

An analysis from the U.S. Energy Information Administration earlier this year found U.S. coal production in 2023 was less than half of what it was in 2008. The EIA attributed the decline to rising mining costs, increasingly strict environmental regulations and competition from other sources of electric power generation.

As part of Monday’s announcement, the EPA proposed a rule to give coal-fired power plants extended deadlines to comply with environmental guidelines for mercury emissions. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin also announced he is requesting information on compliance viability, saying meeting environmental rules established during President Joe Biden’s administration to control wastewater pollution might disincentivize the use of coal.

The proposals reverse several rules the EPA finalized last year when Biden was in office, including the requirement that existing coal-fired plants reduce their greenhouse gas emissions 90% by 2032. In 2024, the agency had also strengthened its rules for coal-fired power plants to reduce toxic metal emissions and to reduce wastewater discharge pollutants such as coal ash that could leak into groundwater.

The EPA said its proposals would save Americans $200 million annually in electricity costs.

According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, energy prices are rising at double the rate of inflation. The most recent Consumer Price Index found electricity prices had risen 6.2% in August compared with a year earlier, whereas overall inflation was up 2.9% over the same period.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/coal_mine_expansion,N,,2025-09-29 17:02:01.907789

30%: BYD Brings A Familiar Playbook To Japan

BYD Mount Fuji

The people of Japan have very specific tastes when it comes to cars. Small-engined kei cars rule the day, and due to persistent challenges around natural resources and power generation, plug-in cars have never really caught on over there. And when buyers go ""foreign,"" they go with premium luxury brands, usually European ones.

But compact size, fuel economy, affordability and reliability rule the day, and few outsider brands have been able to meet those needs. And most EVs you see there are overwhelmingly Teslas, punctuated by the occasional Nissan Leaf. (I've been to the country twice, and I've never once seen a domestic-market Toyota bZ4X, for example.)

The thinking was that if any EV or plug-in hybrid newcomer could break into Japan, it'd be BYD. But Bloomberg's progress report on BYD's two years of sales in that country indicates things aren't going so hot. So now, BYD is pulling a familiar move to drive up sales: fire-sale price cuts.

The automaker sold just 5,300 vehicles between January 2023 and June this year despite opening its 45th sales location in Japan, introducing a fourth EV model and touting plans to debut an electric ‘kei’ car in late 2026.

The moves have done little to ignite demand and BYD is now turning to discounts—a practice that’s put it front and center of an industry crackdown in China—to try and boost sales. The company is offering discounts of up to ¥1 million ($6,700) that, in addition to government subsidies, can slash sticker prices by as much as 50%. Its Atto 3 retails for just under ¥4.2 million.

It has a decent little lineup there: the Sealion 7 and Atto 3 crossovers, the Seal sport sedan and the Dolphin compact. But the upcoming kei car-sized EV will certainly be the missing piece. And even then, it's hard to say if BYD can pull people away from their proven Hondas, Daihatsus and Suzukis.

But then again, the Japanese new car market is relatively small. About 4.5 million new cars were sold there last year, compared to about 16 million in the U.S. So why does BYD care so much?

According to that story, it's about sending a message:

“Winning Japan isn’t the point; leaving a mark is. Earning even a sliver of recognition from the most demanding customers in the world matters for BYD,” [Bloomberg Intelligence senior auto analyst Tatsuo Yoshida] said. “What they really want is to have a track record of doing business in Japan with the world’s most discerning, quality-conscious customers, even if it’s not economically rational.”

This isn't just about sales, in other words. It's about BYD's rise in the world, wanting to be taken seriously as a global giant on par with General Motors and Toyota and the Volkswagen Group. (This is also why I think U.S. sales of Chinese cars are inevitable, and will probably be led by BYD.)

But as that story points out, the price-slashing carries serious risks. It hurts resale values and profits, as well as dealers and suppliers. The Chinese government has had to crack down hard on those practices. BYD may move the needle in Japan a bit by doing this, but the costs of doing so are abundantly clear.

60%: Why Car Sales Are An Economic Warning In America

I had a professor in college, a longtime former Wall Street Journal editor, who said that cars and houses are a good barometer for any economy. If people aren't buying cars and they aren't buying houses, your economy is kind of cooked.

The third quarter of 2025 ends in a few days and car sales look to be strong during that period. Scores of buyers rushed out to seize the EV tax credit while they could, while others took advantage of other aggressive deals on new cars of all sorts.

But I'm not alone in wondering what happens in Q4, when those deals are gone, and buyers are left with average new car prices hovering around $50,000 still. Here's the Wall Street Journal with more:

CarMax, the biggest seller of used cars, said Thursday that its sales and profit plunged in the latest quarter. The company’s results, which sent its stock tumbling 20%, is the latest in a series of unsettling developments in an industry under strain from President Trump’s tariffs and carmakers’ recalibration of expensive electrification strategies.

“The consumer has been distressed for a little while. I think there’s some angst,” CarMax Chief Executive Bill Nash told analysts on a call Thursday. Consumers with better credit profiles “seem to be sitting on the sidelines,” Nash said.

Ford said this week it was offering lower interest rates to buyers with the weakest acceptable credit histories as it tries to unload unsold F-150 pickups, its bestselling model. Honda said it was scrapping an electric Acura SUV after just one model year. Other brands are offering steep discounts on EVs to capture buyers before a federal tax credit expires next week.

The EV sales surge driven by the end of the tax credit, the WSJ writes, is ""masking weakness in the overall market."" But tariffs, still-high interest rates, general uncertainty and high prices across the board may portend bigger issues than we all yet realize.

90%: Mercedes Develops Low-Carbon Aluminum

It might be back to gas here in America, but automakers are under the gun in Europe to cut their carbon footprints and go net-zero emissions in the coming decades. That doesn't just mean zero-emission cars—it means cutting the CO2 output through the entire supply chain. (We have more about that this week on InsideEVs, too.)

Here's a cool development from Mercedes-Benz, via Reuters:

Aluminium made with renewable power and from recycling is helping luxury automaker Mercedes-Benz cut CO2 emissions in the production of its new line of electric vehicles, part of a wider effort to decarbonise operations, executives told Reuters. Mercedes uses the low-carbon aluminium, developed in partnership with Norwegian metals producer Norsk Hydro, opens new tab, to make its new electric CLA model.

The collaboration is an example of how makers of premium consumer products may pay extra for raw materials in return for a more environmentally friendly profile, executives of both companies said.

""There are, of course, extra costs from using an especially low-carbon steel or aluminium,"" said Gunnar Guthenke, vice president of Mercedes-Benz's procurement and supplier quality. ""Sustainability and desirable products, such as the ones we produce, simply go hand in hand,"" he said.

While these technologies do represent a cost premium at the outset, they are expected to decline in price over time.

I do think that in many cases, buyers in America went for EVs because that's where the best deals were, and not so much because of their desire to break up with gasoline. (Realizing those benefits usually comes later.) So what happens in Q4 if the tax credits are gone, fewer EV models are on sale and deals on cars of all sorts are harder to find? Or maybe automakers will keep incentives strong through the end of the year, and the ""real"" results will be seen in January 2026.

The Evolving Global Landscape of Nuclear Security

Lauren Sukin and Rohan Mukherjee

This roundtable examines sources of change in the rapidly evolving global nuclear order. Quantitative expansion combines with qualitative doctrinal changes to challenge traditional deterrence frameworks. Emerging security arrangements such as AUKUS, the Washington Declaration, and expanded NATO–Indo-Pacific ties illustrate evolving alliance strategies, while adversarial cooperation among Russia, China, and North Korea heightens risks of coordinated nuclear coercion. Across democratic and authoritarian systems alike, domestic politics increasingly influence nuclear decision-making, shaping perceptions of credibility, creating proliferation pressures, and dampening arms control prospects. Essays in this collection analyze six regional loci—Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, China, and the Korean Peninsula—highlighting two themes: the centrality of domestic political drivers and the cascading effects of nuclear dynamics across interconnected states and regions. Together, this analysis offers a two-level framework for understanding and addressing the complex challenges confronting today’s nuclear order.

The past decade has witnessed a rapid and complex transformation in the global nuclear security landscape, driven by both quantitative and qualitative changes in nuclear capabilities, doctrines, and strategic alliances. The expansion of nuclear arsenals, shifts in deterrence strategies, and the increasing entanglement of domestic politics with nuclear decision-making have collectively reshaped the foundations of the nuclear order. China’s significant nuclear buildup and North Korea’s continued advancement in missile and warhead technology exemplify the quantitative expansion of nuclear capabilities. Meanwhile, evolving doctrines—such as India’s and Pakistan’s shifting nuclear postures and Russia’s persistent nuclear threats in the context of the Ukraine conflict—illustrate qualitative changes that challenge long-standing assumptions about strategic stability.

Traditional extended deterrence dynamics are being redefined. The Trump administration’s antipathy toward alliance commitments, coupled with a broader shift in US global engagement, have raised concerns about the credibility of American security guarantees across the world. While these developments have the potential to unravel long-standing ties, several nascent relationships centered on deterrence are emerging to face the next nuclear challenges. The AUKUS pact, initially involving Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States, and now incorporating France, signals an evolving security framework in the Indo-Pacific. Similarly, the Washington Declaration between the United States and South Korea and the formation of a US–Japan–South Korea Trilateral Secretariat reflect growing efforts to reinforce deterrence against North Korea, while NATO’s increased coordination with Indo-Pacific partners suggests an expanding strategic footprint and common recognition of China as a threat. The durability and effectiveness of these arrangements, however, remain uncertain as global nuclear competition intensifies.

Adversarial nuclear cooperation has also become a defining feature of this emerging nuclear era. The strategic alignment of Russia, China, and North Korea—evidenced by military coordination, arms transfers, and political signaling—raises concerns about the possibility of simultaneous regional crises or coordinated nuclear coercion. Whether through explicit collaboration or parallel actions, these states’ nuclear strategies increasingly challenge the US-led security architecture.

This evolving multipolar nuclear environment underscores the need for a reassessment of existing deterrence frameworks and strategies. In this issue of the Texas National Security Review, we offer a collection of essays that reflects on the ongoing political and strategic changes in these increasingly interconnected nuclear environments.

Beyond broader geopolitical shifts, domestic political factors are playing an increasingly prominent role in shaping nuclear policy. In democratic societies, public opinion and political polarization can both shape the nuclear future. Divided discourse in the United States on arms control with Iran or extended deterrence to Europe show how US credibility can be undercut by domestic politics. In South Korea, Poland, and elsewhere, tenacious public support for nuclear proliferation and nuclear sharing have already begun to raise questions about these countries’ nuclear futures. Meanwhile, in Sweden and Finland, domestic debates between nuclear deterrence and disarmament played a role in these states’ recent accession to NATO.

Authoritarian states also factor domestic drivers into their nuclear decision-making. In China, the centralization of power under Xi Jinping has led to a nuclear policy increasingly shaped by internal political priorities, raising questions about future arms control prospects. In Russia, Vladimir Putin’s historical revisionism shows the importance of understanding the individuals with authority over nuclear arsenals—and the role of the bureaucracies that stand between them. Meanwhile, Kim Jong Un has revised North Korea’s nuclear doctrine to further protect against decapitation strikes and has officially rejected the idea of Korean unification. The essays in this collection each probe and shed light on the domestic determinants of the ongoing evolution in global nuclear order.

Informed by a conference hosted by the Phelan United States Centre at the London School of Economics and Political Science in June 2024, each essay in this collection examines the evolving nuclear security environment in one of six central loci: Europe, Latin America, the Middle East, South Asia, China, and the Korean Peninsula. The authors’ viewpoints are diverse, providing an expansive and inclusive look at global nuclear policy and exploring how different countries and regions are tackling major new developments in nuclear security. The result is a geographically expansive but cohesive review of the global nuclear order.

The essays also highlight important implications for policy. In particular, each essay offers insights into the complex political dynamics between the United States and various nuclear stakeholders—be they treaty allies, partners, or adversaries of the United States.

Collectively, the essays point to two major themes shaping nuclear policy today. First, domestic politics remains an understudied, but critical, driver of nuclear policy. For example, Do Young Lee demonstrates that—despite the initial success of the Washington Declaration—the South Korean public’s confidence in the credibility of US extended deterrence has declined, and attributes this decline to diverging US and South Korean interpretations of North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy. This divergence has generated major disagreements between Washington and Seoul about both the threat environment and the appropriate strategies to address it.In their discussion of the Middle East, Nicole Grajewski and Jane Darby Menton similarly point to the powerful role of Iranian domestic politics. The recent attacks on Iran’s nuclear program by Israel and the United States have dramatically heightened Tehran’s sense of vulnerability, reducing political barriers to nuclear proliferation that have previously served as valuable guardrails.

Domestic politics also lie at the heart of China’s ongoing vertical proliferation, as Nicola Leveringhaus demonstrates that strategic and internal political rationales combine to explain Xi Jinping’s nuclear decision-making. Centralization of decision-making in foreign and security policy issues has elevated the status of nuclear weapons and contracted the domestic community of nuclear strategists while also diminishing their influence on nuclear decision-making. This “more CCP-aligned, paranoid, younger, and strategically less informed Chinese expert community” may have adverse implications for arms control.

Domestic politics also affect coordination between allies and partners in the nuclear realm. Jacklyn Majnemer evaluates tensions between the United States and its allies over NATO’s nuclear future, arguing that effective deterrence requires satisfying the political concerns of nuclear sharing states. As the Trump administration’s talk and actions perpetuate a rift between the United States and its European allies, squaring US interests with the demands of European nuclear deterrence is likely to become more challenging.

A second theme that emerges from these essays is the way in which the globally interconnected nature of nuclear politics can lead to cascading effects on nuclear policy and strategy. Leveringhaus suggests that expanded security cooperation between Russia and China in the conventional realm could prompt a deepening nuclear relationship, better positioning Beijing to manage its diversifying strategic deterrent. She further argues that China’s nuclear buildup is driven by perceived vulnerability to quantitative improvements in the US arsenal, including ballistic missile defense and conventional counterforce capabilities. This situation raises important questions for policymakers on how their actions could either slow or accelerate an interactive cycle.

Many of the roundtable contributions point to second-order effects of US-China competition on the global nuclear landscape. Debak Das, for example, argues that US-China competition and the AUKUS deal have contributed to major new developments in India’s nuclear posture. In what he calls “a cascade effect of reactionary vertical proliferation,” US-China competition fuels a Chinese nuclear buildup that prompts efforts in India to shore up second-strike capabilities. This chain of events in turn exacerbates the India-Pakistan security dilemma, making recurring South Asian military crises more dangerous and more difficult for US policy to manage. Lee explains the complex effects of China’s nuclear buildup on both US and South Korean military policy. While Washington is increasingly prioritizing deterring China, Seoul remains wary of pushing away its biggest trade partner and fears becoming entrapped in a US-China conflict. J. Luis Rodriguez argues that Latin America reacts to competition between the United States, Russia, and China, noting in particular that the United States has viewed cooperation on nuclear energy and space technology between China and several Latin American countries as a potential security threat. Finally, Grajewski and Menton discuss how US-China competition affects the nuclear energy market—and shapes resulting proliferation risks—among multiple states in the Middle East, producing developments that can draw the US into regional conflicts. These essays emphasize the need for more scholarly and policy attention to the downstream effects of US-China nuclear competition on second-order dynamics that shape the nuclear environment in important ways.

Together, these essays identify significant challenges to the contemporary nuclear order. They present a two-level framework for understanding the domestic and international drivers of ongoing evolutions in nuclear security. Restoring balance to the nuclear order will require efforts on multiple fronts. First, to maintain strategic cohesion, the United States and its allies should be attentive not just to international considerations, but also to domestic political questions and perceptions at the heart of nuclear decision-making. Second, where possible, the United States may benefit from engaging domestic actors in adversarial systems to promote shared understandings of the global risks of nuclear proliferation and of more assertive nuclear postures. Third, these essays demonstrate that nuclear decisions cannot be made in bilateral or regional vacuums. Thinking about the global nuclear order as an interconnected whole and mapping out the downstream risks of decisions will enable policymakers in the US and elsewhere to better appreciate the cascades and feedback effects that might undermine their policies in the future.

2. Growing Divergence: North Korea’s Evolving Nuclear Strategy and the US–South Korea Alliance

Do Young Lee

In response to North Korea’s escalating nuclear and missile threats, the US and South Korea have taken measures to reinforce extended deterrence: the Washington Declaration, the Nuclear Consultative Group, and the enhanced visibility of US strategic assets around the Korean Peninsula. Despite these steps, South Korea’s public confidence in US extended deterrence commitments has declined. This article argues that this decline is rooted in growing divergence between US and South Korean interpretations of North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy and the appropriate responses to it.

On April 26, 2023, US President Joe Biden and South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol held a summit and adopted the Washington Declaration.1 The declaration was designed to reassure South Koreans that the US extended deterrence commitment to South Korea remains steadfast in the face of North Korea’s growing nuclear and missile threats. Washington adopted the declaration in the hope of curbing South Korean support for nuclear armament and encouraging Seoul to faithfully comply with the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. The declaration outlines specific measures, including the establishment of the Nuclear Consultative Group (NCG) and the regular deployment of US strategic assets—such as nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs)—to the Korean Peninsula. As part of the implementation of the Washington Declaration, the USS Kentucky made a historic port call to South Korea in July 2023, marking the first visit to South Korea in forty-two years by a US SSBN.2

Despite these measures, public opinion polls conducted by three South Korean research institutions following the Washington Declaration revealed results that deviated from US expectations.3 In 2024, South Korean respondents’ support in these polls for indigenous nuclear weapons stood at 72.8 percent,4 66.0 percent,5 and 70.9 percent,6 marking decreases of 3.8 percent, 5.8 percent, and 4.2 percent, respectively, from 2023. On average, 69.9 percent of South Koreans favored acquiring nuclear weapons, a 2.1 percent rise from the previous year. Although the Washington Declaration and the implementation of follow-up measures have been widely promoted, support for South Korean nuclear armament has continued to increase.7

Confidence in the US security guarantee appears to be related to these shifts in public opinion. One of the three polls showed that the percentage of South Koreans who believe Washington would use nuclear weapons to defend their country, even if North Korea could strike the US mainland, dropped from 51.3 percent in 2023 to 39.3 percent in 2024.8 In another time-series poll conducted since 2021, when respondents were asked to choose between hosting US troops and possessing their own nuclear weapons for national defense, more respondents selected the second option (possessing nuclear weapons) than the first option (hosting US troops) for the first time in 2024.9 This marked decline in public confidence occurred after the Washington Declaration was adopted.

What accounts for the recent decline in South Korean confidence in US extended deterrence? Addressing this question requires careful analysis of significant shifts in North Korea’s nuclear strategy and doctrine over the past few years. The increasing distrust from South Korean respondents stems from a widening gap between US views and South Korean views on North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy and appropriate countermeasures. Pyongyang appears to have recently made a significant shift in its nuclear strategy, aimed at countering the conventionally superior South Korean and US combined forces stationed on the Korean Peninsula.10 Consequently, North Korea is currently assessed to have adopted a more aggressive nuclear posture on the Korean Peninsula, one that envisions preemptive nuclear use far more actively than in the past.11 While Washington maintains that its existing extended deterrence commitment is sufficient, South Koreans posit that the US has not adapted to these changes, raising doubts about America’s resolve and capability to address the evolving North Korean threat.

Evolution in North Korea’s Nuclear Strategy

Under Vipin Narang’s famous classification of nuclear strategies (or nuclear postures), a catalytic strategy seeks to catalyze military or diplomatic intervention—typically from a third party—when the state’s vital interests are threatened by an external adversary.12 Applying this typology to North Korea, Narang explained that Pyongyang initially adopted a catalytic strategy.13 That is, North Korea aimed to employ its nuclear weapons to prompt intervention from its patron, China, or to induce Beijing to act as a crisis mediator during conflicts on the Korean Peninsula. Additionally, Narang predicted that if China were no longer perceived as a reliable patron, North Korea—facing the conventionally superior US–South Korea combined forces—would likely shift to an asymmetric escalation strategy.14 Indeed, over the past few years, North Korea’s nuclear strategy appears to have evolved into asymmetric escalation, incorporating its core characteristics.15

Asymmetric escalation is designed to deter conventional attacks by enabling a state to quickly escalate to the first use of nuclear weapons against the adversary.16 An asymmetric escalation posture has three key features: (1) the threat of first use of nuclear weapons; (2) explicit intention to employ nuclear weapons tactically against an adversary’s conventional forces and the delivery platforms to achieve this; and (3) pre-delegation of authority to military commanders for nuclear weapon use.17

North Korea’s stance on a “no first use” (NFU) policy has shifted significantly. Previously, Pyongyang consistently portrayed its nuclear forces as defensive. For example, the 2013 North Korea nuclear law describes its nuclear weapons as “just means for defense” to cope with the US’s increasingly hostile policy and nuclear threat.18 The nuclear law also states that the primary role of these weapons is to deter and repel enemy aggression and attacks on the state.19 Additionally, it clarifies that Pyongyang would neither use nor threaten to use nuclear weapons first against nonnuclear states like South Korea unless they participate with a hostile nuclear power like the US in acts of aggression and attack against North Korea.20 In September 2022, however, North Korea enacted a new law that significantly pivoted away from its original NFU-oriented stance. Under the section titled “Conditions of Using Nuclear Weapons,” the new law stipulated five circumstances under which nuclear weapons could be used: “1) in case an attack by nuclear weapons or other weapons of mass destruction was launched or drew near is judged, 2) in case a nuclear or non-nuclear attack by hostile forces on the state leadership and the command organization of the state’s nuclear forces was launched or drew near is judged, 3) in case a fatal military attack against important strategic objects of the state was launched or drew near is judged, 4) in case the need for operation for preventing the expansion and protraction of a war and taking the initiative in the war in contingency is inevitably raised, 5) in other case an inevitable situation in which it is compelled to correspond with catastrophic crisis to the existence of the state and safety of the people by only nuclear weapons is created.”21

Notably, the law allows North Korea to use nuclear weapons first if an external attack on the state “drew near is judged”—that is, is deemed imminent—or during wartime to prevent further escalation and secure victory. The circumstances it describes are so broad that they could allow Pyongyang to resort to preemptive nuclear attacks at virtually any time, based on arbitrary judgments that will not be transparent to external observers and actors trying to deter North Korea.22

Illustrating the second characteristic of an asymmetric escalation strategy, in 2021 Kim publicly acknowledged for the first time that North Korea was developing tactical nuclear weapons and declared that “producing smaller and lighter nuclear weapons for tactical uses” would be one of several key strategic goals in his country’s five-year military development plan (2021–25) for a nuclear weapons program.23 The following year, North Korea began efforts to operationalize tactical nuclear weapons for actual war-fighting missions. In September 2022, Kim ordered the expansion of the operational roles of tactical nuclear weapons and the acceleration of their deployment.24 In late December 2022, the North Korean leader directed that “[n]ow that the South Korean puppet forces who designated the DPRK as their ‘principal enemy’ and openly trumpet about ‘preparations for war’ have assumed our undoubted enemy, it highlights the importance and necessity of a mass-producing of tactical nuclear weapons and calls for an exponential increase of the country’s nuclear arsenal.”25 In 2023, Pyongyang unveiled its tactical nuclear warhead and a range of tactical nuclear platforms designed to target South Korea.26 Since 2022, North Korea has significantly increased the number of test-firings of short-range ballistic and cruise missiles that exclusively target South Korea.27 North Korea has clearly signaled its intention and ability to carry out aggressive tactical nuclear operations against South Korea, if necessary, using these short-range systems.28

The recent evolution of North Korea’s nuclear strategy also clearly reflects the third characteristic of an asymmetric escalation strategy. In recent years, Pyongyang transitioned from its original assertive nuclear command and control (NC2) system, wherein Kim held all centralized power, to a more delegative system. Specifically, North Korea’s 2013 nuclear law specified that the state’s nuclear weapons “can be used only by a final order of the Supreme Commander [Kim Jong Un].”29 In contrast, Pyongyang’s new delegative system seems to be intended to ensure nuclear retaliation against a surprise attack on the North Korean leadership. Notably, the 2022 law stipulates under the newly added section of “command and control of nuclear forces” that “the state nuclear forces command organization” shall assist the North Korean leader in “the whole course from decision concerning nuclear weapons to execution.”30 The section also stipulates that if Kim’s NC2 is incapacitated due to an enemy attack, “a nuclear strike shall be launched automatically and immediately . . . according to the operation plan decided in advance.”31 The core of this reform is to transfer pre-authorized control of the nuclear button to designated individuals.32

Pinpointing the origins of this evolution is beyond this study’s scope, but a few plausible explanations emerge. First, as Narang’s theory suggests, a weakening of North Korea’s trust in China as its security patron may be a contributing factor. The strained relationship between the two communist allies in recent years lends plausibility to this explanation.33 Second, South Korea’s domestic politics may have played a role. The conservative Yoon administration, which took office in May 2022, adopted a more hardline stance toward North Korea than its predecessor, the Moon Jae-in administration.34 Notably, Pyongyang enacted its 2022 nuclear law just four months after Yoon’s inauguration. Third, South Korea’s military modernization has significantly weakened the effectiveness of North Korean conventional artillery attacks, shifting the conventional balance of power in favor of the South.35 This shift may have prompted Pyongyang to adjust its nuclear strategy, utilizing its nuclear forces more actively for political and military purposes within the Korean theater. Fourth, lessons drawn from Russia’s threat of nuclear first use in the Ukraine war might have driven North Korea’s shift.36

The Growing Cacophony

North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy has created a rift between Seoul and Washington in their threat perceptions and their approaches to the evolving North Korean threat. Table 1 examines differences in South Korean and US perceptions of five issues. The allies agree on only two issues.

Note: The values in this summary table represent an overall average perspective that includes both public and elite perceptions from the two states. The terms “increased” and “not increased” use 2021 as a reference point, when North Korea’s nuclear strategy began to evolve in earnest.

South Korea

South Korean leaders and experts across the political spectrum have grown deeply concerned about Pyongyang’s nuclear evolution toward a more offensive and aggressive posture. In particular, they are highly sensitive to North Korea lowering the threshold for nuclear use in various scenarios, believing that the likelihood of North Korea’s nuclear use—ranging from peacetime to crisis and wartime—has significantly increased.37 In January 2024, President Yoon criticized Pyongyang, stating, “The North Korean regime is an irrational group that has legalized the preemptive use of nuclear weapons as the only country in the world to do so.”38 In December 2022, Wi Sung-lac (now the first National Security Advisor under the new Lee Jae Myung administration) assessed that North Korea was extremely escalating its threat to South Korea through test-firings of various types of nuclear missiles.39

South Koreans are concerned that as North Korea’s nuclear strategy grows more aggressive, Pyongyang may be more inclined to undertake military actions on the Korean Peninsula, such as localized provocations or even large-scale invasions. In other words, with North Korea now possessing a more offensive nuclear doctrine and a range of supporting tactical nuclear weapons, Pyongyang could become more emboldened to use military options. Former South Korean Vice Minister of National Defense Baek Seung-joo warned that North Korea, having gained confidence from the legalization of nuclear weapons, might be preparing for localized provocations similar to the shelling of Yeonpyeong Island in 2010.40 South Korean experts have also frequently examined a scenario in which North Korea rapidly occupies disputed islands in the Yellow Sea. These experts warn that North Korea could coerce South Korea into recognizing these already lost islands as a fait accompli, either by threatening a limited nuclear attack or launching an actual “escalate to de-escalate” nuclear attack.41

Moreover, influential South Koreans warn that North Korea’s new nuclear law could signal the prelude to full-scale war. In January 2024, Kim Jong Un ordered a constitutional revision to specify “the issue of completely occupying, subjugating and reclaiming South Korea and annexing it as a part of the territory of our republic in case a war breaks out on the Korean Peninsula.”42 In light of this development, a South Korean expert argued that the new nuclear law reflects a dangerous ambition of “forceful absorption and unification through nuclear means,” adding that “North Korea has never abandoned its goal of unification.”43 President Yoon stated, “North Korea has enacted a new nuclear law for first nuclear use to reunify [the Korean Peninsula] under communism.”44 Then-opposition party leader Lee Jae Myung stated a few days after North Korea’s new nuclear law was released: “I think this is a shocking and serious situation, because it appears North Korea has revealed its intention to use nuclear weapons not just for defense, but even for a preemptive attack.”45

Seoul believes that to effectively counter North Korea’s evolving threats, Washington must significantly enhance the specificity of its extended deterrence commitments to South Korea. For example, South Korea wants the US to more concretely outline in advance how it would respond to North Korean aggression under specific scenarios. The information requested by South Korea includes the specific types of nuclear assets to be deployed, the locations of these assets, and the operational processes to be employed.46 The rationale is this: Seoul believes that if the US were to explicitly and concretely detail its nuclear commitments and publicly announce their establishment—while keeping implementation details confidential—Pyongyang would be more likely to trust that US retaliatory actions would be carried out as specified, and would thus be deterred from launching nuclear or conventional attacks against South Korea. Stated differently, Seoul perceives American ambiguity as weakening the credibility and effectiveness of extended deterrence. Some South Korean experts contend that the US should formally codify that if North Korea launches a nuclear strike against South Korea, Washington will automatically intervene and immediately retaliate with nuclear strikes.47

The Yoon administration sought to address the lack of concreteness in US extended deterrence by enhancing the viability of US nuclear commitments and specifying implementation plans.48 Seoul’s efforts bore fruit with several tangible results, including the endorsement of the Washington Declaration, the establishment of the NCG, the convening of multiple subsequent NCG meetings, the advancement of the alliance’s conventional-nuclear integration (CNI) initiative, and the adoption of the US-ROK Guidelines for Nuclear Deterrence and Nuclear Operations.49 However, many South Korean elites and citizens remain dissatisfied and continue to demand groundbreaking measures, including the redeployment of nonstrategic nuclear weapons to South Korea, the introduction of a NATO-style nuclear sharing arrangement, and the addition of a “nuclear attack protection clause” to the US-ROK alliance treaty.50

Finally, Seoul believes that North Korea now poses a fundamentally different type of threat, and stresses the need to maintain the current strength and role of the United States Forces Korea (USFK) to deter it. Most South Koreans view the existing US military presence as the basic, minimum requirement for effective extended deterrence. Some argue that more American deterrent assets should be dedicated to South Korea’s defense, including the redeployment of tactical nuclear weapons to South Korea and the permanent or semipermanent stationing of US strategic assets on South Korean soil.51South Korean leaders also advocate limiting the USFK’s role to defending South Korea from North Korean incursions, fearing that expanding it beyond the Peninsula could undermine US extended deterrence. For example, when asked if South Korea would assist a US defense of Taiwan during a Chinese attack, President Yoon stated that such a scenario would likely provoke North Korea’s opportunism. He emphasized that the primary focus of the South Korea–US alliance should be maintaining a strong defense posture against North Korea.52 This stance reflects

South Korea’s long-standing view of North Korea as a more immediate threat than China. South Korea’s position that USFK should concentrate exclusively on deterring North Korea also reflects its concern that it could be drawn into unwanted military conflicts beyond the Peninsula. Specifically, apprehension is growing among South Korean experts that if USFK engages in a military confrontation with China in the Taiwan Strait, then South Korea might also be pulled into the conflict.53 Some might argue that the so-called division-of-labor approach—where South Korea takes the lead in deterring North Korea on the Peninsula while USFK reorients toward other regional contingencies—which the Trump administration is said to be pursuing, would shield South Korea from the risk of entrapment.54 South Korean experts reject this view, however, warning that US bases in South Korea would likely become targets of Chinese attacks, thereby drawing South Korea into an unwanted conflict.55

The United States

The US interprets North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy and its implications quite differently from South Korea—as shown in table 1, the two allies’ views align on only two out of five key aspects. Like Seoul, many in Washington have raised concerns that Pyongyang’s evolving strategy increases the likelihood of a nuclear first use, citing the country’s 2022 nuclear law.56 Moreover, North Korea’s continued advancement and diversification of its nuclear weapons are viewed as further exacerbating this risk. Narang, then-Acting Assistant Secretary of Defense for Space Policy, emphasized in a 2024 speech that North Korea’s ongoing nuclear developments are pushing it to recklessly threaten South Korea and increasingly the US.57

The US also acknowledges that North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy raises the potential for localized military provocations by Pyongyang. In other words, Washington agrees that Pyongyang’s evolution has heightened the likelihood that North Korea will use nuclear coercion to achieve economic, political, and even military objectives. The 2023 analysis by the Office of the Director of National Intelligence (ODNI) on North Korea, produced in January 2023 and declassified in June of the same year, serves as a key resource for understanding the US perspective. The document analyzes the potential purposes for which North Korea might use its nuclear arsenal through 2030.58 It assesses as “high” the likelihood that nuclear weapons could be used for coercive purposes and notes that Kim “may use limited military force to raise tensions as a means to press key foreign governments into adopting positions favorable to his objectives, confident that his growing nuclear capabilities will deter any unacceptable retaliation or consequences.”59 The 2025 ODNI annual report does not directly address how North Korea’s evolving nuclear strategy affects its behavior, but it does note that “Pyongyang is expanding its capacity for coercive operations and using new tactics as it becomes more confident in its nuclear deterrent,” highlighting the Kim regime’s growing assertiveness fueled by its advancing nuclear capabilities.60

The ODNI’s annual report and some American experts point to an increasing likelihood that North Korea could launch low-level attacks against South Korea, including shelling disputed islands in the Yellow Sea and resuming provocations along the Northern Limit Line. The experts view these potential local provocations as attempts to maximize the effectiveness of coercive threats for political or economic gains.61 Many in Washington, however, assess that coercive nuclear threats are highly unlikely to lead to a full-scale invasion undertaken to reunify the Korean Peninsula under communism.62 For example, the 2023 ODNI analysis mentioned above notes that North Korea’s nuclear use “to seize territory and achieve political dominance over the Peninsula . . . will be much less likely than the strategy of coercion.”63

Washington’s assessments of the situation have led to a position that differs from Seoul’s regarding the need for a significantly more explicit commitment to extended deterrence. Washington does acknowledge some need for greater specificity, which has led to the establishment of the NCG and efforts to push for a CNI initiative.64 While striving to enhance the specificity of its extended deterrence commitments, however, the US has also expressed opposition to additional measures sought by Seoul, such as the redeployment of nuclear weapons and the adoption of nuclear sharing arrangements.65 Fundamentally, Washington wants to maintain a degree of ambiguity, out of concern that overly explicit commitments could increase the risk of being drawn into a nuclear war.66 Such commitments could limit Washington’s flexibility to employ alternative options, such as massive conventional retaliation or a decapitation strike aimed at eliminating Kim Jong Un.67

Moreover, Washington believes that overly specific commitments would be counterproductive, emphasizing the value of calculated ambiguity.68 This stance rests on the belief that ambiguity forces adversaries to constantly guess about US red lines and retaliation methods, keeping nuclear response a possibility even in unlikely scenarios. This, in turn, promotes caution in adversarial decisions about whether to invade and thereby strengthens deterrence.69 Additionally, Washington believes that excessively specific and detailed nuclear commitments for numerous scenarios could undermine the credibility of extended deterrence. If North Korea concludes that a US deterrent nuclear threat in a particular scenario is exaggerated or a bluff, it might doubt the credibility of all other US nuclear commitments.70 Therefore, Washington prefers to avoid overly detailed or specific declaratory language in favor of ambiguous commitments.

Finally, Washington views the current size and military capabilities of the USFK as substantial and sufficient to deter North Korea. The Trump administration is reportedly even considering withdrawing about 4,500 troops from the 28,500-strong USFK,71 signaling that it wants Seoul to take on a greater role in countering North Korea.72 In this context, the US appears to regard permanent stationing of strategic deterrent assets or the redeployment of nuclear weapons to South Korea as politically unwise and militarily redundant.73 A former US official at the National Security Council, for example, argued that redeployment of these assets is unnecessary and would undermine extended deterrence. The official remarked that redeployment would be akin to announcing that “we will use nukes in Korea rather than engage our homeland. . . . We have to say our homeland is also threatened along with your homeland.”74

The Trump administration has signaled that it is considering shifting USFK’s focus from strictly deterring North Korea to also incorporating broader missions beyond the Korean Peninsula.75 In May 2024, Elbridge Colby, who was later appointed as Undersecretary of Defense for Policy, told South Korean media that the USFK’s role should shift toward countering China.76 Colby being named to the Pentagon’s number three post has raised concerns in Seoul that Washington will want a broader regional role for USFK than Seoul prefers—a divergence that could further weaken South Korea’s confidence in US extended deterrence.77

Conclusion

North Korea’s nuclear strategy has evolved; as conditions have changed, the US and South Korea have diverged in their interpretations of this change. This growing divergence explains the recent sharp decline in South Koreans’ confidence in US extended deterrence: South Koreans believe that the US is downplaying the significance of North Korea’s evolving nuclear capabilities and posture, and failing to take appropriate measures to address the new threats this development poses.

Pyongyang also appears to be exacerbating intra-alliance discord by selectively threatening Seoul with nuclear first use while refraining from doing so toward the continental US. Pyongyang’s announcement that it is no longer seeking reconciliation with South Korea and the deployment of various short-range nuclear and conventional platforms targeting the South seem calibrated to instill maximum fear in Seoul.78 How the US effectively responds to North Korea’s divergent threats will be pivotal in ensuring credible extended deterrence for Seoul.

Since the start of the second Trump administration, American policymakers have increasingly viewed North Korea’s nuclear threat to South Korea and its threat to the US homeland as distinct challenges. Washington has signaled that it may prioritize the “defense of the US homeland” while gradually shifting deterrence responsibilities on the Korean Peninsula to Seoul.79 This bifurcated approach would provide the US with greater strategic flexibility in the Indo-Pacific region, especially to counter China’s regional ambitions.

This approach, however, could encourage North Korean nuclear provocations or military adventurism, which could backfire if a crisis then requires deeper US involvement in military contingencies on the Korean Peninsula. It could also backfire if such a development, in turn, were to create strategic openings for China to move more assertively in the Taiwan Strait or the East China Sea, with negative consequences for stability elsewhere in the region. American policymakers, therefore, should move away from the belief that retasking USFK to focus on the Chinese threat must involve redeploying them outside the Korean Peninsula. Instead, American leaders should recognize that credible extended deterrence can be achieved on the Korean Peninsula and across the region by maintaining current USFK force levels or with minimal withdrawals.

South Korea can also serve as a strategic outpost for countering China’s regional dominance. This scenario is particularly important for addressing China’s growing maritime assertiveness in the Yellow Sea, which has become increasingly apparent in recent months.80 Indeed, concerns are mounting among both South Korean and American experts that China is seeking to transform the Yellow Sea into a “second South China Sea.” Beijing has recently installed large floating steel structures—claimed to be aquaculture cages—in the Provisional Measures Zone (PMZ) established between South Korea and China. These actions echo China’s previous pattern of converting what were originally weather-monitoring stations in the South China Sea into military installations.81

Therefore, a more appropriate approach would be to maintain the overall size of the USFK while restructuring its current Army-centric composition—centered around the Eighth Army—and gradually increasing the proportion of naval and air forces equipped with enhanced intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance (ISR) capabilities. This strategy would allow Washington to simultaneously pursue three objectives: (1) maintaining robust extended deterrence on the Korean Peninsula; (2) checking China’s pursuit of regional hegemony; and (3) reassuring Seoul of Washington’s unwavering commitment. Furthermore, by enabling USFK to assume multiple missions that counter both North Korea and China simultaneously, this approach would also contribute to the Trump administration’s purported pursuit of greater strategic flexibility for USFK.82

3. The Domestic Politics Behind China’s Strategic Force Improvements

Nicola Leveringhaus

China’s nuclear expansion is occurring at a time of major domestic political change, with implications for its nuclear weapons strategy. Domestic changes of note include defense reforms, a contraction and politicization of China’s strategic community, as well as sustained top-down interest in commemoration of China’s nuclear weapons past, such as the “Two Bombs, One Satellite” program. These domestic political changes represent an unprecedented elevation of the national, social, and political value of China’s nuclear weapons by the CCP in the Xi era. How should others in the region and beyond best respond to these changes? The article ends with some thoughts on foreign state engagement with China as Beijing expands and elevates the domestic importance of its nuclear arsenal.

China’s strategic force is undergoing vast and unprecedented levels of improvement. There is a compelling explanation for this: Chinese military modernization, which spans decades, now yields visible results, bolstering national strategic deterrence. Xi Jinping, the current Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leader, today commands the most powerful military since the People’s Republic of China was established in 1949.83 Chinese strategic capabilities have become more accurate, mobile, and diverse across the air, sea, land, space, and cyber domains than ever before. These strategic assets include an estimated 600 nuclear warheads; vast numbers of intermediate-range conventional missiles, including the DF-26, which has dual-use/ “hot swappable” warhead functions; an emerging operational nuclear mission for bombers; and since 2020, the world’s largest navy, which includes six Jin-class nuclear ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs).84

China’s strategic force improvements are happening in real time and constitute an unsettling new technological reality for the US and its allies and partners in the Indo-Pacific. Indeed, since 2024 the US frames China as part of a “multiple nuclear challenger problem,”85 an alteration to the “two-nuclear-peer” framing in 2023 that pitted China alongside Russia, with newer predictions that China might have at least 1,000 nuclear warheads by 2030 and 1,500 by 2035.86 Excellent scholarly literature explains recent changes in Chinese nuclear capabilities in relation to United States capabilities, specifically how US strategy might be unintentionally fueling China’s nuclear expansion, suggesting that a dangerous entangled security dilemma dynamic is emerging between the states.87 Yet much less literature discusses wider domestic political changes and how these shape Chinese nuclear thinking today.88

Evolving Chinese Strategic Capabilities

In the last five to six years, Chinese strategic forces have become much more mobile, precise, and diverse in their operationality in at least three areas.89 First, China now has sea-based nuclear deterrent capabilities, having deployed (since 2015) six Jin-class SSBNs with submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs) to the South China Sea. External estimates suggest that China seeks around ten SSBNs in total, with improved anti-detection capabilities (making the SSBNs quieter) as well as heightened readiness through a desired continuous-at-sea ability. This Chinese effort reflects a wider push among states in the Indo-Pacific to secure deterrence at sea: North Korea, India, and Pakistan are all developing—to varying degrees of success—SSBNs.

A second advancement relates to intermediate missiles like the DF-26, which are within range of Northeast Asia as well as India and Guam. The warheads on these missiles can be changed quickly from a conventional to a nuclear role, hence the “hot-swappable” element. While this element allows greater flexibility in response to an attack,90 analysts worry that it could confuse the enemy and lead to inadvertent escalation in a crisis.91

A third advancement relates to new missile silo bases for longer-range intercontinental ballistic missiles (ICBMs) like the DF-41. The three new Chinese silo bases were identified using commercial satellite imagery in 2021.92 These sites are situated in northern China, specifically Jilantai in Inner Mongolia, the northwestern city of Yumen, and Hami, near Yumen. Chinese officials continue to deny that these sites are silo bases, labeling them windmills instead. Silo bases are important to survivability because they harden and protect missiles from an incoming strike; if these silo fields were to be filled, they could in total house over 300 ICBMs, such as the DF-41, which could reach the continental US.

Today these technical developments give the CCP leadership more strategic options than ever before, including for doctrinal transformation should Beijing desire such change in the future. It remains unclear whether these new capabilities translate into a transformative shift away from assured retaliation and China’s declared “no first use” (NFU) pledge.93 It is therefore useful to look beyond technical changes to political indicators to interpret China’s changing approach to nuclear weapons.

Domestic Politics and Nuclear Weapons in China

Within the last decade, the Chinese leadership has centralized control over foreign and security policy initiatives and debates, with important effects on Chinese nuclear policy and strategy. First, the CCP has elevated the national social and political value of its nuclear weapons to an unprecedented degree, precisely at a time when China’s capabilities and options are expanding rapidly. Second, China’s domestic nuclear expert community has contracted, with fewer senior nuclear strategy experts debating and shaping nuclear policy and strategy in China.

The public elevation of nuclear weapons in China today is evident in CCP commemoration of its own strategic weapons history, which focuses on the Two Bombs, One Satellite program [两弹一星, liang dan yi xing] that resulted in three major scientific achievements: China’s atomic test in 1964, its hydrogen test in 1967, and a satellite launch in 1970.94 Another focus for commemoration is the Third Line / Front [三线, Sanxian], a massive industrial and civil defense project from the Mao era that moved strategic assets and defense industries away from vulnerable coastal and city areas inwards into mountainous and inaccessible areas to ensure survivability in the event of major war.95 China actively draws on both past events, invoking the “spirit” [精神, jing shen] of the Two Bombs, One Satellite and Third Line programs to incentivize ordinary Chinese citizens and scientists working in strategic sectors in China (from high-speed rail to space).

This commemoration comes at a time when Xi has also openly reinforced the present-day value of China’s strategic weapons with a stated aim in 2022 to build “a strong system of strategic deterrence.”96 Earlier closed-door speeches by Xi in 2012 and 2014 to China’s People’s Liberation Army Rocket Forces (PLARF, then named the Second Artillery) reportedly reinforce how important the force is to both China’s security as well as its national rejuvenation as a great power.97 Xi has also made clearer in public statements where the CCP sits in the nuclear decision-making process, reaffirming that the Party’s Central Military Commission (CMC) and Standing Politburo make the ultimate decision for any use (or threat of use) of strategic weapons, hence the party mantra that “the CMC leads, the theatre commands fight, and the services equip.”98

The anti-corruption campaign has also reinforced centralization. In 2023, under the banner of the anti-corruption campaign, former PLARF commander Li Yuchao and his deputies Liu Guangbin and Zhang Zhenzhong, as well as another former commander of the Rocket Force at the CCP National Congress, General Zhou Yaning, were removed from power. Corruption is broadly defined, from practical concerns over the purchase of substandard technology and faulty operation of weaponry like missiles, to fears around external leaks of information and disloyalty to the Party. The Party has also sought to increase control through political education campaigns within the PLA.99 These individual high-profile expulsions and political education campaigns speak to domestic efforts to centralize and purge strategic military bureaucracies from corruption and shore up a deeper sense of loyalty to the Party.100

Defense reforms also occurred in 2015 and 2024, expanding the operational mission mandate and force status of China’s nuclear deterrents, especially its missiles.101 The first of these reforms, in December 2015, elevated the status of China’s land-based strategic nuclear and conventional forces, renaming them as the PLARF. This change can be understood as part of a wider effort to elevate the public status of these forces in domestic politics and their role as important markers of great power. Indeed, from 2017 onwards, Xi Jinping started to talk much more openly about his ambition for China to possess a top-tier world-class military, in which possession of a credible strategic arsenal would be key.102 In the April 2024 reforms, China established four new “arms” (Aerospace Force, Cyberspace Force, Information Support Force, and Joint Logistics Support Force) to support the four services (PLA, PLAAF, PLAN, and PLARF).

Amid these reforms, Xi has spoken of an enlarged operational mission for the PLARF. Traditionally, the PLARF has been tasked to focus on retaliatory missions, namely counterattack (striking after the enemy has struck [后发制人, houfa zhiren]). Yet recent reporting in China suggests that new declared roles have been recently added to the PLARF beyond counterattack, including “counter-balancing” and “winning wars.”103 Strategic counterbalancing seems to reflect a geopolitical rather than technically driven assessment in Beijing that, in an increasingly hostile and difficult external security environment, more weapons would have a stabilizing effect between China and its main competitors.104 Less is known from open-source information about whether “winning wars” includes using nuclear missions as opposed to other nonnuclear strategic assets in the cyber/space/advanced conventional domain to achieve this goal.105 The talk of “winning wars” may be an attempt to talk up emerging capabilities and keep the PLA incentivized in the coming decades of military modernization, or it may simply be a signal attempting to intimidate the United States.

Collectively, these domestic political changes represent an unprecedented elevation of the national, social, and political value of China’s nuclear weapons by the CCP in the Xi era. By CCP design, the past, present, and future of China’s nuclear arsenal matters more domestically and politically than ever before.

The second domestic political change relates to a shrinking of the nuclear expert community, including established and more senior Chinese arms control experts, since 2012.106 This community includes national weapons engineers, physicists, think tank analysts, and academics in fields such as international relations. Under former leaders Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, these actors contributed to national debates around China’s nuclear strategy and posture, and conducted exchanges with foreign counterparts through dialogues and knowledge exchange. This expert community facilitated China’s signature to the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty in 1996, and many were participants in dialogues with the United States, such as the discontinued Lab-to-Lab dialogue of the 1990s, or bilateral Track 1.5 dialogues run by the Pacific Forum.107 Yet the influence of these Chinese actors has seemingly waned in the Xi Jinping era.108 Several Chinese domestic experts, for example, did not anticipate examples of Chinese expansion, such as the construction of the silo bases identified through open-source commercial satellite imagery in 2021.109 As China’s military builds up, the level of informed insight that can be offered by this community of outward-facing experts—particularly of mid- to senior-level experts—seems to be shrinking.

This contraction can be attributed in part to practical factors, such as constrained mobility during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and the reality that some of China’s senior nuclear experts are now reaching retirement age.110 The contraction also reflects broader restructuring of the domestic expert landscape in the Xi era and reorganization of disciplines within Chinese academic institutions. For example, the rise of party committees in universities has increased, as have changes to the study of international relations within one of the top-tier universities based in Beijing, Tsinghua University, where, for example, the study of national security is separate from area studies.111

The domestic environment in which Chinese nuclear strategy is debated has become more centralized and politicized. The effects of these changes are as yet unknown. The near-term outcome of this contraction could be a more CCP-aligned, paranoid, younger, and strategically less informed Chinese expert community capable of engaging on nuclear issues with outsiders. As higher education has come under tighter political control, newer scholars may face greater domestic political scrutiny over what they say and write, limiting the potential for candid conversation in dialogue with foreign counterparts. Although we should not assume that this will make Beijing uninterested in arms control, or that a younger, more politically focused expert community will support larger forces and changed nuclear doctrine, the environment today prioritizes—to an unprecedented level—CCP preferences. More effort might be required to build shared understanding of nuclear strategy between Chinese experts and foreign counterparts. And it may be that a more centralized emerging nuclear community will narrow space for debate on force development, deployment, and use, or will reduce interaction between informed Chinese participants and outside actors on risk reduction and crisis management. Perhaps because the opportunities will be narrower as policy evolves, continued engagement is likely to be increasingly important.

Interaction Between China and the United States

China has become increasingly clear in outlining how specific US technologies affect its own strategic choices. Even decades ago, in the late 1990s, high-profile Chinese figures like former ambassador Sha Zukang never minced his words in calling out what he considered the damaging effect of US ballistic missile defense in Asia on China’s small nuclear arsenal.112 Chinese fears about the US deepening its commitment to missile defense continued into the 2000s following US abrogation of the Anti-Ballistic Missile (ABM) Treaty in 2003. More recently, in the 2010s and 2020s, these concerns have sharpened—still centered around damage limitation capabilities (missile defense), but with additional interest in conventional counterforce strikes in US nuclear strategy, evident in the 2018 and 2022 US nuclear posture reviews (NPRs)113 as well as the US decision to withdraw from the Intermediate Nuclear Forces (INF) Treaty in 2019. The US decision around INF especially was seen in Beijing as a deliberate effort by the US to increase its conventional counterforce capabilities in the Northeast Asian region to counter Chinese theater-level missiles in the region.114 Work in 2024 by Li Bin and Wu Riqiang argues that three specific sets of technology undermine China’s nuclear deterrent: the high kill probability of US missile defense interceptors in coordination with US allies in the region; US anti-submarine warfare limiting China’s emerging SSBN capability; and a US space-based system (Ground Moving Target Indicator) to track Chinese mobile missiles.115

Yet China’s nuclear deterrent has only recently ballooned to deal with the external concerns and challenges above. Why did China take so long? Here domestic political considerations, combined with lessons from other nuclear powers, might offer some insight. As noted earlier, since 2012 nuclear weapons have assumed greater political and social value and prestige, especially when attached, as they are by Xi, to China’s wider road to revival and national rejuvenation as a great power. China might also be looking to the experiences of other nuclear weapons states in managing their relations with the US. This includes Russia as well as other nuclear weapons states like India and North Korea. Yet how lessons drawn from nuclear decision-making in Russia, India, and North Korea might have shaped—actively or inadvertently—contemporary Chinese strategic decisions remains poorly understood.

Challenges and Responses from the US and Wider Region

US and regional responses to evolving Chinese nuclear strategy have so far focused largely on technological advancements rather than domestic politics. This approach has led to calls for US nuclear strategy to go beyond counterforce (military locations) targeting to include countervalue (population centers) targets in China as well.116 Other experts recommend a buildup in US nuclear forces once the United States is no longer bound by the New START Treaty (likely from February 2026), as well as increased regional nuclear commitments to allies and a return to controversial capabilities featured in the 2018 NPRs such as the sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM-N).117 Others have called for the US to adopt a sole-purpose nuclear doctrine (but not NFU) as part of a transition to an active denial strategy, one that would also require allies to do more in terms of conventional deterrence.118 It is unclear whether attempts by the US State Department in the Biden era to discuss NFU with China will continue in the second Trump administration. The 2024 speech by Vipin Narang, then–acting US secretary of defense for space policy, makes clear that the United States will continue to seek dialogue and forms of risk reduction.119 All of these recommendations and approaches will likely have implications for long-standing discussions over mutual vulnerability—something long desired in Beijing, but something about which Washington has so far resisted official declarations.120 In the immediate term, US partners and allies in Asia appear concerned that as China’s nuclear arsenal expands, Beijing will increasingly become more confident in its ability to deter the United States’ use of nuclear weapons.121 For Taiwan, this confidence might lead China to initiate conventional conflict, without fear of escalation to nuclear use from the US.122 Outside the region, US commitments to the security of NATO because of the ongoing Russian war against Ukraine have filtered into the Asian regional security context, with Asian allies concerned about the ability and political will of the US to operate in multiple theaters simultaneously.

These fears reinvigorate preexisting domestic debates around nuclear weapons proliferation for some, as well as new deployment options in an extended deterrence for others. In South Korea, extended deterrence was reaffirmed in April 2023 through the Washington Declaration between the US and South Korea, but debates over the reliability of that commitment remain.123 In Japan, China’s growing military capabilities and assertiveness have contributed to closer cooperation with the US over missile defense, continued consultation through the US-Japan Extended Deterrence Dialogue, and internal debates about nuclear sharing and conventional precision-strike options.124

Wider multilateral US partner and allied responses to changes in Chinese strategic power have started to take shape. For example, AUKUS has catalyzed closer scientific, legal, political, and military discussions among Australia, the UK, and the US, a significant shift regardless of whether the arrangement delivers specific outputs on the timetable announced. Extending new partnerships into AUKUS Pillar II (emerging technologies), perhaps incorporating Japan and South Korea, could have a compounding effect in terms of scientific cooperation.125 Put bluntly, China cannot re-create these multi-state global arrangements in strategic technology.

Conclusion

China’s nuclear expansion is occurring at a time of major domestic political change, with implications for Chinese nuclear strategy. These developments prompt a rethinking for foreign governments as to how best to engage with China in the nuclear domain.

Above all, foreign discussions with China on nuclear strategy will likely be shaped by and tethered to the ideological party and political preferences and the worldview of Xi Jinping to a higher degree than before. Indeed, strategic concepts are being contested already, such as preferences in China and Russia for the term “political stability” over “strategic stability.”126 Engagements around arms control should therefore factor in not just technical assessments and awareness of Xi Jinping’s own statements on nuclear matters—as they likely do already—but also potential domestic political costs and pressures for Chinese counterparts. However, opportunities for engagement also exist, such as upgrading the P5 (Permanent Five of the UN Security Council) nuclear glossary of terms and expanding discussion in a P5-wide context around pre-missile launch notification built on actions China has taken unilaterally recently, as well as with Russia.

A domestic political lens for understanding the evolution of China’s nuclear arsenal also highlights that there may be utility in appealing to arguments around concepts like mutual vulnerability and NFU because they have strong political, rather than simply military, value for China. Yet these concepts will need to be discussed carefully, busting historical myths where necessary. For example, the historical scholarly record now shows that during the Cold War US-Soviet strategic stability—as it was then conceived—was not straightforward, not least because Soviets did not feel mutual vulnerability was enough.127 Bringing in examples from American or European historical experiences may be less sensitive and could help reduce overconfidence around the strategic value of mutual vulnerability.

As demonstrated in this article, current-day emphasis in China on historical commemoration showcases how politically valuable China’s strategic capabilities have become, and exclusively technical assessments of the balance of forces or nuclear posture miss these dimensions. Domestic political changes also matter for gauging which geopolitical arguments and by whom matter to China, especially beyond the US-China lens. As China enters a new era with respect to its nuclear forces, it is important to consider not just technologies and capabilities, but the wider domestic changes afoot.

4. Cascades of Competition: Southern Asia, the Indo-Pacific, and AUKUS

Debak Das

Nuclear stability in Southern Asia is being shaped by different layers of competition in the Indo-Pacific. This article highlights two dynamics that are shaping nuclear competition in the region. The first, within Southern Asia, is states finding space to escalate at lower levels of conflict to address nuclear and military asymmetry. Pakistan is seeking to create space to escalate at lower levels of conflict against India, while India is doing the same against Pakistan on one side and China on the other. The second dynamic is a cascade of reactionary vertical proliferation that is occurring in the Indo-Pacific as a result of China and the United States’ strategic competition. While Washington and Beijing are responding to each other’s nuclear arsenals, India is responding to China’s arsenal, and Pakistan is responding to India’s nuclear modernization. The technology transfers and submarine proliferation in the Indo-Pacific precipitated by AUKUS are intensifying this dynamic.

Nuclear security in Southern Asia is at a crossroads. The two nuclear dyads in the region—India and Pakistan, and China and India—are on different trajectories. While the nuclear arms race between India and Pakistan has maintained the status quo despite occasional crises between the states, the competition between India and China has led to new doctrinal and structural changes in New Delhi’s nuclear and conventional force postures. This shift is informed by two elements. The first is that the rise of China as a revisionist threat in the Indo-Pacific has precipitated the convergence of different multilateral constellations of states—aimed at checking Beijing—that include India. And second, and more importantly, China’s recent territorial threat to India along the 4,057-kilometer-long disputed Line of Actual Control (LAC) has led to significant changes in India’s conventional and nuclear forces.

There are two dynamics within the region that pose the biggest nuclear challenges to South Asia and the Indo-Pacific. The first, within Southern Asia, is the dynamic of states finding space to escalate at lower levels of conflict to address nuclear and military asymmetry. Pakistan is seeking to create space to escalate at lower levels of conflict against India, while India is doing the same against Pakistan on one side and China on the other. The second dynamic is a cascade effect of reactionary vertical proliferation that is occurring in the Indo-Pacific region. This second effect is a result of China and the United States’ strategic competition leading to nuclear modernization and vertical proliferation. The United States is reacting to China’s nuclear modernization, while China is increasing its nuclear forces to remain competitive with Washington. Meanwhile, the qualitative and quantitative increase in Chinese nuclear forces has led to an Indian response to shore up its second-strike capability and maintain a minimum deterrent against Beijing. Furthermore, Pakistan is, in turn, responding to India’s force modernization by strengthening its own nuclear forces and creating new spaces of asymmetric escalation against India to ensure that New Delhi’s modernization does not leave Pakistan at a strategic disadvantage. Nuclear submarine and other advanced military technology transfer arrangements between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (under the AUKUS agreement) have only added to this dynamic, with increased insecurity and uncertainty in the Indo-Pacific.

Creating New Spaces of Escalation: Doctrines and New Rocket Forces

Nuclear modernization in the India-Pakistan dyad has seen both sides seek to match the other at every level of the ladder of escalation. Pakistan’s nuclear forces have about 170 nuclear warheads; air- and ground-launched cruise missiles; and a host of short-, medium-, and long-range ballistic missiles.128 Its doctrine of “full-spectrum deterrence” accounts for the first use of short-range battlefield nuclear weapons—like the Hatf IX Nasr—against India’s conventional forces in a limited battlefield scenario. For Pakistan, this doctrine has been aimed at addressing its conventional military asymmetry with India.

Pakistan’s doctrine of full-spectrum deterrence seeks to ward off the possibility of conventional war with India. As Gen. Khalid Kidwai, one of the architects of the doctrine, stated: “Nasr, specifically, was born out of a compulsion of . . . some people on the other side toying with the idea of finding space for a conventional war, despite Pakistan’s nuclear weapons.”129 Specifically, this doctrine has targeted India’s ability to conduct conventional operations against Pakistan in response to lower-level—especially sub-conventional—escalation. Recent statements by Pakistani officials (including Gen. Kidwai) have led to concerns that Islamabad has now reduced the minimum range of its nuclear weapons to zero meters.130 This means that beyond tactical nuclear weapons, Islamabad’s nuclear arsenal might now include sub-kiloton nuclear projectiles like the Cold War–era Davy Crockett recoilless guns, or nuclear land mines that could either be detonated in place or travel very short distances.131

India has sought to match Islamabad with conventional and dual-use weapons at lower levels of escalation. New Delhi’s steady development of counterforce weapons systems—which are responsive, accurate, and shorter-range—has led scholars to believe that India’s “no first use” (NFU) doctrine may no longer apply to a conflict with Pakistan.132 This belief stems from the perspective that counterforce weapon systems tend to be associated with first-use nuclear doctrines. India might be tempted to move toward a counterforce nuclear doctrine that could match Pakistan’s potential use of battlefield nuclear weapons against conventional Indian forces. Such a strategy would aim to check Pakistan’s ability to use tactical nuclear weapons, thereby creating a space for conventional Indian responses to sub-conventional attacks from Pakistan. During the 2019 India-Pakistan crisis, for example, India responded to a terror attack on its territory at Pulwama with a conventional air attack on Balakot in Pakistan. Speaking about the potential threat of Pakistani nuclear escalation in response to India’s strike, Prime Minister Narendra Modi asked, “What do we have then? Have we kept our nuclear bombs for Diwali (the festival of lights)?”133

In May 2025, when India and Pakistan fought a near-war conflict for four days, it became clear that both sides believe that they have carved out space under the nuclear umbrella to conduct conventional operations against each other. India now considers its new doctrine to be one of assured conventional response against sub-conventional terror attacks on its territory. After the conflict ended, Prime Minister Modi stated that New Delhi would not “tolerate any nuclear blackmail,” affirming that sub-nuclear conventional operations against Pakistan might be the new normal.134

India is increasingly demonstrating that it has two different strategies for its two nuclear competitors, and New Delhi’s nuclear strategy toward China has been considerably different. This is not surprising given that in this nuclear dyad, India is at the weaker end of conventional military asymmetry. Recent border skirmishes between the two states along the LAC in the Himalayas have led to territorial and military losses for India. Since the violent clashes in the Galwan Valley in June 2020, New Delhi has lost at least twenty army troops in combat against the Chinese People’s Liberation Army (PLA) forces, and has lost access to twenty-six of sixty-five patrolling points in Eastern Ladakh.135

Sino-Indian skirmishes along the LAC have continued intermittently since 2020, with the last major one in December 2022.136 Despite India’s military reinforcements at the LAC—with 50,000 additional troops deployed at the border since 2020—and plans to raise a new mountain division aimed at China, skirmishes continue to take place.137

To tackle the conventional military asymmetry against China, India is raising a new Integrated Rocket Force (IRF) aimed at creating space for conventional escalation against China.138 The IRF will be a conventional missile force with short- and long-range cruise and ballistic missiles, and India’s newly developed Pralay short-range (150–500km) ballistic missile is expected to be the mainstay of this force.139 Using a rocket force dedicated to conventional military action will likely allow India space to militarily engage the PLA along the LAC without escalation to the nuclear level. This room for conventional escalation has become increasingly important given China’s building of critical military infrastructure along the LAC, including a motorable bridge over the Pangong Tso Lake, underground bunkers, and hardened shelters for armored vehicles.140 Opening this space for conventional action by India will be central to its ability to deter and counter greater Chinese military action.

Key to this strategy is that both India and China have stated NFU policies. These policies have led to an expectation that any Sino-Indian confrontation at the conventional level would remain nonnuclear—assuming both sides conform to their stated nuclear doctrines. Scholars now doubt, however, whether either India or China would conform to their NFU pledges in time of war or crisis.141 India’s development of nuclear delivery capability suggests a hedging strategy that is aimed at maintaining strategic stability, continuing its overt commitment to its NFU pledge, and increasing its options to strike China if and when necessary.

India’s recent nuclear modernization has increased its ability to target China’s mainland; its Agni-V intermediate-range ballistic missile (IRBM) has a stated range of 5,000 kilometers.142 In March 2024, New Delhi successfully tested MIRV (multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles) technology on an Agni-V missile. This technology is aimed at bolstering India’s second-strike capability, and intended to hold Chinese cities at risk with an increased ability to penetrate Beijing’s missile defenses.143 India’s developing MIRV capability is designed, therefore, to establish a secure mutual nuclear vulnerability with China. This approach will help its IRF operate at the conventional military level—an expected solidification of strategic stability that will thus create space for conventional crisis escalation.144

Proliferation Cascade: From the Indo-Pacific to Southern Asia

The United States’ focus on competition with China in the Indo-Pacific has directly impacted nuclear stability in South Asia. While scholars previously suggested that a “strategic chain” connects Pakistan, India, China, and the United States, the relationship between these states today reflects more of a cascade of reactionary vertical proliferation.145 This dynamic is distinct from the Cold War–era nuclear arms race between the United States and the Soviet Union, and is closer to a system of “spillover effects” from the nuclear modernization of one state to another.146 Indeed, it not clear that any of these states is aiming to attain nuclear superiority over the other. Rather, each is attempting to mitigate nuclear asymmetry and keep up with the force modernization of its adversaries.

This cascade has, at its start, the United States, which is currently modernizing its nuclear arsenal to address the two-peer nuclear threat posed by Russia and China.147 Next, China is increasing its nuclear forces and building new intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) silos and nuclear submarines, seeking to address its nuclear asymmetry with the United States. Meanwhile, India’s increasingly hostile relationship with China has led it to focus its nuclear modernization efforts to address its increasing asymmetry with Beijing’s nuclear forces. Finally, India’s qualitative and quantitative improvements to its nuclear forces are increasing perceptions of nuclear asymmetry with Pakistan, leading to Pakistan’s nuclear force modernization and diversification in response.

In 2024, the United States announced that it has a stockpile of 3,748 nuclear warheads.148 Additionally, the US is conducting a wide-ranging nuclear modernization program that includes new warhead designs and weapon types.149 Competing with China is emerging as a critical pillar of the United States’ nuclear strategy. More than 60 percent of the United States’ ballistic missile submarine patrols occur in the Pacific and are aimed against China and North Korea.150 Furthermore, the United States’ 2023 bipartisan Strategic Posture Commission recommended that Washington increase the size and scope of its nuclear arsenal to “address the possibility that China will field large-scale, counterforce-capable missile forces that pose a threat to US strategic nuclear forces on par with the threat Russia poses to those forces today.”151

Suggestions of an expanded US strategic and tactical nuclear arsenal, along with wide-ranging advancements in missile-defense capability, have had an effect on China, which has responded to the United States’ strategic posture by significantly expanding its own nuclear forces.152 A recent report shows that Beijing is in the process of building about 350 new ballistic missile silos alongside numerous new strategic nuclear delivery systems.153 The total number of Chinese missile brigades has also increased. Beijing’s expanding silo-based ICBM force will increase its second-strike retaliatory capability, and China is expected to possess around 1,000 warheads by 2030.154 Additionally, China is developing more advanced nuclear-powered ballistic missile submarines (SSBNs), submarine-launched ballistic missiles (SLBMs), and road- and rail-mobile ICBM systems, and has already deployed MIRVs on its ballistic missiles.155 According to military and diplomatic officials in Washington, this expansion of Chinese nuclear and missile arsenals might be with a view toward seeking qualitative and quantitative parity with the United States.156 From Beijing’s perspective, these developments are a result of the United States’ overt characterization of its relationship with China as one of “competition.”157 For the immediate future, as China aims to keep up in its competition with the United States, it is likely to continue with its nuclear force modernization and expansion.

China’s nuclear and missile advancements have led to response from India. New Delhi’s nuclear force development has been aimed toward addressing its asymmetry with China.158 With most of its deployed nuclear force already able to target all of Pakistan, India’s next generation of nuclear force development is aimed at mitigating the threat from Beijing. Its Agni family of land-based IRBMs—soon to be armed with MIRV-ed and MaRV (maneuverable reentry vehicle) warheads—is aimed at targeting different parts of China. While there has been no official confirmation on the next version of the missile, Agni VI, this version is expected to have a range of between 9,000 and 12,000 kilometers, with a three-ton nuclear payload.159 Beyond the Chinese mainland, this missile will aim to give India the capacity to strike Chinese targets—aircraft carriers and SSBNs—in the central Pacific Ocean and the southern Indian Ocean.160

In addition to increasing the capabilities of its land-based ballistic missiles, India is also increasing its sea-based nuclear capability, with the aim of having a more secure and dispersed second-strike capability against China and building up a greater naval footprint in the Indo-Pacific. In August 2024, the second SSBN of New Delhi’s nuclear triad, the INS Arighaat, was commissioned, substantially increasing India’s nuclear strike capacity.161 Along with India’s first SSBN—the INS Arihant—the Arighaat now forms a strategic naval force that will likely conduct regular deterrence patrols in the Indo-Pacific. India is building three more SSBNs that will be larger than the first two.162 Currently, India’s two SSBNs are armed with the K-15 Sagarika SLBMs, which have a range of 750 kilometers, a short range that severely limits India’s ability to strike China from the sea. To address this problem, India’s next two SSBNs will be armed with the K-4 SLBMs, with a striking range of 3,500 kilometers, and the yet-unnamed fifth SSBN is expected to carry the 5,000-kilometer-range K-5 SLBM.163

Finally, India’s nuclear force modernization and expansion of its nuclear forces has led to vertical proliferation in Pakistan. Pakistan is developing new delivery vehicles with the goal of seeking parity with India on the nuclear front, and its fissile materials and weapons arsenal are expected to continue growing.164 Its development of diverse delivery systems seeks to ensure that if India does abandon the NFU vis-à-vis Pakistan, it will not be able to conduct a “splendid” first strike (that is, a strike in which all of Pakistan’s nuclear weapons are attacked, thus nullifying Islamabad’s ability to strike back). Pakistan’s building of road-mobile transporter erector launchers (TELs) and sea-launched cruise and ballistic missiles is aimed at dispersing its nuclear force to counter any such possibility.165

Additionally, in keeping with the dynamic of creating space for low-scale nuclear escalation to deter conventional attacks as a part of its full-spectrum deterrence strategy, Pakistan has developed ground-, air-, and sea-launched nuclear-capable short-range cruise missiles.166 Islamabad has also deployed tactical nuclear weapons (TNWs) in the form of the 60-kilometer-range Hatf IX Nasr ballistic missile. Pakistan’s TNWs have been developed to counter India’s “Cold Start” doctrine, which aimed to conduct proactive conventional military operations on Pakistani territory in response to sub-conventional attacks on Indian territory.167 Through both its nuclear doctrine and its development of advanced nuclear-delivery systems, Pakistan has sought to ensure that it is able to compete with India’s nuclear abilities, even if those capabilities may now be driven primarily by China’s actions.

This cascade of proliferation results directly from the United States’ competition with China. The more Washington centers the Indo-Pacific in its nuclear strategy, the more downstream effects there will likely be on other nuclear states, whether they are either directly in competition with the United States or with a rival that is also impacted by US nuclear strategy.

AUKUS and the Nuclearization of the Indo-Pacific

The United States has significant direct and indirect effects on the proliferation of nuclear and missile systems across the Indo-Pacific. Its AUKUS deal with the United Kingdom and Australia will give Canberra conventionally armed nuclear-powered attack submarines (SSNs) in service of a “free and open” Indo-Pacific. While Pillar One of AUKUS deals with nuclear submarines, Pillar Two provides for the United States to share key technology (related to hypersonic missiles, electronic warfare, artificial intelligence, and advanced cyber capabilities) with its allies.168 This technology sharing, motivated by strategic competition with China, may lead to several downstream effects that are likely to intensify the risks of naval competition and proliferation in the Indo-Pacific and Southern Asia.

Consistent with the cascade dynamic, China will feel pressure to respond to AUKUS. Its Foreign Ministry has described the deal as a “wrong and dangerous path” that will “only motivate an arms race, damage the international nuclear nonproliferation regime, and harm regional stability and peace.”169 Of course, the AUKUS deal by itself will not lead to these outcomes. But China’s response to AUKUS likely will. Beijing’s new SSBNs—especially the Type 096—have made considerable qualitative technical advancements that make them a formidable change in the Indo-Pacific.170 A proliferation of United States, United Kingdom, and Australian SSNs because of AUKUS in the Indo-Pacific might put China’s six-boat SSBN force—and its second-strike capability—at risk. This dynamic could lead to a considerable increase in the number of Chinese SSNs and SSBNs developed over the next few years—a development that would, in turn, likely impact India’s projected SSBN and SSN force.

India’s commitment to the Indo-Pacific primarily focuses on its side of the western Indian Ocean and South Asia. However, it has a long-standing commitment to keeping the sea lines of communication free and open from the Gulf of Aden to the Straits of Malacca. Increased militarization of the Indo-Pacific via proliferation of nuclear submarines and other naval deployments by China—even if simply a response to AUKUS—will prompt India to develop its own naval capacity, and particularly, to consider an increase in its nuclear submarine force, specifically SSNs. Currently, India builds its own SSBNs but has leased out Akula-class SSNs from Russia intermittently since 1987. India plans on inducting one such leased SSN into its fleet by 2028 and is reportedly considering leasing a second submarine from Moscow as well.171 In addition, in 2024, India announced that it has started a program to build its own indigenous SSNs. The first of these submarines is expected to be deployed by 2037 and will, crucially, lead to increased Indian independence in the field of naval force projection.172

Once all five of India’s planned Arihant-class SSBNs are deployed and India moves toward a continuous-at-sea deterrence posture—as other navies with a similar force structure have—there will be a broader question of how this force operates and interacts with China’s nuclear submarines and forces in a nuclear-crowded Indo-Pacific. Will the QUAD grouping (which includes India, Japan, Australia, and United States) coordinate their naval strategies and SSN deployments in the Indo-Pacific? How will the United States and its allies view India’s use of leased-out Russian Akula submarines in the region?

Finally, an increased Indian naval force with nuclear submarines—both SSNs and SSBNs—is likely to threaten Pakistan’s access to and freedom of navigation in the Arabian Sea and Indian Ocean. Islamabad has been developing the sea-leg of its nuclear forces and has developed a nuclear-capable Babur sea-launched cruise missile (SLCM) with a range of 450 kilometers to be deployed on its diesel-powered Agosta 90B submarines.173 An increase in India’s submarine forces may prompt Pakistan to consider increasing its naval forces as well. Importantly, the AUKUS deal has set a precedent for China to lease or sell nuclear-powered attack submarines to Pakistan if both states decide to pursue that path. Given Beijing and Islamabad’s long history of nuclear and missile cooperation—and common interest in checking India—this scenario could become more likely.

The United States needs to consider the downstream consequences of its Indo-Pacific nuclear strategy. Introducing more nuclear-powered submarines through other states and potentially deploying nuclear-armed cruise missiles on its own SSNs to enhance its ability to use tactical nuclear weapons in the Indo-Pacific will generate responses from its immediate nuclear competitors, whose responses will have their own effects on others.174 This scenario might continue—and exacerbate—proliferation and modernization cascades across the Indo-Pacific region.

Conclusion

Analysts suggest that the Indo-Pacific is “at the cusp of a new missile age, driven by perceptions of rising insecurity.”175 If this is true, then the dynamics leading to this insecurity must be understood. There are three main drivers of proliferation and insecurity in South Asia and the Indo-Pacific: the dynamic of creating spaces of escalation under the shadow of nuclear weapons; proliferation cascades resulting from great power competition; and the risk of naval buildup precipitated by AUKUS.176 Each of these drivers share underlying elements—reaction-driven vertical proliferation and modernization of nuclear weapons and their delivery systems—that amplify regional insecurity and must be addressed.

Thus far, competition has been the driving force behind United States–China tensions, intensifying the security dilemma between both states.177 This dynamic is now generating spillover effects in other regions, like South Asia. From the United States’ perspective, then, deemphasizing the nuclear aspect of its competition with China in the Indo-Pacific could have a stabilizing effect on the unfolding regional cascade of proliferation.

Central to nuclear delivery-system proliferation and modernization is the question of nuclear posture. The expansion of nuclear delivery systems in both China and India—with varying ranges, payloads, and accuracies—suggests that these states are reducing the threshold for the potential use of nuclear weapons and might each be tempted to abandon their NFU policies in the future.178 Scholars have suggested that NFU policies might not hold much weight anyway—that is, they are “cheap talk” when it comes to a war or nuclear crisis.179 So far, however, both China’s and India’s NFU policies have had greater weight because they are coupled with nuclear postures characterized by a lack of numerical and qualitative capacity to strike their adversaries first. These capacities are now changing, such that both China and India might possess first-strike capability soon. This development may tempt both states to abandon their NFU policies. If more first use-oriented weapon systems are introduced in the Indo-Pacific, rather than states simply shoring up their second-strike capabilities, we might see more of a Cold War–type arms race dynamic among the region’s nuclear weapons states.

Finally, given the proliferation of missile systems and nuclear submarines, there is growing risk of serious accidents and inadvertent escalation. During the Cold War, nuclear missile submarines collided with each other in the ocean, sometimes significantly damaging each other.180 More recently, in 2009, two nuclear-armed SSBNs—the British HMS Vanguard and the French Le Triomphant—collided deep in the Atlantic Ocean.181 A greater number of SSNs and SSBNs in the Indo-Pacific will only raise the likelihood of such accidents. On the missile front, in 2022, India accidentally fired a supersonic BrahMos cruise missile into Pakistan.182 The missile was not armed, and a major escalation was averted, but the incident highlighted the risks of inadvertent escalation among nuclear adversaries, emphasizing the need to have better missile safety management and crisis communication. Widespread missile proliferation in the Indo-Pacific and South Asia is therefore another area where mechanisms will be needed to mitigate the risks of rising insecurity.

5. MENA at the Threshold? Proliferation Risks and Great Power Competition

Nicole Grajewski and Jane Darby Menton

This article situates the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) in the global nuclear order, emphasizing how the region has both challenged and spurred adaptations in international nuclear governance for decades. It then examines two pressing contemporary issues: the uncertain trajectory of Iran’s nuclear program after Israeli and US military strikes in June 2025, and the anticipated expansion of nuclear energy across MENA, which could also result in more countries with capabilities that would be conducive to pursuing the bomb. Both developments underscore the difficulties of managing nuclear latency in a conflict-prone region, where tensions among local actors inflect nuclear decision-making. While there are opportunities to mitigate these challenges, and principles that policymakers should follow in addressing them, nuclear aspirations are likely to remain a prominent feature of MENA’s security landscape so long as underlying tensions between regional actors remain unresolved.

The Middle East and North Africa (MENA) occupy a unique and volatile position within the global nuclear order. At the heart of this dynamic lies a long history of challenges to international nuclear governance, coupled with Israel’s status as the region’s sole nuclear-armed state and the only MENA country that operates outside the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT), a position that has both resulted from and contributed to the region’s pervasive security dilemmas. Israel’s undeclared arsenal; proliferation attempts in states including Iran, Iraq, Libya, and Syria; and regional counterproliferation practices, including kinetic attacks on nuclear infrastructure, have fueled insecurity and motivated latent nuclear ambitions across MENA for generations.

Today, the region faces two nuclear challenges that demand urgent attention from policymakers and scholars alike. First, as this article goes to press in early July 2025, the long-simmering Iranian nuclear crisis appears to be at an inflection point. For years, Iran has been a “threshold state,” meaning that it would be capable of building nuclear weapons relatively quickly if it chose to do so. Efforts to contain the program diplomatically stalled after the United States withdrew from the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (J",https://tnsr.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/7642581-downsized-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 18:03:18.163727

Specifically, section 1822 of the FY26 House NDAA would enable the commercial best practice of permitting advance payments and allow Federal agencies to access cutting-edge technologies more quickly.
However, as the conference considers section 863 in the FY26 House NDAA and section 836 in the FY26 Senate NDAA, we encourage you to carefully consider the implications and unintended consequences of the IP mandates included in these provisions.
The Chamber thanks you for your work on the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act.","Dear Chairman Wicker, Ranking Member Reed, Chairman Rogers, and Ranking Member Smith:

As the House and Senate work over the coming weeks to reconcile differences among each chamber's respective version of the Fiscal Year 2026 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), the U.S. Chamber of Commerce stands ready to work with you to advance policies that ensure our servicemembers have the capabilities and certainty they need by making it easier for American businesses of all sizes to work with the Department of War (the Department).

Among the many provisions we support, we highlight the following:

Acquisition Reform: We applaud both the House and Senate for taking crucial steps to address the burdensome, outdated acquisition process within the Department. The Chamber has long supported multi-year procurement contracts and efforts to involve businesses of all sizes in the acquisition process.

Additionally, the Chamber supports section 1832 of the FY26 House NDAA to create a “data-as-a-service solutions for weapons system contracts."" This approach would give the Department flexibility in identifying the intellectual property (IP) required to sustain a program over its lifecycle, while also adjusting to the ever-evolving threat landscape.

We also support efforts to reform the foreign military sales process. As the Chamber testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee on May 15, 2025, “the foreign military sales process is cumbersome and after nearly three decades of attempts, no meaningful reforms have been made. Together, industry and government can change that.”[1]

[1]https://www.armed-services.senate.gov/hearings/to-receive-testimony-on-the-department-of-defense-responsibilities-related-to-foreign-military-sales-system-and-international-armaments-cooperation

Accordingly, we are encouraged by section 908 of the FY26 Senate NDAA that provides a new Assistant Secretary of Defense for International Cooperation within the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition and Sustainment to focus on the execution of contracts and section 1259 of the Senate text that establishes a foreign military sales continuous process improvement board that would include industry experts not employed by the Department or registered as federal lobbyists.

AUKUS: The U.S. Chamber is proud to be one of four U.S. industry associations serving on a working group related to the trilateral security pact between Australia, the United Kingdom, and the United States (AUKUS). We are encouraged to see both the House and Senate texts recognize the vital importance of this partnership in deterring threats in the Indo-Pacific region, as industry needs consistent and strong demand signals from all three AUKUS member governments to make meaningful investments and ensure the pact’s success.

Space: To maintain America’s leadership in space, the Chamber continues to encourage commercial innovation, private-public partnerships, and a supportive regulatory environment. Specifically, section 1822 of the FY26 House NDAA would enable the commercial best practice of permitting advance payments and allow Federal agencies to access cutting-edge technologies more quickly. This section will let Federal agencies lock in favorable pricing and leverage services over time and as-needed, rather than being constrained by fiscal year–end deadlines. We commend the House for section 1604 that directs the Secretary of the Air Force to establish the tactical surveillance, reconnaissance and tracking (TacSRT) program as a program of record, and the Senate for its language in section 1505 that requires competition from multiple vendors to maximize resilience and interoperability with Department of War systems in the acquisition of space-based data. The Chamber also supports provisions in section 1605 of the House text and section 1502 of the Senate text to study national needs for future space launch capacity.

PFAS: We applaud the House for including language to delay the deadline for phasing out Aqueous Film-Forming Foam (AFFF) used by the military. Additionally, we support several provisions in the Senate text including:

Section 315 granting authority to the Department to destroy or dispose of perfluoroalkyl or polyfluoroalkyl substances;

Section 316 to modify restrictions on procurement or purchasing of personal protective equipment for firefighters;

Section 318 to repeal the restrictions of DoD’s procurement of certain products containing PFAS, including nonstick cookware, furniture, and carpets; and section 319 to repeal the temporary moratorium on incineration by the Department of PFAS and AFFF.

The Chamber believes the NDAA would be improved if amended in several key areas:

Protecting Intellectual Property: The U.S. Chamber shares the goal of ensuring our warfighters have the tools necessary to fight and win on the battlefield, which includes the ability to maintain and repair weapons systems. However, as the conference considers section 863 in the FY26 House NDAA and section 836 in the FY26 Senate NDAA, we encourage you to carefully consider the implications and unintended consequences of the IP mandates included in these provisions. We are concerned that the inclusion of these mandates would unnecessarily harm our traditional defense companies, deter non-traditional and commercial firms from entering and sustaining the defense industrial base, chill investment, and stifle the defense tech innovation that the Department seeks. If adopted as drafted, this language would make the broader private sector less inclined to serve the defense market, reducing competition and risking slower sustainment and repair.

Instead, we urge the conference to adopt the “data-as-a-service"" approach included in the House text. Additionally, we believe the Department already has existing authorities[2]

[2]https://www.ndia.org/-/media/sites/ndia/policy/ip-and-data-rights/ip-and-data-rights-white-paper.pdf?download=1?download=1

with regards to data rights and IP that can help achieve the same goals.

Non-Traditional Defense Contractors: We welcome efforts to broaden industrial participation in the defense industrial base. However, we caution the conference against putting into law any language that favors any sector or business type. A level playing field, open to small businesses, mid-tiers, commercial innovators, and traditional defense suppliers alike, is essential to ensure that the industrial base can operate on a wartime footing. An open, competitive market that welcomes every capable supplier is essential to mobilize at speed and deliver for the warfighter.

Cybersecurity: The Cybersecurity Information Sharing Act of 2015 (CISA 2015) expires on September 30, 2025 and requires reauthorization. Without renewal, the U.S. will face a more complex and dangerous security landscape. Important provisions of CISA 2015 include:

(a) a framework that enables private entities to share cyber threat information with industry and government partners within a secure policy and legal framework, which allows defenders to improve their security measures and complicates attackers' operations;

(b) protections for businesses related to public disclosure, regulatory issues, and antitrust matters, which encourage the timely exchange of information between public and private entities without fear of legal repercussions; and

(c) strong measures to safeguard privacy and civil liberties, ensuring that the sharing of information does not infringe on the rights of individuals.

The Chamber advocates for a multi-year reauthorization of this essential law. Both the private sector and the government need certainty, including the ability to allocate resources for long-term cybersecurity planning and implementation. House and Senate leaders and the Trump administration have expressed strong support for reauthorizing CISA 2015.

The State and Local Cybersecurity Grant Program (SLCGP) also expires September 30, 2025. Inaction on its reauthorization will disrupt, stall, and unwind meaningful progress made by state and local cybersecurity entities and professionals that are protecting our nation’s most critical assets. Nation-state actors are persistently targeting U.S. critical infrastructure and systems at the state, local, tribal, and territorial (SLTT) government levels, seeking to conduct espionage, disrupt essential services, and erode public trust. State and local governments overseeing the function of essential services and infrastructure, such as energy, water, transportation, and healthcare, among others, are in dire need of federal support. Without continued funding, state and local governments will be left without the support necessary to engage in meaningful efforts to improve cyber resilience in support of the American citizens who rely on these services. The Chamber supports full reauthorization of the SLCGP.

Protecting Americans from Russian Litigation: U.S. businesses are being unfairly targeted in foreign jurisdictions, particularly Russian courts, for their good faith compliance with U.S. sanctions and export controls. U.S. law currently provides no protection for enforcement of foreign judgments that are issued due to such compliance, which often spurs from companies exiting the Russian market (or related contractual activities). The Chamber urges inclusion of Senate Amendment 3903 in the FY26 NDAA to protect U.S. businesses by closing the loophole in U.S. federal law that allows enforcement of these foreign judgments and functions as a Russian countersanction.

Housing: America’s housing market continues to suffer from a severe shortage of over 4.7 million homes[3]

[3]https://www.uschamber.com/economy/the-state-of-housing-in-america

, which has created cascading economic and social challenges impacting both the civilian and military workforce. To help address the housing crisis, we encourage the conference to include Senate Amendment 3777, the Renewing Opportunity in the American Dream (ROAD) to Housing Act, in the FY26 NDAA.

Second Chance Act: As we work to address America’s workforce needs, the Chamber continues to support reauthorization of the Second Chance Act and encourages the conference to include Senate Amendment 3435 in the FY26 NDAA. This will help increase career training and employment opportunities for formerly incarcerated individuals giving these individuals second chances while reducing recidivism, driving economic growth, and bolstering the workforce.

The Chamber thanks you for your work on the FY26 National Defense Authorization Act. We believe passage of this bipartisan legislation is critical to both keeping our nation safe and meeting America’s national security commitments.

Sincerely,

Neil L. Bradley

NJ, UNITED STATES, September 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Genuine Heating & Cooling has published a new, easy-to-understand guide for consumers. It explains how new air-source heat pumps can significantly cut down on energy costs. These systems also offer both heating and cooling from one unit. The guide points out that highly efficient heat pumps can lower utility bills by 20–40 percent. This is compared to old oil heaters or electric resistance heaters. This applies to heat pumps with SEER ratings of 18–20+ and Heating Seasonal Performance Factors (HSPF) above 9. These systems can reverse their operation. This means they warm homes in winter and cool them in summer. You won't need separate furnaces and air conditioners anymore.

“Many homeowners still think heat pumps are only for mild weather,” the guide explains. “But new models for cold weather now provide full heating even when it's very cold outside, below –13 °F.” This technology works by moving heat, not by creating it. This makes it much more efficient than burning fuel or using electric coils. Heat pumps run on electricity. In New Jersey, more and more electricity comes from renewable sources. So, heat pumps also reduce our reliance on fossil fuels. This helps shrink a home’s carbon footprint.

Besides saving energy, the guide shows many life advantages of heat pumps. Modern units run quietly, typically 40–55 decibels outdoors. They don't need oil deliveries or propane tanks. Homeowners might qualify for good financial help. The New Jersey Clean Energy Program gives rebates of up to $2,000 for certain heat pump installations. Federal tax credits cover 30 percent of costs, up to $2,000. The guide also says installation usually takes 1–3 days. This includes a professional calculation of your home's needs, picking the right system, and handling permits.

The costs are clear. Installing a single-zone ductless heat pump can cost $4,000–$7,500. Multi-zone systems for an entire home can range from $10,000–$20,000 or more. Replacing an old furnace and central AC with a ducted heat pump costs about $12,000–$18,000. Prices depend on the system's size, how efficient it is, how many zones you need, and how complex the installation is. However, rebates and tax credits significantly reduce these upfront costs.

Tuesday is when the FAST Act's HOV exemption for EV drivers ends.
In California, EV drivers will not be ticketed for HOV lane violations until 60 days after the exemption expires under the California Vehicle Code.
In September, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., introduced companion legislation to extend the authorization for certain alternative fuel vehicles to use HOV lanes.
“Congress should pass this HOV extension plan before the September 30 deadline and keep current — and future — EV drivers in the fast lane.”","More than a million electric vehicle drivers are about to lose access to a key perk.

Starting Wednesday, unless they have the required number of passengers, EV drivers in 12 states will no longer be able to use high-occupancy vehicle lanes once a provision in the 2015 U.S. highway and infrastructure bill ends with the conclusion of the federal fiscal year.

Here’s what you need to know:

In Arizona, California, Colorado, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Maryland, New Jersey, New York, North Carolina, Utah and Virginia, single drivers of EVs can use high-occupancy vehicle lanes, according to the U.S. Energy Department's Alternative Fuels Data Center. The programs vary from state to state, with some drivers gaining access through a decal and others with special permits or transponders.

Initially authorized through the Safe, Accountable, Flexible, Efficient Transportation Equity Act, low-emission and energy-efficient vehicles with a single occupant have been allowed in HOV lanes since 2005. In 2015, the Fixing America’s Surface Transportation, or FAST, Act extended the ability for states to allow EVs’ carpool lane access for 10 years.

Ordinarily, HOV lanes are only accessible to vehicles with at least two or three passengers, but the FAST Act granted an exemption from that rule to incentivize the adoption of low-emissions and energy-efficient vehicles.

By increasing EV adoption, states were able to improve air quality and ease congestion in regular traffic lanes, while EV drivers were able to cut their commute times — helping justify the cost difference of an EV compared with a traditional gas-powered car, according to the Electric Vehicle Association.

Tuesday is when the FAST Act's HOV exemption for EV drivers ends.

States that allowed the clean vehicle exemption will start to enforce the federal HOV occupancy rule of at least two or three passengers starting Wednesday, according to the U.S. Transportation Department. In California, EV drivers will not be ticketed for HOV lane violations until 60 days after the exemption expires under the California Vehicle Code.

Penalties for drivers who violate HOV lane rules vary from state to state but usually result in a ticket and demerit points on the driver's license. In California, the penalty for illegally driving in the HOV lane is $490, according to the state's Department of Transportation. In Arizona, the minimum fine is $400, according to the state's DOT.

Yes. In August, U.S. Reps. Greg Standon, D-Ariz., and Mark DeSaulnier, D-Calif., introduced the HOV Lane Exemption Reauthorization Act to extend the HOV lane exemption program under the Transportation Department through 2031.

In September, Sen. Alex Padilla, D-Calif., introduced companion legislation to extend the authorization for certain alternative fuel vehicles to use HOV lanes. Co-sponsored by Sens. John Curtis, R-Utah, and Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., the bill would amend Title 23 of the United States Code that regulates the national highway system.

In the House, the legislation is stuck in the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure. In the Senate, it is currently with the Committee on Environment and Public Works. The bills are unlikely to get traction amid a larger federal funding fight that could shut down the government at the end of Tuesday.

The HOV Lane Exemption Reauthorization Act is supported by the Center for Transportation and the Environment; the Electric Drive Transportation Association; the Fuel Cell and Hydrogen Energy Association; the Renewable Fuels Association; The Transport Project; the Zero Emission Transportation Association; and the main auto industry trade group the Alliance for Automotive Innovation.

“What could be less controversial than cleaner air through lower emissions; faster commutes; and a program that encourages customers to choose advanced vehicle technology?” Alliance for Automotive Innovation President and CEO John Bozzella said in a blog post earlier this month. “Congress should pass this HOV extension plan before the September 30 deadline and keep current — and future — EV drivers in the fast lane.”",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/EV_HOV_lane_access,N,,2025-09-29 17:03:05.727704

California, in tax year 2023, filmed 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit.
Altogether, the buyers in those top three states claimed a total $1.5 billion in federal EV tax credits that year.
So, with the elimination of the $7,500 federal credit, EV buyers would have to hang onto their vehicles longer to justify the higher purchase price from the outset.
At this point, it’s unclear exactly how losing the tax credit will impact the new EV market.","If you’re really still thinking about buying a new EV, you need to drop what you’re doing right now.

Although it’s been creeping up for a little while, you know how it goes: Some folks are still in the market for an EV, but haven’t yet pulled the trigger before the $7,500 federal tax credit expires on September 30. Well, it’s September 29, so if you really are still on the fence, here’s a piece of advice. Stop what you’re doing, and take advantage for the literal hours you have left to do so.

For everyone else, this point is more a period of reflection than anything else. After President Donald Trump signed the One Big Beautiful Bill Act into law, he set a ticking clock for the US government’s — and taxpayers’ — subsidy of new, American-built electric cars and trucks. But how much did Americans actually take advantage of the federal tax credit? Thanks to a new analysis over at LendingTree, we have a better idea.

In tax year 2023 alone, the last year in this particular study, some 487,990 American EV shoppers saved a combined $3.3 billion. No surprises as to which EVs rounded out the top three choices among those buyers (Tesla Model Y, Tesla Model 3 and Chevrolet Equinox EV) or which states filed the most claims (California, Texas and Florida — the three most populous states).

California, in tax year 2023, filmed 157,360 claims for the new EV tax credit. That is by far and away the highest total, representing nearly one-third (32.2%) of all claims that year across the US. Texas, even being in second place, saw 38,870 claims (or 8% of the total by comparison). Florida came in close to Texas with 30,090 claims (6.2%). Altogether, the buyers in those top three states claimed a total $1.5 billion in federal EV tax credits that year. The average amount of new-vehicle credit was $6,709 of the maximum $7,500, as not all buyers had the sort of tax liability necessary to actually claim that upper limit.

Ostensibly, the tax credits were supposed to help interested buyers cope with the higher up-front costs compared to an equivalent internal combustion vehicle. With the federal incentive disappearing, high-priced EVs are going to be a tougher sell, especially as all new vehicles continue to get more expensive with each passing year. Whether you’re shopping for either type of vehicle, though, the calculus of ownership boils down to up-front costs versus what you’ll spend over the time you plan to keep the vehicle. So, with the elimination of the $7,500 federal credit, EV buyers would have to hang onto their vehicles longer to justify the higher purchase price from the outset.

At this point, it’s unclear exactly how losing the tax credit will impact the new EV market. By extension, any changes in the fortunes of the new car market could also affect the used market, so values could be all over the place as we all adjust to the new reality. While the federal tax credit will be gone after tomorrow, September 30, some states may still keep their credits in place, too, so you may still be able to save some money…just not as much as you’ve been able to these past few years.",http://tflcar.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Tesla-EV-Tax-Credit-Countdown.webp,N,,2025-09-29 16:03:14.757827

,Texas American Energy ,2025-09-29 19:42:32+00:00,RealClearEnergy,All of the Above Energy or Best of the Above: Conservatives' Way Forward | RealClearEnergy,Stephen Perkins,,,,,https://www.realclearenergy.org/articles/2025/09/29/all_of_the_above_energy_or_best_of_the_above_conservatives_way_forward_1137846.html,"In recent years, conservatives have proudly championed “all of the above” energy as the most practical path for meeting energy demand, strengthening reliability, and lowering emissions.
With the world’s energy demand surging at unprecedented rates, limiting our energy resources is self-sabotage, not prudence.
An all-of-the-above energy approach does not mean pursuing all energy sources without a strategy, nor does it mean ignoring affordability and reliability.
Hydropower, geothermal, and other energy sources will also play integral parts in meeting our energy demand and satisfying the energy trilemma.
The future of American energy is all of the above: the only correct foundation for an affordable, reliable, and clean energy landscape.","In recent years, conservatives have proudly championed “all of the above” energy as the most practical path for meeting energy demand, strengthening reliability, and lowering emissions. Yet, during a House hearing regarding recent actions by the Department of Energy, “all of the above” seemed to morph into “best of the above.”

Of course, we shouldn’t support every energy source simply for the sake of inclusivity or box-checking. But if we’re serious about solving the energy trilemma –affordable, reliable, and clean–we need every tool available. With the world’s energy demand surging at unprecedented rates, limiting our energy resources is self-sabotage, not prudence. The proliferation of AI is here, which mandates an era of rapid “energy addition,” in the words of Secretary Chris Wright.

An all-of-the-above energy approach does not mean pursuing all energy sources without a strategy, nor does it mean ignoring affordability and reliability. In fact, an all-of-the-above strategy inherently produces a more affordable and reliable energy landscape.

Take my home state of Texas, for example. The world leader in oil and gas, Texas also leads the country in wind energy production and had a record year for solar installations in 2023. In fact, during hot summer days in June of this year, wind and solar provided more than 40% of the electricity for necessities like air conditioning. Since Winter Storm Uri caused widespread blackouts across the state, we’ve put considerable work into bolstering energy reliability and resilience–ensuring we would never again experience what we did in February 2021.

Texas remains one of the best examples of a successful all-of-the-above strategy, but it’s not the only state taking advantage of renewable energy sources while maintaining traditional energy. Iowa, for example, is a leader in wind energy, producing nearly 60% of its electricity with wind power. This is in addition to – not at the expense of – its significant natural gas industry. In fact, this combination has allowed Iowa to routinely produce more energy than it consumes, meaning the state can contribute to regional power grids.

Diversifying our energy portfolio is not just good for reducing emissions or protecting our environment. Just like anything else, putting all our eggs into one basket – or one energy source, in this case – is a recipe for energy insecurity and disaster. Just as environmentalists promise that wind and solar could meet all of our energy needs, relying entirely on fossil fuels would be a grave mistake. Promoting a strategy that takes advantage of all available energy sources where they work best will pave the way for a more abundant future. By relying on a multitude of sources for our energy needs, we’re more prepared in the event of one source going offline.

Arguments against all of the above ignore the reality that we need more energy, period, and we should pursue this goal with all the tools in our arsenal. It’s time to set aside our preconceived notions or biases when it comes to certain forms of energy: we need every source in our arsenal if we’re going to meet our historic energy demand, keep prices for families low, and stay competitive globally. In particular, renewable energy demand and deployment is exploding worldwide, but China is currently dominating these markets. This poses a massive threat, so we must prioritize beating China in energy deployment on the world stage. To that end, we should not be focused on picking winners and losers in the energy market, but rather focus on robust permitting reform to unlock all American energy.

While renewables like wind and solar are inherently intermittent sources, they are remarkably affordable, quick to install, and provide clean energy to the grid. Natural gas, in turn, is a highly reliable and affordable energy source, while producing 50% fewer emissions than coal. In fact, the shale boom has done more than any other tactic to reduce energy-related emissions. Clean and reliable nuclear energy will be instrumental to meeting our energy demand, but there is still work to be done to ensure we can cost-effectively and quickly build new nuclear projects. Hydropower, geothermal, and other energy sources will also play integral parts in meeting our energy demand and satisfying the energy trilemma.

Limiting choice and interfering with the direction of the market is the exact opposite of a conservative approach to bolstering American energy. By unleashing the power of all energy sources, we’re ensuring that our energy grids are more robust and more secure in the face of extreme weather events and other external factors.

The future of American energy is all of the above: the only correct foundation for an affordable, reliable, and clean energy landscape. The Trump Administration and Congress must work to make this strategy a reality for the American people.

As the deadline approaches, some customers are reportedly jumping at the opportunity to buy an EV before the tax credit is gone.

“We knew with the Sept. 30 deadline, it was now or never, so we did it,” Dan McGrath of Cincinnati told The New York Times. ”The car became much more affordable with the tax credit.”

Thousands of others are making the same decision. According to data obtained by the Times, EV sales increased 18% last month to nearly 150,000 vehicles. Industry experts predict another jump this month.

Automakers to embrace more hybrid and gas vehicles

Analysts, however, expect EV sales to begin to decline after the current surge, and auto manufacturers are likely to shift production toward more hybrids, as well as gas and diesel vehicles.

Tesla and Rivian, meanwhile, may endure rough patches as the tax credit expires. They gained billions from electric vehicle subsidies under the Biden administration and currently offer no gas or diesel vehicles.

However, industry analysts suggest that sales may eventually rebound, as they did in Europe after EV subsidies expired in some EU nations a couple of years ago. But in the short term, they said it’s likely a gloomy outlook for EVs.

“Next year could be a pretty dreadful year for EVs in this country,” Adam Jonas, an auto industry analyst for Morgan Stanley, said earlier this month.

Automakers have cut production of some EVs, suspended or canceled new models and shifted toward more gasoline and hybrid automobiles.

Shifting policy prompts change

Eliminating the tax credit marks the end of an embrace of cleaner energy under former President Joe Biden and the introduction of new policies under Trump.

The Trump administration and Republicans in Congress largely oppose subsidies for EVs, and Trump has expressed skepticism toward climate change science. He has dubbed Biden’s former policies on energy the “green new scam.”

Electric cars with performance, range, and tech that deliver on promises

For years, automakers have promised that EVs would change the way we drive. Too often, the reality has fallen short. Range anxiety, glacial charging times, and uninspiring cabins left many shoppers skeptical. But 2025 and 2026 models are different. This new wave of electric vehicles doesn’t just check the boxes they’re genuinely desirable machines. After driving them back-to-back, here are five EVs that prove you don’t need to compromise excitement for electrification.

Why does this matter right now?

The EV market is in a tug-of-war between ambition and reality. Consumers are wary after hearing stories of chargers that don’t work and ranges that vanish in winter. Yet the latest crop, including Ford’s Mustang Mach-E GT and Lucid’s Air Pure, shows that manufacturers are finally addressing these pain points. These vehicles combine fast charging, confident range, and tech that feels genuinely useful. They’re here at the exact moment when the $7,500 EV tax credit is expiring for many models, meaning buyers are scrambling to make decisions quickly.

Consider the Lucid Air Pure: whisper-quiet on the highway, cathedral-like inside, and capable of over-the-air updates to stay current. Or the Kia EV6 GT-Line, which can add hundreds of miles of range in the time it takes to do your grocery run. These cars are arriving just as shoppers demand evidence that EVs can truly replace their gas-powered counterparts.

How does it compare to rivals?

Each of these five goes head-to-head with rivals and proves competitive in ways that matter:

Ford Mustang Mach-E GT: Muscle-car acceleration with family-friendly practicality. Against Tesla’s Model Y, it feels more emotional and less clinical.

Kia EV6 GT-Line AWD: Blends real-world usability with charging speeds that shame more expensive German brands. Compared with the Hyundai Ioniq 5, the EV6 leans sportier and more premium. (See: Acura ADX vs BMW X1 and Audi Q3: Which SUV Wins?)

Polestar 3: A minimalist Swedish design with German-like chassis seriousness. It rivals BMW’s iX but feels less ostentatious and more grounded.

Genesis GV60: Premium quirk with delightful design cues. More playful than a Mercedes EQE SUV and significantly less expensive.

Lucid Air Pure: Highway serenity and cutting-edge software. While Tesla still has the network advantage, Lucid proves luxury EVs can be innovative without compromise.

Even compared with the competition’s brightest, these five hold their ground. They are not future promises, they’re here, and they’re good.

Who is this for and who should skip it?

These EVs suit a wide spectrum of buyers. Commuters who demand quiet luxury will gravitate toward the Lucid Air Pure. Enthusiasts wanting muscle-car vibes will love the Mach-E GT. The Polestar 3 appeals to drivers who want minimalist elegance and European precision. Kia’s EV6 GT-Line hits the sweet spot for families balancing price and practicality, while the Genesis GV60 caters to those seeking premium style with a playful edge.

Who should skip? Road-trippers outside of strong charging networks may still find EVs inconvenient. Those needing heavy towing or large cargo capacities will be better served by traditional SUVs and trucks, at least until EV infrastructure catches up.

What is the long-term significance?

The long-term story here is that EVs are finally maturing. Over-the-air updates ensure cars like the Polestar 3 and Lucid Air Pure won’t feel outdated in three years. Ford, Kia, and Genesis are all expanding their software cadence, so buyers can trust their investments won’t stagnate. This marks a turning point: EVs that deliver not only on eco-credibility but also on excitement.

The industry has promised “the year of the EV” for a decade. This lineup suggests it’s finally happening. Automakers who fail to offer this combination of performance, charging, and comfort will risk losing buyers not only in the short term but also in the critical long game.",https://www.cbs17.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/29/2025/09/5evs.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-29 17:03:10.205787

With more than 10 active coal power plants in Texas, this delay would add more than 2,800 tons of coal ash wastewater pollution to our environment – a 122% increase.

In 2024, the EPA updated the Effluent Limitations Guidelines (ELG) to include stronger protections against coal ash wastewater pollution that enters streams, creeks, and lakes. Coal ash wastewater discharges contain heavy metals and toxins like mercury and arsenic that can cause increased risk of liver and kidney damage, cardiovascular illnesses, cancers, and developmental delays in children.

The Biden-era rule would require coal-burning power plants to eliminate these harmful discharges by 2029, or else commit by the end of this year to cease burning coal by 2034. Today, the EPA under the Trump Administration proposed extending both the compliance deadline and the end-of-year notice deadline—meaning coal plants would be allowed to continue discharging toxic wastewater under weaker standards for several more years.

According to the Sierra Club’s Trump Coal Pollution Dashboard, a delay of last year’s ELG updates would add over 325,000 tons of toxic pollution to public waterways nationwide every year – a 64 percent increase.

In response, Sierra Club Beyond Coal Organizer James Perkins issued the following statement:

“Today’s proposal sends a clear message: people’s health simply doesn’t matter to our federal government. Communities across Texas are pleading for cleaner air and water, but the EPA’s latest slap in the face will give wealthy polluters more time to comply with basic cleanup requirements for dangerous coal ash pollution of our water. Keep in mind they’ve already had enough time to prepare for this deadline – why should they get more if our health is on the line?

Actions by the Energy and Interior departments and the Environmental Protection Agency follow executive orders Trump issued in April to revive coal, a reliable but polluting energy source that’s long been shrinking amid environmental regulations and competition from cheaper natural gas.

Environmental groups denounced the actions, which come as the Trump administration has clamped down on renewable energy, including freezing permits for offshore wind projects, ending clean energy tax credits and blocking wind and solar projects on federal lands.

Under Trump’s orders, the Energy Department has required fossil-fueled power plants in Michigan and Pennsylvania to keep operating past their retirement dates to meet rising U.S. power demand amid growth in data centers, artificial intelligence and electric cars. The latest announcement would allow those efforts to expand as a precaution against possible electricity shortfalls.

Trump also has directed federal agencies to identify coal resources on federal lands, lift barriers to coal mining and prioritize coal leasing on U.S. lands. A sweeping tax bill approved by Republicans and signed by Trump reduces royalty rates for coal mining from 12.5% to 7%, a significant decrease that officials said will help ensure U.S. coal producers can compete in global markets.

‘Mine, baby, mine’

The new law also mandates increased availability for coal mining on federal lands and streamlines federal reviews of coal leases.

“Everybody likes to say, ‘drill, baby, drill.’ I know that President Trump has another initiative for us, which is ‘mine, baby, mine,’” Interior Secretary Doug Burgum said at a news conference Monday at Interior headquarters. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin and Energy Undersecretary Wells Griffith also spoke at the event. All three agencies signed orders boosting coal.

“By reducing the royalty rate for coal, increasing coal acres available for leasing and unlocking critical minerals from mine waste, we are strengthening our economy, protecting national security and ensuring that communities from Montana to Alabama benefit from good-paying jobs,” Burgum said.

Zeldin called coal a reliable energy source that has supported American communities and economic growth for generations.

“Americans are suffering because the past administration attempted to apply heavy-handed regulations to coal and other forms of energy it deemed unfavorable,” he said.

Trump has clamped down on renewable energy

Environmental groups said Trump was wasting federal tax dollars by handing them to owners of the oldest, most expensive and dirtiest source of electricity.

“Subsidizing coal means propping up dirty, uncompetitive plants from last century – and saddling families with their high costs and pollution, said Ted Kelly, clean energy director for the Environmental Defense Fund. “We need modern, affordable clean energy solutions to power a modern economy, but the Trump administration wants to drag us back to a 1950s electric grid.’'

Solar, wind and battery storage are the cheapest and fastest ways to bring new power to the grid, Kelly and other advocates said. “It makes no sense to cut off your best, most affordable options while doubling down on the most expensive ones,” Kelly said.

EPA eases pollution rules

The EPA said Monday it will delay seven deadlines related to wastewater pollution from coal-fired power plants. The industry has complained that regulations imposed under the Biden administration were costly and designed to speed the closure of coal plants.

Coal ash, the waste from burning coal, can leach into groundwater and spread toxins. The Biden administration said the rules were aimed at keeping arsenic and lead out of well water, lowering cancer rates and avoiding disastrous spills.

“Donald Trump and Lee Zeldin are giving big polluters a pass to dump tons and tons of toxic pollution into our waterways, with no care for how many Americans will suffer from drinking contaminated water or eating contaminated food,’' said Laurie Williams, who directs the Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal Campaign.

The EPA also said it will open a 60-day public comment period on potential changes to a regional haze rule that has helped reduce pollution-fueled haze hanging over national parks, wilderness areas and tribal reservations. Zeldin announced in March that the haze rule would be among dozens of landmark environmental regulations that he plans to roll back or eliminate, including a 2009 finding that climate change harms human health and the environment.

Michelle Bloodworth, president and CEO of America’s Power, an industry group, said the EPA rule changes and other administration actions would help to “protect America’s electric reliability and preserve its fleet of coal-fired power plants.”

Coal production has dropped steeply

Burgum, who also chairs Trump’s National Energy Dominance Council, said the actions announced Monday, along with the tax law and previous presidential and secretarial orders, will ensure “abundant, affordable energy while reducing reliance on foreign sources of coal and minerals.’'

The Republican president has long promised to boost what he calls “beautiful” coal to fire power plants and for other uses, but the industry has been in decline for decades.

Coal once provided more than half of U.S. electricity production, but its share dropped to about 15% in 2024, down from about 45% as recently as 2010. Natural gas provides about 43% of U.S. electricity, with the remainder from nuclear energy and renewables such as wind, solar and hydropower.

Energy experts say any bump for coal under Trump is likely to be temporary because natural gas is cheaper, and there’s a durable market for renewable energy such as wind and solar power no matter who holds the White House.

“As electricity demand skyrockets, smart energy policies that help keep the lights on are more important than ever,” NRECA CEO Jim Matheson said. “Today’s announcements give electric co-ops important flexibility to reliably meet growing energy needs at a cost local families and businesses can afford. In recent years, misguided energy policies have forced essential power plants off the grid, while electricity demand surged. We thank the administration for moving swiftly to respond to growing energy needs with an emphasis on new tools, flexibility and a pro-energy policy agenda.”

The North American Electric Reliability Corporation projected that peak power needs are expected to increase 17% over the next 10 years, and newly announced projects—particularly data centers—will drive that number even higher. In the meantime, more than 115,000 megawatts of always-available generation—enough to power about 100 million homes—is expected to retire over the next decade.

The National Rural Electric Cooperative Association is the national trade association representing nearly 900 local electric cooperatives. From growing suburbs to remote farming communities, electric co-ops serve as engines of economic development for 42 million Americans across 56 percent of the nation’s landscape. As local businesses built by the consumers they serve, electric cooperatives have meaningful ties to rural America and invest $15 billion annually in their communities.

The more young people are energized about the future of American energy production, the better for our future.
Even more so, we need an optimistic energy workforce that sees American energy as an opportunity to win, not a problem to be solved.","Throughout the first nine months of the Trump Administration, “energy dominance” has been the agenda. To win the artificial intelligence (AI) race, ensure energy reliability for Americans, and beat China on the world stage, we need more energy – period.

But we can’t do it without America’s young people. Fortunately, it’s a dynamic time to get involved with the energy sector—from robust American leadership in traditional energy sources to developments in advanced nuclear technology to a burgeoning geothermal industry. Adding electrons to the grid has never been more exciting.

Because of all these developments and exploding energy demand, the energy sector continues to grow, and we need promising talent to join its ranks. Innovative companies across the country are hiring young people to craft the future of American energy. Oklo, for instance, is in the process of building next-generation nuclear reactors. Fervo Energy is harnessing the heat under the earth’s crust to produce geothermal power. First Solar is establishing American supply chains and manufacturing for solar panels. Deploying a diverse array of energy sources to fuel Americans’ lives will foster a more secure grid and increased reliability.

Many young Americans, though, don’t know about the work going on in the energy industry. Or, worse, they have a deep misunderstanding of how energy is produced and why we need it. Flipping on a light switch is one thing. Understanding where our precious energy comes from is another thing entirely. In our national discourse, a false dichotomy of “100% renewables” versus “drill, baby, drill” has emerged, deeply dividing politicians and the American people.

Rather than limiting our energy choices, pursuing an all-of-the-above strategy will best serve our energy sector and our nation as a whole. With American leadership in all forms of energy—from traditional sources to renewable technologies—we can lower electricity prices, dominate emerging technologies, and reduce global emissions. Every energy source has trade-offs, but by analyzing each through the trilemma of “affordable, reliable, and clean,” the right balance can be achieved.

This message must be shared with our nation’s young people. Energy literacy, defined by the Department of Energy as “an understanding of the nature and role of energy in the world and daily lives,” is crucial to our energy dominance agenda. We cannot achieve affordable, reliable, and abundant energy without a robust and dedicated workforce and talent pipeline. The more young people are energized about the future of American energy production, the better for our future.

Importantly, universities and trade schools across the country will be instrumental in fostering the next generation of American energy workers. Educators should focus on teaching students about real-world implications and the potential of American-made energy to drive solutions to environmental challenges.

For instance, America’s young people should know that our nation led the world in emissions reductions, largely thanks to the shale boom and natural gas production. Young Americans should be proud that in Chicago, engineers built the world’s very first nuclear reactor. Recent leadership in geothermal energy capacity should excite young Americans.

Our nation needs more energy workers—everything from technically skilled electricians to nuclear engineers with college degrees. Even more so, we need an optimistic energy workforce that sees American energy as an opportunity to win, not a problem to be solved. The next great energy innovation could already be an idea in a young American’s mind. It’s time to unleash it.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/young-male-teacher-giving-a-science-class-presentation-envato.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 16:02:22.209861

“AI data centers and advanced manufacturing are at the core of America’s economic future, but they can’t run without reliable, affordable power,” Rep. Barr said on Sept. 25. “The SPEED and Reliability Act cuts red tape and builds the transmission lines we need to lower costs and ensures we stay ahead of China in the race for AI.”

Under the current National Interest Electric Transmission Corridor (NIETC) program, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) are supposed to coordinate on designating broad corridors for transmission development, with the goal of streamlining siting and permitting for high-impact transmission lines in the national interest, the lawmakers said.

Thus far, though, the process hasn’t resulted in a single transmission project due to widespread opposition to the approach, they added.

“We cannot wait a decade plus for individual transmission lines to be approved if we don’t want to fall behind China and our adversaries,” said Rep. Peters. “This bill will lower costs for consumers, improve reliability, and help secure America’s energy independence.”

The SPEED and Reliability Act would reform the NIETC program by removing the ability of the U.S. Energy Secretary to designate corridors, and would centralize environmental reviews at FERC.

The bill also would include additional guardrails to protect customers, benefit local communities, and respect state authority, according to a bill summary provided by the congressmen, such as allocating costs only to customers that benefit, using a minimum specified list of electric reliability criteria, along with specified economic benefits.

Among other provisions, the SPEED and Reliability Act also would allow FERC to issue a construction permit for individual national interest transmission lines that reduce grid congestion, improve reliability, and provide a clear set of economic and reliability benefits to customers, the summary says.",,N,,2025-09-29 16:04:27.477278

The inherent advantage of SSLSBs in energy density requires further validation through pouch cell testing. Due to the increasing application of battery integration with the chassis in electric vehicles, the limited design space necessitates consideration of volumetric energy density. While meeting gravimetric energy density requirements, it is crucial to ensure that battery volume matches the compartment space. Similarly, the confined spaces in unmanned aerial vehicles and wearable devices require evaluating whether volumetric energy density meets application demands alongside gravimetric energy density considerations. For applications requiring high power output, such as unmanned aerial vehicles, and rapid charging capabilities, as in electric vehicles, the power density and fast-charging performance of SSLSBs still require improvement. This necessitates addressing the poor conductivity of sulfur species and ion transport limitations within the battery. Regarding cycle life, SSLSBs face challenges associated with volumetric expansion and non-uniform lithium metal deposition, which compromise battery integrity. In the subsequent discussion, we will examine the technological breakthroughs required for SSLSB applications based on their existing limitations, with the aim of identifying viable strategies to overcome these challenges.

Power density and fast charging

The power density and fast charging of SSLSBs are influenced by multiple factors. On the one hand, there is the voltage limitation, which is determined by the inherent battery system of SSLSBs. Compared with the discharge plateau of traditional lithium-ion batteries, the average discharge plateau of SSLSBs is reduced by nearly 46%. To achieve the same output power, it relies on larger output currents or series-parallel structures. Currently, many devices have requirements for output voltage (such as electric vehicles and electric aircraft). Fortunately, Direct current to direct current converter (DC-DC) technology122 can be used to boost the voltage of single cells, but this process also causes approximately 10% energy loss. Benefiting from the significant advantage of SSLSBs over traditional lithium-ion battery systems in specific capacity, the energy loss for achieving higher output voltage is within an acceptable range. On the other hand, considering the electrochemical reactions and the migration processes of electrons and ions occurring during battery operation, the pivotal determinant lies in the ionic conductivity of both the SSE and the cathode (Fig. 3a). Unlike liquid electrolytes, ion transport in the solid phase is more complex, leading to reduced ionic conductivity. Additionally, due to the inherently poor electrical conductivity of sulfur, the electron transport pathway heavily relies on conductive additives incorporated into the cathode material123.

Material and structure modifications of SSEs can directly and significantly enhance the ionic conductivity of Li+ migration within battery systems. In the Li6+xP1–xGexS5I (LPGSI) electrolyte system, aliovalent substitution enhances the performance of SSE124. Germanium (Ge) substitution induces structural modifications and site disorder, leading to a reduction in the activation energy barrier for ion migration and an enhancement in ionic conductivity (Fig. 3b), thereby achieving an ionic conductivity of up to 18.4 ± 2.7 mS cm−1. By adding fillers and other components, the ionic conductivity of SSEs can also be improved. For instance, the implementation of composite electrodes has been employed for Li+ transport enhancement. The incorporation of barium titanite into PEO polymer electrolytes generates an inherent polarization field125, which provides a robust driving force for Li+ transport, thereby accelerating Li+ migration (Fig. 3c). This approach not only enhances lithium-ion transport and accelerates redox reaction kinetics but also establishes strong chemical interactions between macroscopic charges and LiPSs, effectively suppressing the shuttle effect and significantly improving the cycling stability of SSLSBs.

In addition to the ionic conductivity of SSEs, the sulfur cathode component represents another critical aspect that requires attention in SSLSBs. The redox reactions at the cathode necessitate simultaneous electron conduction and ion migration. However, due to the insulating nature of sulfur, the solid-solid sulfur conversion reaction can only occur at the triple-phase boundary between the SSE, active material, and carbon126. This results in sluggish reaction kinetics, which significantly limits the power density and fast-charging capabilities of the system. The acceleration of electrochemical reactions through redox-mediated molecular processes or the introduction of redox reactions to facilitate the conversion between active species127,128 are considered promising strategies for enhancing the power density and fast-charging capabilities of SSLSBs. Recent research advancements have demonstrated a rapid solid-state sulfur redox reaction facilitated by Li6PS5I glassy solid electrolytes (GSE)126. Based on the reversible redox reaction between I− and I2/I3−, the GSE not only functions as a superionic conductor but also serves as a surface redox mediator, promoting sluggish reactions at the solid–solid phase boundary, thereby significantly increasing the density of active sites (Fig. 3d). Furthermore, accelerating the conversion between sulfur species through redox-mediated molecules or introducing redox reactions represents a viable strategy for enhancing electrochemical kinetics, thereby improving the power density and fast-charging capability of SSLSBs. The study revealed that the LiI-enriched domains formed after charging can effectively sustain the ionic conductivity of the cathode129. Building upon the research findings of enhanced ionic conductivity in solid-state Li−S cathodes through LiI/Li2S synergistic effects, the research team proposed a strategy to construct both microscopic and nanoscale ion conduction pathways to ensure high power density130,131. They synthesized a Li2S–Li2O–LiI cathode with active materials dispersed in an amorphous matrix, wherein Li2O–LiI provides nanoscale ion conduction pathways and activates Li2S during cycling130. In addition to the incorporation of external redox mediators, the molecular redesign of active species and the construction of conductive frameworks in cathodes can effectively enhance redox kinetics and improve electrode impedance132. Sulfurized polyacrylonitrile (SPAN)133, as a conductive polymer matrix, exhibits higher electrical conductivity. By anchoring sulfur within the polyacrylonitrile (PAN) framework, the formation of Li2S is effectively prevented, significantly accelerating redox kinetics. Furthermore, the utilization of residual N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF) strengthens the C–S bonds, enabling a quasi-intercalation reaction. Consequently, solid-state Li−SPAN batteries demonstrate superior rate performance compared to liquid Li−S batteries even at room temperature. Three-dimensional porous covalent organic framework (COF)-derived nitrogen-doped carbon integrated with two-dimensional transition metal carbides and nitrides (MXene) was designed as an electronically conductive sulfur host material134. The well-aligned porous framework provides continuous channels for electron transport (Fig. 3e). It should be noted that for the method of accelerating kinetics via redox mediating molecules, the range design of redox potential must be carefully considered. Otherwise, excessively activation potentials of mediating molecules will cause additional energy loss135. Additionally, introducing inactive materials without capacity contribution to improve ion and electron conduction in sulfur cathodes may dilute the sulfur ratio in the cathode, thereby affecting the energy density. This aspect requires special attention in engineering optimization.

In addition to the inherent ionic conductivity of SSEs, the design of thin electrolytes can directly shorten the ionic transport distance between the positive and negative electrodes of SSLSBs, thereby enhancing the power density. During the preparation of traditional SSEs, reducing the thickness of SSEs makes it increasingly difficult to maintain their mechanical stability. In particular, for inorganic electrolytes136, sulfide SSEs may suffer from weak inter-particle bonding and direct fragmentation during direct pressing, while oxide SSEs are more prone to cracking as independent thin films due to their inherent brittleness. Introducing flexible polymers as supports is an effective solution, which can provide mechanical strength and support structures for inorganic SSEs. For example, the composite SSE film137 prepared by incorporating carboxylated nitrile butadiene rubber into LPSCl enables continuous preparation at a thickness of <50 μm. In-situ filling of polymer electrolytes and lithium salts into the 78Li2S–22P2S5 thin inorganic electrolyte not only achieves a self-supporting structure but also reduces porosity, increasing the original thin SSE conductivity by 2.7 times.

Polymer-based SSEs can also endow SSLSBs with the ability to adapt to deformation, facilitating their application in flexible wearable devices120. A flexible SSLSB assembled with a crosslinked gel electrolyte based on PEO and PAN employs a PAN fiber network design to simultaneously address issues of ionic conduction, mechanical strength, and LiPSs shuttling138. This flexible SSLSB maintains a capacity retention rate of over 96% after 1000 bending cycles. Flexible matching of electrodes is also of great importance. All-solid-state polymer electrolytes can also endow SSLSBs with flexibility, offering higher safety and stronger capability to prevent LiPSs shuttling compared to gel-state polymer SSEs. However, some all-solid-state polymer electrolytes exhibit low Li+ conductivity at room temperature, typically requiring operation at high temperatures (>60 °C) to achieve ionic conductivity sufficient for power output139,140. This limitation consequently restricts the application scenarios of polymer-based SSLSBs under ambient conditions. Interestingly, there is an integrated approach that can solve the temperature issue by integrating a photothermal conversion system into the battery structure141. This system effectively generates heat through carrier non-radiative recombination within silicon nanoshells, with the generated heat subsequently transferred rapidly to the battery system via a copper core. Through solar irradiation, the converted thermal energy enables enhanced reaction kinetics in SSLSBs. Due to the poor thermal conductivity of polymers, ionic conductivity tends to be non-uniform during temperature variations, which readily induces inhomogeneous lithium deposition. Incorporating two-dimensional boron nitride (BN) nanosheets into PEO-based SSEs can synergistically enhance the ionic conductivity, mechanical strength, and thermal transport of PEO-based SSEs, thereby improving cycling stability under temperature fluctuations139. Given that the ionic conductivity of polymer-based SSEs is dependent on segmental motion142, maintaining an amorphous state is particularly crucial for ensuring ionic conductivity at and below ambient temperatures143. The incorporation of plasticizer components144 enables the polymer electrolyte to maintain a completely amorphous state across a wide temperature range extending to subzero conditions, thereby facilitating rapid Li+ conduction and stable interfacial chemistry in batteries at low temperatures.

In addition to the solid-solid transition reactions at the cathode and SSEs, the interface also significantly influences fast charging performance. Indium trifluoride (InF3) was employed as a bifunctional initiator to facilitate the in-situ polymerization of 1,3-dioxolane (PDOL) electrolyte145. The interaction between InF3 and lithium metal promotes the formation of a hybrid solid electrolyte interphase (SEI) enriched with lithium fluoride (LiF) and lithium-indium alloy. This structural modification effectively enhances Li+ kinetics and mitigates the impedance effects at the anode interface.

Cycling performance

To achieve long cycle life in SSLSBs, it is essential to consider factors such as active material loss and degradation of battery components146. The primary manifestations of battery component damage include (Fig. 4a): (1) Volume changes in the electrode during charge-discharge cycles of solid-state Li−S cathodes, which can readily compromise the cathode structure and damage the conductive ion network through repeated expansion and contraction, resulting in excessive polarization and capacity loss. (2) Degradation of SSEs, typically occurs during charging processes. This phenomenon may lead to electrolyte penetration and subsequent short-circuiting. Although inorganic SSEs exhibit higher modulus, they remain susceptible to dendrite penetration issues.

In the field of liquid Li−S batteries, self-healing strategies have been extensively employed to mitigate the polysulfide dissolution and shuttle effect in the cathodes147,148,149,150,151. In SSLSBs, self-healing approaches are recognized as an effective strategy to mitigate the degradation of SSEs. SSE self-healing predominantly relies on the intrinsic self-healing properties of materials, which are primarily attributed to reversible chemical bonds and hydrogen bonds within the material system152, typically based on polymer matrices. A novel polymer-based quasi-solid-state electrolyte has been successfully synthesized153, demonstrating remarkable interfacial stability during prolonged cycling. This enhanced performance is attributed to the incorporation of reversible S–S bonds and hydrogen bonds within the polymer matrix (Fig. 4b). The significantly lower activation energy of S–S bonds compared to hydrogen bonds facilitates the rapid self-healing process, which exhibits a high self-healing efficiency of approximately 95.3% within an exceptionally short recovery time of 5 min (Fig. 4c). In cathodes based on sulfide SSEs, carbon materials can enhance electron transport but accelerate the oxidative decomposition of sulfide SSEs. Introducing non-conductive polar host mesoporous matrices (such as SiO2) can suppress electrolyte decomposition via non-conductivity154. Meanwhile, the strong interaction between the high-polarity surface and S/Li2S avoids sulfur detachment, maintaining stable conductive pathways. In this work, the electron conductivity issue is addressed by constructing three-dimensional conductive networks with different carbon materials. Additionally, introducing hybrid ion/electron conductive transition metal sulfide VS2 into the cathode to form a core-shell structured cathode architecture with sulfur coated on VS2 nanosheets can mitigate degradation of the SSE155. Layered VS2 acts not only as an electron conductor but also provides Li+ transport channels. This structure reduces the surface contact between electron-conductive components and the SSE in the cathode, thereby suppressing SSE decomposition during charging and enabling stable cycling performance with high sulfur utilization.

During the electrochemical reaction process, the delamination at the electrolyte/electrode interface can be effectively mitigated through the implementation of self-healing strategies. The modification of PEO through the Michael addition strategy, utilizing self-healing poly(β-amino ester)s with comb-like topology and multiple functional groups, not only facilitates the formation of rapid Li+ transport channels but also endows the electrolyte with self-healing capabilities156. Solid-state polymer electrolytes based on poly(ether-urethane) demonstrate enhanced interfacial contact and self-healing capability at the interface, maintaining 93% of their capacity after 700 cycles157 (Fig. 4d, e). Furthermore, this issue can also be mitigated through the physical confinement and regulation of sulfur distribution. Sulfur-carbon composites prepared by sulfur vapor deposition (SVD) method enable uniform distribution of submicron-scale sulfur materials within carbon pores158. When sulfur and discharge products are confined in the porous carbon matrix during cycling, interfacial separation caused by volume changes is avoided, ensuring high-capacity retention. This regulation strategy, which requires no additional framework introduction, achieves a high sulfur loading ratio of up to 83.3%. To address the issue of electrode damage induced by volume variations, the integration of elastic polymers with SSEs has been demonstrated to effectively accommodate the substantial volume changes experienced by lithium metal anodes during cycling159. Such materials not only strengthen mechanical integrity but also maintain stable contact between the electrodes and the electrolyte, thereby enhancing cycle life160. Moreover, the construction of rapid and stable ion and electron transport pathways within the cathode is particularly crucial for the cycling stability of SSLSBs161,162. Nanostructures and novel material compositions have also been pivotal in advancing the performance metrics of SSLSBs. For example, the incorporation of Li2S and carbon nanotubes in composite electrodes has been demonstrated to improve the electrocatalytic activity for polysulfide conversion163,164,165. The use of nanostructured materials not only enhances the surface area for reactions but also facilitates better ionic and electronic pathways, further contributing to longer cycling life166,167.

Effective interface engineering can mitigate issues of poor interfacial contact and enhance the electrochemical stability of the battery. Innovative approaches involve the use of coatings or surface modifications on the sulfur particles to optimize electron transport and polysulfide interaction with the electrolyte168,169,170. These interface improvements can lead to better redox kinetics and more effective utilization of sulfur, directly impacting the overall lifecycle of the batteries. The incorporation of multifunctional additives can effectively enhance the electrolyte’s performance, thereby preventing the detrimental penetration of lithium dendrites that may cause structural damage to the electrolyte, especially in polymer electrolytes. Researchers171 have proposed a multifunctional additive, C60, which, when incorporated into PEO, effectively mitigates lithium dendrite growth and penetration by reducing the high interfacial energy of lithium. This mechanism is responsible for the stable cycling durability observed over 1000 hours. Additionally, researchers172 have employed salt additives as a strategy to artificially induce the formation of an SEI layer with enhanced mechanical integrity and lithium-ion conductivity, thereby mitigating the detrimental effects of lithium dendrite formation on polymer electrolytes. Although SSLSBs have significantly mitigated the dissolution and shuttling of LiPSs compared to their liquid counterparts, this phenomenon persists in polymer and quasi-solid-state electrolytes, leading to capacity degradation. However, the suppression of LiPSs shuttling is relatively more straightforward in solid-state batteries, as the application of a functional coating on the cathode can effectively inhibit the shuttling effect37.

Real energy density

Most of the current literature predominantly focuses on evaluating energy density or capacity based on the mass of active materials in cathode, while neglecting the significant proportion of inactive components within the entire battery system. These inactive components, which may include SSEs, current collectors, conductive additives, and packaging materials, contribute to the substantial discrepancy between the practical and theoretical energy densities of SSLSBs.

Table 1 presents energy densities of SSLSBs referenced to battery components rather than active materials. Notably, the practical energy densities considering non-active components are significantly lower than the theoretical values: the theoretical gravimetric energy density of SSLSB is ~2600 Wh kg−1, and the theoretical volumetric energy density173 is ~2800 Wh L−1. In the surveyed literatures, the practical energy densities referenced to the positive electrodes174,175 only reach approximately half of the theoretical values, while the highest practical gravimetric energy density referenced to both positive and negative electrodes176 is around 1000 Wh kg−1. When additionally considering the SSE, the practical energy densities177 are limited to 505 Wh kg−1 and 557 Wh L−1. Current laboratory-scale energy density evaluations primarily use coin-cell configurations for verification. However, in practical applications, essential components such as current collectors and encapsulation materials (beyond electrodes and electrolytes) must be considered, particularly in industries with urgent demands for high-energy-density batteries (e.g., electric vehicles). They require high energy densities not only at the electrochemical system level but also at the entire device level.

To evaluate the discrepancy in practical energy density between SSLSBs at the device and material levels, we developed a simplified solid-state Li−S pouch cell model. By systematically varying some key parameters, we investigated the influence of sulfur content and inactive components on the practical device energy density. Furthermore, we analyzed potential strategies for enhancing energy density at the device level. As illustrated in Fig. 5a, we investigated a single-layer solid-state Li−S pouch cell configuration, which comprises encapsulation materials, current collectors for both cathode and anode, SSE, lithium metal anode, and sulfur cathode. The sulfur cathode consists of elemental sulfur, SSE, and electronic conductor materials. In this model, several assumptions were established: (1) The active materials exhibit 100% theoretical capacity; (2) The side materials and tabs of the pouch cell were neglected, with all materials assumed to be perfectly aligned in a 1:1 area ratio and in intimate contact. (3) The average voltage of the discharge platform is 2 V.

Based on the aforementioned considerations, we establish the following parameters: sulfur loading (x, mg cm−2), sulfur ratio (y), and SSE thickness (z, µm), and subsequently calculate the total areal mass of the cell (mg cm−2). The obtained results are presented in Table 2. For the current collector’s areal mass, we adopt reference values from commercial current collectors (current collector density of cathode: 8.96 g cm−3, thickness: 17 µm; current collector density of anode: 2.70 g cm−3, thickness: 12 µm). Assuming that the electrochemical reaction can completely convert the sulfur in the cathode, in the solid-state Li−S pouch cell model with a negative-to-positive electrode capacity ratio (N/P ratio) of RN/P (where RN/P ≥ 1), the areal mass of lithium metal can be calculated based on RN/P and the theoretical capacities of lithium and sulfur. It is assumed that the SSE has a density of ρ g cm−3, with an areal mass of 0.1ρz mg cm−2. The cathode comprises active material (sulfur), ion-conducting component (SSE), and electron-conducting material (e.g., carbon). Assuming the sulfur component accounts for y of the mass, the remaining cathode components contribute x/y(1−y). Encapsulation material is also considered, with commercial aluminum laminate film as reference (density: 1 g cm−3, thickness: 114 µm). The total areal capacity of the cell can be determined by multiplying the sulfur’s theoretical capacity with its loading, yielding 1.675x mAh cm−2. Given an average discharge voltage of 2 V, the overall energy density of the pouch cell can be calculated using Formula 1,

where the energy density is expressed in Wh kg−1, where the numerator represents the areal capacity of the pouch cell and the denominator corresponds to the total areal mass of the battery.

The energy density variations of pouch cells were investigated by systematically controlling the parameters of x, y, z, and ρ, as illustrated in Fig. 5b. Considering that the density difference of SSEs affects the results, to make the trend more realistic, we referenced the densities of classic SSEs with different densities: Li3PS4 (LPS, ρLPS = 1.88 g cm−3), LAGP (ρLAGP = 3.56 g cm−3), and LLZO (ρLLZO = 5.07 g cm−3). Energy density variation curves with different ρ parameters were plotted while adjusting x, y, and z parameters. Here, the effect of RN/P was initially ignored and set to 1. To study the impact of sulfur loading on energy density, experiments were pre-set under conditions of 60 wt% sulfur content and 50 µm SSE thickness. Results show that sulfur loading exhibits an approximately linear relationship with energy density, and the influence of electrolyte density is minor. Under these conditions, when sulfur loading exceeds 8.6 mg cm−2, the energy density of the overall device reaches 500 Wh kg−1.

Subsequently, with parameters of 7 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and 50 µm SSE thickness, we investigated the effect of sulfur content, revealing a distinct nonlinear curve. This curve indicates that increasing the sulfur ratio significantly enhanced the energy density of pouch cells at lower sulfur ratios, but this trend gradually diminished with higher sulfur ratios. The influence of electrolyte density starts to become significant, and the gap in energy density widens with the increase of the sulfur ratio. This is because when the sulfur ratio is the independent variable and the sulfur loading is fixed, a high sulfur ratio reduces the mass of the cathode, thereby enhancing the impact of inactive components (especially the electrolyte). Analysis of energy density variations across different sulfur ratio ranges (from 10 wt% to 100 wt%) shows that, taking the LPS electrolyte curve as an example, the growth contribution ratios are 35.43% for sulfur ratios increasing from 10 wt% to 20 wt%, 33.26% from 20 wt% to 40 wt%, 15.88% from 40 wt% to 60 wt%, 9.30% from 60 wt% to 80 wt%, and 6.11% from 80 wt% to 100 wt%. Notably, increasing the sulfur ratio in the cathode significantly enhances energy density at low sulfur contents, with diminishing returns as the sulfur ratio increases. At 60 wt%, 84.59% of the total curve growth is achieved. Furthermore, a high sulfur ratio is accompanied by a reduction in the amount of ionic and electronic conductors within the electrode, which tends to cause poor interfacial contact, leading to increased impedance and even preventing sulfur from participating in electrochemical reactions. Thus, optimization strategies need to be carefully balanced. Maintaining the sulfur ratio at an appropriate level can not only increase the overall energy density but also avoid the regulation of internal interfaces and particle distribution in cathodes with excessively high sulfur ratios, thereby reducing manufacturing process costs.

In addition to the parametric influences of the sulfur active material, we have investigated the impact of the SSE, which represents one of the most critical components in SSLSB. Within the model, the SSE contained in the cathode has already been accounted for in the sulfur ratio. The SSE discussed herein refers specifically to the separator layer between the cathode and anode. Under the parameters of 7 mg cm−2 sulfur loading and 60 wt% sulfur ratio, the influence of SSE thickness ranging from 1 µm to 500 µm on energy density was investigated. Simulation results demonstrate that energy density exhibits a trend of rapid decline followed by a gentle decrease as the SSE thickness increases. The SSE density also significantly affects energy density within a wide range. When the thickness exceeds 40 µm, the energy density difference caused by electrolyte density variations becomes more pronounced. At LPS thicknesses of 200 µm, 100 µm, 50 µm, and 20 µm, the energy density shows enhancements of 69%, 119%, 157%, and 187%, respectively, compared to the 500 µm baseline. Thinner SSE thickness leads to more significant enhancement in energy density, achieving nearly a twofold improvement. This observation highlights the necessity of applying thin SSEs in high-energy-density SSLSBs. Finally, we estimated the volumetric energy density using reference values of x = 7, y = 60 wt%, and z = 50, assuming a uniform area for all components and a 1:1 mapping from sulfur mass ratio to volume ratio. The calculation used the volumetric specific capacities of sulfur (~1800 Ah L−1) and lithium metal (~2060 Ah L−1), yielding a volumetric energy density of 499 Wh L−1 under these conditions. This is because the thickness of the encapsulation material accounts for nearly half of the total cell thickness, leading to the lower volumetric energy density.

In practical applications, multi-layer pouch cells with stacked electrodes exhibit higher energy density compared to single-layer electrodes. To address this, we extended our model to evaluate the energy density variations in multi-layer solid-state Li−S pouch cells (Fig. 5c). In the extended model, we introduced the variable n to represent the number of layers, with the number of SSE layers serving as the reference for the pouch cell layer count. Additionally, all electrodes except the outermost ones were considered to have double-sided active material loading. The variations in each component for multi-layer solid-state Li−S pouch cells are summarized in Table 3.

Subsequently, the values of sulfur loading, sulfur ratio, SSE thickness, and RN/P were assumed to be 7 mg cm−2, 60 wt%, 500 µm, and 1, respectively. The data from Table 2 were then incorporated into Formula 1, yielding the simulation results presented in Fig. 5d. It is evident that a rapid growth region emerges during the process of increasing the number of layers. Specifically, the dual-layer pouch cell design exhibits a direct 24.38% improvement in energy density compared to the single-layer design, exceeding the target value of 500 Wh kg−1. Meanwhile, the quadruple-layer pouch cell design achieves a 41.64% enhancement in energy density over the single-layer configuration. Notably, the energy density variation from a single layer to four layers has reached 70.18% of that from a single layer to twenty layers. This indicates that excessive layer stacking is unnecessary for enhancing overall pouch cell energy density, while highlighting the necessity of multi-layer electrode designs to achieve energy densities of 500 Wh kg−1 and beyond.

In practical batteries, excess lithium metal is often required for cell assembly. We defined the parameter RN/P to represent the N/P ratio and investigated its impact on solid-state Li–S pouch cell performance. Based on the above results, taking LPS electrolyte as an example, we set parameters of 7 mg cm−2 sulfur loading, 60 wt% sulfur ratio, and 50 µm electrolyte thickness to investigate the influence of RN/P on battery energy density. As shown in Fig. 5e, the effect of RN/P on energy density is limited for both single-layer and multi-layer pouch cells. We attribute this to the fact that the ultra-high specific capacity of lithium metal results in the increased mass having a minimal impact on the cell. In the four-layer pouch cell model, the energy density with RN/P = 1.5 decreased by only 3.92% compared to that with RN/P = 1. Additionally, side reactions such as electrolyte decomposition during battery cycling also affect the practical energy density. These scenarios may either contribute extra capacity or cause capacity loss, but their common feature is that they do not change the overall mass of the cell. Therefore, to make the model more consistent with real-world conditions, we introduced a function f(c) to account for these effects. The result of this function can be directly incorporated into the energy density calculation formula as a variable multiplied by the numerator. The function f(c) can describe the deviation between the actual released capacity and the theoretically designed capacity during a complete discharge cycle, similar to the coulombic efficiency during battery cycling, which corrects capacity changes caused by side reactions. This function needs to be formulated based on the target battery system and fitted using extensive battery cases and data. Undoubtedly, if this function and model can directly predict capacity changes throughout the battery’s life cycle from the perspective of material design, it will provide valuable insights for the design of SSLSBs.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs43246-025-00918-9/MediaObjects/43246_2025_918_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-29 19:01:06.898429

Pre-owned electric cars and trucks in America are now almost as cheap as used gas-powered vehicles, on average, and are selling even faster, according to Cox Automotive.... What's more, sales of used EVs this year through June increased by 34% over the year-earlier period, while the market for new EVs only ticked up a tad.

Bloomberg goes on to note that while the end of a $7,500 federal incentive this month is expected to curtail already sluggish new EV sales in the U.S., the loss of a maximum $4,000 credit on used EVs isn't projected to have the same negative effect. That's because used EVs and used gas-powered vehicles are closing in on price parity. A used EV at $34,700, Bloomberg reported, is about even with a used gas-burner at $33,800. The EV isn't as old, nor is it likely to require as much maintenance going forward. What's not to like?

Fears about EV ownership — ranging from range anxiety to concerns about the potentially high cost of replacing batteries — have obviously been eased by the sheer number of vehicles that have hit the road, validating the technology. Real-world experience has enhanced the reputations of EVs, batteries are lasting longer than originally anticipated, and the prices have become right.

The appealing stickers on used EVs are of course not all a positive story. These vehicles are aggressively depreciating, establishing a buyer's market for those interested in taking the plunge. Bloomberg cites a Ford Mustang Mach-E GT buyer who picked up a 2024 model for $33,000. Original price? $55,000. Of course, that degree of decline means that in the used market, complaints about EV affordability are being resolved. In fact, it almost makes more sense to hold off on a new EV purchase because, as Bloomberg reports, a lot of vehicles that were first leased three years ago are now hitting the market.

There is no used EV market without a new EV market, so a natural question to ask in the face of this relatively optimistic news is, ""Will a collapse in sales and leasing of new EVs undermine growing used sales?"" That will be something to keep an eye on over the next year or two. One might expect a reduced supply of new EVs coming into the used-car market to bid up prices, reversing or stalling the trend that Bloomberg noticed, sending buyers back to gas vehicles even if they want to give EVs a shot.

One other factor to take into account is that although the situation for new and used EVs is better than it was a decade ago, they still occupy a niche. Total EV sales in 2024 made up about 9% of the U.S. new-car market, according to Kelley Blue Book. New cars remain overwhelmingly powered by petrol, as do used cars.

Conclusion EPA’s actions mark a notable reorientation of NSR permitting policy.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) recently announced two significant reforms to its New Source Review (NSR) permitting program for major sources of air emissions. First, EPA is developing a rule to revise its interpretation of the definition of “begin actual construction” under NSR regulations, with a proposal expected in 2026. Second, EPA has rescinded its long-standing “Reactivation Policy” through a memorandum issued by Administrator Lee Zeldin on 18 September 2025 (Zeldin Memo). These actions mark shifts in the regulatory landscape for project development and facility restarts under the Clean Air Act (CAA).

These permitting reforms arrive at a moment when energy demand, particularly due to artificial intelligence (AI), data center growth, and electrification, is projected to surge sharply over the next five years. US data center power demand alone is projected to grow from 25 GW in 2024 to over 80 GW by 2030.1 Given this backdrop, the timing of EPA’s shifts on air permitting is likely to have outsized implications for developers of fossil-fuel-fired power plants, large industrial and manufacturing facilities, electric utilities, state and local permitting authorities, and community stakeholders.

Preconstruction Rule: Redefining “Begin Actual Construction”

Under the CAA, new or modified major stationary sources must obtain an NSR permit before it may “begin actual construction.”2 EPA’s regulations define “begin actual construction” as “the initiation of physical on-site construction activities on an emissions unit…include[ing], but not limited to, installation of building supports and foundations, laying underground pipework and construction of permanent storage structures.”3 Historically, EPA has sometimes applied this definition broadly, most notably in its 1986 “Reich memo,” which implied that construction of structures accommodating emissions units could be considered “actual construction,” even if no emissions units were installed.4

In contrast, a 2020 draft guidance issued during the previous Trump administration expressed a narrower interpretation, emphasizing that NSR permitting should be triggered only by physical on-site construction of emissions units themselves, not general building or site preparation.5

In September 2025, EPA responded to a request from the Maricopa County Air Quality Department regarding a proposed semiconductor facility.6 The developer sought to construct the “core and shell” of a building—its foundation, steel superstructure, and external walls—prior to receiving an NSR permit. EPA concluded that construction of structures not specifically configured for emissions units did not constitute “begin actual construction” and could proceed without an NSR permit, provided no emission units, foundations for such units, or related piping were installed.

EPA emphasized that the Reich memo reflected an overly expansive interpretation and confirmed that the agency intends to clarify its position through rulemaking. Specifically, EPA plans to propose and finalize a rule in 2026 to revise the regulatory definition of “begin actual construction.”7 Until then, EPA will continue to apply its interpretation on a case-by-case basis, guided by the principle that nonemissions-unit construction does not, on its own, trigger NSR requirements. EPA has not identified any specific criteria it will rely on for its case-by-case analysis, which could raise the possibility that environmental groups and other nongovernmental organizations could seek to halt construction that they claim is proceeding without an NSR permit based on the prior EPA interpretation.

EPA’s rulemaking is expected to bring clarity to project developers who often seek to advance construction schedules while awaiting permit decisions. A narrower definition of “begin actual construction” may enable developers to undertake certain preparatory building activities without risking an NSR violation. However, EPA has emphasized that construction activities undertaken before a permit is issued remain “at risk,” as permitting authorities retain discretion to deny permits or require additional controls.

Rescission of the Reactivation Policy

Since the late 1970s, EPA has applied its “Reactivation Policy” to idle facilities, presuming that sources shut down for two or more years were permanently closed and thus subject to NSR permitting as newly constructed sources if restarted. Facility owners could rebut this presumption by showing intent to restart at the time of shutdown, based on factors such as maintenance activities, operator statements, and the cost of reactivation. The policy was most comprehensively articulated in the 1999 Monroe Order.8

In Port Hamilton Refining and Transportation LLP v. EPA, 87 F.4th 188 (3d Cir. 2023), the Third Circuit rejected EPA’s application of the Reactivation Policy to require a prevention of significant deterioration (PSD) permit before restarting a long-idle refinery in the US Virgin Islands. The court held that the CAA unambiguously limits NSR applicability to construction of new sources and modifications of existing sources, not mere operation. The decision followed the court’s earlier reasoning in EME Homer City Generation that the PSD program does not extend to “operation.”9

Administrator Zeldin’s 18 September 2025 memorandum formally rescinds the Reactivation Policy nationwide.10 EPA now recognizes that restarting an idle facility does not constitute “construction” under the CAA and will not, by itself, trigger NSR permitting requirements. Instead, EPA will apply NSR only where a restart involves a “major modification”—a physical or operational change that increases emissions above regulatory thresholds.

The Zeldin Memo also stresses the importance of nationwide consistency and makes clear that EPA regional offices should no longer apply the Reactivation Policy in permitting or enforcement. State and local agencies are encouraged to align with this approach, though stricter state laws may still apply.

The rescission provides significant regulatory relief for operators of idle facilities, eliminating a policy that EPA itself acknowledged was subjective and inconsistently applied. Owners of facilities seeking to restart operations will no longer face automatic NSR permitting obligations absent a qualifying modification. Nevertheless, sources must still carefully evaluate whether changes undertaken in connection with a restart amount to a major modification that triggers NSR.

Conclusion

EPA’s actions mark a notable reorientation of NSR permitting policy. The forthcoming preconstruction rule promises greater clarity on when physical construction may begin without an NSR permit, while the rescission of the Reactivation Policy resolves long-standing legal and practical uncertainties for idled facilities. Together, these reforms could expedite project development timelines and facilitate restarts of dormant sources, though state permitting authorities—which may have different views and interests than EPA—retain broad discretion to enforce NSR requirements where modifications increase emissions. As data center capacity, AI model training, digitalization, and electrification drive electricity demand upward, clarity around when construction triggers permitting, and when restarting a source requires NSR, will matter more than ever.",https://files.klgates.com/images/_wbmanaged/elnr_wbc_socialimage_372384.png,N,,2025-09-29 16:03:01.727280

On Sunday, the Motley Fool news service published a story with the headline: Could Buying Wolfspeed Today Set You Up for Life? A possible answer: $1,000 worth of Wolfspeed shares at Friday’s close would have been worth $18,000 at Monday’s high.

Trading was halted for Wolfspeed at 11:59 a.m. with shares trading at $14.97, up $13.76 or 1,137%. On Monday, Wolfspeed filed an SEC Form 25, which is a document used to delist its securities. An SEC spokesperson declined to explain the trading halt.

A company filing a Form 25 must issue a press release and post notice on its website of its intention to delist no fewer than 10 days before delisting becomes effective under Rule 12d2-2. Wolfspeed’s website does not have such a press release.

Company officials did not immediately return a request for comment.

The Motley Fool report noted that some speculative investors believe that “the worst-case scenario” is already priced in for the bankrupt company. The story notes Wolfspeed’s strategy of replacing ordinary silicon with silicon carbide might be a winning formula since the “carbon-toughened version of the simple material can be used for higher voltage applications like solar inverters and electric vehicles, since it tolerates higher levels of heat. It’s also just more power-efficient.”

More than 95% of the value of Wolfspeed stock was expected to be eliminated through the bankruptcy process, along with significant reductions in debt held by company creditors. But some investors in the company’s shares obviously believe the emerging company has good prospects.

It is building a $5 billion manufacturing plant near Siler City, aided by federal subsidies approved during the Biden administration. The goal was to promote U.S. chip manufacturing, but the Trump administration has criticized many such projects originating during Biden’s term.

Barring a last-minute deal, government funding will expire on Wednesday, launching a shutdown and possible reductions in force across federal agencies. President Donald Trump plans to meet with the top four congressional leaders this afternoon to discuss a funding extension.

The White House Office of Management and Budget directed agencies last week to consider RIFs as part of their shutdown “lapse plans.” These RIFs would be in addition to standard furloughs and should target programs that do not have alternative sources of funding and are “not consistent with the president’s priorities,” the OMB memo states. In a statement last week, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) expressed doubt that any such RIFs would be permanent. “These unnecessary firings will either be overturned in court or the administration will end up hiring the workers back, just like they did as recently as today,” he said.

OMB earlier directed agencies to submit updated lapse plans by Aug. 1, but many do not appear to be available online yet. The National Science Foundation’s plan from 2023 would have furloughed nearly 80% of its employees, while NASA’s plan would have furloughed more than 90%.

If Congress passes a continuing resolution to avoid a shutdown, interim NASA Administrator Sean Duffy has directed the agency to “work toward” the spending levels in the House’s funding proposal for fiscal year 2026, according to Ars Technica. That proposal would cut NASA’s Science Mission Directorate by 18%, compared to the 50% cut in the president’s budget request and near-level funding in the Senate proposal. Meanwhile, a report released today by Sen. Maria Cantwell (D-WA) states that NASA has been implementing cuts from the president’s budget request since early summer, disregarding congressional intent concerning funding levels.

Scientific societies protest grantmaking executive order

More than 50 scientific and medical organizations urged Congress last week to block key elements of the grantmaking executive order President Donald Trump issued in August, arguing that it will increase politicization of federally funded research and add inefficiencies to the grantmaking process. “The EO does not advance the administration’s goal of implementing Gold Standard Science,” reads the letter sent by the societies. (Multiple AIP Member Societies signed the letter.)

The letter asks Congress to ensure that independent peer review “remains the cornerstone” of scientific grantmaking, “such that the most meritorious proposals are funded in this and all future administrations.” Trump’s order states that agencies may use peer review methods for grantmaking on an advisory basis but places ultimate decision authority in the hands of political appointees. The letter also asks Congress to reject the order’s requirement that science agencies permit “termination for convenience” in all grants, warning of a chilling effect for research that could be perceived as controversial. Finally, the letter calls on Congress to block the order’s directive for agencies to prioritize research proposals from academic institutions with the lowest indirect cost rates.

Jacob Helberg to be under secretary of state for economic growth, energy, and the environment; and

Thomas DiNanno to be under secretary of state for arms control and international security.

Senate Republicans confirmed the first bloc of nearly 50 nominees two weeks ago after modifying the chamber’s rules to allow confirmations in groups instead of one at a time. Democrats had been using the old rules to severely slow down votes on Trump’s nominees. Some of the nominees in the second bloc had advanced out of committee more than four months ago.

In fact, policymakers should increase park entrance fees to more closely reflect the demand to visit.
As a result, National Parks are experiencing some major problems such as deferred maintenance, overcrowding, worse environmental outcomes, and underfunding.
More accurate pricing for entrance fees can help address these issues and more.","September 27 was National Public Lands Day. To celebrate, the National Park Service (NPS) advertised free admission to national parks that normally charge an entrance fee. Most NPS sites offer free admission every day of the year.

A more appropriate term for the NPS to use would be “unpriced,” because while visitors didn’t have to pay an entrance fee on Saturday, the money required for NPS operations still came from somewhere. Theoretically, the money lost from entrance fees on National Public Lands Day was made up for through other sources, such as congressional appropriations.

But it’s not just on September 27 when most of the NPS’s funding comes from Congress. In FY25, their total request from all funding sources was $4.81 billion, of which $3.6 billion was discretionary. In 2024, the estimated revenue from recreation fees was only $355.5 million. Significant funding also comes from other sources like the Land and Water Conservation Fund and donations.

Some might say that this seems right; the people of the United States have decided (through their representatives) that we want to have national parks. So, it’s fair that all Americans pay for the NPS’s budget through tax dollars.

Yet some Americans will never visit a national park but still pay roughly $20 per year, on average, toward the NPS budget through taxes. Proponents argue that non-visitors should contribute to the NPS budget because they still receive some utility from just knowing that the national parks exist, but whatever utility that may be is trivial in comparison to that of a park visitor.

NPS has tried to address these problems by charging entrance fees and other types of user fees at some of the most popular sites. For example, the most expensive parks to enter, such as Yellowstone and the Grand Canyon, charge an entrance fee of $35 per car per week, which is still an extremely cheap price.

In fact, policymakers should increase park entrance fees to more closely reflect the demand to visit. Current prices haven’t even kept up with inflation. As a result, National Parks are experiencing some major problems such as deferred maintenance, overcrowding, worse environmental outcomes, and underfunding. More accurate pricing for entrance fees can help address these issues and more.

National parks have often been called “America’s best idea.” If Americans truly feel this way, then park visitors should be expected to pay a reasonable user fee.",https://cei.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/GettyImages-1370171185-1-1200x628.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:02:57.791282

The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition formed to change that.
Meeting people where they are “The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition works because it blends trusted, high-quality tax preparation with the deep community connections of our outreach partners,” said Matt Hetherwick of Accounting Aid Society.
“Congress of Communities participates in the tax coalition because the residents we serve need access to affordable tax preparation and clear information about all the benefits available to them,” said Amanda Holiday.
By centering trust, access, and community leadership, the Detroit Tax Credit Coalition is helping families file for the future—and keep more of what they’ve earned.","When tax season arrives in Detroit, the stakes are high. More than 40% of the city’s children live in poverty, and the tax code is one of the surest, fastest tools for putting money into family budgets. Refundable credits like the Earned Income Tax Credit (EITC) and the Child Tax Credit (CTC) can return thousands of dollars to eligible households—often enough to pay down debt, purchase a reliable vehicle, or take a first step toward homeownership. Yet every year, Detroit families leave an estimated $80 million in tax credits unclaimed—too often because filing feels confusing, costly, or out of reach.

The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition formed to change that. Launched in 2021 with support from a group of funders led by The Kresge Foundation, the coalition’s mission is straightforward: make it easy, trustworthy, and free for low- and moderate-income Detroiters to file taxes and receive every credit they’ve earned.

A coalition built on trust—and results

The Coalition builds on a 2017 effort spearheaded by Detroit Mayor Mike Duggan’s office. Today, United Way for Southeastern Michigan facilitates the steering committee alongside the City of Detroit and two tax preparation leaders—Accounting Aid Society and Wayne Metropolitan Community Action Agency—while a network of community organizations carries the message deep into neighborhoods.

“The key to increasing the number of Detroiters who file taxes and claim their credits comes down to three things: awareness, trust, and access,” said Megan Thibos of United Way. “Our central website, GetTheTaxFacts.org, offers clear information and a unified scheduling tool, and our VITA partners operate dozens of convenient sites so help is close to home.”

An evaluation by the University of Michigan estimated that in 2021–2022, the coalition helped Detroit families claim more than $6.5 million in Child Tax Credits that otherwise would have been missed—evidence that coordinated outreach and high-quality preparation can move real dollars into household budgets.

Meeting people where they are

“The Detroit Tax Credit Coalition works because it blends trusted, high-quality tax preparation with the deep community connections of our outreach partners,” said Matt Hetherwick of Accounting Aid Society. “We meet people where they are—geographically and in terms of trust—so no one is left behind because they didn’t know help was available or feared they couldn’t afford it.”

Wayne Metro’s Ricky Palitti underscored the impact: “Partnership makes it possible to reach as many people as we do. The result is real impact, saving families hundreds of dollars each in filing fees and putting more money back into household budgets where it’s needed most.”

For neighborhood partners, participation is about aligning with community priorities. “Congress of Communities participates in the tax coalition because the residents we serve need access to affordable tax preparation and clear information about all the benefits available to them,” said Amanda Holiday.

In HOPE Village, Executive Director Jeffrey Jones said tax help is core to the mission: “This work is a vital resource to our community. We exist to mitigate disparities in wealth, health, and education—and the coalition’s approach advances that priority.”

Breaking down barriers to benefits

Access is often blocked by multiple, overlapping hurdles. “Families may not know what they can claim, they may mistrust financial systems, or they may face practical challenges like transportation, language, or technology,” said Hetherwick. “We address this by offering free, trusted services in community settings; training outreach partners to share accurate, culturally relevant information; and providing in-person, drop-off, and virtual options. We invest in long-term relationships so residents know there’s reliable help year after year.”

Wayne Metro complements tax services with wrap-around support. “Our agency helps clients tackle other life needs that can stand between them and the credits they’ve earned,” said Program Manager Tameka Gray.

United Way targets common misconceptions. “Some families mistakenly believe they aren’t eligible,” Thibos said. “For example, grandparents raising grandchildren may qualify even when the children are not biological. We’ve added a trilingual flyer in English, Spanish, and Arabic, made our website and scheduling tool available in Spanish, provide 1:1 navigation for issues like IDs, and are exploring transportation support next year.”

Reaching the hardest to reach

The coalition’s outreach strategy is layered and persistent. “Mass outreach through text messaging and targeted digital ads casts a wide net and makes it easy to click straight through to schedule,” said Thibos. “Community-based outreach kick-starts word-of-mouth networks. And for those who are hesitant or face barriers, our team offers personalized navigation.”

Congress of Communities focuses on multiple touchpoints. “Research shows people need to see information several times before acting,” Holiday said. “We set up at community events, send texts and emails to members, and use social media—often handing out free books to encourage conversations and promote literacy at the same time.”

For HOPE Village, accessibility and presence are the rule. “Be accessible and show up in a variety of places,” said Jones. “That’s how trust is built.”

Virtual access and language capacity round out the approach. “Virtual appointments have been a game-changer, and our bilingual team members help ensure those whose first language isn’t English receive the assistance they need,” said Palitti.

Policy progress—and what’s next

The coalition pairs on-the-ground services with policy advocacy. Recent progress includes the 2023 expansion of the Michigan EITC, which quintuples the state credit and puts millions more dollars into family budgets. Even amid a volatile policy environment—with recent federal changes increasing the Child Tax Credit by $200 per child alongside cuts to SNAP and Medicaid—partners remain focused on expanding eligibility and benefit amounts for both the EITC and CTC over time.

Implementation work continues year-round: strengthening existing outreach partnerships, building new ones, expanding tax prep capacity, and learning from data to improve resident experience. The invitation is open. If your organization would like to collaborate, email taxes@unitedwaysem.org. To learn more or schedule a free appointment, visit GetTheTaxFacts.org.

Why it matters

When families file, children thrive. A maximum EITC can exceed $10,000 (state and federal combined), with an additional $1,700–$2,200 per child from the CTC—dollars that stabilize households and unlock opportunity. By centering trust, access, and community leadership, the Detroit Tax Credit Coalition is helping families file for the future—and keep more of what they’ve earned.

The aluminium, which is sourced through a collaboration with Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian metal producer, is utilised in the construction of Mercedes-Benz’s new electric CLA model.
Gunnar Guthenke, vice president of Mercedes-Benz’ procurement and supplier quality, said: “There are of course extra costs from using an especially low-carbon steel or aluminium.
The companies chose not to disclose a detailed cost analysis but stated that the production of the new CLA resulted in a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the previous non-electric model.

The initiative is part of the luxury automaker’s broader strategy to decarbonise its operations.

The aluminium, which is sourced through a collaboration with Norsk Hydro, a Norwegian metal producer, is utilised in the construction of Mercedes-Benz’s new electric CLA model.

Executives of both companies told the news agency that the collaboration serves as an illustration of how premium consumer goods manufacturers are prepared to incur higher costs for raw materials to achieve a greener image.

Gunnar Guthenke, vice president of Mercedes-Benz’ procurement and supplier quality, said: “There are of course extra costs from using an especially low-carbon steel or aluminium.

“Sustainability and desirable products, such as the ones we produce, simply go hand in hand,” he said.

The companies chose not to disclose a detailed cost analysis but stated that the production of the new CLA resulted in a 40% reduction in CO2 emissions compared to the previous non-electric model.

Norsk Hydro’s CEO Eivind Kallevik said decarbonising supply chains can incur considerable costs, yet by establishing partnerships, the financial burden can be shared, ensuring it does not fall solely on manufacturers or consumers.

Moreover, he remarked that the premium on the metal’s price is not discouraging buyers, even in the recent challenging market for aluminium, which has been experiencing subdued economic growth.

The aluminium produced for Mercedes-Benz at Norsk Hydro’s Aardal plant in Norway is associated with 3 kg of CO2 emissions per kilogram of aluminium, significantly lower than the global average of 16.7 kg, the companies added.

This reduction is partly achieved by incorporating 25% aluminium scrap into the mix, which decreases the need for primary metal produced through “energy-intensive” methods.

As part of its “Ambition 2039” strategy, Mercedes-Benz said that it aims to incorporate aluminium with a 90% reduced carbon footprint compared to the European average into its vehicles by 2030.

The federal EV tax credit was implemented in 2022 under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and since then sales of EVs have been steadily increasing.
Data from Argonne National Laboratory tracking EV sales found that EV sales in the U.S. for August 2025 were up 14.7 percent over the same time period in 2024.
Used EV sales were up nearly 60 percent in August 2025 over the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive shows.
Karl Brauer, the executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press that EV sales are ""going to crater"" once the incentive wraps.","Car buyers are rushing out to buy electric vehicles as the clock ticks down on a tax credit program allowing them to save thousands on new and used cars.

The federal EV (electric vehicle) tax credit is ending on September 30. The program, which allows EV buyers to claim a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a new vehicle and up to $4,000 on a used vehicle, was originally slated to last until 2032, but President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" is bringing it to a close years earlier.

According to an analysis from the Detroit Free Press using data collected from Cars.com, approximately half of buyers considering an EV purchase are accelerating their purchases to try to get them in before the deadline.

The website told the outlet that demand for new EVs on its site are up by 33 percent when compared to a year ago, and up 22 percent for used EVs over the same time period.

In August, Cars.com conducted a survey asking its customers what was motivating them to buy EVs, and nearly 75 percent of the 950 respondents said that the federal tax credit was a ""major or contributing factor"" to their decision.

The federal EV tax credit was implemented in 2022 under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and since then sales of EVs have been steadily increasing.

Data from Argonne National Laboratory tracking EV sales found that EV sales in the U.S. for August 2025 were up 14.7 percent over the same time period in 2024. In 2024, EV sales were up 7 percent over the number of vehicles sold in 2023.

The laboratory found that, cumulatively, more than 7.3 million plug-in EVs have been sold in the U.S. since 2010.

Used EV sales were up nearly 60 percent in August 2025 over the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive shows.

""As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,"" Cox said in its report.

Some experts predict that interest in EVs will come to a halt once the tax incentive ends on the 30th.

Karl Brauer, the executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press that EV sales are ""going to crater"" once the incentive wraps.

He predicted that there will be ""almost no buyers"" after the 30th because EVs are typically priced higher than gasoline vehicles.

Tim Horvick, the owner of San Tan Ford dealership in Phoenix, told CBS News that the end of the credit is a concern for him, and admitted ""it could be challenging"" to move EVs once the incentive expires.

Cars.com's Detroit bureau chief had a different take, telling the Detroit Free Press that even after the deadline, buyers will still be able to take advantage of incentives offered by state and local governments. He added that car manufacturers like Nissan, Chevrolet, and Hyundai are already planning to roll our new, lower-priced EV models.

In fact, lower prices for EVs, at least in the immediate aftermath of the tax credit expiration, may be on the way. Assuming there is a significant drop-off in EV sales beginning in October, car manufacturers who produce EVs will have to consider how to price their supply of the vehicles amid a sharp decline in demand.

In 2019, and an EV tax credit for Tesla and General Motors ended, both car companies responded to the decrease in demand by cutting prices, according to CNN.

If prices are cut, it won't likely stay that way longterm. Manufacturers are likely going to cut back on the production of EV models to ease the supply pressure to lower their prices.

While some analysts are more pessimistic than others about the fate of EVs, a survey by Cox found that, for more than half of prospective EV buyers, saving money with a tax credit isn't their main interest in purchasing an EV.

According to Cox, 65 percent of those prospective buyers said they planned to buy regardless of the tax credit, and only 20 percent said they would instead choose to buy a gas or hybrid vehicle.

The same survey found the respondents still hoping to buy an EV were more concerned with the fuel and maintenance savings, vehicle performance, and with environmental concerns than their potential savings via a tax credit.",https://static.the-independent.com/2025/07/24/11/54/GettyImages-1392610598.jpeg?width=1200&height=800&crop=1200:800,N,,2025-09-29 15:03:36.024951

If you’ve been to a dealership the past couple of months, you may have noticed more drivers expressing interest in electric vehicles (EVs). One reason is that the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill means that the federal EV tax credit will expire at the end of September.

For those looking to buy an EV, there are several things to consider regarding eligibility and finances.

An Increase in Sales

“EV inventory is selling fast,” said Justin Fischer, automotive expert at CarEdge. “As buyers rush to take advantage of federal incentives before they expire, EVs are selling faster than gas-powered models for the first time ever.”

According to Fischer, CarEdge Insights shows a 62-day supply of new EVs in September and a 37-day supply of used EVs. Per Fischer, once incentives expire on Sept. 30, don’t expect big manufacturer incentives until December’s year-end sales.

Buyers: What To Know Now

Here are three things every buyer should know now with the credit ending.

The federal tax credit for new and used EVs ends after Sept. 30. As noted by Kiplinger, you must purchase before the deadline to claim up to $7,500 for a new EV or $4,000 for a used vehicle.

Eligibility rules still apply. In fact, Fischer said many EVs don’t qualify, and recommended buyers check the government’s fuel economy website to learn more. This may be especially helpful given that there’s been a great deal of confusion over the federal tax credits, who qualifies and how exactly they work.

Do your homework. If you’re ready to buy an EV, make sure you know what you qualify for and whether your finances are in good enough shape to afford a vehicle. Keep in mind that some state and local incentives might remain in effect even with the federal credits ending.",https://cdn.gobankingrates.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/line-of-electric-vehicles-at-charging-stations_iStock-1393199281.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:20.446507

From the cliffs of Sloan Canyon to the Ruby mountains, our public lands are more than scenery.
But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us.
Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.
The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.","On Saturday, folks across the country celebrated Public Lands Day. Each year, Public Lands Day is a chance to celebrate the open spaces that make Nevada extraordinary. From the cliffs of Sloan Canyon to the Ruby mountains, our public lands are more than scenery. They provide clean water and wildlife habitat, preserve Indigenous cultural sites and Indigenous homelands, drive Nevada’s outdoor recreation economy, and offer places for families to hike, camp, hunt, and recharge.

But while we celebrate, it’s important to remember that the biggest threats to Nevada’s public lands aren’t behind us. They’re moving through Congress right now, and if passed, they could forever reshape our landscapes.

Two pieces of legislation in particular deserve Nevadans’ attention: the Southern Nevada Economic Development and Conservation Act (SNEDCA), which was scheduled to be heard in Congress on October 1 but has since been postponed, and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, which is advancing rapidly on Capitol Hill, having just passed out of House Natural Resources on September 17. Together, these bills would sell off and industrialize Nevada’s public lands on a scale we haven’t seen in years.

SNEDCA is being promoted as a balanced bill that conserves lands while allowing for development. Supporters point to provisions that designate certain areas as protected. But Nevadans should look closely. At its core, this bill is a sweeping public lands sell-off.

SNEDCA would open tens of thousands of acres in Clark County for disposal, turning our desert into a land bank for real estate developers. SNEDCA doubles down on a sprawl approach to development at a time when we desperately need smarter planning, water conservation, and genuine climate resilience. We know that sprawl raises costs for working class folks, both directly and indirectly, and detracts from mass transportation services. This bill fails to guarantee any of the land proposed for disposal would actually be used for affordable housing.

The consequences are not abstract. Development on this scale fragments wildlife habitat, threatens desert tortoise populations, and paves over landscapes that recharge groundwater and absorb carbon. Once developed, these lands cannot be restored. We lose them forever.

This is exactly the type of land sell-off Nevadans pushed back against during the federal reconciliation process, when proposals to liquidate Nevada’s deserts raised alarm bells statewide, and indeed, across the country.

At the same time, another bill moving through Congress threatens Nevada’s lands in a different way. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would fundamentally change how mining companies are allowed to operate on public lands.

Under current law, mining companies must demonstrate a valid mineral discovery before they can use federal land for waste dumps or processing. This safeguard ensures that sensitive lands are not simply commandeered for industrial use without scrutiny. The Mining Regulatory Clarity Act would gut that requirement, allowing companies to dump toxic mine waste on public lands without ever proving that valuable minerals exist.

For Nevada, home to more mining activity than any other state, the impact would be staggering. The result would be more toxic pollution on public land, more scarred landscapes, and less accountability for corporations.

Taken together, SNEDCA and the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act represent a one-two punch: one bill sells off Nevada’s lands to developers, while the other makes it easier for mining companies to pollute what’s left. Both bills prioritize corporate profits over community well-being, over Tribal sovereignty, and over the conservation values Nevadans have fought to uphold for decades.

We know what happens when we fail to protect public lands. Red Rock Canyon, Avi Kwa Ame, and Gold Butte did not gain protections by accident. They were defended through years of community organizing, advocacy, and public outcry. Tribes, conservationists, recreationists, and everyday residents came together to demand that these landscapes be safeguarded for future generations. If Congress approves SNEDCA or the Mining Regulatory Clarity Act, we risk unraveling decades of progress in a matter of months.

It doesn’t have to be this way. Nevada can pursue genuine conservation and responsible economic development without selling out our public lands. We should be expanding access to parks and trails, supporting Tribal stewardship of ancestral lands, and protecting biodiversity in the face of climate change. We should not be doubling down on extractive and short-sighted policies.

The choice before us is clear. We can allow corporations and their lobbyists to dictate the future of Nevada’s open spaces, or we can stand up for the values that make our state unique.",https://nevadacurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/uscapitoljune302025ashleymurray-scaled-e1759166037351-2048x1225.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:04.102934

“But Massachusetts has an opportunity to accelerate the deployment of solar in the next five years in spite of those attacks,” Robertson said at a roundtable in Boston. “Massachusetts was an early leader in solar, but we ran into growing pains that brought the industry to a virtual standstill for several years.”

Tax incentives that have saved thousands of dollars for people in the U.S. looking to install home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations like solar panels, or to purchase electric vehicles are set to expire at the end of this year.

The federal residential clean energy tax credit is slated to expire at the end of this year, and the clean energy investment tax credit is scheduled to end after 2027.

Healey said the tax credits have “helped make the electricity we need fast and affordable.”

“The (Trump) administration has slowed down permitting timelines and created other political roadblocks to energy development. They’ve imposed tariffs on materials that are needed for this industry and other industries, including gas turbines to transformers to steel, and this is going to contribute to delays and also to the raising of costs,” the first-term Democrat said.

Industry leaders said elected officials in Massachusetts should reform clean energy permitting to speed up solar projects.

Bronte Payne, senior manager for policy at Sunrun, a renewable energy company, said lawmakers should establish automated, instant permitting in cities and towns where projects are code-compliant and meet safety requirements.

“Automated permitting helps more solar and storage get installed faster and reduces the cost,” Payne told Healey and her deputies.

Healey signed legislation in November that she argued accelerated clean energy development by reforming siting and permitting processes.

The law established a 12-month deadline for municipal permitting for wind, solar, storage, and electric infrastructure. It also required municipalities to issue a single permit at the end of their process.

Robertson said there is no other state in the country where industry officials “can say that a project that we start permitting in 2026 can know that it will have a permit.”

“There is an increasing number of towns where solar and storage is effectively off limits. Your administration’s leadership has broken through this barrier to establish a new system with a standardized, data-driven approach to solar siting and much more predictability on timelines and outcomes,” Robertson said to Healey.

Nick d’Arbeloff, a senior member of the commercial team at ReVision Energy, said solar energy delivered 5,000 megawatts of energy, or $8.2 million in savings for ratepayers in Massachusetts, on June 24, the hottest day of the summer.

Massachusetts has about 5.8 gigawatts of installed solar, d’Arbeloff said.

“Supporting residential solar is essential for affordability, equity, and our broader clean energy goals,” he said.

TotalEnergies is selling 50% of a portfolio of combined 1.4 gigawatts (GW) installed capacity in a transaction valuing said portfolio at $1.25 billion, the supermajor said on Monday.

Thanks to the transactions and the bank refinancing currently being finalized, TotalEnergies will receive a total of $950 million at closing of the sale.

Included in the sale are six utility-scale solar assets with a combined capacity of 1.3 GW, and 41 distributed generation assets totaling 140 MW, primarily situated in the United States. The electricity production of these projects has either been sold to third parties or will be commercialized by TotalEnergies, the French major said.

Unlike other European majors such as BP and Shell, which have outright reduced spending on renewables, TotalEnergies has a strategy to reach a

12% profitability target for its Integrated Power business. This means that TotalEnergies would typically divest up to 50% of its renewable assets once they reach commercial operation date (COD) and are de-risked, which allows it “to maximize asset value and manage risks.”

“Aligned with our strategy, this transaction unlocks value from newly commissioned assets and further strengthens the profitability of our Integrated Power business,” said Stéphane Michel, President of Gas, Renewables & Power at TotalEnergies.

In the United States, solar projects could see significant slowdown going forward, due to the Trump Administration’s policies, the industry warned earlier this month.

In a report hailing the installation of close to 18 GW in new capacity—including battery storage—over the first half of the year, which constituted 82% of all new capacity additions, the Solar Energy Industries Association also warned that the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has substantially changed the medium-term outlook.

The U.S. solar industry risks losing 44 GW in new capacity additions by 2030 as a result of the current Administration’s policies, SEIA said.

Residential electricity prices rose by 25% during his term in office. States across the country are looking at ways to stop or reduce the increases. But it may be too little too late, as reliable coal plants are being shut down and replaced by costly new systems that magnify the demand growth issues.

PJM Auction Prices Hit Record Highs

PJM Interconnection, the regional grid operator of 13 states, had its capacity auction clear at record-setting prices as electricity demand is rapidly increasing while supply growth is limited. Growing supply is made more difficult by significant delays in connecting new generation projects to the PJM grid and the retirement of coal power plants. PJM has warned states against prematurely retiring power plants and replacing them with solar and wind units. The North American Electric Reliability Corporation has also stressed in its 2025 Summer Reliability Assessment that solar and battery additions have made the resource mix less flexible and more variable.

The 13 states in the PJM Interconnection recently met to discuss the situation, as states are seeing electricity prices increase. For example, this year, energy prices increased across Pennsylvania and New Jersey, with PPL Electric getting a 16% rate increase and JCP&L getting a 19.6% increase. According to 69WFMZ, in Pennsylvania, regulated utilities like PPL Electric are prohibited from owning electric generation. Its electricity is purchased through a series of competitive auctions through PJM.

Electricity Price Increases Enter into the New Jersey Governor’s Race

Beginning in June, New Jersey residents were to receive a 20% increase in electricity prices, resulting mainly from the state’s most recent capacity auction. According to Consumer Energy Solutions, every year in February, the New Jersey Board of Public Utilities (BPU) holds an energy auction that sets the wholesale electricity price that NJ customers pay if they have not chosen a third-party energy supplier. The auction is held yearly to help lessen price volatility. The auction prices apply to about one-third of the state’s supply each year, as they are combined with prices from the previous two years’ auctions. Similar to PJM’s capacity auction, the NJ auction received record-high prices as the state closed its last two coal-fired plants in 2022 and divested its fossil-fuel generating stations in 2023.

NJ state policies, however, have exacerbated the supply problem. Governor Phil Murphy set a goal to make New Jersey’s electricity production fossil-free by 2035 and instituted other decarbonization policies, such as phasing out fossil-fuel plants. New Jersey is also a net importer of electricity from other PJM states, as it does not produce enough electricity in-state to meet demand, forcing it to buy expensive power from the regional grid. According to Gabriella Hoffman in RealClear Energy, it is estimated that NJ Governor Murphy’s green transition plan to wind, solar, battery power, and electric vehicles, if fully implemented, would result in $1.4 trillion in lost income, or $140,000 per average New Jerseyan over the next 25 years. Some family energy bills in New Jersey have exceeded $500 per month.

Via CFACT, while Jack Ciattarelli, the Republican challenger for NJ Governor, wants to overturn Murphy’s green energy mandate, ban expensive offshore wind, diversify the state’s energy sources to include nuclear and coal, and withdraw New Jersey from a multistate carbon tax plan known as the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative, the Democratic candidate, Mikie Sherrill wants to continue with the failed policies of Governor Murphy to the detriment of affordable energy. And, to gain an edge, she is twisting the words of Mr. Ciattarelli regarding tax increases.

Via Hoffman, the 20% rate hike that was supposed to take effect in June was delayed until September 30, after the height of the air conditioning season. On August 14, the BPU also announced a $100 Residential Universal Bill Credit to help lower bills in September and October, essentially disguising the cost of the new utility bills until after the NJ Governor’s election in November.

Nevada Public Utility Commission Approves New Charges

Some Nevada residents are expecting higher utility costs due to the state’s Public Utility Commission’s approval of a demand charge and net metering changes for NV Energy, a major Nevada utility serving over 1.4 million customers. In April 2026, NV Energy will add a monthly demand charge of $20 based on an average customer’s bill and will make changes to its net metering policy, affecting rooftop solar systems. The plan is to calculate credits for energy returned to the grid from rooftop solar systems every 15 minutes of peak usage each day, rather than monthly.

According to regulators, most residential and small business customers of NV Energy will see lower bills, adding to their already comparatively low rates. Through June, Nevada’s average retail price for residential customers was about 60% lower than California’s price and 22% lower than the U.S. average price. Last year, Nevada generated 53% of its electricity from natural gas, its smallest share in 19 years, with solar contributing 31%. Nevada imports natural gas from neighboring states like Utah.

In 2019, Nevada lawmakers set a 100% zero-carbon emission energy mandate by 2050 under former Democratic Nevada Governor Steve Sisolak. To achieve zero-emission energy by 2050, Nevada has phased out its coal plants. That means rate payers are paying for the coal plant retirements and their replacements, requiring the build out of a whole new system. Pushing for an accelerated green energy transition while phasing out reliable energy sources like coal is linked to rising utility costs and reliability issues.

According to Utility Dive, renewable advocates are against the change for net metering, saying that it would erect further barriers to renewables adoption because it would reduce annual solar customer compensation by $136. Depending on how the compensation is calculated, non-solar rooftop customers could be subsidizing rooftop customers, particularly if they are compensated at retail rates where they do not pay for the use of power lines.

Depending on usage, Advanced Energy United indicates that the demand charge could be higher than NV Energy indicates. It calculates that the new demand charge could add $27 per month to the bill of a customer using five kilowatt hours and $38 per month to customers using six kilowatt hours. NV Energy claims the new charge will not make a major difference to the new bills of an average NV Energy customer because the utility is moving some parts of the volumetric rate into the daily demand charge. Via KTNV Las Vegas, the purpose of the demand charge is to incentivize customers to decrease their overall energy usage by spreading out their energy usage and avoiding simultaneous operation of numerous appliances, which would result in less strain on the power grid during times of peak demand.

California Passes Bills to Supposedly Lower Energy Costs

According to The Hill, California Governor Gavin Newsom signed several climate and clean energy bills supposedly to “lower electricity costs, stabilize the petroleum market and slash air pollution.” The measures include legislation to increase climate credits on utility bills, expand regional power markets out West, and add $18 billion to the California Wildfire Fund. The cap-and-trade program, renamed “cap-and-invest,” was also extended through 2045.

Analysis

Energy consumers in states across the country are facing higher bills as the grid becomes strained by additional demand, particularly from artificial intelligence data centers and electrification. Unfortunately for consumers, utilities are ill-equipped to deal with these challenges because of prohibitive permitting policies and state renewable portfolio standards that incentivize intermittent wind and solar generation over natural gas and coal. To prevent consumers from being burdened with rising costs, states need to adopt “best of the above” approaches to energy policy that let the market dictate which sources are optimal to meet rising demand.",https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/bigstock-A-Woman-Inspects-A-Dollar-Mone-445270193.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:02:47.179918

It’s connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.
The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action.
Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years.
Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.","So you’re booking your flight, and just when you’re about to check out, the airline asks if you’d like to pay a little something to offset your share of the flight’s pollution. Or, maybe you’re an environmentally minded person, and you’ve heard you can buy these things called carbon offsets.

Are they worth it? Let’s explore.

Why planes are so pollutive

A roundtrip flight from New York to Los Angeles emits more than 1,300 pounds (about 614 kilograms) of planet-warming carbon dioxide per passenger, according to an emissions calculator from the International Civil Aviation Organization. That’s about the amount of pollution you’d save if you swore off meat for 17 months.

Jet engines burn fossil fuels, releasing planet-warming gases into the atmosphere. They also release water vapor, which turns into long, thin clouds called contrails that trap heat instead of letting it escape to space — additional warming that isn’t typically included in a flight’s emissions, said Diane Vitry, aviation director at a clean energy advocacy organization called the European Federation for Transport and Environment.

Reducing emissions from air travel is difficult. Batteries weigh too much and provide too little power for long flights. Sustainable aviation fuel — biofuels made from things like corn, oil seeds and algae that can be mixed with jet fuel — is currently more expensive than traditional fuel and lacking sufficient supply to be in wide use.

“Aviation is the problem child,” Vitry said. “Aviation and shipping are not decarbonizing, and definitely not fast enough.”

That’s where carbon offsets come in.

What is a carbon offset?

A carbon offset is a certificate or a permit to emit planet-warming gases. It’s connected to something that stores or reduces carbon emissions — for example, planting trees, or funding renewable energy.

The idea is that the program or action offsets your pollutive action. You drive a car that pollutes a certain amount, you buy a carbon offset that leads to the planting of a tree that sequesters the same amount, and bam: the pollutive action (driving) is offset (tree planting).

They’ve gotten popular enough that there’s an entire marketplace that connects people and companies wanting to reduce their impacts with other companies that promise to do so.

Do the offsets work?

Vitry doesn’t think so. She calls them a fake climate solution.

“Unfortunately, it is not what is going to solve aviation’s climate problem,” she said. “You can’t clear your climate conscience with an offset.”

Sure, you can plant a tree, but Vitry said that doesn’t stop your flight’s emissions from entering the atmosphere. The tree may eventually absorb an equivalent amount of emissions. Or it may die. Or it may be sold as an offset multiple times by an unscrupulous company, meaning the tree can’t possible absorb all the emissions it’s supposed to.

Barbara Haya, director of the Berkeley Carbon Trading Project, has studied carbon offsets for more than 20 years. She said some offset schemes are overcounted by 10 to 13 times their actual value.

“There’s so much over-crediting on the offset market, so many credits that either don’t represent any emissions reductions at all or represent just a small fraction of what they claim,” Haya said.

She said that’s partly because the voluntary offset market is largely unregulated, and it’s really difficult to measure offsets. The other problem is everyone involved benefits from over-exaggerating the benefits of offsets. “The buyer of the credit wants the cheap credits, the seller of the credits wants to get more credits for the same activity and the third party verifier is hired by the project developer, so has a conflict of interest to be lenient,” Haya said.

Jodi Manning, chief executive of the carbon offset nonprofit Cool Effect, said consumers should beware of offset programs that don’t say clearly which project will benefit from your purchase or how much of your money is going to a project. But she said “high-quality” carbon credits can play an important role where emissions are unavoidable.

Manning said offsets have to be permanent, transparent, and unable to exist without the offset funding.

“When carbon is done correctly, it can provide a credible, immediate way to account for the emissions that travelers cannot otherwise reduce. We all create emissions at some point and it is certainly better to take action to compensate for it than to do nothing,” she said.

Several airlines that offer offsets did not respond to requests from AP to talk about their use. One that did, Southwest Airlines, said in a statement that it does not plan to rely on carbon offsets to help it reach a goal of net zero emissions by 2050.

What are you some other options for offsetting your air travel?

Fly less, take the train if you can, and pack light, Manning said.

If you have to fly, think about cutting your emissions in other ways, Haya said.

Instead of buying carbon offsets, Haya said she donates $1,000 to an organization she cares about on the rare occasion she flies for work or family visits.

“We have an ethical obligation not to fly unless we really have to,” she said.

The school system was awarded $7.1 million earlier this year through the federal Clean School Bus Program to replace 25 of its diesel buses with zero-emission, battery-operated buses. The district, which applied for the money last year, must contribute around $3.4 million of its own funds under a grant stipulation that requires districts to foot 30% of related costs, board members said.

The board’s facilities subcommittee voted 2-1 last week to pay for the buses with the combined federal and local funding, with members Clay Moise and Ralph Brandt voting in favor and member Michael Pedalino opposed. The full board will vote on the plan Wednesday.

In their application for a grant through the Environmental Protection Agency’s $5 billion electric bus program, which launched under the Biden administration, Jefferson Parish officials said the switch will likely save the district around $2.3 million annually in fuel and maintenance costs. The district was awarded the funds in January, and the school board voted in April to accept them.

The Trump administration earlier this year paused funding for several environmental programs, including the clean bus program, causing delays for school districts that planned to purchase new buses. Federal courts have blocked the freeze, but the Trump administration challenged the rulings, making the future of many such programs uncertain.

Changing out diesel buses for electric ones is a growing national trend for school districts, many of which are making the change out of environmental concerns or with the hope of saving money on fuel and maintenance costs.

High up-front costs associated with purchasing an electric vehicle, which can often be twice as much as a typical diesel bus, have also remained a barrier for most districts. Pedalino said that even with help from the EPA’s grant program, he worries about the potential burden on local taxpayers.

“If the grant covered 100% of everything, I’m sure it would probably have an easier road to pass because we wouldn’t be taking resources out of our general funds to pay for it,” he said.

Moise disagreed, saying that the money to cover the buses will come out of an existing district fund for bus maintenance costs.

“Taking advantage of this program is in the best interest of our students,” he said, adding the projected savings mean Jefferson Parish will “have money left over to push into the classroom.”

If the board approves the grant, the district is expected to purchase the vehicles over a period of two years at a cost of around $370,000 each, board documents show. The grant will also pay for 25 charging stations.

In its grant application, the district said that converting to electric school buses will “profoundly impact the community of Jefferson parish,” which has been heavily impacted by pollution attributed to offshore oil extraction. The summary also says that replacing the district’s diesel buses with electric ones is projected to reduce heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions by 383 tons annually or by 6,130 tons over 15 years.

If funded, the project “can serve as a blueprint for successful zero-emission journeys for other fleets,” it adds.

The number of electric school buses in the U.S. has grown rapidly, with Louisiana helping to lead the way. Several school districts, including East Baton Rouge, Livingston and Rapides, have received EPA grants to purchase the vehicles.

More than 12,000 electric buses were being used by school districts nationwide as of June 2024 – up from nearly zero in 2017, according to data from Climate Central, a nonprofit that seeks to find solutions to climate change. Around 300 of those buses were reported to be in use in Louisiana, more than in most other states, though fewer than South Carolina and Florida.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/d/a4/da4c9c0e-9a91-4459-86b2-cdee90931417/659dde0f6cc3a.image.jpg?crop=1662%2C873%2C0%2C187&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-29 14:04:28.719283

A consortium of public and private partners announced a plan last week to explore expanding nuclear power production and energy storage in Kansas.

Midwest utility provider Evergy, Washington-based TerraPower, and officials at the Kansas Department of Commerce are partnering on a proposed project to locate a nuclear reactor and energy storage system somewhere in Evergy's Kansas service territory.

TerraPower, a nuclear power company founded by Bill Gates, is proposing a Natrium power plant in Evergy’s Kansas territory.

“Our Natrium technology features a next-generation reactor with enhanced safety and efficiency, paired with utility-scale storage to ensure grid resilience,” TerraPower President/CEO Chris Levesque said in a Sept. 23 press release. “The TerraPower team is excited to advance conversations with Evergy, state leaders, and local communities on the opportunities that the Natrium reactor and energy storage system brings to Kansas.”

TerraPower described its Natrium technology as a 345-megawatt electrical (MWe) sodium-cooled fast reactor paired with a molten salt-based energy storage system.

TerraPower said the agreement will allow the company to evaluate site-specific characteristics for the potential power plant, while exploring the plant’s technical design and ability to support Evergy’s customers.

""Nuclear energy has been part of Evergy's generation mix for decades, and this next step will allow us to explore the opportunity to add reliable, non-carbon emitting advanced nuclear energy in the state of Kansas,"" Evergy Chairman and CEO David Campbell said in a press release announcing the memorandum of understanding. ""This agreement supports our all-of-the-above energy strategy and will allow us to evaluate the cost, technology, and feasibility of potentially deploying Natrium advanced nuclear plants.""

Evergy operates the Wolf Creek Nuclear Generation Station in Burlington, Kansas, about 95 miles south of the Kansas City metro area. The plant, which opened in 1985, generates 1,200 megawatts of electricity and is currently the only nuclear reactor in Kansas.

""My administration has always supported an 'all-of-the-above' approach when meeting the energy needs of Kansas citizens and businesses,"" said Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly. ""We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state, and I'm pleased we're using innovative methods to do just that.""

According to TerraPower, site selection will be based on many factors, such as community support, the physical characteristics of the site, the site's ability to obtain a license from the U.S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and access to existing infrastructure.

Kansas' U.S. Sens. Jerry Moran and Roger Marshall, both Republicans, are included in the project's supporters, citing the project's ability to potentially reduce electric costs to consumers.

""Expanding the use of nuclear energy strengthens U.S. energy independence while bringing down electricity costs for Kansas rate payers,"" Moran said in the release.

Marshall described nuclear as ""the way of the future.""

""Nuclear produces reliable, clean power — and a lot of it,"" Marshall said. ""I'm excited about the prospect of welcoming TerraPower's Natrium reactor to Kansas and look forward to helping bring this project to fruition so that Kansans can have safe, reliable, and affordable energy.""

Capital News Service

New federal policy is aimed at addressing the nation’s wildfire crisis by boosting timber production, but some experts say it’s not expected to have a major impact in Michigan.

There are more than 2.5 million acres of national forest in the Northern Lower Peninsula and Upper Peninsula, but most forestland in Michigan is owned by the state, local governments and private entities and individuals.

The policy change is reflected in federal actions such as President Donald Trump’s “Empowering Commonsense Wildfire Prevention and Response” executive order and provisions about the sale of timber and long-term contracts by the U.S. Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

For example, Trump’s “Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production” executive order was promoted as a way to prevent wildfires by reducing fuel loads in high-risk areas.

In part, it requires federal agencies to update guidance to speed up timber delivery and delay or suspend regulations to expedite permitting and reduce environmental reviews.

In addition, U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Brooke Rollins issued a memorandum stating that her department’s future efforts will promote the production of timber, remove hazardous fuels and remove trees damaged by natural disasters.

Supporters of the policy change say it also will provide a major boost for the U.S. timber industry, as well as preventing wildfires.

However, some experts, including Shivan Gc, an assistant professor in the Michigan State University Department of Forestry, criticize the new policy as more focused on the economy than on the environment. She researches forest economics and environmental policy.

Gc said the policy change may increase timber production in the short term but that she doesn’t expect a big impact on the economy, especially in Michigan, since it primarily applies to federal land.

That includes areas managed by the U.S. Forest Service (under the Department of Agriculture) and the Bureau of Land Management (under the Department of the Interior), and does not apply to state or private forests.

David Prince, the forest planning and operations manager at the state Department of Natural Resources, also said the law will apply only to federal forests and will not affect state and privately owned forests.

Prince said there are three federal forests in Michigan: the Huron-Manistee National Forest in the Northern Lower Peninsula, the Hiawatha National Forest in the eastern and central UP and the Ottawa National Forest in the western UP.

Michigan has almost 4 million acres of state forest.

According to Gc, federal forests make up about 31% of the nation’s total forestland. The non-federal forests are owned mostly by private individuals and companies, with roughly 11% managed by state and local governments.

“These (federal forests) are not distributed evenly across the country,” said Gc. “So, if you think about the Rocky Mountain region or Pacific coast, a large percentage of those forests are federally owned, versus Michigan, where 62% of the forests are privately owned.”

Thus, the new policy’s on-the-ground impact in a state like Michigan may be limited, experts say.

The question of the policy’s economic scope will lead directly to specific government actions on federal forestlands.

Gc said, “So these kinds of treatments probably may be like active forest management kind of strategies, which are going ahead and identifying areas that need to be thinned and then removing excess dead trees or downed woody material from the forest floor.

“Those create hazardous fuel buildup, so removing those should have some positive effects on forest health.

“But that also depends upon how much will be removed. And if you hit that sustainability balance, then it could have negative effects on wildlife or sensitive species,” said Gc.

While the new federal policy prioritizes timber production and fire suppression, a more scientific and balanced strategy, according to Gc, would focus on a different set of priorities.

“If you focus more on the environmental aspect of it, then you’d probably frame it a little bit differently,” she said, “Not just opening up forests for timber production or increasing timber harvest, but maybe focusing more on science, like fire management science or ecological aspects of it.”

It also would take into consideration and incorporate the public’s view and not reduce public comment, she said.",https://greatlakesecho.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/FORESTS-PHOTO.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 13:02:52.969019

A comparative analysis of these figures reflects that GE Vernova boasts a strong solvency position, which should enable it to fulfill its commitment to invest $9 billion in cumulative research and development (R&D) and capital expenditures through 2028.

As part of this plan, the company has plans to invest $600 million in its U.S. factories and facilities over the next two years (as mentioned in a January 2025 press release). GEV also plans to invest a total of nearly $20 million to expand capacity at its Grid Solutions facilities in Charleroi, PA, which will support the smooth integration of renewable electricity across the United States.

On the other hand, SMNEY ended June 2025 with cash and cash equivalents worth $9.64 billion. On the other hand, its current debt totaled $1.72 million, while its long-term debt amounted to $2.48 billion. A comparative analysis of these figures reveals that Siemens Energy maintains a strong solvency position, which, in turn, should enable the company to execute its manufacturing facility expansion plans effectively and meet the growing electricity demand. These plans include the company’s goal, as of September 2025, to invest approximately $257 million to expand its transformer factory in Nuremberg, Germany.

As far as growth catalysts are concerned, rising demand for both offshore and onshore wind continues to strengthen the outlook for the broader wind industry, as renewables increasingly outcompete fossil-fuel power on cost. This trend positions GE Vernova and Siemens Energy to benefit, as both companies advance their expansion efforts in the wind market.

In September, GEV received an order from Germany’s Enertrag to supply seven 6MW, 164m turbines, among others. In the same month, GEV announced that it clinched an order from Germany’s Prokon Regenerative Energien eG to repower a wind farm with eight 6MW-164m turbines in the second quarter of 2025.

On the other hand, in June 2025, Siemens Energy Berlin delivered its 2000th SF6-free 8VM1 Blue GIS to the monumental Hornsea 3 wind farm in the North Sea, developed by Siemens Gamesa. These are indicative of the solid demand that both GEV and SMNEY’s products enjoy in the wind industry.

Apart from the growth characteristics of the wind energy industry, increasing demand for efficient grid and storage solutions, along with the rising use of non-fossil energy sources such as nuclear, has also been driving growth for GEV and SMNEY.

Risks of Investing in GEV vs SMNEY

Both GE Vernova and Siemens Energy face shared risks in the wind industry, particularly offshore wind, where rising material costs, supply-chain bottlenecks, and regulatory hurdles have strained project economics and slowed deployment. Compounding these challenges, U.S. import tariffs introduced in early 2025 threaten to further inflate raw material and installation costs while extending project timelines — a key downside risk for wind-focused stocks like GEV and SMNEY, which are already navigating a fragile supply landscape and facing pressure to meet ambitious targets.

Beyond the issues related to the offshore wind market, both these companies are vulnerable to the high volatility in cost and availability of raw materials required for manufacturing renewable energy products, including steel, copper, and rare earth elements. This can compress margins and affect the final cost of their equipment and services.

In total, the administration has interfered with just above 62 percent of approved offshore wind energy.
Indeed, federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths.
Without the stable, long-term contracts that offshore wind projects would have provided, ratepayers are left at the mercy of volatile fossil fuel markets.
Finally, all of us can help educate our communities on the critical importance of offshore wind development to the health of our environment and our communities.","The United States has an abundance of reliable offshore wind blowing off its coasts, enough to power the country five times over. Over the last few years, the United States has advanced offshore wind development, issuing leases across its three coasts and approving 11 projects capable of generating enough electricity for seven million homes. However, starting on Inauguration Day, President Trump halted all new leasing, permitting, and approvals for offshore wind energy, which stopped any new wind projects. Since then, attacks against offshore wind have escalated, with the president signing legislation to rapidly phase out and otherwise restrict access to tax incentives while rescinding funding for port redevelopment and transmission upgrades.

Now the administration is interfering with approved projects in the Atlantic: Of the five projects under construction, two were ordered to immediately cease construction, with only vague justifications provided (one project has since been allowed to resume construction and the other was recently temporarily lifted by granting a preliminary injunction); one project had a necessary federal permit revoked; and the federal government has started a process to voluntarily remand the approval of three other projects. In total, the administration has interfered with just above 62 percent of approved offshore wind energy.

Together, these actions jeopardize billions of dollars in private investment, thousands of good-paying jobs, and several gigawatts of clean electricity that grid operators and states are counting on to keep the lights on and meet clean energy mandates.

At the same time, federal officials have engaged in false rhetoric, portraying offshore wind as unreliable and environmentally damaging and repeating unfounded claims about harm to whales without identifying any credible evidence to back up their statements. Indeed, federal agencies and independent scientists have found no causal link between offshore wind development and whale deaths. Collectively, these actions send a chilling signal to investors and developers that the federal government is hostile to business, undermining confidence across U.S. industries and discouraging the commitments needed to cut costs, expand supply chains, and grow the economy.

The immediate consequences of these rollbacks harm consumers and grid reliability. With offshore wind sidelined—and increasing numbers of power-hungry data centers—the East Coast could be forced to lean more heavily on natural gas, exposing families to the same price spikes that have already driven up winter heating and electricity bills. Without the stable, long-term contracts that offshore wind projects would have provided, ratepayers are left at the mercy of volatile fossil fuel markets.

One of the projects that was ordered to cease construction, Revolution Wind, was poised to deliver 704 megawatts of clean energy to Rhode Island and Connecticut next year. The stop order for Revolution Wind, which was recently overturned while an underlying lawsuit challenging it proceeds, will force Rhode Island and Connecticut consumers to rely on more expensive fossil fuels, driving electricity bills up by at least $500 million each year. And because offshore wind delivers power when demand is often high in the winter months, losing this supply weakens the grid and increases the risk of blackouts during extreme cold.

Offshore wind remains the largest untapped clean energy resource, with the potential to deliver gigawatts of reliable power right where it’s needed most. Early returns are demonstrating the benefit of offshore wind: The South Fork Wind project off Long Island has exceeded production goals, reliably delivering power when needed most.

Defending offshore wind will take a village, with a role for everyone, ranging from states and Congress to each and every one of us.

A critical step is fighting back—in the courts and in Congress. Developers and states have already filed lawsuits challenging the administration’s stop work order and permitting and leasing ban, and the outcome of these cases will be critical in determining whether key projects can move forward. At the same time, Congress must act to restore the $679 million in rescinded offshore wind funding and protect future federal investments that are essential for building out the industry. Even where direct authority is limited, Congress can exert soft power through oversight hearings, public pressure, and funding priorities to push back against these cuts.

Governors and state legislatures also have a central role. States must defend their clean energy solicitations and contracts, ensuring that planned projects are not abandoned. States can move forward with transmission projects that lay the groundwork for future offshore wind integration. They should also continue investing in ports and supply chain readiness to keep the region competitive and prepared and support research and technology development that improve the responsible deployment of offshore wind. Above all, offshore wind must remain a cornerstone of state energy strategies, even in the face of federal hostility.

Finally, all of us can help educate our communities on the critical importance of offshore wind development to the health of our environment and our communities. In the face of anti–offshore wind rhetoric from the president and his administration, it is important to understand the facts and help maintain support so that offshore wind can proceed once federal roadblocks are relieved.

Attacks on offshore wind aren’t just a clean energy setback; they are also direct hits to family budgets and our ability to keep the lights on as electricity demand soars. Organizations and individuals across sectors must join forces to raise the alarm that stopping offshore wind will result in higher bills, greater blackout risks, and stalled climate progress, all because of reckless federal hostility.",https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/styles/social_sharing_1200x630/public/2025-09/rhode-island-wind-turbine-construction-2156801158.jpg?h=060ec7d7&itok=4F1pYdwY,N,,2025-09-29 13:01:38.179359

Climate change is straining America's health care system: Study

Wealthy households are more likely to flee hurricanes and flooding than other households: Study

Extreme weather events can devastate communities. Now, a new study finds that it can also have long-term effects on a community's demographics that may hinder its ability to respond to future weather disasters.

The study from the University of Vermont, published in the journal Population and Environment, found that higher-income households left their communities at a higher rate than other households after hurricanes and damaging floods.

""Hurricanes had an impact on both net migration of people and net migration of income,"" said Mahalia Clark, lead author of the study.

The study examined anonymous IRS data from 2011 to 2021 to examine human migration and household income, and overlaid county-level data on weather-related property damage from data housed at Arizona State University.

""There hasn't been a ton of research that looks at how multiple different climate hazards affect human migration in the U.S.,"" said Clark. ""There's even less on that migration's economic impacts.""

Some regions experienced a different response to hurricanes and damaging flooding. The study found that the Northeast, for example, had fewer higher-income households leaving impacted communities.

""In the Northeast, we might be seeing those higher-income households being more responsive to this emerging threat,"" Clark said.

The study found that hurricanes had more of an impact on migration rates than other extreme weather events, but flooding had the highest impact on the income migration rates in affected areas.

""This suggests that you have either more higher-income households leaving, or fewer higher-income households arriving in those places,"" Clark said. ""On average, the household income of the people leaving is higher than the average household income of people coming in.""

Governor Candidate, small business owner, energy expert Brett Hulsey unveiled the Positive Energy Plan(PEP) yesterday before the wisconsinclimatemarch.org.

“My Positive Energy Plan makes Wisconsin better for my family and yours. PEP gives our families good clean jobs, less air pollution, and lower energy and grocery bills for a better future,” said Hulsey, who founded Better Environmental Solutions, an affordable housing, energy and environmental, and general contracting firm in 1995.

“We will move forward to implement Gov. Tony Evers Climate Change Action Plan due out later this year, but we need to move the deadlines up to 2030 because immediate action is needed,” said Brett. “Our families should not have to worry about higher food costs, killer heat waves, deadly rains and floods, losing crops and cows, and poisonous air from carbon pollution, according to the WI Department of Natural Resources.”

The Positive Energy Plan will also build on Governor Thompson’s Climate Change Action Plan from the 90’s, make all Wisconsin government buildings produce more energy than they use as Brett did with grocers across the state.” The seven Green Grocer stores taking action reduced 4 million pounds of CO2 emissions and save 2.3 million kilowatt hours of electricity next year, equal to taking 328 cars off the road.

Brett Walks the Talk for Good Union Jobs

Brett has worked with Master Electrician and IBEW member Dan McGrath to install appropriate and controllable LED lights in dozens of remodeling projects.

“Brett knows what he is doing and walks the talk of clean jobs and energy,” said Dan McGrath of Mainstage Lighting of Madison. “He keeps me busy and wants to put every union electrician in Wisconsin to work with his Positive Energy Plan that will relight every government building in the state.” Brett wants to expand apprenticeship programs so workers can get paid to learn trades needed to build the Positive energy future.

He also worked with Madison Area Technical College to set up training for biofuel plant operators.

Brett’s Positive Energy History

Brett designed and helped build a passive solar addition on the left side of his westside 1930’s Madison farmhouse at 110 Merrill Crest Dr. to accommodate his two kids and family. He used recycled newspaper insulation, Wisconsin barnwood on some of the floors and light colored roofing to reduce cooling costs.

Brett also helped build one of America’s first positive energy homes for energy expert Amory Lovins in western Colorado in 1982. This 4,000 square foot home pumps 18,000 watts of clean solar electricity back onto the grid. The added solar and energy efficiency costs paid for themselves in less than a year, making the home both comfortable and beautiful.

Over 40 Year’s Energy Efficiency Experience

Brett’s energy efficiency experience started as an Energy Conservation Advocate in the Volunteer in Service to America Program (VISTA) in the Carter Administration in Alaska during the Energy Crisis in 1978-1979, earning $396 a month.

“Helping residents and Native Tribes all over Alaska make their homes more energy efficient not only saved them money, it saved lives,” said Brett, whose great-great-grandmother was Native American. “The winters there are brutal and too many people freeze to death.”

County Board, National Positive Power Leader

Brett pushed positive power programs on the Dane County Board for 14 years and was on the National Association of Counties(NACo) Energy, Environmental and Land Use Steering Committee.

Brett spearheaded efforts to build two bioplants to treat 20,000 cow’s manure to make biogas and remove phosphorous to reduce water pollution and uncontrolled cow methane.

Brett pioneered efforts working with utilities and Johnson Controls to make county building more efficient, increase comfort for nursing home patients, and save tax money.

Helped write and pass the first NACo resolution to address climate change in a cost-effective manner.

Brett’s Farm Family Roots Help Him Reach Farmer

Growing up in Oklahoma, Brett worked on his family farm and as a cowboy in Kansas. In Wisconsin, he worked with the WI Corn Growers to build two advanced biofuel plants and promote low carbon fuels, and the WI Soybean Association to start the WI Biodiesel Association, attempting to build a soybean processing plant for producing food and fuel.

“Working on my family’s farms, I understand that protecting farmers and their families protects Wisconsin’s future and landscape,” said Brett. “I worked on federal Farm Bills to create the Conservation and Wetland Reserve Programs that protect millions of acres of habitat critical for fish, wildlife, reducing flooding, and providing cleaner water. Wetlands are nature’s sponges and an acre can store up to 1 million gallons of floodwater.”

For his work, Brett was one of the first civilians to win the prestigious FEMA Distinguished Pubic Service Award for using wetlands to control floods.

Brett’s Family and Education

Brett attended UW-Madison, holds a Master’s in Natural Science and Science Education from the University of Oklahoma, attended engineering graduate school at Dartmouth College, studied Wildlife Biology at Colorado State, and has a B.A. in Political Economy from Middlebury College, VT, where he captained the Cross Country Running Team.",https://www.wispolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/WisPoliticsIconSocial.png,N,,2025-09-29 14:03:58.229708

ALSO: Brunswick commissioners respond to calls for clean water, apply for grant

The North Carolina Department of Environmental Quality’s Division of Air Quality approved dust control plans for wood pellet manufacturer Enviva and wood-chipping company Basaga International. The new regulations follow two confirmed complaints in the last year from nearby Sunset Park residents about wood-dust pollution.

Enviva has been manufacturing wood pellets since 2011 in North Carolina and is known in Wilmington for their large white dome storage facility at the Port of Wilmington. Though most citizen complaints are directed at Enviva, the state has identified Basaga, a wood-chipping facility operating at the port since 2022, as a “reoccuring source” of dust pollution as well.

In June 2024, NCDEQ required both companies to adopt fugitive dust-control plans. “Fugitive dust” is the term for particulate matter that becomes airborne from non-point sources, meaning it does not come out of a traditional vent or stack. At the Port of Wilmington, this dust primarily consists of small wood particles escaping during the loading and handling of Enviva’s wood pellets and Basaga’s wood-chip processing.

Wood dust can lead to short-term health problems, including respiratory irritation that can pose a heightened risk for people with conditions like asthma, but long-term effects are still being studied.

The newly approved plans by DEQ outline a step-by-step procedure for Enviva and Basaga International employees to prevent wood dust from leaving the Port of Wilmington site.

Key to Enviva’s plan is enhanced monitoring during ship loading, where associates must record wind speed and direction every three hours. If winds from the west exceed 10 miles per hour, a second observer must be deployed to watch closely for dust. If any fugitive dust is observed leaving the property or if a citizen complaint is received, employees are immediately required to stop work until the dust source is investigated and fully mitigated.

Furthermore, the company must maintain a detailed fugitive dust complaint log of all incidents and actions taken, with the entire plan subject to an annual review by DEQ. The plan also imposes a two-year record-keeping requirement for all operational documentation and stipulates Enviva must cross-reference on-site dust observations with official wind data from the Wilmington International Airport.

“Enviva has been proud to be part of the Wilmington community since 2016,” a spokesperson for the company told Port City Daily. “Over the years, we have continued to build relationships, listen to feedback, and take action to be a responsible and engaged neighbor. Enviva remains committed to being a strong partner in the communities where we live and work.”

The Basaga International dust-control plan is strictly focused on controlling emissions from its wood chipping operations. The plan centers on reducing dust at the source, primarily through the regular application of water or chemical suppressants to stockpiles and work areas to cut back the likelihood of particulates going into the air. This may involve stopping chipping activity when weather like high winds makes dust control difficult. Like Enviva, the company is required to keep detailed records of all incidents and actions, and the entire plan is subject to annual DEQ review.

Port City Daily reached out to Basaga International for comment on the implementation of the dust control plans but did not received a response by press.

Ivy Miller, a resident of Sunset Park, has dealt with the persistent problem of fugitive wood dust for years. She and a neighbor have sent nearly 50 complaints to NCDEQ over the last decade, including letters to the attorney general’s office, which she said have gone unanswered.

“It’s definitely not fun,” Miller explained. “It makes you not want to sit outside, but at some point, you feel pressure you’re going to give up because there’s nobody really holding anybody accountable.”

Miller and her neighbors have dealt with the wood dust accumulating on their homes, in their yards and coating their vehicles. She and other neighbors have also experienced health issues, including heavy sinuses and congestion, which they attribute to the exposure.

Miller explained the dust decreased for a few months when NCDEQ first issued requirements for the management plans in June 2024, but the particulates still continue to pollute the neighborhood.

“There were weeks where we didn’t see anything, but, suddenly, there’d be like two or three days in a row where you see sawdust every morning,” Miller stated. “You wake up and the car, you can see it’s just covered.”

As far as the dust management plans go, Miller is not convinced they will solve the problem.

“I just honestly don’t really think they care,” Miller said about the companies. “Enviva has tried to give us money through gift certificates for Winnie’s [Tavern] down the road and car washes and house washes and I’ve told them, ‘No, I want you to figure out the problem because I moved here before you guys did, and you’re ruining our environment.’”

According to an NCDEQ spokesperson, both Enviva and Basaga will be required to be in compliance with their respective fugitive dust control plans by Oct. 18. The agency will monitor compliance through inspections spurred by new complaints.

NCDEQ has not assessed any civil penalties against Enviva in the last year, but has previously for air quality violations.

The Enviva plant in Sampson County has received five air quality violations from NCDEQ since opening in 2016 for emitting too much carbon monoxide and volatile organic compounds, resulting in fines in excess of $148,000.

Widely considered the world’s largest wood pellet producer, Enviva operates four plants in North Carolina collectively generating roughly 2.3-million metric tons of wood pellets annually. They are shipped overseas, primarily through the Port of Wilmington. These plants — located in Hertford County, Northampton County, Sampson County, and Richmond County — have all undergone or sought capacity increases since they began operation.

Most notably, the Northampton plant received an expansion permit from NCDEQ in 2019 to boost its production to 780,000 tons of pellets per year, while the Hertford County plant was permitted in 2023 to increase its capacity to 630,000 tons per year. These expansions are coupled with the required installation of new pollution control devices, such as regenerative thermal oxidizers, which destroy air pollutants using heat.

The wood pellet industry is sustained by large subsidies provided by the United Kingdom and the European Union. The UK and EU, starting with a 2009 Renewable Energy Directive, classify the burning of wood pellets as a renewable and zero-carbon energy source, allowing European utility companies to access billions in financial incentives. Although the U.S. also classifies wood pellets as renewable biomass, it provides no comparable subsidies, driving the domestic industry to focus on European exports.

The renewable classification propels international demand, as evidenced by the fact that nearly all wood pellets produced by Enviva are exported to power plants overseas. As a result of this system, Enviva has received approximately $7.7 billion in cumulative net revenue from the start of its public reporting in 2014 through the end of 2023.

In addition to the foreign incentives, North Carolina has provided taxpayer-backed funds to attract and retain Enviva’s operations. State and county economic development grants, including Job Development Investment Grants and One North Carolina Fund awards, total over $7 million for the company’s North Carolina plants since 2011.

However, these revenue streams did not prevent the company from collapsing under its own debt. Enviva filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in March 2024 to restructure about $1 billion. The company’s financial issues stemmed from unfavorable contracts with overseas utility companies and operational issues at its plants. No longer a publicly traded company, Enviva emerged as a private entity in December 2024, having eliminated more than $1 billion in debt and secured new financing from private equity firm American Industrial Partners Capital Fund VIII.

Despite the subsidies powering the industry, the environmental classification justifying them remains controversial. Environmental educator and conservationist Andy Wood explained that claims of “renewable” and “carbon-neutral” wood pellet biomass energy are not entirely accurate. While trees eventually do grow back, he said it can take 50 years or longer for a forest to re-absorb the amount of carbon released into the atmosphere from burning wood pellets.

“It’s harming the climate in two ways: One, burning wood pellets releases more carbon dioxide than burning natural gas or coal,” Wood stated. “The other is, we’re burning trees that, when left to their homes, sequester existing carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere. So we’re cutting ourselves twice — and we are paying a company to do it.”

Wood, along with other environmental advocates from the Dogwood Alliance, the Southern Forest Conservation Coalition, the Alliance for Cape Fear Trees, and Save Sledge Forest, held an informational tour for the public on the Cape Fear River recently to discuss Enviva’s operations locally and in the state. Environmental advocates have held similar cruises in the past — Port City Daily last attended in 2021.

Anita Cunningham, executive director of the Southern Forest Conservation Coalition and resident of Robeson County near the Enviva facility, spoke during the tour about the impact of the Enviva plant in Robeson County. Cunningham also serves as the co-director of the NC Climate Solutions Coalition and was appointed in 2024 to serve on the White House Environmental Justice Advisory Council.

She previously led grassroots opposition through the Robeson County Cooperative for Sustainable Development, achieving a victory by successfully stopping the proposed Active Energy wood pellet plant (a company distinct from Enviva) in Lumberton in 2022.

Cunningham explained the Robeson community’s struggles with persistent noise pollution from tree debarking as well as particulate matter expelled from the Enviva plant.

“If [particulates] covers their yards, their homes, cars, plants and flowers,” Cunningham stated. “It’s gonna be harmful to you and your community, your health and welfare and your ability to live freely and enjoy your life at your home.”

California now has 68% more electric vehicle (EV) charging ports than gas pumps statewide, according to the California Energy Commission (CEC).

That’s 201,180 publicly available and shared EV charging ports throughout the state, California Governor Gavin Newsom said.

“With this expanding public network, EV chargers are becoming ubiquitous in California,” said CEC Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “Our goal is to make driving an EV a no-brainer choice for Californians. They are fun to drive, never need an oil change, don’t cause smog and it’s getting easier to charge your vehicle with public EV infrastructure.”

California’s publicly available EV chargers can be found at convenience stores such as Love’s Travel Stops, Jacksons Food Stores, 7-Eleven, Circle K and more. They are also available at various grocery stores, parking lots, workplaces and sports facilities.

Federal tax incentives for zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) are set to end on Sept. 30. After that date, tax credits of up to $7,500 for eligible new electric or hydrogen-powered vehicles, and up to $4,000 for qualifying used models, will no longer be available. Additional credits of up to $1,000 are also available for installing home charging equipment and battery storage systems. This expiration is the result of decisions made by the Trump administration.

California state agencies, however, continue efforts to speed up EV charger installation and plan for increasing grid demand. These efforts include:

Providing grant funds that support publicly accessible, workplace and at-home charging installations, including in multi-family complexes, throughout the state.

Prioritizing shovel-ready fast-charging installations for the funding incentives available through the CEC’s grant solicitation programs.

Developing the ZEV Infrastructure Plan, a comprehensive plan that lays out the overall infrastructure strategy to meet California’s zero-emission transportation goals.

Establishing charger reliability standards.

Meanwhile, at the federal level, other recent updates aim to further support EV infrastructure growth. In August, U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy announced revised rules for the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Formula (NEVI) Program, which had been paused earlier this year for review. The new guidance streamlines approvals, increases state flexibility and removes several planning and consultation requirements.

These changes may reduce regulatory and planning burdens for businesses, including convenience stores, that are eligible to host charging stations. By encouraging site-host-owned locations and simplifying the approval process, the revisions could make it easier for retailers to participate in the NEVI program and expand the public charging network.",https://cdn.informaconnect.com/platform/files/public/2025-09/background/ev-sign.jpg?VersionId=61nfLcWlg6rvsL1RXFZnuMuoAeNWXb5g,N,,2025-09-29 12:07:28.055829

CARFAX reported a sharp surge in sales of electric and hybrid vehicles in September in the U.S. They said consumers rushed to take advantage of federal tax credits for new and used EVs before they expire at the end of the month. EVs and hybrids are selling about 30 per cent faster than they were at the start of the summer, based on the company’s data.

“EV and hybrid sales are spiking, yet prices remain stable,” said Patrick Olsen, Editor-in-Chief at CARFAX, in a statement. “For shoppers considering a purchase, experts say now is the time to act.”

According to CARFAX, the Inflation Reduction Act included EV and some plug-in hybrid incentives. A $7,500 tax credit is offered for new models and $4,000 for used. Congress voted to eliminate the credits, with Sept. 30 as the deadline for eligible purchases to qualify.

A recent Cox Automotive report is forecasting a record 410,000 EVs will be sold in the third quarter. That’s a significant increase — of 21.4 per cent — year-over-year, and up more than 30 per cent compared to Q2. The federal tax credit was considered a “key catalyst” for EV adoption.

“This shift (away from the tax credit) will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, Director of Industry Insights at Cox Automotive, in a statement.

Cox Automotive is anticipating that EV sales will slow notably in Q4, but long-term sales growth will continue.

Washington, DC – U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-RI), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, this week exposed the malign influence of the fossil fuel industry’s climate denial operation and its infiltration of the Trump administration in a comment submitted to the Environmental Protection Agency. Whitehouse’s comment was filed during the same week that President Donald Trump attempted to spread pro-polluter falsehoods at the United Nations General Assembly. Speaking before world leaders in New York City, Trump falsely claimed that renewables “don’t work” and that climate change is “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.”

Whitehouse submitted the comment in response to the Environmental Protection Agency’s legally deficient and factually inaccurate proposed rollback of the endangerment finding, a 2009 scientific determination by EPA that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare that provides a legal bedrock of U.S. climate policy. Repealing the endangerment finding would fly in the face of overwhelming scientific evidence and set the stage for rolling back emissions standards for motor vehicles, power plants, airplanes, and more, making it easier to pollute.

“This sham regulatory proceeding can only properly be understood against its backdrop: a multi-year, multi-billion dollar, semi-covert campaign of climate denial fraud by fossil fuel interests; and its related multi-year, multi-billion dollar, semi-covert campaign of dark-money political influence and corruption,” wrote Whitehouse.

Whitehouse’s opening in the comment letter details the fossil fuel industry’s orchestration of the Trump administration and Congressional Republicans’ energy agenda, and the industry’s corrupt mission to use the power of government to kill America’s clean energy industry. Whitehouse wrote:

“With this sham proceeding, climate denial fraud has metastasized inside government, with an arm of the operation operating within the halls of government, allowing fossil fuel interests to capture and exert official government agency power. A long and sordid history of agency capture, aka regulatory capture, resounds through the literature of economics and administrative law; this sorry episode of climate denial fraud is its latest and perhaps worst chapter. Consider it fraud-by-government.

“The climate denial fraud operation has never had the goal that its statements be true; only that the falsehoods be loud and persistent enough to confound rational public debate; and that it provide a rhetorical structure for the political forces influenced and/or corrupted by its dark money operation. Those persistent falsehoods and related rhetoric litter EPA’s work here.

“The tactics of the climate denial fraud operation, now deployed from within government, remain the same: an embrace of fake science, propagated by a small stable of reliable climate deniers; deployment of fake proceedings that resemble legitimate proceedings but aren’t; and behind it all the power of fossil fuel industry’s pressure to ram the falsehoods home and protect its free-to-pollute business model. This is a simulacrum of a regulatory proceeding, not a real one.”

The rollback of the endangerment finding, if finalized, would constitute a formal denial by EPA that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare—a position that defies years of scientific evidence, agency precedent, and Supreme Court rulings. To justify the repeal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin relied on a pseudoscientific Department of Energy report written by known climate deniers with close ties to fossil fuel and polluting industries. Rife with clear errors, cherry-picked data, and misrepresented facts, the report peddles the lie that human-caused climate change is not a threat.

“In a world where climate change is causing homeowners to face gut-wrenching financial decisions as insurance premiums and nonrenewal rates soar; farmers to endure massive crop losses from flood and drought; and families to suffer grocery ‘climate-flation,’ food insecurity, displacement, and even illness and death, EPA’s Proposal, with its legal and factual deficiencies, deserves zero credence. As a product of the fraud-by-government stage of the fossil fuel industry’s linked climate denial fraud and dark money corruption operations, it merits condemnation,”Whitehouse’s letter concluded.

Whitehouse and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) led the entire Democratic Caucus in a separate comment letter demanding the Trump Administration withdraw its legally deficient and factually inaccurate proposed rollback of the endangerment finding. The 47 senators comprising the Senate Democratic caucus called the repeal of the climate and public health protection a “dereliction of duty” and a “blatant failure to protect the American people.” Whitehouse has also launched an investigation into the extent of fossil fuel and related entities’ improper influence on the Trump Administration’s proposed roll back of the endangerment finding.

Whitehouse has long been the Senate’s leading voice exposing the corruption of the fossil-fuel-funded climate denial operation and the fossil fuel industry’s long-running covert operation to profit off the American people while damaging the economy and wrecking the planet.

The terms staffers are forbidden from using include: climate change, green, decarbonization, energy transition, sustainability, sustainable, subsidies, tax breaks, tax credits, and carbon footprint.

Also on the banned word list is the term “emissions.” According to the report, the term apparently implies some level of negativity, despite the neutrally worded dictionary definition. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in 2007 that greenhouse gases aren’t simply emissions, though, but instead can be regulated as air pollutants.

The EERE was established in the late 1970s after several government agencies were rolled into one. The office was a response to the 1973 energy crisis, which had sent oil prices skyrocketing. The intent of the EERE was to foster renewable energy and energy efficiency in an effort to stabilize the American economy from price shocks that can roil commodity markets, like oil and gas.

President Trump and his appointees have decided to bet the American economy on expanded use of those commodities.

Fusion energy has the potential to deliver abundant, affordable, carbon-free power, and New Mexico will now play a central role in making that future a reality,” said Heinrich, Ranking Member of the U.S. Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee and founder of the Senate Fusion Caucus.

“I’m proud to announce that Pacific Fusion has chosen Albuquerque for its new 225,000-square-foot research and manufacturing campus,” said Luján,a member of the Senate Committee on Science, Commerce, and Transportation.“Their technology is built off innovations from Sandia Labs and will continue to advance our state’s leadership in clean energy. This investment will create hundreds of good-paying jobs, strengthen our local economy, and ensure New Mexico continues to lead in innovation. This is another example of how New Mexico is attracting cutting-edge industries and strengthening our state.”

The company’s state-of-the-art research and manufacturing facility will house Pacific Fusion’s Demonstration System, producing more fusion energy output than all the energy stored in the system by 2030, and is expected to start manufacturing operations before the end of the year.

Heinrich and Luján have long supported clean energy innovation. Both lawmakers helped author and pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which has created a manufacturing renaissance in the state and established New Mexico at the center of the nation’s clean energy future – and opposed Trump and Republicans’ Big, Bad Bill, which sunsets critical investments in clean energy. Senator Heinrich also founded the Senate Fusion Caucus.

There are a lot of tariffs that a company like Ford gets because there are auto-specific tariffs and non-auto-specific tariffs.","Hello, and welcome to Decoder! This is Nilay Patel’s show about big ideas and other problems. I am not Nilay Patel, though I have long wanted to be him.

I am Joanna Stern, the senior personal technology columnist at The Wall Street Journal, author of the upcoming book I AM NOT A ROBOT (releasing spring 2026), and, once upon a time, a cofounder of The Verge. I’m the last Monday guest host filling in for Nilay while he’s out on parental leave with his adorable new son, and I’m very excited to be talking today to Ford CEO Jim Farley.

I’m a longtime Decoder listener and my favorite episodes are car episodes. I might not own a gas-powered Mustang convertible like Nilay — I’m not cool enough — but I did, in fact, lease my first EV, a Ford Mustang Mach-E, back in 2023. I think car CEOs are currently facing some of the most fascinating and complex challenges in both tech and business.

Listen to Decoder, a show hosted by The Verge’s Nilay Patel about big ideas — and other problems. Subscribe here!

So when I was asked to guest host the show I said, “That’s it, car CEOs.” And Jim was at the top of the list. Jim was on this show once before — his first appearance was in May 2021. And, well, a whole lot has changed in the past four years. Actually, a whole lot has changed in the last four months. The second Trump administration’s barrage of tariffs, trade wars, and a whole lot more, just to name a few.

For Ford, it’s an especially critical moment. Last month, the company announced what it calls the Ford Universal EV Platform, an all-new manufacturing process that the company is calling a “Model T moment” for EVs. That’s because it should, in theory, allow Ford to produce cheaper EVs in a more efficient manner than it does with its current lineup, including my Mach-E. You will hear Jim say “last week” a few times — that’s because we taped this episode in August just after their announcement.

It’s also not just tariff troubles for Ford. There’s the general weakening of demand for EVs in the US, the loss of the federal tax credit, and rising competition from low-cost Chinese competitors like BYD and Xiaomi.

One thing I love about talking to Jim is that he’s honest about it all. You’ll hear him say in plain terms that China is, in some respects, miles ahead of the West when it comes to some parts of its EV industry. And this major multibillion-dollar gamble on a Ford Universal EV Platform isn’t a done deal. You’re going to hear him say the word “risk” quite a lot in this conversation, and how this major manufacturing and strategy pivot could very well fail.

Jim had quite a lot to say about rebuilding the manufacturing base of blue-collar workers here in the US to compete with China — and even AI. Plus, he didn’t shy away from what he’d like to see from the Trump administration on tariffs. He says specifically, “We’re just asking for a fair fight.”

And don’t worry, I didn’t forget to do my best Nilay impression with a bunch of Decoder questions. Is Ford considering Apple’s CarPlay Ultra? (His answer is so great on that one.) How does Jim Farley make decisions? And, most importantly, do I stick with the Ford Mach-E when my lease is up next summer? I also couldn’t let Jim go without hitting him with a special call-in question from an old friend who’s technically not supposed to be working right now. I think you’re going to really like that one.

Okay, hopefully you’re in your car listening to this: Ford CEO Jim Farley, here we go.

This interview has been lightly edited for length and clarity.

Jim Farley, you are the CEO of Ford Motor Company. Welcome back to Decoder.

Great to be here with you, Joanna.

Thank you for coming on my show. Obviously, this is not my show, this is Nilay’s show, but I want to give you some background. I listen to Decoder all the time, and I love Nilay’s car CEO interviews. But often I find myself saying, “Nilay, why didn’t you ask that question?” So, when he asked me to do this, I said, “That’s it, I’m going to bring on car CEOs. And I’m going to ask the questions I want.”

I see.

[Laughs] So you were last on the show in May 2021. Things have changed considerably in the world, in technology, in the country, and at Ford. I want to talk about all of those things. But something also changed for me. In 2023, I got a Mustang Mach-E. I leased one.

Thank you.

And that lease is up next summer.

Ah, I’ll be reading about your decision process.

Well, that’s going to inform a lot of this conversation because I wanted to give you the chance to be the world’s best car salesman to the most annoying customer. I think that’s just going to set a lot of the backdrop of this conversation.

[Laughs] I love it.

Last month, you said at a press conference that the Mach-E is not so great, that it’s not the future of Ford. Why should I stick with a Ford EV next time?

Well, we just won the revised Model Y versus Mach-E drive evaluation by a pretty respected magazine. I’m still pretty proud of the Mach-E. We knew what we knew then (five years ago) and we now know what we know now. Those are, as you said, two different things.

I would say that in the second inning of product development, Ford really understood the opportunity to serve the EV market more fully than we did several years ago and we executed a product with the right approach based on those lessons. That’s with the consumer, because we’ve learned what consumers are willing to live with and not — like charging on the fly — as well as where in the market Ford should participate and put its limited resources. I think you’re going to find that the Ford EV product range will be much sharper, more specific, and more valuable to customers than it was when you last shopped.

Let’s dig into the news you just announced, which is that you have something called Ford Universal EV Platform. What is that, and when is it coming? More specifically for me, will it be out next August, and will I be able to get that kind of new Ford versus an upgrade to my Mach-E?

You’ll learn a lot more about the first product. It’s a platform that will be out in 2027. We learned so much from the Mach-E. We’ve been number two to Tesla. We’re a long way behind them, but we’re number two in the US market in EV sales. EV sales aren’t the most important metric, but it does give you an indication that Ford has learned a lot and has served a lot of wonderful customers like you. We have all of the data coming off the vehicle, so we have learned a lot about customers.

We believe the platform that we shared in Kentucky is a breakthrough approach for developing and delivering an affordable, electric platform to customers, where we’ll develop and launch several vehicles over the subsequent few years and show that we can have a profitable vehicle that’s sustainable in terms of the company’s resources and made in the US. But in order to compete with the likes of BYD, who we think are among the best in the world, we had to completely reinvent the platform for the customers.

There’s a lot to that. I’m sure we’ll get into it, but in short, the evolution revolution of our thinking was to develop a vehicle for manufacturability, to radically reduce the cost and the complexity of the vehicle with all new thinking that is not embedded in a traditional car company. To do that, we needed all new talent, and we needed them to be separate from Ford, separate from our IT solutions that we used to develop and release parts, and separate from a philosophy standpoint about how to radically simplify the vehicle. This is all to really get back to the basics of Ford and Henry Ford’s idea of a “universal car.”

Our first body style will be a pickup, but it’s really not a pickup. I would say it’s a new silhouette. What I mean by that is that it has more room than a RAV4, the best-selling passenger car in the US. That doesn’t include its frunk and pickup truck bed. It is very fast, it’s rear-wheel drive, it’s super fun to drive, and it has a digital experience that no one’s seen — at least that we’ve seen — even in China. The digital experience is quite different for customers. I think the whole package is something that has not been offered in the US or anywhere else to date. I think this first product is quite revolutionary.

And this first product is what you’re going to have out in 2027?

Yes, exactly.

You’ve mentioned BYD, which is a Chinese competitor that is making low-cost, very high-tech EVs. Here in the US, you’re up against Tesla and GM. You mentioned that you have the second-best-selling EV, but GM seems to have had some real luck with the Equinox EVs, and they’re quickly taking off because of price.

Absolutely.

Is the move to put this new platform out against this backdrop enough? Is it enough to compete both here and in China?

For us, it could be. Globally, no,, it’s not enough. In North America, it’s absolutely the right strategy, but it’s not our complete strategy. GM has 14 nameplates, we have three. We came out with our vehicles four or five years ago, and it’s coming out with them now. So, our product cycle is completely different. What I mean by that is we’re about to launch our second generation of products, and it has its first 14 out now. I hope it outsells us. If I were GM with 14 nameplates, it should easily scale. I personally didn’t think we would be number two for three years with our simple lineup, but it seems to have worked so far in the first inning.

The competitive reality is that the Chinese are the 700-pound gorilla in the EV industry. There’s no real competition from Tesla, GM, or Ford with what we’ve seen from China. It is completely dominating the EV landscape globally and more and more outside of China. They have 20 million units locally, and about 11 million are EV or [extended-range EVs], So half that market. We’re barely at a million vehicles here in the US. That’s one tenth of China’s volume. Europe’s only twice as big as us, so that’s maybe only one fifth. China’s successful for good reason. It has great innovation at a very low cost.

For example, it bet on [lithium iron phosphate] technology, not these expensive lithium batteries. There’s hundreds of companies, and they’re all sponsored by their local governments, so they have huge subsidies. It’s new brands. It’s BYD and Geely, and companies like Nio and Xiaomi, many of which have never been in the car business before, and that’s a big advantage for them. In China, the brands that are winning are indigenous brands. They’re not global automotive companies, they’re really Chinese companies. To beat them, we need a completely different approach. It’s not the number of vehicles you have or the price you offer the customer. Everyone’s going to have affordable EVs. If you sell an affordable EV in the US for $30,000 but it costs you $50,000 to make, you could say you have an affordable EV, but that’s not a sustainable business.

Three or four years ago, we saw this affordable customer duty cycle changing with our sales. It became very obvious to me that we had to go outside of Ford, create this maverick group, give them resources and stay out of their way, but make sure that they deliver on a completely new approach because the Chinese are so formidable, they have so much support from the government, and their customers have such a high expectation for the digital experience that an incremental approach from Mach-E would never work.

I love you telling it to me real straight here. It’s exactly what I was thinking. In some ways I’m driving a dinosaur, right? That’s the whole reason I leased a number of years back.

Smart move.

I want to go back to price. I was charging at an Electrify America station in Connecticut recently, and four out of the six stalls had these Chevy Equinox EVs. I asked this woman how she likes hers. She said she liked it, but the thing she was really talking about was the price. She said, “We like this car and the price so much that we actually got two.” And she pointed to her husband who’s in the other stall. I’m not thrilled that this type of family’s taking up all these stalls, but it’s fine. I forgive them.

I’m wondering if just getting that price down so that EVs can finally take off in lower, more affordable areas is one of your motivating factors right now.

To your point, I think it was inevitable that government support would wane. It was inevitable that the duty cycle wound up being EV customers who use their car for commuting and shorter trips, and occasionally taking a longer trip. This happened in the 1910s over 100 years ago. Steam was 30 percent, electric was 30 percent, and the rest was internal combustion engines. A few years later, it was totally different.

Back then you could not call which technology would win. It’s the same now. The EVs came at the high end, and I would say $40,000 is expensive now for most people. We don’t talk about it in the car business because more than two-thirds of the cars sold in the US are used. We never really talk about those two-thirds, but their average price is around $30,000. The average new car is obviously much higher than that. Most of the five-year-old vehicles that people are driving around in the US are going to be around $30,000. This is the most important part of the EV market. It’s not expensive Lucids and Teslas. That’s all interesting, but what is really going to move this market is a non-government-subsidized, affordable EV that people can afford, and that’s at a lower cost to use than a used Model Y because there’s a lot of those around.

For people in America who have a tough time with all their demands, want to go on vacation, want to put their kids through college, and want to have a house or whatever, $30,000 is the most they want to spend. I think that customer you met is very typical. Sorry to use a baseball analogy, but this next inning is completely different from the first one, where the fitness of the companies doesn’t rely on the government, and we have to innovate.

I said it last week, and I’ll emphasize it now: there are no assurances that we can do this. No one has ever built a car in three pieces. No one’s offered their own electric architecture at this price. We’ve never done it. We’ve never had two large unit castings and high quality. No one’s done it. Tesla’s talked about it, but it hasn’t done it. In fact, our manufacturing process has radically moved on beyond what Tesla’s ever shown in its unboxing. So, there’s a lot of risk here. This is not a guarantee that Ford’s going to get this done.

You’ve segued really nicely into my next set of questions, which are the Decoder questions. You’ve set out to build something, and now you’ve got to figure out the structure to build it. You said you had to create a maverick group that was separate from Ford, separate in terms of IT. Now, you’ve got to take this skunkworks engineering team, which I believe is in California, and you’ve got to bring that into the big castle that is Ford.

Yes.

How do you think about integrating these new skunkworks ideas into this bigger system? Have you mapped out how that’s going to happen?

Yes. We’ve been working on that for a couple years now. One of the things that really helped us in that regard was that Alan [Clarke], the leader of this Universal EV Platform team, was free to have Ford people on his team but had the right to say no to anyone. So, he went through a very rigorous process. He’s had the team that scouts for the manufacturing process for all this new stuff for three to four years.Of course, we’ve been listening to them. We have a lot of good experience at Ford, too, that knows how to handle risk in supply chain and risk in manufacturing and new processes like the one we use with aluminum F-150. It’s a different problem, but the same process of risk elimination. It’s a plan that has come together.

It’s important to have a plan, but you get out of the plan pretty quickly because of surprises. The supplier isn’t as good as you thought, they’re running late, or software for a module is running late. Then, you have to really de-risk. The way we’re thinking about it is, “Let’s make a simple one first. Let’s not try to add all the complexity. Why don’t we just make one color, one version, one spec at the beginning, and massively simplify the task for everyone? What is the basic level of software capability?”

We don’t need all the singing and dancing, hands-free automation at launch. Maybe we focus BlueCruise on a simple operating domain like high-speed safety, with hands-off highway operations for the autonomy solution. Then gradually, as we verify the delivery of that base capability — whether it’s the vehicle structure, the manufacturing process of the suppliers, or even automation — we start to introduce more complexity and capability over time when we feel comfortable. That makes it stressful for the go-to-market team because, frankly, they don’t know what they’re going to be selling in a year and a half. But that’s the only way we’ve found to do this.

I want to stay on some more Decoder questions, and call you out. In your first Decoder interview in 2021, you dodged the question, “How do you make decisions?” In fact, I was listening to the episode in my Mach-E last week and just screaming, “Jim, you didn’t answer.” You answered about the company’s strategy, but you didn’t answer how you specifically make decisions. I feel like you’ve had to make some big decisions here with this new platform. So, how do you do it?

Let’s just be specific. In this case, I looked at the wiring loom in the Mach-E. It’s a beautiful wiring loom, but it’s 70 pounds heavier than the Model Y’s wiring loom, and it’s $200 a battery to carry that wiring loom around. I just had to ask myself the question, “Can my team do it?” Taking the wiring loom as a metaphor, can my team beat BYD?

I went to [Executive Chairman] Bill Ford, the board, and my team. I said, “I love you guys, but I don’t think we can do this.” The decision I arrived at, which was highly informed by meeting Doug Fields, was that we had to do it completely separately. Doug is a Model 3 chief engineer and worked on the car project at Apple. He was one of the first-generation software designers in AOS. He also designed the Segway early in his career. He’s been at the forefront of a lot of technology revolutions time and time again. I asked him, “Why can’t Ford do it?” He’s like, “Jim, your part release system, your IT, your CAD design systems are 25 years uncompetitive. There’s no way you can beat BYD with that. You need real expertise.”

BYD has vertical integration with the batteries. Its batteries are 30 percent cheaper than what we can buy from CATL. For us to beat that battery, to even be in the neighborhood in terms of cost, we have to radically redesign the efficiency of the motors, gearboxes, and inverters on the EV side so it uses 30 percent less battery. We can’t beat BYD’s vertical integration on the cost of battery. The only way we can beat it was with innovation on the draw of the battery.

When I got the list of inventory from Doug about what we have to do to beat BYD, even three to four years ago, it became very obvious to me that I had to look my team in the eyes and say, “Eventually we’re going to come back to you for the industrialization of this product. But for now, leave these people alone, trust that they don’t have any prejudice in coming up with something better. If you want to get mad at me, you can come into my office and shout at me, but don’t waste their time.”

I talked to Bill, and I also do Gemba. I go in person for every big decision I ever make. I went to that teardown and looked at every piece. I looked at the number of fasteners in a Model Y. It was literally a third of the fasteners that go into a Mach-E. From a customer standpoint, you won’t tell the difference, but from manufacturability and cost standpoints, fasteners are an output metric for how elegant your engineering solution is. When I looked at those fasteners and the wiring loom, I knew I had no choice because I gemba walked and talked to people who knew. I can’t put the company’s future at risk by making people happy. I have to do the right thing. That’s how I approached that particular decision.

Can I interrupt you quickly to tell me what gemba is?

Gemba is something that I fell in love with at Toyota. Gemba is “genchi genbutsu,” which is a Japanese phrase for “go and see with your own eyes, learn with your own eyes.” It’s actually the five senses. The idea is that before you make a big decision or want to understand a problem, you have to go and see the real problem and where the waste is. It’s a tool in problem solving.

In my case, the waste was that wiring harness, those fasteners, all the welds, the front and rear structures that’ll eventually get displaced by unicasting. You see the waste. You look at it, you ask the engineers: “Why do we have this waste? Why do we use a 25-year-old parts release system?” As a leader, you get down on the floor and you ask them the basic questions, so you can visualize your decision. That’s what gemba is.

Love that. Didn’t know that before. I need to practice gemba, clearly.

Let me back up here. You have to restructure your company, but it also seems like you’ve been talking about restructuring the economy. You’ve been talking about a refocus on the “Essential Economy,” or the blue-collar jobs that are the backbone of this country.

You wrote a LinkedIn essay in June about the focus of AI on white-collar productivity, but that we need to do the same for blue-collar work. How are you thinking about automation at Ford?

There’s a complete crisis in the country that’s not being talked about. People like Mike Rowe will talk about it, but we have a crisis that’s not in the public debate. We have a 500,000 construction worker shortfall. We have a 500,000 factory worker shortfall. We don’t have enough people in emergency services to support our society when things go wrong. Firemen, ambulance workers, medical workers, plumbers, and electricians — the frontline people that make our society run that many of us take for granted.We call this the Essential Economy.

We see this at Ford because we’re on the edge of this software-defined vehicle, but we’re also a heavy manufacturing industrial company. Whether it’s a technician shortage in our dealerships to work on these vehicles or the factory worker shortage, I really learned as a leader during the United Auto Workers (UAW) strike what a crisis we have as a country. I see it with our customers. Plumbers and electricians are constantly trying to get young people into those vocations, and there’s no training. The trade schools and apprentice programs that our grandparents had that made this country so great are not there anymore. We’re very vulnerable as a country.

The productivity of those essential workers, as you said, is way behind that of white-collar workers. Automation, AI deployment, and everything else that has happened for white-collar tools, it’s not the same for blue-collar work. There’s very little training. Companies like Ford, thankfully, have enough resources that we can put our backs behind this problem with trade schools and scholarships, but our society isn’t doing it. In fact, we’re going to have a conference here in Detroit in the fall where we’re going to gather other companies that have the same problem and really see it — solution providers, academics, and creative people in government — and we’re going to try and start working on this problem.

Is it a Farm Aid or medical crisis like COVID? No, it’s more. In a way, it’s just as threatening to our society. The way we’re thinking about it is that we’re going to walk the walk and invest heavily. We have been. We spent about $1 billion on the dignity of the workplace and safety in our plants. We’ve modernized our buildings. We’re investing in trade schools and scholarships to recruit technicians for vehicle repair as well as our factories.

But this is a society problem. The one that bothers me the most is cultural. We, as a culture, think that everyone has to go to an Ivy League school to be valuable in our society, yet we all know that our parents and grandparents made our country wonderful because of these kinds of jobs. There’s incredible dignity in emergency services, and people can have wonderful careers. But our society doesn’t celebrate those people like they do the latest AI engineer.

That’s exactly what I wanted to ask you. This seems like such a reversal of decades of messaging in America that said “Get out of manufacturing and go to the office.” Is your advice to this next generation to actually go get a job in manufacturing?

I think it would help all of us as a society. Look, my son [Jameson] is 17. He’s a senior in high school. He’s got every opportunity that you could ever imagine. He doesn’t have to worry like most people. I made sure that he had a summer job where he learned how to weld, to fabricate, to really work with his hands, and relate to people. And he can make a choice. I have no prejudice for Jameson. If he turns out to be the greatest welder or a mechanic working on our Super Duty diesel engines, I will be so thrilled as a parent. I think we all need to look at ourselves and decide what kind of society we want to build in America. Let’s say that we’re getting into war somewhere. Google’s not going to make the boots, but Ford will. To defend our own country, we need these people.

Now, we’re having critical issues. The average ambulance is 15 years old. We do not have enough emergency care people. Look at what firemen are having to go through in California with smoke and their own health. These are very dangerous jobs, and we have a shortage. It’s going to affect all of us in a lot of annoying ways. We need to really get serious about readjusting our expectations for our kids, younger people, and our country to give them opportunities to grow. And these are great jobs. A factory job at Ford could make way over $100,000 a year, and you can bridge into a lot of other things. My grandfather was a factory worker at Ford, and he became a Ford dealer in his 60s. Think about the possibility. He was an orphan, he had nothing. He never went to college. It didn’t matter to him.

I’m really excited and energized about this. It’s a much bigger problem than fixing Ford and making it a world-class company. It’s important for our country. We need to focus on this just as much as the new exciting AI and the new social media dance on Instagram. Let’s get busy working on these important problems.

I do have a call-in question from a guest caller.

Nilay Patel: Hey, Jim, it’s Nilay. I’m very excited to be calling in with this question. As you know, I’m a Mustang guy. I have a 2021 Mustang GT convertible. It’s one of my favorite cars ever. People love this car because it’s so easy to mod and tune. You can just reprogram the engine control unit (ECU) to make the car go faster. But with the new version of the gas Mustang, the one with all the screens running on your new platform, the ECUs are locked. People can’t just reprogram them. A lot of enthusiasts attribute the recent drop in gas-powered Mustang sales to the locked ECUs.

My questions are: Do you agree with that, that the locked ECUs are behind the recent drop in gas-powered Mustang sales? Do you have a plan to let people unlock the ECUs and tune the car more easily? Thanks for answering the question. Joanna, I’m sure you’re doing a great job.

I have no idea what that question means. So–

[Laughs] I do.

I’m going to set a timer. You get a minute to answer that.

I have this debate with my son, actually, because he has an older Mustang. He didn’t buy the new one for reasons like that. I would absolutely say the drop in sales is not due to that. Actually, we’re doing really well with Mustang. I think we’re the only one left really, which we’re quite proud of. We’re investing a lot in Mustang. I think the thing people don’t get about Mustang is that it’s a global car. It’s the best-selling sports coupe in the world. We outsell Mustang outside of the US than inside the US. When I look at sales for Mustang, I look at globally. The Mustang continues to grow in some of our biggest countries like Australia and Sweden because people want a little slice of that America. Everyone wants to do a burnout.

As far as the vehicle’s tunability, I think the call-in question is outstanding. This is a real dilemma for us, and there’s no easy answer. We want people to modify their cars, but we also have to take quality and privacy really seriously. I think he was talking more about the performance of the vehicle, and over time, our approach would be to give people the option to digitally adjust their vehicle from Ford, so that we can maintain quality but still let the user have their own idea of performance. That’s different for everyone, and I think that vision will come to life in the coming years.

The aftermarket is a real opportunity, but it’s also a big challenge for us because a lot of people like to write software in the control module that controls the powertrain to get better performance. But what they don’t know, and what the user may not be aware of, is that all the reliability and the quality issues that might come up are very expensive. My daughter’s boyfriend is one of these people. He bought a brand new F-150, he’s got a supercharger on it. He recently got a bunch of error codes because he updated the ECU against Ford’s standards, and now he needs thousands of dollars of expensive repairs because the vehicle has started chewing its camshaft. It was great that he could get 650 horsepower out of his EcoBoost F-150. He didn’t think about what he was doing to the reliability of the vehicle, but we have to at Ford.

All I would say is that it’s a tough problem to solve. We always want to give customers a chance to tune their vehicles, but we actually know a lot about the reliability of the vehicle. Are we as a brand going to let our quality reputation suffer to give a person the ability to modify the vehicle? I think that’s a hard compromise for us to make.

I actually understood most of it. I want to move on to the big T in the room: the tariffs. Last quarter, you operated at a loss despite record revenue because you took $800 million in tariff charges in Q2, when tariffs were actually lower than they are now. What are your conversations like right now with the administration?

They’re very important. Ford is the most American company in terms of the quantity of vehicles we make in the US. Over 80 percent of our vehicles sold here are made here. But we also are the largest importer of parts. The discussion we’re having with the administration today covers three policy areas: tailpipe emissions, tax policy, and especially tariffs. On tariffs, the biggest issue is the $2 billion bill for our imported parts. Because we make the most in the US, we import the most parts. We have a lot of stackable tariffs. There’s fentanyl tariffs, [Section 301 tariffs] from China. We have steel and aluminum tariffs that are now over 50 percent. There are a lot of tariffs that a company like Ford gets because there are auto-specific tariffs and non-auto-specific tariffs. They all stack up. So, we have this layering of all these imported parts.

To make an F-150 affordable, there are a lot of parts we can’t make locally, like wiring looms and fasteners. There are thousands and thousands of parts that we have to import because we can’t even buy them in the US. If we did, the vehicle would be $100 to $200 a month too expensive for customers. Our discussions with Washington, D.C. are really clear: “Look, we both agree. Let’s strengthen US companies like Ford that have bet on America. We have more UAW jobs than anyone, but don’t penalize us for trying to make the vehicle affordable.”

We’ve had very productive discussions with the Department of Commerce, the president himself, and the whole administration on how to come up with a way to minimize this $2 billion bill so that we are advantaged as a company. Originally, they were thinking that there would be high tariffs for finished automotive vehicles. Fifty percent of all vehicles bought in the US are imported through a port or a rail across a border. Now, it looks like the standard tariff will be about 15 percent and 12.5 percent from Japan. That’s not a fair fight. We’re just asking for a fair fight. If you’re going to allow people to import with 15 percent tariffs, which includes their parts in the vehicle, but you put a 50, 60, 70 percent tariff on the aluminum steel that goes into our US-made vehicle, let’s work on a process for tariff relief that would allow us to do that and still make the vehicles affordable.

That’s what we’re talking about with the administration. They’re extremely open, and they’re extremely supportive of us. They’re also making a lot of policy changes on tailpipe emissions and tax. Look at the EV credits as an example. We can get to that if you want. But the tariffs are the most critical for our profitability. About 20 percent of our profit has evaporated now because of these parts tariffs. We’re highly engaged with the administration. I remain very optimistic that we will find a solution, but it is very expensive.

I wanted to ask about the EV credits because between the tariffs and the EV credits going away, it feels like this administration is on your side. Yet, you are also adding more jobs than ever to manufacturing here in the US. You’re doing the things the president wants.

Yes. I do generally believe that those three policy areas are very important. Joanna, we didn’t feel like we should get a $7,500 check on an EV to make the transition successful. We do need support for the production tax credit on batteries, so that we could be competitive with China because it has such a huge advantage, and we do need to onshore that IP to start really scaling battery manufacture. You can’t ship a battery overseas. It’s very heavy and it’s not a good shipper, which we say as a shipper.

We have gotten a lot of support from them for making batteries here in the US. The PTC credit is very important. We have changed our EV investment to not depend on the consumer tax credit from the government, and we’re fine with that. Other countries like China and in Europe do support their EV consumers. We didn’t really expect that at Ford. We’re kind of a “lift ourselves up by the bootstraps” kind of company anyway, so that was something we already did.

But the relief on fuel economy standards is a very important topic that the administration clearly has a point of view on. We want one national standard, and we want to be able to sell what customers really want. Hybrids are really popular now, and so are EVs. I think we’ll find a tailpipe emission standard that is more reasonable and sustainable and not have a bunch of states with unique standards that make logistics for cars a nightmare, since you have to send different states different emission-standard cars. And that’s really expensive for customers, too.

The real area that is super critical for Ford and for companies like Ford that are committed to the US, is tariffs, working through and making adjustments as they and bilateral trade deals get announced. We need to find a landing spot that works for companies like Ford, where it’s a level playing field from a tariff standpoint and the administration accomplishes what it wants to accomplish. We’re not there yet, and that’s why we’re working really hard. I spent a lot of time in DC, and there’s a good reason for it. This is really important for our factory workers, for the future of our country, and for the shareholders of Ford.

I want to come back to me because really this whole podcast is about me, obviously.

[Laughs] Good.

One of the main reasons I decided to get the Mach-E, other than it having good range and me loving the way it drives, was that it had Apple CarPlay. Some of your competitors have abandoned CarPlay. A lot of the newer, upstart car companies, like Rivian and Tesla, have their own software. I want to talk about this new Digital Experience you guys are working on, but I want to just cut to the chase with CarPlay. What about CarPlay Ultra? Are you considering that?

We are. We don’t like the execution of Ultra in round one, but we’re very committed to Apple. I’ve talked to Tim [Cook] many times about this. Ford does not have the right, in our opinion, to disrupt someone’s digital life when they get in their car. We want you, Joanna, and all the customers to bring in their digital life, and make it as easy as possible. We don’t think we should restrict that to make money off the customers. We don’t want it to be a hassle. We don’t think we can design an experience that’s going to displace your phone. At the same time, there are things that Ford is working on to add on top of the Google and CarPlay digital experience, whether it’s automated systems or the way a trip gets planned, that will make it even better.

We’re highly informed by what’s going on in China right now, specifically the customer experience part. An AI assistant in the car, let’s say, is very important for Ford. We think that every customer should have an AI assistant in the car. Not just a voice to move to your phone-based AI system but something specific that you can talk to, almost like a companion. To allow everyone to bring their digital life into the car and have it seamlessly integrated is a more complicated journey for us to execute. Then, put more on top of that, whether it’s productivity software (we’re now up to 1 million Ford Pro subscriptions now), BlueCruise, how you plan a trip, or auto specific things like how your [Advanced Driver Assistance Systems] (ADAS) system works and how it integrates into your entertainment system. We believe we have to design something that works with your digital life as well.

It’s a more complicated choice, especially when you look at backcasting it into all of our past vehicles, but I believe it’s a more customer-centric approach. And you will see that, Joanna, in your next shopping trip. You’ll make that choice, we’ll all read about it. That’s our philosophy. Now, other companies have different philosophies, but we believe that our philosophy is the most customer-centric.

But it seems like with the Ford Digital Experience, which you have rolled out to some cars and is based on Android Automotive, that you’re going to have to choose. Are you going to do this Android Automotive experience with the things you’re talking about building on top, or are you going to pick a CarPlay Ultra experience and go all on Apple?

I see what you mean. It’s a really good question. I don’t know where Apple’s going to go. I think Apple has to make a big decision. It’s not a Ford decision, actually. Then, we will decide based on their decision.

You mean that Apple has to make a decision, or are you going to allow this to also run in combination with other infotainment software?

Yes. Not only that, are you going to allow OEMs to control the vehicles? How far do you want the Apple brand to go? Do you want the Apple brand to start the car? Do you want the Apple brand to limit the speed? Do you want the Apple brand to limit access?

We’re doing that now for our Pro customers. If you’re a Pro customer, you can limit access to the vehicle on the weekend. Many of our plumbers and electricians have a company vehicle and they’re not allowed to use it on the weekend. We allow speed control now, so you can’t go above the speed limit. Is Apple going to want to do that? If Apple wants to do that, I think we’re going to have a tough time because then the Digital Experience gets really messy, and we’ll have to decide between Google and Apple, to your point.

Now, Google has two different layers. It has Google Automotive Services, which is a curated digital services experience in the car, but it also has Android Auto, which is an operating system that we can build our own experience on top of. So, Google as a platform company gives us both. Apple has a totally different approach. Again, I’ve talked to the Apple team and our team is in contact with them. I think Apple has to decide if it wants control of the entire experience inside a vehicle. If it does and it wants to follow Ultra with the Ultra 2 or whatever is next, then Ford will have to make a big decision.

I know where we would go. We believe ADAS integration with your entertainment system is so critical. In three or four years when you’re flying down the highway with your eyes off the road going 80 miles an hour on Interstate 5 and you’re watching a movie, having a ChatGPT moment, or having a wearable on, we don’t think that a system from a tech company that’s not integrated into the car is going to save your life. So we’ll have to make a choice.

It sounds to me that you’ve been forced with the reality that you’ve got to build your own.

Yes, but the good thing is that now versus when you and I last talked, Android Auto is advancing nicely. We’ve learned a lot about how to build an experience on that. I hear a lot of OEMs say, “Well, it’s about controlling the customer. I don’t want Apple to be able to...” That’s not a big deal for us. We just want it to be easy for customers. But if those companies want to control the vehicle, I think that’s a bridge too far. In that case, we have to invest a lot more in a Ford experience.

I hope that doesn’t happen, by the way. I look at what has happened with Huawei and Xiaomi in China. It’s amazing. Those companies are all in on auto. When you’re a Huawei or Xiaomi customer, you either buy a Huawei system in someone else’s brand or you buy a Xiaomi car, and it’s completely seamless. I wish our tech companies had approached the auto industry that way, but they haven’t. Now we’ve got to do what we’ve got to do.

You said something really interesting about how you want to have an AI companion in the car. I am actually spending a lot of time in the car now talking to ChatGPT. I’m not listening to Decoder. I have my iPhone, it’s coming through CarPlay, it’s Bluetooth paired, and I’ve got my ChatGPT app. I’m not looking at it, it’s safe. I just have it in voice mode and I’m driving to a meeting to meet you. I’ll say, “Tell me what I should know about Jim Farley and where he’s been in the news.” It’s a very interactive conversation, almost like I’m on the phone.

How do you think about this? Does Ford have to be a part of that relationship?

It’s a good question. I think, yes, especially for anything transportation-related. I want to go somewhere, I want to know about my car and the condition of the car. We either have to be part of the conversation or we have to supply that. Not to be arrogant because of the safety control and the vehicle control, but we actually think we can provide a chat experience that has added value beyond your non-vehicle experience. To your point, we don’t want to burden the customer with two different experiences. That would be really arrogant and really bad for the company.

I think people are starting to realize why you’ve been on this, Joanna. The difference between car companies where you have a software-defined vehicle is not going to be what your sheet metal looks like. It won’t be how powerful your EV motor is. That’s all math. All the cars look nice. It’s going to be this digital experience that says why someone buys this or that. We have to sort this out really thoughtfully.

Now, in China, Nio has an AI companion in the car. It’s like a physical thing. It’s like a little person, and it works really well. Customers love it. If you look at China being ahead of the West in terms of integrating AI as a companion in your vehicle, early indications are that a well done companion-like functionality from the OEMcan add a lot of value to people’s lives. That’s the direction we’re going. It’s similar to not investing in Level 4 autonomy and robotaxis and putting our effort towards Level 3 automated, eyes-off driving in the AI space. It’s a similar kind of bet. Pick a few places where Ford can add value, but don’t make the customer go backwards. That’s our philosophy.

To be clear , you’re more focused on that highway driving experience right now with BlueCruise?

For sure. Our number one priority is to not be the first one to do eyes-off, Level 3highway driving, but to be the best, most reliable, and the safest, the one you want to use for you and your loved ones. We took all the Argo AI people and we gave them a choice. Do you want to do highway high speed, eyes-off automation? Push a button, watch a movie, or whatever people want to do? We could do this podcast in your car.

All of our AI deployment for autonomous driving is going there because we think that’s a cooler problem to solve for most average Americans than a robotaxi. Even though the robotaxi is a really cool problem — I love being in a Waymo — we think that highway miles are a bigger societal opportunity.

Alright, my last question. You get to play car salesman. It’s next August, I got to get rid of this Mach-E. What do I do?

Oh, you need to buy another Mach-E. We’ve improved it a lot since your last one. It’s a lot more affordable. We have some wonderful new experiences. I’m going to give you a run for your money in terms of value. It’s a really incredible product that we’ve refined over four years. The Mach-E’s we’re making now are pretty radically different from the earlier ones. We have OTA updated your car, and I know what improvements were in that. The new vehicle, the compute power onboard, the efficiency, the quality, and the improvements to the fit and finish are all material enough that I think you should test-drive one and see what we have.

There’s a reason why we just beat the revised Model Y, which is the best-selling alternative — not that you would just use that as your benchmark. I think you’re going to have a lot of fun shopping. I’m going to learn a lot as you go shopping, like the rest of America. What I would love for you to do is wait six months because I want to show you this new Universal car. You’re going to go, “Jim, I’m so glad you told me to wait.”

That’s what you can do for me. You can give me an extension on the lease. This is what you should have been doing for me. This is where I would’ve sold me. I would’ve said, “Extension on the lease, six months, we’re going to give you a good deal Joanna. You’re going to be happy.”

And bridge you to something that no one will be able to offer. You’ll go, “Oh, my god, this is so much better than anything I could buy, including the Mach-E. I’m really glad I waited.” That’s the right approach.

See, I should be working in your dealership. That’s how I would’ve sold it. Well, Jim Farley, thank you so much for spending so much time. I’ve got a ton more questions, but we’ll do this again sometime and have you back on the show.

I don’t think you’re driving a dinosaur either. I think you’re driving a fantastic automobile. I love my Mach-E. Frankly, we’re really proud to have you as the owner, and thank you for being on the podcast. I always enjoy our interaction. I can’t wait to learn more about the ChatGPT experience inside your car. I hope you don’t mind if a few of our software engineers call you.

Yeah, they should call me. Again, this is not sponsored. I have been a very happy Mach-E driver. I’ve been in it a lot this summer. We didn’t get to it, but the charging infrastructure has improved so much. I charge for 30 minutes at Electrify America, and Electrify America has gotten better. Get that CEO on here. I charge, I’m on my way. I drove 350 miles up to New Hampshire last week.

Oh good.

I’ve been happy. We’ve got some software things to deal with. We didn’t really get into that, but it sounds like you’re working on it for me.

We are. That you for the time, Joanna. All the best to you.

You too.

""This approach, if permitted, would open the floodgates to multiple competing 'settlements' among differently aligned intervenors that do not include the utility,"" FPL attorneys wrote.
FPL filed an initial rate proposal in February but scaled it back in the proposed settlement filed Aug. 20.
The counter proposal, which was filed Aug. 26, would have resulted in increases of $867 million in 2026 and $403 million in 2027.
The Office of Public Counsel and its allies said the FPL proposal could lead to cumulative increases over four years of $6.903 billion, while the counter proposal would total $5.241 billion.","Florida Power & Light on Friday fired back at a renewed request for state regulators to consider a ""counter proposal"" to a proposed settlement that would increase the utility's base electric rates.

Opponents of the proposed settlement, including the state Office of Public Counsel, which is designated by law to represent utility customers, want the Florida Public Service Commission to consider the counter proposal. Commission Chairman Mike La Rosa, on Sept. 12, denied the request, but the Office of Public Counsel and its allies are seeking reconsideration of that decision.

But in a 32-page document filed Friday, FPL argued the ""request for reconsideration collapses under even the most cursory scrutiny and falls far beneath the legal threshold required to warrant reconsideration before this commission. Moreover, even assuming… that their request met the standard required for reconsideration, which it does not, the (opponents') arguments are legally indefensible and wholly without merit.""

The sparring about the counter proposal has come as the regulatory commission prepares for the Oct. 6 start of what could be a two-week hearing on FPL's proposed four-year settlement, which it reached in August with numerous businesses and groups. The hearing will include complex financial and technical issues and likely will be contentious.

After the FPL settlement was proposed, the Office of Public Counsel and consumer groups last month filed a competing settlement proposal that, in part, would lead to smaller rate increases. But La Rosa, acting as a prehearing officer in the case, dismissed the counter proposal, ruling that FPL is an ""indispensable party to any settlement.""

Attorneys for the opponents on Sept. 19 filed a motion for reconsideration, saying the Florida Supreme Court has never ruled on whether a utility would have to be a party to a settlement.

""If the commission were to find that the terms of the (counter proposal) were in the public interest, and that the (counter proposal) would result in fair, just, and reasonable rates, then the commission would have just as much authority to approve it without FPL's consent or over FPL's objection,"" the motion for reconsideration said.

Also, the motion said the regulatory commission's authority to set utility rates is ""not conditioned on any party's approval or absence of objection, including FPL.""

But in the document filed Friday, FPL said ""there simply is no authority or precedent to support the proposition that the commission can resolve a contested matter by approving a settlement or stipulation that does not include the utility in question.""

""This approach, if permitted, would open the floodgates to multiple competing 'settlements' among differently aligned intervenors that do not include the utility,"" FPL attorneys wrote. ""In other words, intervenors representing endless combinations of aligned interests could settle with themselves — all in the same proceeding and without the utility — in multiple versions of 'settlements.' This approach to 'settlement' defies logic because it does not result in the resolution of a dispute between opposing parties — it merely memorializes an agreement among aligned parties.""

FPL filed an initial rate proposal in February but scaled it back in the proposed settlement filed Aug. 20. FPL reached its proposed settlement with the Florida Industrial Power Users Group; the Florida Retail Federation; the Florida Energy for Innovation Association; Americans for Affordable Clean Energy; the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy; Walmart Inc.; EVgo Services, LLC; Circle K Stores, Inc.; RaceTrac Inc.; Wawa, Inc.; Electrify America, LLC; Armstrong World Industries, Inc.; and federal government agencies.

The proposed settlement would lead to base-rate increases of $945 million in 2026 and $766 million in 2027, according to the utility. FPL also would collect additional amounts in 2028 and 2029 for solar-energy and battery-storage projects.

The counter proposal, which was filed Aug. 26, would have resulted in increases of $867 million in 2026 and $403 million in 2027. It also would have left open the possibility of FPL seeking increases of an estimated $195 million in 2028 and $174 million in 2029 for generation-related projects that could include solar and battery projects.

The Office of Public Counsel and its allies said the FPL proposal could lead to cumulative increases over four years of $6.903 billion, while the counter proposal would total $5.241 billion.

Along with the Office of Public Counsel, the counter proposal was filed by the groups Florida Rising, the League of United Latin American Citizens of Florida, Environmental Confederation of Southwest Florida and Floridians Against Increased Rates.",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2024/12/30/1f029fb5-e206-44ef-8986-e704d588a2de/thumbnail/1200x630/a82eb547cc0e2f9a1521316f8539601a/cbsmiami-energy-bill-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 15:03:10.751813

Outlook The report projects that cumulative U.S. energy storage capacity will reach 87.8 GW/261.2 GWh by 2029, with growth led by residential and utility-scale storage.","The U.S. energy storage market achieved its strongest ever quarter in the second quarter (Q2) of the financial year 2025, with total installations reaching 5.6 GW/17.8 GWh, according to the latest U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie.

The utility-scale segment accounted for 4.9 GW/15 GWh of this total, a 63% year-on-year increase. Texas, California, and Arizona together contributed nearly 75% of this newly installed capacity, each adding around 1.2 GW.

Oklahoma re-entered the utility-scale market with three projects totaling 170 MW, while the national project pipeline has seen some contraction, falling from 1,080 projects in 2024 to 801 in 2025, a 26% decline.

Installations for the residential storage sector increased by 8% quarter-on-quarter, with California, Arizona, and Illinois driving the majority of the growth. The rise is largely attributed to state-level policies such as California’s Net Billing Tariff, declining solar export rates, and additional state incentives in California, Arizona, and Illinois.

Higher-capacity systems are increasingly being adopted in the residential market, which is projected to outpace solar in growth due to high policy resilience, strong attachment rates in markets such as California and Puerto Rico, and continued access to the federal investment tax credit (ITC), particularly under third-party ownership models.

For 2025 alone, residential storage growth is forecast to reach 96% in terms of megawatts and 41% in terms of the number of installations.

CCI Market Gains Momentum

The community, commercial, and industrial (CCI) market posted its best second quarter since 2023, driven by commercial solar-plus-storage deployments in California under the state’s Net Energy Metering 3.0 framework.

Storage incentive programs in New York, Illinois, and Massachusetts are also contributing to steady growth, although community storage remains limited due to high development costs and policy constraints.

Massachusetts’ upcoming SMART 3.0 program is expected to provide future support, though nationwide CCI capacity is projected to remain under 1 GW by 2029.

OBBBA and Federal Policy

Federal policy developments under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) have preserved ITC benefits for most storage applications but introduced new equipment sourcing requirements that take effect after 2025.

This has led to a rush to begin project construction ahead of the restrictions, temporarily boosting forecasts according to the report. While domestic cell supply is expected to ramp up, supply chain limitations and U.S.–China trade barriers are likely to create challenges.

Distributed storage remains highly sensitive to OBBBA impacts, with the CCI sector potentially benefiting from reduced solar incentives, which could lead to an increase in solar-plus-storage installations. However, growth is expected to remain slow. For residential storage, the decline in solar incentives may accelerate the adoption of virtual power plants and third-party ownership models.

Low Case Forecast and Risks

The low-case scenario forecasts a potential reduction of 16.5 GW, or 19%, in cumulative installations between 2025 and 2029, driven by risks including supply shortages compliant with the Foreign Entity of Concern (FEOC) rule, sustained trade barriers with China, and delays in federal land permitting for renewable projects.

In this downside case, utility-scale projects would be most affected, particularly those not safe-harbored in 2025. Residential forecasts would be constrained by uncertainty around FEOC-compliant supply and potential restrictions on third-party ownership qualification for the ITC.

The CCI sector would face further headwinds if the rollout of Massachusetts’ SMART 3.0 program is slow, and costs remain high.

However, the report notes that the final version of OBBBA was less restrictive than the House bill, which had proposed a 60-day construction start window and a 2028 in-service deadline to qualify for the ITC.

As a result, the low-case outlook was raised by 23% quarter-on-quarter compared to the earlier baseline, which had assumed the stricter House version would pass.

Beyond the 2025–2029 outlook period, downside risks remain if gas supply chain bottlenecks ease and permitting restrictions increase for solar and storage projects. These conditions could slow the pace of deployment in the longer term.

Financial and Market Implications

The scale of Q2 2025 installations underscores the growing importance of storage as a vital component of the U.S. energy transition. With 7.6 GW installed in the first half of 2025, the year is expected to set a new annual record for storage deployment.

While policy and supply chain challenges persist, particularly in terms of equipment sourcing requirements and federal permitting, the resilience of the residential market and the dominance of leading states such as California, Texas, and Arizona position the U.S. storage sector for continued growth.

The utility-scale market remains vulnerable to policy and trade uncertainty; however, the extension of the ITC provides a foundation for sustained development over the next decade.

Residential and distributed storage are increasingly adapting through models such as virtual power plants and third-party ownership, ensuring continued deployment even as solar incentives decline.

The CCI segment, though lagging, is likely to see incremental growth supported by state-level incentive programs and the eventual rollout of SMART 3.0 in Massachusetts.

Overall, the report underscores both the opportunities and challenges facing the U.S. storage market. Strong near-term growth is balanced by risks of supply shortages and policy headwinds, but the cumulative capacity of nearly 88 GW by 2029 remains achievable under the base case.

Outlook

The report projects that cumulative U.S. energy storage capacity will reach 87.8 GW/261.2 GWh by 2029, with growth led by residential and utility-scale storage. Utility-scale capacity is forecast to reach 72 GW/259 GWh by 2029 despite a projected 10% year-on-year decline in 2027.

After 2025, which is expected to remain the record year for utility-scale installations, annual deployments are not expected to reach similar levels until 2029. Federal policy will continue to be a significant factor in shaping the outlook.

While the ITC has been extended through 2033, new equipment sourcing requirements and continued uncertainty in global trade are expected to slow growth. The strongest markets for utility-scale deployment will continue to be California, Texas, and other states with favorable storage policies, coupled with high load growth.

The residential segment is expected to remain the most resilient, with growth supported by virtual power plant models and third-party ownership structures, even as solar incentives decline.

The CCI segment is forecasted to experience gradual growth, although the sector will face challenges from high costs and slower transitions to programs that reduce support for solar projects.

The U.S. energy storage market added more than 2 GW across all segments in the first quarter of 2025, marking the highest Q1 on record, according to U.S. Energy Storage Monitor report from the American Clean Power Association and Wood Mackenzie.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/Copy-of-Mercom-FI-2025-06-18T121458.313.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:18.195372

This move continues the company’s path to delivering affordable fusion energy, following 50 years of applied innovation at U.S. National Laboratories in New Mexico and California.
“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, Co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion.
Pacific Fusion will receive these incentives as it meets its commitments to create new jobs and make significant capital investments.
The Pacific Fusion headquarters, including three research and development campuses, will remain in California.","Pacific Fusion has selected Albuquerque, New Mexico as the site for its first research and manufacturing campus. The company plans to build the $1 billion campus at Mesa del Sol and expects to create more than 200 high-wage jobs and hundreds of construction jobs. This move continues the company’s path to delivering affordable fusion energy, following 50 years of applied innovation at U.S. National Laboratories in New Mexico and California.

“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, Co-founder and CTO of Pacific Fusion. “Working alongside the City of Albuquerque, the Governor’s office, and the state’s economic development leaders, we’ve built true partnerships that give us confidence we can move quickly to deliver on the promise of low-cost fusion power.”

Supporting the project is legislation signed by Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller on September 26, 2025 authorizing the performance-based incentives that include: $10 million in Local Economic Development Act funds; $9 million from the State; and $1 million from the City, as well as $776 million in City-issued Industrial Revenue Bonds, abating property taxes over 20 years. Pacific Fusion will receive these incentives as it meets its commitments to create new jobs and make significant capital investments.

“After years of working to build Albuquerque as a hub for energy technology innovation, Pacific Fusion joins a growing number of companies that are choosing our city to literally ‘power’ our future,” said Mayor Keller. “Today is proof of the assertion that we have passed a turning point — that our city is not only on the map, but can define the next chapter of clean energy innovation.”

The Albuquerque campus will house Pacific Fusion’s Demonstration System, with the goal of achieving net facility gain, producing more energy from a fusion reaction than the total energy used, by 2030. Pacific Fusion’s decision builds on New Mexico’s long history of energy innovation and decades of research at Sandia National Laboratories, while adding to the city’s growing clean-tech ecosystem.

“Pacific Fusion’s decision to build in Albuquerque proves our city is ready to lead in the industries of the future,” said the City of Albuquerque Economic Development Director Max Gruner. “This project will bring good jobs, drive innovation, and anchor a clean-energy ecosystem that benefits our entire community.”

Stated the company: “Our Albuquerque campus will build on New Mexico’s legacy in applied physics, including decades of foundational research at Sandia National Laboratories. The state’s expertise in advanced energy technologies, workforce that aligns with our future hiring needs, and capital-efficient environment for large projects make it a natural choice for Pacific Fusion’s strategic expansion.”

Construction on the new Mesa del Sol facility is scheduled to begin in 2026, with manufacturing operations launching before the end of the year.

The Pacific Fusion headquarters, including three research and development campuses, will remain in California. Over the last year, the company has tripled its California-based team to more than 110 employees and also expanded its Bay Area footprint.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/albuquerque_new_mexico_downtown.jpeg,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:34.298436

The words on the DOE list are at the heart of EERE’s mission: It is the government’s largest investor in technologies that help reduce heat-trapping emissions that cause climate change as well as the hazardous pollution from fossil fuels. It is the latest in a series of Trump administration efforts to dispute, silence or downplay the realities of climate change.

“Please ensure that every member of your team is aware that this is the latest list of words to avoid — and continue to be conscientious about avoiding any terminology that you know to be misaligned with the Administration’s perspectives and priorities,” the directive from acting director of external affairs Rachel Overbey said.

Those instructions apply to both public-facing and internal communications and cover documents such as requests for information for federal funding opportunities, reports and briefings.

In addition to “climate change” and “green,” EERE forbid officials from using “emissions” to avoid the implication that they are a negative. Climate change is caused by rising greenhouse gas emissions, which is driven primarily by burning oil, coal and natural gas for energy.

Other terms officials must ditch include “energy transition,” “sustainability/sustainable,” “‘clean’ or ‘dirty’ energy,” “Carbon/CO2 ‘Footprint’” and “Tax breaks/tax credits/subsidies.”

DOE did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The new policies come days after President Donald Trump excoriated world leaders at the United Nations General Assembly for pursuing actions to confront rising emissions.

“I’ve been right about everything and I’m telling you that if you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,” he said during his Tuesday speech.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has also sought to impugn climate science by touting a report he commissioned that downplayed the role rising emissions have had in worsening weather extremes. He has endorsed some of the report’s most controversial findings, such as claiming the potential benefits of a warmer planet are undervalued.

DOE has been at the forefront of the Trump administration’s efforts to quash renewable energy subsidies and incentives. Last week, Wright canceled $13 billion of funding for renewable energy projects and took shots at wind and solar incentives that the Republican megalaw will quickly sunset after more than three decades of existence.

By Roberto Hugo González

Westlake, Texas — September 2025- Governor Greg Abbott highlighted Texas’ expanding economic influence during the Texas Economic Development Corporation (TxEDC) Investor Summit, held at Hillwood’s Circle T Ranch in Westlake and hosted by Ross Perot, Jr. Themed “Texas Takeover: America’s New Financial Hub,” the summit convened more than 200 business leaders, investors, and officials from across the state and the nation.

In a fireside chat moderated by Glenn Hamer, President and CEO of the Texas Association of Business, Abbott pointed to the advantages driving Texas’ economy. These include a “booming, diversified economy anchored by technology, energy, and manufacturing,” a “young, skilled, and diverse workforce ready to power growth,” and what he described as a “predictable regulatory climate and no state income tax that gives Texas an edge over coastal competitors.”

“We’re cutting red tape and keeping government out of the way so both small businesses and large investors can thrive here in Texas,” Abbott said, according to the Governor’s Office. “The future of finance is no longer limited to New York or California—Texas is leading the way.”

The governor emphasized the Dallas–Fort Worth region’s emergence as a financial hub, highlighting expansions by Nasdaq, NYSE, and multiple Fortune 500 relocations. He was joined on stage by Arun Agarwal, Chair of the TxEDC Board of Directors, and Aaron Demerson, President and CEO of TxEDC, who both underscored the summit’s role in advancing Texas’ global competitiveness.

The program featured panels on venture capital, private equity, and banking, as well as networking opportunities for institutional investors. TxEDC also introduced its new Investor Guide, a resource designed for businesses evaluating expansion or relocation to the state of Texas.

The summit reinforced Texas’ goal of becoming a premier financial center in addition to its traditional leadership in energy, aerospace, and technology.

Economic development leaders from across the Rio Grande Valley also attended. Teclo Garcia, CEO of the Mission Economic Development Office, praised the event: “Thank you, Governor Greg Abbott and your economic development & tourism team, for hosting an outstanding Texas Economic Development Corporation Investor Summit and for delivering a strong message of competitiveness and Texas leadership in innovation and business as we advance.”

Garcia added that it was an opportunity to reconnect with state leaders and colleagues. “It was good to catch up with TxEDC Board of Directors Chairman Arun Agarwal, TxEDC President & CEO Aaron Demerson, Adriana Cruz, Executive Director of the Governor’s Office of Economic Development and Tourism, and good RGV friend Fernanda S., an industry specialist within the ED&T office, as well as Dr. Valerie G. Segovia. Excellent work on the dynamic meeting and for all the leadership.”

Garcia also noted the participation of other Rio Grande Valley representatives, including Adam Gonzalez and Dalith Cantu, Industrial Development Executive at Cil Commodities Integrated Logistics.

“I am grateful to Ross Perot Jr. for hosting the 200+ leaders from around the state at the beautiful Circle T Ranch,” Garcia said. “Texas is on the right road for economic development.”",https://texasborderbusiness.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/MEDC-Abbott.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 12:09:52.148389

How Newsom handles the energy crisis will weigh heavily on Californian’s pocketbooks, but also on his prospects for higher office.
California fuel prices are inflated by environmental fees and taxes, a requirement for a unique fuel blend that cuts air pollution and dwindling in-state supply.

Newsom, a Democrat in his second and final term, is making a remarkable shift in his approach after leading a yearslong crusade against fossil fuels - which may have ended up being more successful than he intended. California, often home to the country’s highest gasoline prices, is now staring down a potential energy crisis as the industry pulls up stakes.

Chevron Corp. moved its headquarters out of the Golden State, refineries are closing, a key oil pipeline is hemorrhaging money and Republicans are warning that gasoline prices could soon top $8 a gallon ($2.11 per liter).

Newsom has disputed that estimate, but says it’s a top priority to bring down gasoline prices for Californians. The focus comes amid growing speculation that he’s gearing up for a presidential run in 2028.

The cost of living is a top issue for Americans, and steep fuel prices in California have been central to critics’ attacks on Newsom. President Donald Trump has highlighted the issue, there are billboards dotting California highways blaming Newsom and opponents took out a full-page newspaper ad mocking “Gavin’s Gas Station” where prices are “$2 higher than the other guys.”

“Newsom owns this gas crisis,” Brian W. Jones, the Republican leader in the state Senate, said in a statement. “His policies have made it nearly impossible for California refineries to stay open.”

Now Newsom has approved the biggest streamlining of oil permitting the state has seen in decades, enraging environmentalists who say he’s taking a page from Trump’s “drill, baby, drill” play book. His regulators spent months working closely with the industry to come up with avenues to deregulate and increase profits. Lawmakers even discussed giving Texas-based Valero Energy Corp. hundreds of millions of dollars to keep its San Francisco Bay area refinery open.

“This is not an ideological endeavor,” Newsom told journalists this month, applauding the oil drilling legislation, which was part of a larger package of bills seeking to stabilize the state’s energy markets. “We’re in the practical application businesses.”

More oil drilling will allow California to reduce price spikes at the pump while marching forward with a years-long transition away from fossil fuels, his office said. And Newsom’s pivot is only a partial win for the industry. The governor also approved tighter regulations on offshore drilling that will hamper efforts to restart a controversial pipeline north of Santa Barbara. A carbon trading program will force polluters to pay billions of dollars for greenhouse gas emissions over two decades.

As Newsom works to raise his national profile, he has sought to project a more open stance, hosting conservative guests including Stephen Bannon and the late Charlie Kirk on his podcast. He highlights his sense of humor with social-media posts that mimic Trump’s style. How Newsom handles the energy crisis will weigh heavily on Californian’s pocketbooks, but also on his prospects for higher office.

“He has called for the end of an industry that is completely vital in our state,” said Congressman Vince Fong, a Republican who represents oil production hubs in California’s Kern County. “And he is begrudgingly acknowledging the fact that he needs their input.”

California has long been controlled by Democrats and long had some of the country’s most expensive gasoline prices, currently averaging about $4.47 a gallon, more than $1 above the US mean. California fuel prices are inflated by environmental fees and taxes, a requirement for a unique fuel blend that cuts air pollution and dwindling in-state supply.

The current crisis has its roots in attempts to keep prices in check. In 2023 and 2024, Newson signed measures that sought to establish a maximum profit margin for refiners and required that they keep a minimum level of fuel on hand to mitigate the impact of any disruptions.

Two days after Newsom signed the bill on inventories in October 2024, Phillips 66 announced it would close its more-than-century-old Los Angeles refinery by the end of 2025, removing over 139,000 barrels a day of fuel from a market whose top politicians and energy regulator were busy trying to shore up supply.

In April, Valero announced it planned to close its 145,000-barrel-a-day Benicia refinery - about 35 miles (56 kilometers) northeast of San Francisco - by April 2026. The company cited, in part, an $82 million penalty that local and state environmental regulators imposed in 2024 for violations related to cancer-causing emissions that went unreported.

The state’s largest inland oil pipeline, operated by Crimson Midstream LLC, is losing $2 million a month and could close this year as demand for oil from the few remaining Bay Area refiners slows to a trickle.

Meanwhile, gasoline imports are expected to replace the shuttered refinery output, but the industry has warned it isn’t ready for new emissions regulations at ports.

There is a “new or renewed understanding that all this is intertwined,” Jas Sajjan, the head of government affairs at oil driller California Resources Corp., said in an interview.

Crude capacity

All together, almost one-fifth of the state’s crude-processing capacity is set to vanish in the coming year. Many in California’s fuel industry say it was the Valero announcement that finally got lawmakers’ attention.

“We have a crisis on our hands that may have been self-created,” Democratic Senator David Alvarez said in a May hearing with the California Energy Commission, a powerful state body that sets standards for the industry.

As the risks became apparent, Newsom backed off his attacks on the industry. In April, he sent a letter to the commission, instructing Vice Chair Siva Gunda to work with refiners to ensure affordable and reliable fuel supplies. And regulators began meeting with the oil industry, alongside labor unions and environmental groups, in closed-door sessions to hash out a path forward, according to people who attended the meetings.

The administration has a “firm belief” that refiners “can profitably operate in California - a market where demand for gasoline will still exist for years to come,” Newsom said in the letter.

Two months later, much of the industry’s wishes were incorporated into a 24-page proposal to stabilize California’s fuel markets. The California Energy Commission said Newsom shouldn’t move forward with the profit cap on oil refineries. Gunda also said California should increase fuel imports to make up for refinery closures and stabilize in-state oil production, especially in the once prolific Kern County oil basin.

It came after Gunda made several trips to San Antonio and Houston to meet with officials from Valero and Phillips 66. The companies made it clear that they were focused on profits. Environmental laws weighed on their margins and they were concerned that in-state oil producers would be underpriced by imported oil not subject to the state’s strict environmental regulations, the California Energy Commission said.

Among environmental groups, there was surprise at how receptive lawmakers were to pocketbook arguments being made by the industry. “Fear mongering around price shocks sent legislators scrambling,” said Faraz Rizvi, policy and campaign manager for the Asian Pacific Environmental Network. Oil lobbyists and refiners “smelled blood in the water,” Rizvi said.

California’s looming oil crisis is most apparent in Benicia. Hugging San Francisco Bay, the small town has been home to an oil refinery for more than 50 years. If Valero goes through with plans to shutter its site, it could wipe out 10% of the city’s annual tax revenue.

“I was thinking this is something we would be dealing with in 2035, not 2025,” said City Manager Mario Giuliani, who is planning for budget cuts next year. The town, he said, is a small window into the energy crisis that could soon face the entire state.

Benicia, with the help of the Valero refinery that was once owned by Exxon, has flourished with healthy tax revenues, Giuliani said. In the shadow of the refinery, Benicia grew into an affluent suburb with an attractive waterfront and small-town feel.

But change is coming soon. The town has already stopped paying for July 4 fireworks and an annual Christmas tree lighting due to budgetary constraints. Next year, cuts will be far more severe without Valero, the single largest taxpayer. “It provided that economic blanket to remain a small community,” Giuliani said. “Well, now that is gone.”

A last-minute attempt by lawmakers to pay Valero hundreds of million of dollars to keep the refinery open hasn’t materialized, and the state has six months before the company cuts off a key source of supply to Northern California.

The new reality in California, and Newsom’s pivot, may also usher in an era in which Democrats will seek to work with the oil and gas industry instead of taking an outright hostile stance.

Henry Stern, a Democratic state senator who has championed environmental causes, acknowledged that there’s now an appetite among a diverse range of Democrats for more oil drilling in California, alongside more aggressive climate action.

“It’s strange for me to be talking this way sometimes,” he added.","https://www.detroitnews.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/09/29/PDTN/86418668007-newsombg-mojwzj-3-ozjdkjd-4-cabuh-44-shsy.jpg?crop=3996,2251,x0,y290&width=3200&height=1803&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-09-29 12:08:22.366741

One year after Meta began data center operations at its new campus in Montgomery, Alabama, the tech giant is heading back into the city to expand the site. Last week, Meta announced a $700 million investment would introduce two new facilities and 100 new direct jobs. This move would bring the campus to a total of 1.3 million sq. ft. once complete. Energy used at the site will be matched with 100% renewable energy, in addition to new renewable energy projects that will bring 227 megawatts to Alabama’s electricity grid. “Montgomery has proven to be a perfect home for our data center, and we are excited to be expanding,” the company said in its announcement. Before the end of the year Meta plans to launch its Data Center Community Action Grants program in the region. This annual program will provide funding for technology-focused projects that enhance the community and boost local STEAM education, building upon the company’s partnerships with the Montgomery Public Schools system and non-profit organizations for skills building initiatives.

A FAVORABLE BUSINESS CLIMATE CAPTURES ELI LILLY

In order to boost Eli Lilly and Company’s small molecule drug production pipeline, the manufacturer is heading to Houston, Texas, with a $6.5 billion project investment. This is the second facility to come of the company’s $27 billion commitment to four new U.S. manufacturing sites. The location at Generation Park was said to be chosen based on local incentives, access to utilities, transportation and its overall business environment. Notably, the new Houston plant is among a few sites chosen to manufacture Eli Lilly’s first oral, small molecule GLP-1 receptor agonist, known as orforglipron, which will be submitted to global regulatory agencies by the end of 2026. “Our new Houston site will enhance Lilly’s ability to manufacture orforglipron at scale and, if approved, help fulfill the medicine’s potential as a metabolic health treatment for tens of millions of people worldwide who prefer the ease of a pill that can be taken without food and water restrictions,” said Eli Lilly Chair and CEO David A. Ricks. “This significant U.S. investment and onshoring of our API production capabilities will ensure faster, more secure access to orforglipron and to other life-changing medicines of the future.” Anticipated to be complete by 2030, the investment will create 615 new jobs in the region.

TERMINAL INVESTMENT DIVES DEEP IN SPAIN

A $165.6 million expansion initiative will soon boost APM Terminals’ annual capacity to 1.23 million twenty-foot equivalent units at the Port of Barcelona in Spain. Over the next three years, the Netherlands-based logistics company will pursue modernization and expansion that will not only scale the Port’s activity but also target its decarbonization goals via a new Offshore Power Supply system that provides docked ships access to power supply through the local grid. The move will cut emissions while improving environmental performance at the port. “[The modernization is] a strategic milestone for APM Terminals and reaffirms our firm commitment to the port development of Barcelona and to the sustainable growth of Spain as a key logistics hub in Europe,” said APM Terminals Spanish Gateways Managing Director Julián Fernández. The expansion phase of the project details reinforcing the South Quay berths; replacing rails for new Ship-to-Shore cranes; updating infrastructure to support up to 15-meter (49-ft.) drafts; and ensuring the terminal can handle two mega-container ships at once.

Gore indicated during his interview with Harder that this new demand may help reverse a problem that has halted the growth of the nuclear energy industry over the past few decades—namely, high costs. “For a variety of reasons, [nuclear power] has priced itself out of the market as the market used to exist. Now the market is different. . . . I think a lot of large users of electricity are recalculating whether or not they want to place very large, one-time bets for a huge increment of power in the form of nuclear,” Gore said. “And I think you’re going to see some resurgence of nuclear power.”

Eager to discuss nuclear: Harder writes that Gore “was eager to dive deeper into nuclear power in our conversation. Unprompted, he sought to address various concerns about it.”

Of used fuel Gore told Harder, “I think that the waste can be stored safely.” He also touched on nonproliferation during the interview, saying, “I think the terrorism threats are real, but they’re shared by a lot of other kinds of facilities around the world. . . . The proliferation issues are very real and have to be attended to with extreme care, safety of operation.” I think we can handle that. I really do.

Still, doubts: According to Harder, Gore expressed some reservations about nuclear. “The cost issue is the one that’s really a barrier to the expansion of nuclear,” he said.

Regard small modular reactors, Gore wasn’t sure how big of a role they would play in a nuclear resurgence “due to their price tag.” He said, “Some of the most responsible policy analysts that I respect are now shifting back away from SMRs as maybe a technological dead end again.”",https://cdn.ans.org/i/favicon-128.png,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:21.739147

Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

The colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, about 50 miles west of Vicksburg, Mississippi. But not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a “kill switch” law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Floriday’s Nova Southeastern University powers student housing with floating solar

Nova Southeastern University (NSU), in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, has become the first university in the United States to host a commercial floating solar photovoltaic (FPV) system. The 700kW array, developed by D3Energy, will directly power student housing on campus and marks a milestone in bringing clean energy to higher education.

“This installation at NSU demonstrates how floating solar can deliver real benefits for institutions that may not have the land or rooftop space for large-scale solar,” said Stetson Tchividjian, managing director of D3Energy, which specializes in floating solar development in the United States, “We’re proud to be pioneering solutions that reduce costs and support sustainability goals, while opening the door for universities to lead by example in renewable energy adoption.”

Cool factor: Floating solar is one of the fastest-growing clean energy technologies worldwide. The FPV system spans nearly two acres and includes 1,200 solar modules secured with an advanced anchoring system built for hurricane-force winds. It uses Ciel & Terre’s Hydrelio floating platform, a global leader in FPV manufacturing. Construction is underway, with grid connection expected by year’s end. Once complete, the project will offset a significant share of the electricity needs at Mako Hall, Nova Southeastern University’s latest student housing complex, providing clean energy directly where students live and study.

Avangrid’s new Oregon Trail Solar project will help power data centers

Avangrid Inc., signed a PPA with Amazon for energy from a new solar project called Oregon Trail Solar. The 57 MWdc (41 MWac) facility will be located in Gilliam County, Oregon, and will supply renewable energy for Amazon data centers in the region. The project will be operational in 2027.

“This agreement reflects Amazon and Avangrid’s commitment to delivering reliable energy solutions that will help meet America’s growing energy needs and support the growth of critical infrastructure,” said Jose Antonio Miranda, Avangrid CEO. “Oregon Trail Solar builds on our strong presence in Oregon and deep partnership with Amazon, and we’re proud to help power the future with projects that bring lasting economic benefits to local communities, bolster our nation’s energy independence, and maximize energy production.”

Cool factor: Oregon Trail Solar represents the second recent renewable energy PPA between Avangrid and Amazon in the Pacific Northwest, adding to a previously announced deal for power from the Leaning Juniper IIA repower project, also located in Gilliam County. Avangrid and Amazon have agreements to generate power from several renewable energy projects in Illinois, Ohio and North Carolina as well.

Construction of Oregon Trail is expected to generate 200 jobs, mostly filled by local union labor. It will use over 100,000 solar panels and produce the same amount of electricity used by about 10,000 U.S. homes each year. Operations at Oregon Trail will also support several new full-time jobs in the community. Over its lifetime, Avangrid expects the project to contribute $6 million in combined PILOTs (payment in lieu of taxes), as well as property taxes for Gilliam County which will support a variety of public services, including schools and infrastructure.

Oregon Trail will add to Avangrid’s longstanding presence in the state, with its oldest project dating back to 2001. Today, the company operates 2.5 GW of capacity in Oregon. Avangrid also maintains its National Training Center in neighboring Sherman County and a large corporate office in Portland.

Lightstar Renewables launches New York’s first agrivoltaics project

Lightstar Renewables LLC hosted a ribbon-cutting ceremony to celebrate the groundbreaking for Plains Road agrivoltaics project Montgomery, New York. The commissioning event was held at the DiMartino Farm, drawing attendance from state officials, agricultural leaders, and local media, and other local faming families. Representing Assembly Member Brian Maher, whose legislative support was instrumental in the project’s development, was his chief of staff, Meghan Hurlburt. She stood alongside representatives from American Farmland Trust (AFT) and Iain Ward, farmer, founder, and CEO of Solar Agricultural Services Inc. (SolAg).

“Today marks a turning point for sustainable development in New York,” Maher said in a statement. “The Plains Road project demonstrates how we can honor our agricultural heritage while meeting our clean energy goals. This is the kind of innovative thinking we need to build a resilient future for rural communities.”

Cool factor: The Plains Road project marks New York’s first agrivoltaics installation. The ribbon-cutting ceremony highlighted the unique design features that allow hay planting and harvesting equipment to operate seamlessly around the solar facility. The project will also add two acres of vegetable production, providing opportunities for new entry farmers while generating enough clean energy to power 466 homes annually.

Ever.green uses RECs to support 28 MW solar project in South Carolina

Ever.green partnered with Wells Fargo through a long-term purchase of High-Impact RECs to support a 28 MW solar project in Lee County, South Carolina. The deal displays how corporate energy buyers can accelerate the deployment of new renewable energy projects. The solar installation, developed by Headwater Energy, will generate approximately 50,000 MWh of electricity annually.

“High-Impact RECs are making it easier for companies to directly support new, impactful projects,” said Cris Eugster, CEO of Ever.green. “This project is a powerful example of how forward-thinking buyers can accelerate the energy transition while advancing grid resilience.”

Cool factor: Ever.green’s High-Impact RECs are renewable energy certificates sourced from yet-built clean energy projects via long-term, fixed-price forward contracts that are material to the project’s finance-ability. Projects are selected for their ability to maximize climate impact, minimize environmental harm, and deliver social benefits.

The Bishopville project uses low-carbon, domestically manufactured solar panels, helping to create new U.S. manufacturing jobs while strengthening the domestic energy supply chain. The panels use thin-film technology, which performs well in hot and humid climates, and they are both sustainably constructed and designed to be recycled at their end-of-life. A comprehensive environmental assessment of the project ensured compliance with biodiversity and land use protections, including the safeguarding of wetlands and floodplains through best management practices. Non-reflective panels and habitat preservation efforts have helped minimize impacts on 12 migratory bird species. At the end of its useful life, the site will be fully restored with native vegetation to preserve local ecosystems.

OCI Energy, ING finalize construction financing for battery project in Texas

OCI Energy has closed on the construction financing for its Project Alamo City, a flagship BESS installation under development in Bexar County, Texas. OCI Energy selected ING to underwrite the construction financing package which includes a construction-to-term loan, a tax equity bridge loan, and letters of credit. ING served as sole coordinating lead arranger, sole bookrunner, and sole green loan coordinator, and will also act as administrative agent. The relationship between ING and OCI Energy has proven instrumental in advancing the project from concept to construction.

“This project not only advances the deployment of cutting-edge battery storage technology in Texas, but also demonstrates the power of collaborative, innovative financing to accelerate the energy transition,” said Sven Wellock, head of renewables and power, Americas, ING.

Cool factor: With a planned capacity of 120 MW and with a four-hour battery duration, Project Alamo City will be a significant standalone battery storage installation in Texas, delivering 480 MWh of grid-strengthening storage capacity for CPS Energy.

“Project Alamo City represents a bold step forward in our commitment to enhancing grid stability and ensuring long-term energy reliability,” said Sabah Bayatli, president of OCI Energy. “It also marks OCI Energy’s return as a developer-owner-operator in the project finance space, and partnering with a financial institution like ING has been instrumental in bringing this transformative project to fruition.”

OCI Energy had previously announced the execution of a 20-year Storage Capacity Agreement with CPS Energy, the largest municipally-owned electric and natural gas utility in the United States. Under that agreement, OCI Energy is responsible for the development, financing, construction, and ownership of Project Alamo City, and CPS Energy will have operational control. Project Alamo City is expected to enter commercial operation in Q3 2027.

Nofar USA has secured more than 1 GW of solar development projects across multiple U.S. markets through a combination of acquisitions and exclusive development agreements. The transactions, completed in late August, expand the company’s portfolio and encompasses utility-scale and distributed generation projects with commercial operations expected to start between 2026 and 2029.

“These transactions mark a significant milestone in the expansion of our U.S. pipeline,” said Allon Raveh, executive chairman and CEO of Nofar USA, a wholly owned subsidiary of Nofar Energy. “By securing more than a gigawatt of projects across key renewable energy markets, including PJM, SPP and ERCOT, in combination with our ITC safe harboring strategy, I expect Nofar USA to grow its solar portfolio significantly in the next few years. This, combined with our growing energy storage portfolio which has already reached a contracted pipeline of 1.2 GWh, reinforcing our commitment to supporting America’s demand for clean power while generating long-term value for our shareholders”

Cool factor: The solar portfolio includes projects in various stages of development, from early-stage development through ready-to-build status. Projects span multiple regional transmission organizations and independent system operators, providing geographic and market diversification.

Nofar Energy operates across 10 countries with renewable energy and energy storage projects. The company has 2.4 GW of renewable energy projects connected or under construction globally. In the United States, Nofar has been expanding its presence through strategic acquisitions and partnerships, developing projects that range from distributed generation to utility-scale installations.

Aspen Power expands Pennsylvania portfolio with 6.85 MW in new solar projects

Aspen Power has closed on the acquisition of two solar projects in Northampton, Pennsylvania, with a combined capacity of 6.85 MWdc. These projects are the first projects to close under a portfolio totaling 18 MWdc under contract with Syncarpha Capital LLC. The ground-mounted systems are expected to generate almost 9 million kWh of clean energy annually.

“Solar is now the most affordable source of new electricity in the U.S., and even in a difficult national political environment, we are executing and bringing projects online,” said Jorge Vargas, CEO of Aspen Power. “Together with our partners at Syncarpha Capital, we are creating reliable, long-term income for landowners, affordable clean energy for residents, and tangible progress toward a more resilient grid. At this pivotal moment for the renewable energy industry, strong execution and strong partnerships are what will drive lasting economic and environmental benefits, and Aspen is proud to be leading that effort in Pennsylvania.”

Cool factor: Aspen Power has been highly active in Pennsylvania, with more than 100 MW of operating and in-construction assets across the state. As electricity demand grows, solar’s speed of deployment makes it a critical solution for meeting near-term energy needs. Pennsylvania’s target of sourcing 18% of its electricity from renewables by 2025 underscores the importance of these projects, which will contribute directly to the state’s clean energy goals.

The company has developed or acquired more than 600 renewable energy projects across 26 states in pursuit of a more affordable, reliable, and sustainable energy future.

Nexus secures $220 million, energy offtaker for Project Goody

Nexus Renewable Power LLC has closed on a series of transactions that together represent approximately $220 million of project funding for MRG Goody Solar and Storage (Project Goody), a 171.72 MWac solar project combined with a 237 MWh storage project located in Lamar County, Texas.

Goldman Sachs is making a preferred equity investment into Project Goody to support the hybrid tax equity financing. Nexus also executed a tax credit purchase agreement with respect to Project Goody. Meta is the power offtaker for the project, which will help match its data center electricity use with clean and renewable energy. This aggregate financing complements the previously announced $300 million construction-to-permanent financing facility with HPS Investment Partners, and the $100 million Nexus-Bad Carbon carbon credit financing joint venture.

Cool factor: Project Goody is named after, and honors the service of, Michael R. “Goody” Goodboe who died on Nov. 24, 2020, from injuries sustained while serving his country overseas. He was a highly decorated Navy SEAL and served his country with distinction in multiple theaters including Iraq, Afghanistan, Eastern Europe, and Africa. He is remembered for his warrior spirit, sense of humor, and high standards for himself and his comrades.

Project Goody is currently under construction, with a scheduled commercial operation date in the fourth quarter of 2025. It is the first in a series of projects being developed and constructed by Nexus. The project will provide employment opportunities and economic benefits to Lamar County, creating hundreds of construction jobs and contributing millions in long-term tax revenue to support the local school district and the community at large.

Verogy begins construction on sixth SCEF solar project in Connecticut

Connecticut-based developer Verogy has started construction on its sixth project under the state’s Shared Clean Energy Facility (SCEF) program in 2025. These projects, totaling more than 30 MW of renewable energy, enable Verogy to advance equal access to solar power and drive meaningful economic impact across Connecticut.

As part of its commitment to using domestically sourced materials and power generation technologies, Verogy continues to partner with Arizona-headquartered First Solar Inc. to supply its modules.

Cool factor: The SCEF program, overseen by the Connecticut Public Utilities Regulatory Authority (PURA), was designed to expand access to solar power, particularly for low- to moderate-income (LMI) households. Participating residents can subscribe to a portion of the electricity generated by a SCEF project and receive credits on their electricity bills, which results in long-term savings without installing any equipment on their own property.

“Verogy is committed to ensuring the benefits of renewable energy are felt across all communities, not just those with access to on-site solar,” said William Herchel, CEO of Verogy. “The SCEF program makes it possible for more Connecticut consumers than ever to participate in and benefit from the solar economy.”

Upon completion of these six SCEF projects, Verogy anticipates delivering enough clean energy to power more than 3,600 average homes every year. In addition, these projects will generate an estimated $975,000 in annual savings for LMI households and other utility customers for the next 20 years.

“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club.
The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said.
Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said.
“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said.","TOPEKA — Big utility companies nationwide lost ground this year in their plans to meet minimum climate targets, and Kansas’ Evergy received an F for a “multi-year backslide” from renewable investments, a Sierra Club report said.

Evergy received 9 points out of 100 this year, dropping from 12 last year. The company earned a spotlight because of its move toward delaying the closure of a coal-burning plant and plans to build new gas-burning plants, the Dirty Truth about Utility Climate Pledges report said.

The report grades 75 utilities across the country on plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035 and transition to clean energy through 2035, a press release said.

“I think this is the worst year since we started doing the report five years ago,” said Ty Gorman, a Kansas organizing strategist for the Sierra Club. “The average score was 15. The purpose of the report was to inspire utilities to move us forward towards a livable future. We didn’t expect to see it go backwards.”

Gorman said Evergy’s decisions about natural gas plants and delaying closure of coal plants is part of a national trend. The stress of data centers and other large-load users on utility grids is being used as an “excuse” to move quickly, he said.

Planning for a clean energy transition requires that utilities shift to running everything off of clean electricity, he said.

“There’s a good reason to increase load, but that’s at a steady pace that brings a lot of other benefits to the economy, to jobs, to ratepayers,” he said.

Data centers, though, offer a different kind of economic risk than other electric load growth types, Gorman said. The Kansas Sierra Club was part of the work at the Kansas Corporation Commission recently to determine how utilities like Evergy should make sure costs associated with new customers, like data centers, aren’t borne by other customers, he said.

“Evergy is courting data centers to come to the territory, and even with the changes, some of those costs shift to customers,” Gorman said. “I’d say that Evergy customers need to hold these large loads, these data centers, accountable to keep our bills low and lower our pollution by demanding that they use renewable energy.”

Gina Penzig, Evergy spokeswoman, said the company is delaying its expectations of a 70% reduction in greenhouse gases by 2030.

“The reasons for this include growing demand growth because of the record economic growth in our service area and the need for new dispatchable generation, which is generation that can be turned on and off when our customers need it,” Penzig said. “The only sources of that would be natural gas, coal and potentially nuclear.”

Evergy announced last week that it is partnering with TerraPower to explore the possibility of building a nuclear power plant in Kansas, using advanced technology designed by TerraPower.

Penzig said Sierra Club has a narrow mission of retiring all fossil-fuel generation as soon as possible.

“At Evergy, we have to first ensure that it’s reliable, so it’s there when our customers need it. And what is the least cost combination of resources that we can use to get there,” she said. “If you look at our long-term plan, it has a considerable amount of renewables also being added to serve customers. The only reason we can do that is by combining it with traditional energy sources so that we can ensure we have reliable service.”

Penzig said the new generation of natural gas plants has advanced technology that makes them more efficient and cleaner than older plants.

Gorman said focusing on decreasing fossil fuel use is critical because of the effects of the climate crisis.

“We see them all across the country, the extreme weather, extreme heat, extreme cold,” he said. “They’re causing utility infrastructure to fall apart, especially gas and fossil fuel infrastructure. In response, these utilities in order to increase their profits are doubling down on that same gas and coal infrastructure that’s the most expensive.”

Gorman said it’s clear the utilities are going in the wrong direction.

“(Evergy CEO) David Campbell is taking Evergy backwards, trying to increase fossil fuel product pollution and shareholder profits by spending as much as they can on expensive fossil fuel infrastructure, as much as the Kansas Corporation Commission will allow them to,” he said. That’s making our climate crisis worse. It’s making our bills higher, and it’s making our health worse.”",https://kansasreflector.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Evergy-Lawrence-2048x1365.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:01:59.196582

This particular opinion was chock-full of misinformation about clean energy and the economy, and commenters were quick to point that out.

Clean energy projects are great for the economy. They create jobs in multiple industries. Besides employment created in a given area directly associated with the necessary construction, the demand for equipment, components, and services creates additional employment down the supply chain. The ripple effect continues, as the wages earned are then spent in local economies.

On top of that, the proliferation of clean energy sources can attract businesses. According to Sustainable Views, a recent survey of nearly 1,500 business leaders from 15 countries showed that the majority would be willing to move business operations to a country with a higher adoption of clean energy.

A healthier population due to the reduction in pollution caused by dirty energy generation can also lead to huge economic savings. According to Yale Climate Connections, cleaner air and the resulting better public health will save the U.S. economy an estimated $118-200 billion between now and 2030.

The misinformed opinions shared by this Redditor said otherwise.

The Redditor believes clean energy regulations — not lower labor costs and reduced operating costs — drive companies to move operations overseas, resulting in lost jobs and a worse economy. They also believe this ends up in more planet-overheating pollution being released into the environment.

As mentioned above, commenters were quick to correct the original poster.

""Sounds like you have no clue at all about any of this,"" one person commented.

Another added: ""Your fear is not supported by reality.""

Another commenter debunked much of the general premise of the original post by mentioning that the U.S. had been sending jobs overseas long before the clean energy push started.

""American industry has been sending good manufacturing jobs to China and elsewhere for a half century,"" the commenter said. ""Singling out green tech is a bad faith argument.""

One commenter pleaded with the original poster to educate themselves on this, posting: ""Please spend a few minutes researching this … The premise that the transition to green energy is causing more problems than it's solving is nonsense.""",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/clean-energy-regulationsimage-recY7eCzOgl1iWZ0L.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:02:05.087152

Energy Vault’s Calistoga Resiliency Centre comes online, company secures US$50 million

In other news from Energy Vault, the company, along with utility Pacific Gas and Electric (PG&E) announced the successful completion and operation of the Calistoga Resiliency Centre (CRC) located in California.

CRC integrates hydrogen fuel cells with a lithium-ion BESS to ensure power resilience during grid outages caused by wildfires or natural disasters.

The Calistoga community microgrid will benefit from the CRC by sustaining power during shutoffs or disconnections. According to Energy Vault, the 293MWh system provides about 48 hours of continuous energy, with a peak output of 8.5MW during public safety power shutoff (PSPS) events.

During such events, the system operates in ‘island’ mode, using green hydrogen to generate electricity.

After fulfilling the black-start and grid-forming roles of the microgrid, Energy Vault’s B-VAULT DC battery technology works with the fuel cells to ensure grid stability.

In April, Energy Vault closed on US$28 million in project financing for the CRC, including the sale of an investment tax credit associated with the project.

In August, the company received approval from the California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) to pursue market-based participation in the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) market with the CRC.

A representative from Energy Vault said to Energy-Storage.news:

“Ultimately, the system will need to be approved for market participation by CAISO itself, but the CPUC clearance is a key milestone toward that goal. That being said, the system’s operation relies on a hybrid combination of lithium-ion battery and hydrogen fuel cell technologies, so there is no distinction to be made in terms of which technology will be considered for CAISO market participation.”

The company also announced on 26 September that it entered into a definitive funding agreement with YA II PN, for up to US$50 million in corporate debenture financing.

Energy Vault noted the funding agreement is separate from and in addition to the recently announced US$300 million preferred equity investment with a leading infrastructure investor, which is pending final closure.

Upon final closing, Asset Vault will be established as a fully consolidated subsidiary to manage Energy Vault’s storage assets, which it will own and operate.

These assets will be backed by long-term offtake agreements, which Energy Vault says will secure project revenue and support Energy Vault’s strategy as an independent power producer (IPP).

The value of the contracts has not been disclosed owing to commercial sensitivity, although the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) said that funding will be taken from the £9.4bn (US$12.6bn) earmarked for CCUS in the spending review in June.

Combined, the two facilities are expected to capture almost 1.2m tCO2e/y, including 800,000 tCO2e/y from Padeswood, amounting to around 95% of the cement works’ total emissions and more than half of all emissions from Heidelberg Materials’ UK overall cement operations in 2023. The 370,000 tCO2e/y expected to be captured at Protos, meanwhile, amounts to just under half of Encyclis’ total emissions from its three incinerators in the UK and Ireland in 2024. Encyclis plans to incinerate 500,000 t/y of non-recyclable waste at Protos, generating 49.9 MW of electricity.

Cement production is one of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries, responsible for around 8% of global emissions, largely from the vast heat required to turn limestone into clinker.

Emissions at Padeswood are generated from burning domestic waste to heat the cement kiln. Heidelberg Materials says the plant will be the first cement works in the world to capture almost all CO2 emissions from industrial-scale production.

The facility Heidelberg Materials plans to build at Padeswood will use an amine solvent-based technology already deployed at its Brevik cement plant in Norway, which became the world’s first industrial-scale site to capture emissions from cement production when it opened in June. The Brevik plant captures only 50% of emissions, making Padeswood a significant technological advancement.

Heidelberg Materials is also planning to build a new heat and power plant to support the additional energy demand created by the capture facility. The company told TCE that the new heat and power plant will be fuelled by waste heat from cement production and natural gas, and that emissions will be captured.

Heidelberg Materials is also building a new 10 km spur pipeline to connect Padeswood to the wider HyNet network.

Olivia Powis, CEO of the CCS Association, said: “Cement and energy from waste are two of the most difficult sectors to decarbonise, yet they are fundamental to our economy and way of life – from building new homes and vital infrastructure to managing society’s unrecyclable waste and providing reliable low-carbon power.

“These world-leading projects show how carbon capture can provide credible, scalable pathways to net zero securing the future of essential UK industries and keeping businesses competitive in global markets.”

The UK government expects the two projects to generate around 500 jobs, primarily in construction. Heidelberg Materials noted that its facility will create 50 new operational roles while supporting 200 existing positions. UK energy minister Michael Shanks said: “Our clean energy mission means good jobs, regional growth and investment for local communities. These trailblazing projects showcase north Wales and the northwest’s workforce on the global stage – leading the charge in the clean industries of the future and powering Britain’s reindustrialisation.”

It can be life-threatening and lead to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in losses.

Unfortunately, research out of Texas A&M discovered that the country is shockingly vulnerable to grid outages — and some states are more at risk than others.

What's happening?

EnergySage spotlighted Texas A&M's report in a recent article examining how installing solar panels with battery storage can give homeowners a leg up during grid outages on households without a backup power source or those dependent on gasoline generators.

As an independent, objective expert in the nuances of the rooftop solar industry, EnergySage offers free tools for consumers to obtain easy-to-compare solar installation quotes.

Texas A&M's findings reveal why an increasing number of homeowners are preparing for weather-induced grid outages with the assistance of EnergySage.

The university reported that power outages have risen by 20% since 2019. Texas, California, and Louisiana, respectively, accounted for the most major power outages between 2000 and 2023, according to a Power System Vulnerability Index created using over 179 million data points.

Why is this important?

As EnergySage explains, power outages aren't just dangerous for people who rely on medical equipment needing refrigeration or electricity. During an outage, the average family loses $200 in groceries because of spoilage, and they may need to shell out upward of $25,000 on hotel stays, damaged electronics, and other repairs in the event of water-related property damage.

Dr. Ali Mostafavi, the director of the Urban Resilience AI Lab that used machine learning to develop the vulnerability index, said in the Texas A&M release that the grid failure situation was more dire than they originally suspected.

""We knew that the state of power system vulnerability nationwide is exacerbating. But the magnitude of that was shocking, and greater than we hypothesized,"" Dr. Mostafavi said.

What can be done about this?

Installing solar panels and pairing them with battery storage won't only boost your family's ability to manage whatever climate-related event comes its way.

Along with upgrading to energy-efficient technology, solar and battery storage will also help you significantly reduce your energy bills while slashing dirty fuel-produced heat-trapping pollution responsible for warming the climate and subsequently supercharging extreme weather.

Whether used for everyday power or as a backup energy source, solar panels also improve comfort and peace of mind because they're quieter than gas generators and don't introduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

On average, EnergySage's free services save homeowners $10,000 on solar installations. Now is also the time to connect with EnergySage to maximize your savings, as solar projects must be underway by Dec. 31 to qualify for federal tax incentives. Its state-by-state mapping tool can help you discover which area-specific savings may also be available.

Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an electric one can save you $1,500 every year on fuel and maintenance.","An electric vehicle battery recycling project in Germany promises to keep the valuable devices in use, saving precious materials and supporting a circular economy while boosting communities.

The pilot plant is set for Chemnitz and will be built by manufacturing institute Fraunhofer IWU and EDAG Production Solutions, Interesting Engineering reported.

""Shredding high-voltage storage systems discards valuable resources,"" the outlet stated. ""The team sees disassembly and reuse as a better option.

""The process preserves raw materials and allows non-reusable cells to be passed on to recyclers, who can still recover lithium, cobalt, and other critical elements.""

The resulting products will be used to enable energy storage for homes, businesses, and utilities.

IE noted that used batteries will increase tenfold in the European Union by 2030. For the units to be fully repurposed, they must be broken down to their individual components. That way, failed or damaged cells can be replaced or repaired.

The plant will compile data about disassembly and recovery so it can improve processes.

Artificial intelligence will support the breakdown method, evaluating whether cells can be reused or are at the end of their lifespans. This will also reduce risks to workers and make the system scalable, IE reported.

Electric vehicles are great for people and the planet, saving folks money and reducing pollution that harms human health and the environment. EV batteries are made with rare metals, and their cells are arranged in modules, which make up a pack. Keeping these resources in circulation after they have outlived their usefulness in automobiles reduces the risk of toxins leaching into groundwater and soil and minimizes resource depletion.

Battery technology is always evolving, and developments make EVs and other machines more affordable and efficient. Switching from a gas-powered vehicle to an electric one can save you $1,500 every year on fuel and maintenance. It will also produce only about one-quarter of the heat-trapping gases that are driving rising global temperatures and all the consequences of dirty energy use.

Battery storage also makes daily living easier for humans, helping individuals, companies, and cities reduce reliance on the electric grid, which is still powered mostly by dirty energy sources, saving money and curbing pollution. This has a profound effect on people's well-being, lowering risks of heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and more while protecting vulnerable people and communities.

""Solar is not only about generation anymore; it is about creating a local industry,"" Tayfun Hiz, a researcher at the Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications of Middle East Technical University in Ankara, told Xinhua recently.
Without these steps, it may be difficult to use all the renewable power being built,"" she told Xinhua.
The Turkish government aims to reach around 120 gigawatts of combined solar and wind capacity by 2035, while continuing to develop hydropower, geothermal and biomass.

""Solar is not only about generation anymore; it is about creating a local industry,"" Tayfun Hiz, a researcher at the Center for Solar Energy Research and Applications of Middle East Technical University in Ankara, told Xinhua recently.

""Türkiye is already building panels, inverters and related technologies domestically. If we align research, manufacturing and policy, solar can become a driver of exports as well as clean energy at home,"" he added.

Muhdan Saglam, director of Ankara-based think tank the Center for Energy and Climate Change Studies at the Economic Policy Research Foundation, emphasized the next phase of the energy transition: ""Türkiye has shown it can build renewable power quickly, but the real challenge now is to integrate these resources smoothly into the system.""

""To solve this, Türkiye will need to invest in stronger power lines, storage systems such as batteries, and smarter electricity markets. Without these steps, it may be difficult to use all the renewable power being built,"" she told Xinhua.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan announced at the UN Climate Summit 2025 held Wednesday in New York that more than 60 percent of Türkiye's installed electricity capacity now comes from renewable sources, including hydropower, wind and solar.

He outlined new measures including an emissions trading system and green finance tools. ""In line with our net-zero emissions target for 2053, we will continue to transform key sectors,"" Erdogan added.

The renewable expansion also supports Türkiye's goal of reducing dependence on imported fossil fuels, and enhancing energy security through sun, wind and water resources.

Official data showed that Türkiye's solar power has doubled since 2021, reaching over 21 gigawatts of capacity by early 2025, while wind power has steadily expanded and hydropower remains the backbone with over 32 gigawatts of capacity.

The Turkish government aims to reach around 120 gigawatts of combined solar and wind capacity by 2035, while continuing to develop hydropower, geothermal and biomass.

Saglam warned that without proper grid infrastructure, renewable energy potential in Türkiye cannot be fully realized.

Citing the massive blackout in the Iberian Peninsula in late April as an example of grid vulnerability, Saglam stressed that ""necessary investments have to be made to support the grid.""

We are still ignoring the important role of ventilation in the full HVAC&R cycle.","As climate change pushes temperatures ever higher in the Middle East, the HVAC&R industry is being asked to provide more cooling while simultaneously consuming less energy. It’s a problem the industry has had to confront across the world, but the high ambient temperatures of the Middle East make it especially difficult to balance cooling and energy consumption.

It’s this challenge that Eurovent Middle East, an industry association of HVAC&R manufacturers and local service providers, is addressing at its upcoming HVACR Next Generation congress, which is being held in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia, on October 28. Indoor air quality (IAQ), ventilation and training are all major focus points of the program, as are natural refrigerants. In addition to technical challenges and best practices, another goal of the event is to show that sustainability is good for business, according to Markus Lattner, Managing Director of Eurovent Middle East.

“There is a clear business case to be made to rely on high-quality, high-energy-efficient systems designed and operated by trained and qualified personnel,” Lattner said.

NaturalRefrigerants.com spoke with Lattner to learn more about the HVACR Next Generation congress and Eurovent Middle East’s goals for the event. This interview has been edited for length and clarity.

The HVACR Next Generation congress is a relatively new event in its second edition. What is its goal and format?

Markus Lattner: There are several major issues the industry and region is facing that need to be brought to the attention of a wider audience within our ecosystem. Contrary to many of the commercial conferences, we can address these issues free from commercial interest and influence. We do not allow commercial content and sponsoring does not automatically entitle you to a presentation. This ensures that we can provide a truly relevant and engaging agenda.

One of the key topics on the agenda is the refrigerant transition in high ambient temperature, or HAT, countries. Given this, what presence will natural refrigerants have on the agenda?

ML: It is clear that the region will have to adapt to a changing refrigerant landscape in the coming decades, and the top priority lies in decarbonizing the building sector. Natural refrigerants will undoubtedly have to play a major part in this transition, and it is essential that we educate the market on their potential and address prejudices and misinformation as to their applicability in HAT conditions.

We want to motivate investors and end users to switch to low-GWP solutions at an early stage. We will discuss essential steps to be taken if we want to see this transition be successful from the legal environment to qualification requirements and the adoption of relevant international safety standards. This aspect will form a major part of the conference.

Training is an issue in the HVAC&R industry, both in general and with regard to the transition to natural refrigerants. Will training be a topic of discussion at the event?

ML: We launched our HVAC&R Leadership Academy two years ago to provide certified technical training, and we are seeing an increased interest in f-gas certification, which is a vital first step. Qualification across the value chain from planning to installation, operation and maintenance forms the greatest savings potential when it comes to energy consumption and carbon emissions. It is about time that we bring more skill requirements to the industry in the region.

“Natural refrigerants will undoubtedly have to play a major part in this transition, and it is essential that we educate the market on their potential and address prejudices and misinformation as to their applicability in HAT conditions.”

Markus Lattner, Managing Director of Eurovent Middle East

In addition to high-ambient temperatures, are there other unique challenges facing the HVAC&R industry in the Middle East?

ML: Our other major focal point is ventilation. We are still ignoring the important role of ventilation in the full HVAC&R cycle. After all, the best chiller on the roof is useless if the cooling load isn’t delivered equally and fully to the building. Add into this its effect on IAQ, the role it plays in keeping buildings healthy and its energy imprint, which is estimated to be between 40% to 50% of the total HVAC-related energy costs, and it is clear that we need to bring more scrutiny to the planning and design of ventilation systems.

We also will highlight that sustainability, aside from its environmental impact, is directly related to lower total cost of ownership. There is a clear business case to be made to rely on high-quality, high-energy-efficient systems designed and operated by trained and qualified personnel.

Mike Jacobs, a senior energy manager at UCS, uncovered these additional costs by analyzing last year’s filings from utilities in seven PJM states and identifying 130 projects that will connect private data centers directly to the high-voltage transmission system.
Over 95% of the projects identified passed all of their transmission connection costs onto local people’s electricity bills, totaling $4.3 billion in costs previously undistinguished from other, more typical expenses to upgrade and maintain the electricity grid.
“People deserve to understand the full extent of how data centers in their communities may affect their lives and wallets.
This is a clear case of the public unknowingly subsidizing private companies’ profits.","CAMBRIDGE, Mass. (September 15, 2025)—A new analysis by the Union of Concerned Scientists (UCS) reveals how millions of people across Illinois, Maryland, New Jersey, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Virginia and West Virginia are footing the bill for an additional $4.3 billion in electricity infrastructure projects approved in 2024 solely to connect wealthy private companies’ data centers.

This $4.3 billion was previously obscured through opaque utility filings and is on top of an estimated $9.3 billion in data center electricity costs to be paid between June 2025 and June 2026 by the 65 million people who are customers supplied by PJM, the regional utility operator spanning 13 Mid-Atlantic and Ohio Valley states plus the District of Columbia.

Mike Jacobs, a senior energy manager at UCS, uncovered these additional costs by analyzing last year’s filings from utilities in seven PJM states and identifying 130 projects that will connect private data centers directly to the high-voltage transmission system. Over 95% of the projects identified passed all of their transmission connection costs onto local people’s electricity bills, totaling $4.3 billion in costs previously undistinguished from other, more typical expenses to upgrade and maintain the electricity grid.

Jacobs’ seven state analysis found household electricity bills subsidizing the following in direct data center transmission costs approved in 2024:

Illinois: $239 million

Maryland: $107.5 million

New Jersey: $14.5 million

Ohio: $1.3 billion

Pennsylvania: $491.7 million

Virginia: $1.9 billion

West Virginia: $215.8 million

“The big tech companies rushing to build out massive data centers are worth trillions of dollars, yet they’re successfully exploiting an outdated regulatory process to pawn billions of dollars of costs off on families who may never even use their products,” said Jacobs. “People deserve to understand the full extent of how data centers in their communities may affect their lives and wallets. This is a clear case of the public unknowingly subsidizing private companies’ profits. Utilities and regulators must do more to protect people from this outrageous practice that is already driving up household electricity bills for millions of people across the country.”

There are several ways state and federal regulators can reverse this subsidy, Jacobs explains, and these solutions could save people billions of dollars as data centers are projected to increase U.S. energy demand by 130% by 2030, potentially repeating these cost shifts in many more states.",https://www.ucsusa.org/sites/default/files/2021-05/media-release-image.png,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:10.694594

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa. — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”",http://d3i5p6znmm9yua.cloudfront.net/360_Tiffin_Live/0/0/0/0/753/661/753661_1,N,,2025-09-29 11:03:59.429587

The comprehensive funding package forms a central component of the ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa’ campaign, an ambitious initiative co-hosted with South African President Cyril Ramaphosa that seeks to mobilize unprecedented levels of public and private investment in clean energy infrastructure across the African continent. This coordinated effort aims not only to expand renewable energy generation capacity but also to address the pressing challenge of energy access that continues to affect hundreds of millions of African citizens.

The Strategic Vision: Powering Africa’s Future Through Clean Energy

“The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world,” President von der Leyen emphasized in her address. “A clean energy transition on the continent will create jobs, stability, growth and the delivery of our global climate goals. The European Union, with the Global Gateway investment plan, is fully committed to supporting Africa on its clean energy path.”

This statement encapsulates the multifaceted rationale behind the EU’s substantial investment commitment. The initiative recognizes that Africa’s energy transition carries implications far beyond the continent’s borders, influencing global climate trajectories, international supply chain resilience, migration patterns, and geopolitical stability. By supporting Africa’s renewable energy development, the European Union positions itself as a key partner in addressing interconnected challenges of development, security, and environmental sustainability.

Africa’s Energy Paradox: Immense Potential Meets Pressing Need

The African continent presents a striking paradox in the global energy landscape. Blessed with extraordinary renewable energy resources—abundant sunshine across vast territories, strong wind corridors along coastal regions, significant hydropower potential from mighty river systems, and substantial geothermal capacity in the East African Rift Valley—Africa theoretically possesses the natural endowments to become a renewable energy powerhouse. Solar irradiation levels across much of Africa exceed those found in most other regions globally, making solar photovoltaic installations particularly economically attractive.

Yet despite these abundant natural resources, approximately 600 million Africans currently live without access to electricity—representing roughly 43% of the continent’s population. This energy poverty constrains economic development, limits educational opportunities, hampers healthcare delivery, and perpetuates cycles of underdevelopment. In rural areas particularly, lack of electricity access affects fundamental aspects of daily life, from food preservation and water pumping to communication and productive economic activities.

The consequences of this energy deficit extend beyond mere inconvenience. Without reliable electricity, small businesses cannot operate modern equipment, students struggle to study after dark, healthcare facilities cannot refrigerate vaccines or power critical medical equipment, and communities remain isolated from the digital economy transforming much of the world. Addressing this energy access challenge while simultaneously pursuing climate-friendly development pathways represents one of the defining development challenges of the 21st century.

The Development and Strategic Imperative

The urgency of supporting Africa’s clean energy transition stems from both developmental and strategic considerations. From a development perspective, modern energy access serves as a fundamental prerequisite for poverty reduction, economic diversification, and human development progress. The correlation between energy access and development indicators like life expectancy, education levels, and income is well-established in development economics research.

Strategically, how Africa meets its growing energy needs will profoundly influence global climate outcomes. With Africa’s population projected to reach approximately 2.5 billion by 2050—representing a doubling from current levels—and with legitimate aspirations for economic development and improved living standards, the continent’s energy consumption will inevitably increase substantially. Whether this increased energy demand is met through fossil fuels or renewable sources will significantly impact global greenhouse gas emissions trajectories and the feasibility of limiting global temperature increases to 1.5 or 2 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels.

Investing in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power across Africa is described in the EU announcement as “not just a moral and development imperative” but also “a strategic choice that strengthens supply chains, creates up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, and makes energy systems more resilient.” This job creation potential is particularly significant given Africa’s youth demographic profile, with the continent possessing the world’s youngest population and facing substantial youth employment challenges.

The reference to supply chain strengthening acknowledges the growing importance of critical minerals for renewable energy technologies. Africa possesses substantial reserves of minerals essential for batteries, solar panels, wind turbines, and other clean energy technologies, including cobalt, lithium, copper, and rare earth elements. Developing renewable energy industries within Africa could create opportunities for value-added processing and manufacturing, moving beyond simple raw material extraction toward more sophisticated and economically beneficial industrial activities.

The Global Gateway: Europe’s Infrastructure Investment Framework

The announced package operates within the framework of the EU’s Global Gateway investment strategy, an ambitious initiative launched to mobilize €300 billion in infrastructure investments globally between 2021 and 2027. Global Gateway represents the European Union’s strategic response to infrastructure financing needs in developing and emerging economies, emphasizing sustainable, high-quality investments that adhere to international standards for environmental protection, labor rights, transparency, and governance.

The strategy explicitly positions itself as offering an alternative model to some other international infrastructure investment approaches, emphasizing partnership principles, local ownership, and sustainability considerations. In the African context, Global Gateway focuses particularly on digital connectivity, health systems, education, renewable energy, and transport infrastructure—sectors identified as critical for sustainable development and economic transformation.

Through this framework, the EU commits to helping “accelerate this transition, delivering major investments in generation, transmission, and cross-border electricity trade, while building stable international partnerships.” This comprehensive approach recognizes that expanding renewable energy generation capacity alone is insufficient; investments must also address transmission infrastructure to move electricity from generation sites to population centers, and regional interconnection to enable electricity trade and enhance system reliability.

Detailed Breakdown: Where the €545 Million Will Be Deployed

The newly announced package distributes resources across multiple African nations and regional initiatives, targeting both large-scale infrastructure projects and community-level electrification efforts. This diversified approach reflects recognition that Africa’s energy challenge requires solutions at multiple scales, from major transmission lines enabling regional power trade to decentralized mini-grids bringing electricity to remote villages.

Côte d’Ivoire: Strengthening Regional Energy Backbone (€359.4 million)

The largest single allocation within the package directs €359.4 million toward construction of a high-voltage transmission line known as ‘Dorsale Est’ (Eastern Backbone) in Côte d’Ivoire. This substantial infrastructure project aims to enhance regional energy distribution capacity, enabling more efficient power flow across the country and potentially facilitating electricity trade with neighboring nations.

Côte d’Ivoire has emerged as West Africa’s fastest-growing economy in recent years and serves as a regional economic hub. The country has achieved relatively high electrification rates compared to regional averages, with approximately 70% of the population having electricity access. However, the quality and reliability of supply require improvement, and transmission infrastructure needs upgrading to accommodate increasing demand and integration of new renewable generation capacity.

High-voltage transmission lines are critical infrastructure for modern power systems, enabling efficient long-distance electricity transport with minimal losses. By strengthening this transmission backbone, the project will facilitate integration of renewable energy sources that may be located far from major consumption centers—such as solar installations in northern regions or potential wind farms in coastal areas—and enhance grid stability and reliability.

Cameroon: Bringing Power to Rural Communities (€59.1 million)

The second-largest country allocation targets rural electrification in Cameroon, with €59.1 million dedicated to bringing electricity access to 687 communities, potentially benefiting more than 2.5 million people. This represents a significant step toward addressing Cameroon’s substantial rural-urban electricity access gap, where rural electrification rates lag far behind urban areas.

Rural electrification projects face distinct challenges compared to urban grid extension, including dispersed populations, difficult terrain, long distances from existing grid infrastructure, and limited ability of rural populations to pay cost-reflective electricity tariffs. These challenges often require innovative approaches such as mini-grids powered by solar or small hydropower installations, rather than traditional grid extension strategies.

The impact of rural electrification extends well beyond household lighting. Electricity access enables irrigation pumping for agriculture, refrigeration for food preservation and small businesses, power for processing agricultural products, communication technologies connecting rural areas to markets and information, and improved healthcare and education services. Studies consistently demonstrate that rural electrification catalyzes broader economic development when accompanied by complementary investments in productive uses of electricity.

Republic of Congo: Diversifying Renewable Energy Sources (€3.5 million)

A more modest allocation of €3.5 million for the Republic of Congo focuses on expanding access to diverse renewable energy sources, including solar, wind, and hydropower technologies. While smaller in absolute terms, this investment could support feasibility studies, pilot projects, technical assistance, and policy development that lay groundwork for larger future investments.

The Republic of Congo possesses significant hydropower potential from the Congo River basin, one of the world’s most powerful river systems. However, developing this potential requires substantial investment in generation facilities and transmission infrastructure. Meanwhile, solar and wind technologies offer opportunities for more distributed generation that can provide electricity access more quickly and flexibly than large-scale hydropower projects.

Lesotho: Unlocking Wind and Hydropower Potential (€25.9 million)

The mountain kingdom of Lesotho receives €25.9 million through the Renewable Lesotho programme, specifically targeting development of wind and hydropower resources. Lesotho’s mountainous topography and high elevation create favorable conditions for both wind energy generation and hydroelectric installations, though the country currently remains heavily dependent on imported electricity from neighboring South Africa.

Lesotho faces unique energy challenges stemming from its geography—entirely surrounded by South Africa, with rugged terrain complicating infrastructure development, and a small population of approximately 2 million people that limits economies of scale. However, these same geographical characteristics provide renewable energy advantages. The highlands experience strong, consistent winds suitable for wind power generation, while steep elevation changes and reliable water flows create hydropower opportunities.

Developing domestic renewable energy generation could reduce Lesotho’s electricity import dependence, keep energy expenditure within the national economy, and potentially position the country to export renewable electricity to South Africa’s much larger market. The Renewable Lesotho programme appears designed to conduct necessary assessments, develop project pipelines, and attract additional financing for specific generation projects.

Ghana: Planning Large-Scale Solar Development (€2 million)

Ghana receives €2 million designated for laying groundwork for a large-scale solar park and facilitating regional energy trade. Though modest in size, this funding likely supports preliminary activities essential for major renewable energy projects—site assessments, grid integration studies, environmental and social impact assessments, regulatory approvals, and engagement with potential investors and off-takers.

Ghana has established itself as one of West Africa’s more stable and prosperous nations, with relatively strong governance institutions and a growing economy. The country has set ambitious renewable energy targets and seeks to diversify its electricity generation mix, which historically relied heavily on hydropower and thermal generation. Large-scale solar parks represent attractive options given Ghana’s location near the equator and consistently high solar irradiation levels.

Regional energy trade represents another strategic dimension of this investment. West African nations have long recognized benefits of regional electricity market integration, which can enhance supply reliability, optimize generation resource utilization, and provide economic efficiencies through trade. Ghana’s participation in the West African Power Pool positions it to both import and export electricity, and developing additional generation capacity could enable the country to become a net exporter to neighbors with electricity deficits.

Central Africa: Strengthening Regional Energy Cooperation (€3.3 million)

The package allocates €3.3 million across three initiatives supporting the Central African Power Pool (CAPP), a regional organization working to develop integrated electricity markets and infrastructure across Central African nations. These investments include:

Technical Assistance to CAPP (€1.6 million): Supporting the institutional development, planning capabilities, and operational effectiveness of this regional power pool organization. Effective regional electricity market operation requires sophisticated planning, coordination mechanisms, regulatory frameworks, and technical standards—all areas where technical assistance can build capacity.

Research and Infrastructure Funding Facility (€0.5 million): Creating a funding mechanism to support studies and small-scale infrastructure investments advancing regional energy integration. This facility could finance grid interconnection studies, renewable energy resource assessments, and pilot projects demonstrating innovative approaches.

Friendship Loop Feasibility Study (€1.2 million): Examining the technical and economic feasibility of a cross-border transmission line—dubbed the ‘Boucle de l’Amitié’ (Friendship Loop)—that would connect Pointe Noire, Brazzaville, and Kinshasa. These cities represent major population and economic centers across the Republic of Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo, yet electricity interconnections remain limited. A transmission link could enable power sharing, improve supply reliability, and facilitate integration of new generation capacity.

Madagascar: Expanding Rural Electrification (€33.2 million)

Madagascar receives €33.2 million focused on expanding electrification through mini-grids in rural areas. The island nation faces particularly acute energy access challenges, with electrification rates among the lowest globally—only about 15% of the population has electricity access, and rural access rates drop below 5%.

Madagascar’s geography—an island nation with dispersed rural populations, challenging terrain, and biodiversity conservation priorities—makes traditional grid extension economically prohibitive for many communities. Mini-grids powered by solar panels, small wind turbines, or micro-hydropower installations offer more practical solutions for bringing electricity to isolated communities.

These decentralized energy systems can be deployed relatively quickly, scaled to match community needs, and operated independently of national grid infrastructure. When properly designed and managed, mini-grids can provide reliable electricity at costs competitive with diesel generators while avoiding fossil fuel dependence. The EU investment will likely support both the physical installation of mini-grid systems and the development of sustainable business models ensuring their long-term operation and maintenance.

Mozambique: Encouraging Private Sector Engagement (€13 million)

Mozambique’s allocation of €13 million emphasizes supporting a low-emission energy transition while particularly encouraging private sector involvement. This reflects recognition that public financing alone cannot meet the scale of investment required for comprehensive energy system transformation, and that mobilizing private capital is essential for sustainable energy sector development.

Mozambique possesses substantial renewable energy potential, including significant solar resources, hydropower potential from major river systems, wind resources along its extensive coastline, and potentially exploitable natural gas reserves that could serve as a transition fuel. The country has attracted interest from international renewable energy developers, though project development faces challenges including limited grid infrastructure, regulatory uncertainties, and financing constraints.

EU support could address these barriers through various mechanisms: providing concessional financing that improves project economics, offering guarantees that reduce investor risk, supporting regulatory reforms that create clearer frameworks for private investment, and funding grid infrastructure that enables private generation projects to connect and deliver power to markets.

Somalia: Building Resilience Through Renewable Energy (€45.5 million)

Somalia receives a substantial €45.5 million allocation with multiple interconnected objectives: increasing access to affordable renewable energy, advancing circular economy practices, and building climate-resilient agri-food systems. This integrated approach recognizes the multiple challenges facing Somalia and the interconnections between energy access, agricultural development, climate adaptation, and economic recovery.

Somalia faces extraordinary development challenges stemming from decades of conflict, weak state institutions, and vulnerability to climate shocks including recurring droughts and occasional flooding. Energy access remains extremely limited, with most electricity generation coming from expensive imported diesel fuel powering small-scale generators. This results in some of the world’s highest electricity costs—often exceeding $1 per kilowatt-hour—which constrains economic activity and household wellbeing.

Renewable energy deployment, particularly solar systems, could dramatically reduce energy costs while avoiding continued fossil fuel dependence. The reference to circular economy practices suggests attention to sustainable resource management, waste reduction, and recycling—principles that can be integrated into energy system development through careful planning of equipment lifecycles, local manufacturing or assembly where feasible, and proper management of end-of-life solar panels and batteries.

The connection to climate-resilient agri-food systems acknowledges that Somalia’s economy depends heavily on agriculture and pastoralism, sectors highly vulnerable to climate variability. Renewable energy can support agricultural adaptation through solar-powered irrigation, cold storage facilities for produce and vaccines, processing equipment that adds value to agricultural products, and communication systems enabling farmers to access weather information and market prices.

The Scaling Up Renewables in Africa Campaign: A Collaborative Approach

The €545 million EU package represents one component of the broader ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa’ campaign, an innovative multi-stakeholder initiative designed to mobilize commitments and action far beyond what any single actor could achieve alone. The campaign brings together governments, international organizations, private sector entities, and civil society in a coordinated effort to accelerate Africa’s renewable energy transition.

The involvement of Global Citizen, an international advocacy organization with expertise in mobilizing public engagement and private sector commitments around development goals, adds a grassroots dimension to the campaign. Global Citizen has pioneered approaches that combine public advocacy, major music and cultural events, and engagement with political and business leaders to drive action on global challenges ranging from poverty and hunger to education and climate change.

The International Energy Agency provides critical technical and analytical support, bringing its extensive expertise in energy markets, technologies, and policies. The IEA’s participation lends credibility and technical rigor to the campaign while helping ensure that initiatives align with best practices in energy system planning and development.

The campaign structure encourages diverse actors—governments, financial institutions, private companies, and philanthropists—to make concrete pledges of capital, expertise, or technical assistance. This model recognizes that comprehensive energy system transformation requires contributions from multiple sources: public financing to support enabling infrastructure and reduce project risks, private capital to fund commercially viable generation projects, philanthropic resources to support community-level initiatives and capacity building, and technical expertise to navigate complex planning, regulatory, and implementation challenges.

Momentum Toward Global Climate Goals

The campaign explicitly maintains momentum toward the ambitious targets established at COP28—the 28th United Nations Climate Change Conference held in Dubai—which called for tripling renewable energy capacity globally and doubling energy efficiency improvements by 2030. These targets reflect scientific consensus regarding the pace of clean energy deployment needed to limit global temperature increases and avoid the most severe climate change impacts.

Africa’s energy transition plays a crucial role in achieving these global targets. While the continent currently accounts for a relatively small share of global greenhouse gas emissions—reflecting low historical industrialization and energy consumption—Africa’s development trajectory over coming decades will significantly influence global emissions pathways. Supporting clean energy development now can help African nations achieve development goals while avoiding the high-carbon pathways that characterized industrialization in other regions.

The connection to COP28 commitments also positions the Africa renewable energy campaign within broader international climate negotiations and accountability frameworks. By linking African energy investments to global climate targets, the initiative emphasizes shared responsibility for climate action and the importance of developed nations supporting clean energy transitions in developing countries—consistent with principles of climate justice and differentiated responsibilities embodied in international climate agreements.

Looking Ahead: Upcoming Forums and the G20 Summit

The campaign’s strategic timeline builds momentum through a series of high-profile events designed to maintain attention, generate additional commitments, and translate pledges into concrete action. In early October, the Global Gateway Forum in Brussels will convene governments, financial institutions, and private sector leaders to provide additional support for Africa’s clean energy transition. This forum offers opportunities for announcing new investment commitments, establishing partnerships between European and African entities, and addressing technical and policy challenges impeding project development.

The campaign culminates with a high-level event connected to the G20 Summit in South Africa on November 22-23, 2025. The G20 represents the world’s major economies and accounts for approximately 85% of global GDP and two-thirds of the world population. Holding the summit in an African nation—South Africa—provides unique opportunities to center African development priorities, including energy access and climate change, in discussions among the world’s most powerful governments and economic institutions.

South Africa’s hosting of the G20 Summit carries particular significance given the country’s own energy transition challenges and opportunities. South Africa’s electricity system has historically relied heavily on coal-fired generation, but the nation has committed to transitioning toward renewable energy and has attracted substantial international support for this transition, including through the Just Energy Transition Partnership announced at COP26. South Africa’s experience navigating the complexities of energy transition—including managing social and economic impacts on coal-dependent communities and workers—provides relevant lessons for other African nations.

The G20 context also enables engagement with major emerging economies like China, India, and Brazil—countries that increasingly influence development finance, technology transfer, and trade patterns affecting African nations. Securing commitments from this diverse group of global powers could mobilize resources and political will far beyond what European contributions alone could achieve.

The Path Forward: Challenges and Opportunities

While the €545 million EU package and the broader Scaling Up Renewables campaign represent significant commitments, successfully transforming Africa’s energy landscape will require addressing substantial challenges that extend beyond financing alone. Technical challenges include integrating variable renewable energy sources like solar and wind into electricity grids designed for predictable, dispatchable generation; developing adequate transmission infrastructure to connect generation sites with consumption centers; building local technical capacity for operating and maintaining modern energy systems; and ensuring cybersecurity for increasingly digitized grid management systems.

Regulatory and institutional challenges may prove equally important. Many African nations require reforms to electricity sector regulations that currently inhibit private investment, updates to grid codes and technical standards that facilitate renewable energy integration, strengthening of regulatory agencies that can effectively oversee liberalized electricity markets, and development of clear, stable policy frameworks that provide investors with confidence for long-term commitments.

Social and economic dimensions of energy transition also demand attention. Ensuring that energy access reaches poor and marginalized communities, not just economically advantaged populations, requires careful attention to affordability and deliberate targeting of underserved areas. Managing impacts on existing energy sector workers and fossil fuel-dependent communities necessitates just transition strategies that provide retraining, alternative employment opportunities, and social protection. Building local supply chains and manufacturing capabilities can maximize employment benefits and technology transfer, though this requires coordinated industrial policy alongside energy sector development.

Despite these challenges, the opportunities are immense. Successfully developing Africa’s renewable energy potential could position the continent as a major clean energy producer and exporter, particularly for green hydrogen and electricity exports to Europe via undersea cables. The job creation potential—up to 38 million positions by 2030 according to the EU announcement—could transform employment prospects for Africa’s young and growing population. Enhanced energy access would catalyze economic development across sectors from manufacturing and services to agriculture and digital economy participation.

Conclusion: A Defining Partnership for Sustainable Development

The European Commission’s €545 million investment package, announced by President von der Leyen at the Global Citizen Festival, represents far more than a financial commitment. It embodies a vision of partnership between Europe and Africa grounded in shared interests—climate stability, sustainable development, economic opportunity, and regional security—rather than outdated models of aid dependency or resource extraction.

By supporting Africa’s renewable energy transition through the Global Gateway framework and the Scaling Up Renewables campaign, the European Union positions itself as a committed partner in one of the 21st century’s defining development challenges. The success of these initiatives will be measured not simply in megawatts of generation capacity installed or kilometers of transmission lines constructed, but in lives transformed through energy access, jobs created in emerging green economies, and progress toward global climate goals that protect the planet for future generations.

As President von der Leyen emphasized, “The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world.” Through this substantial investment and the collaborative campaign it supports, Europe signals its commitment to ensuring that Africa has the resources, partnerships, and support needed to make choices that advance both continental development and global sustainability. The coming months, as the campaign builds toward the G20 Summit in Johannesburg, will reveal whether this vision can mobilize the comprehensive action—political, financial, and technical—required to realize Africa’s renewable energy potential and deliver on the promise of a clean energy future for all.

JPMorgan Chase & Co. is giving a group of its clients front-row access to the energy transition that’s underway in the Gulf states, as the region’s efforts to pivot away from fossil-fuel dependence generate growing investor interest.

“It’s a very compelling story,” said Hannah Lee, Asia-Pacific equity thematic and head of sustainable investing research at JPMorgan Securities. That applies “both for their own electricity generation, but also for the potential to export clean energy at some point in the future.”

JPMorgan will be taking a group of institutional clients, some with an emerging markets and Asia focus, to Saudi Arabia next month. The trip will serve to raise investor awareness around the energy transformation that’s underway across many of the Gulf states, Lee said.

For now, the Middle East remains a bastion of fossil-fuel dominance. It’s home to about 30% of global oil production, and is coming to the clean-energy transition later than many other major economies, including the US, India and China. But the low base from which the Middle East is starting underpins the opportunity to generate returns from early green investments, according to Lee.

“Our entire renewable energy complex of analysts” has been following the build-out in the Middle East, she said. That analysis, which has covered “batteries and renewables and transformers and everything,” has identified “interesting new commitments out of some of the Middle Eastern, Gulf states on renewable energy and energy transition, of which Saudi Arabia is very notable.”

Gulf state efforts to explore clean energy gathered pace after Dubai hosted the annual United Nations climate change conference in 2023, also known as COP28, according to JPMorgan.

This year, the region is expected to spend $10 billion on renewable and nuclear power generation. That’s still less than a tenth of its projected investment in supplying oil and gas, according to the International Energy Agency. In the coming decade, however, solar photo-voltaic capacity in the Middle East and North Africa is expected to increase tenfold, the IEA estimates.

JPMorgan is drawing investors’ attention to clean-energy opportunities in the Middle East at a time when capital previously destined for the US looks for other destinations. That’s amid growing evidence that a number of institutional investors have been put off by President Donald Trump’s escalating attacks on green energy.

Saudi Arabia has set a target of 130 gigawatts of installed renewable capacity by 2030, and will rely on renewables for half the electricity it generates. Abu Dhabi aims to produce 60% of its electricity from renewables and nuclear by 2035. Both sets of targets will require significant investments.

Data provider Kpler estimates that Saudi Arabia is installing 12.8 gigawatts in renewable energy capacity this year. Power demand from data centers and water desalination are further expected to drive renewables growth in Saudi Arabia. As of 2024, the Saudi Water Authority reported that 20% of the energy used in its new desalination plants came from renewable sources, primarily solar power, the Kpler report stated.

However, the stock market has yet to reward some of the biggest players in the region, with the share price of Saudi Arabian utility Acwa Power Co. down by roughly half this year.

Fossil-fuel behemoth Saudi Aramco, meanwhile, has lost about 13% of its market value in the same period, as excess supply drives down oil prices. The company’s importance to the Saudi economy means its share price losses have left a dent on the kingdom’s main stock index, which is down about 7% this year. Dubai’s benchmark equity index, meanwhile, is up about 14%.

Investor interest in the Gulf states has picked up more broadly of late, as the region’s low taxes and light-touch regulations lure hedge funds, private equity firms and wealthy individuals. At the same time, Middle Eastern efforts to dedicate capital to data centers is laying the foundations for a surge in energy demand. Deals to date include a $3 billion agreement backed by Qatar Investment Authority to finance and invest in data centers.

Lee says JPMorgan also expects the region to benefit from growing trade and investment ties with China, as the world’s biggest clean-tech economy steps up exports to developing nations. Chinese companies have sharply increased foreign investment plans in recent years, with more than 360 manufacturing projects announced since 2022.

The Silk Road Fund and various Chinese firms have already signed billions of dollars worth of investments in Saudi Arabia to help the kingdom achieve its renewables targets under Vision 2030.

Saudi Arabia’s abundant sunshine combined with its ability to pump capital into projects it decides to back has already helped it achieve some of the world’s lowest average costs of producing electricity (known as levelized costs of electricity, or LCOE), according to Norway-based energy research firm Rystad Energy.

“It’s quite an interesting trend and plays into the increased South-South trade corporation that we’ve seen kind of growing over the last couple of years,” Lee said.",https://cdn-res.keymedia.com/cms/images/in/deni_638947418339646341.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 11:02:59.351447

The Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids were created to support wider adoption of battery electric vehicles (BEVs), the company said.

In partnership with RML Group, Shell engineered a 34 kWh battery pack using EV-Plus Thermal Fluid with Shell Gas-to-Liquid Technology. This pack can charge from 10% to 80% capacity in under 10 minutes by reducing thermal stresses and allowing higher charging currents, Shell said.

When used in a lightweight, aerodynamic car with an efficiency of 10 km/kWh, the charging rate could reach 24 km (14 miles) per minute, Shell said.

Key Benefits of Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids

Shell said fluids are electrically non-conductive and provide heat transfer by filling interstitial spaces in the battery pack. This ensures consistent temperature control and enhanced protection against thermal events, according to Shell.

“We are thrilled to demonstrate that these fluids can help to significantly improve battery thermal performance. This paves the way towards higher charging efficiencies, enhanced safety, convenience and cost-effectiveness— to support the widespread adoption of BEVs demanded by legislative initiatives around the world,” said Jason Wong, Global Executive Vice President, Shell Lubricants.

Addressing EV Adoption Challenges

Global BEV sales rose 14% in 2024 compared to 2023, according to Shell. EVs in Europe and the U.S. now travel farther than ICE vehicles, but range anxiety and limited charging infrastructure remain concerns. Faster charging solutions like Shell EV-Plus Thermal Fluids help address these barriers, making EV ownership more practical, Shell said.

“Consumers are in pursuit of better energy efficiency, longer driving range and faster charging,” said Robert Mainwaring, Shell’s lead engineer on the project. “Our ambition within this project was to show how these fluids can support significant reductions in charging time. Without compromising cell integrity and lifetime. We believe this will open the door to a generation of more sustainable, efficient and cost-effective battery electric vehicle solutions.”

Democrats are trying to leverage the must-pass bill to extend Affordable Care Act subsidies; the Trump administration is tying a shutdown to potential mass federal worker layoffs.

The current battle focuses on expiring subsidies for the Affordable Care Act that Democrats say will hurt the ability of millions of enrolees to afford insurance. Democrats have also said they want to reverse Medicaid cuts that Trump signed into law this summer.

Republicans are seeking a bill to temporarily extend federal spending at current levels without any add-ons.

If the government shuts down, President Donald Trump and his administration – which has already defied norms on executive power – likely will seek to exert more power.

Trump’s Office of Management and Budget under Russell Vought has moved with more executive authority over spending, which is typically left to Congress. The administration took steps to cancel foreign aid and asserted power to withhold billions in domestic spending.

“I would expect this shutdown to look different than any other shutdown,” said Joshua Sewell, Taxpayers for Common Sense director of research and policy. He said he expects that the Trump team’s actions would be guided by what they believe achieves the most for them politically.

Trump could use a shutdown to dismantle government functions, wrote Max Stier, chief executive of the Partnership for Public Service, a nonprofit focused on improving the federal government.

If lawmakers can’t reach a deal, Stier wrote, Trump and Vought “will have enormous latitude to determine which services, programmes and employees can be sidelined – decisions that could go far beyond what has occurred during past shutdowns”.

Beyond the Antideficiency Act, which says the government cannot spend money or incur debts without Congress’s authority, the shutdown process has historically been guided by traditions, not laws.

In recent past shutdowns, hundreds of thousands of employees were furloughed, but the shutdowns did not result in mass permanent layoffs or significant reorganisations. Under federal law, federal workers also receive back pay for their time on furlough.

Trump and his congressional allies would be in charge of the government amid a shutdown. What could Trump do on his own?

OMB told agencies to ‘consider’ layoff notices

The Trump administration has already reduced the workforce by about 200,000, a number that could grow to 300,000 by the end of the year, Stier wrote. The administration gutted some agencies and programmes, including the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and Voice of America.

The Office of Management and Budget (OMB) provided an email, first published by Politico, that it sent to agency heads that said agencies should consider sending “reduction in force” notices to employees whose programmes are “not consistent with the President’s priorities” or lack mandatory funding or another source of funding, such as the tax-and-spending legislation, HR1 (Trump’s “One Big Beautiful Bill”), which became law in July.

Rachel Greszler, a workforce expert at the conservative Heritage Foundation, said the administration hasn’t mandated layoffs, but directed agencies to “consider” issuing such notices “as a way to let federal employees know which of their jobs could be on the line if Congress reduces their agency’s funding”.

This signals to Democrats that healthcare funding demands could backfire, she said, potentially causing further reductions in the size of the federal government.

Several questions remain, including how many employees could face layoffs and when. The memo says once fiscal year 2026 appropriations are enacted, agencies should revise their plans to reduce staff.

“I believe this memo indicates OMB will pursue a dual path of shutdown-related furloughs and a separate process of mass layoffs,” Sewell said. Whether the layoffs happen before or after funding is restored “is an open question”, Sewell said. “This certainly indicates the administration wants to cut these agencies and programmes at any opportunity either now or in the future.”

Experts offered mixed opinions about whether layoffs would hold up in court. Any such process must follow the rules, such as a 60-day written notice.

“A shutdown provides no new legal authority to engage in widespread firings,” said Sam Berger, who works for the liberal Centre on Budget and Policy Priorities and who worked at OMB during the Biden and Obama administrations.

Senator Chuck Schumer, the Democratic Senate minority leader from New York, said the memo is an “attempt at intimidation” and predicted such firings would be reversed.

Social Security cheques and other mandatory spending will continue

Mandatory spending – ongoing spending that does not require periodic extensions from Congress – generally continues during a shutdown. This means Americans would still receive Social Security cheques and be able to use Medicare and Medicaid.

In previous shutdowns, border protection, medical care in hospitals, air traffic control, law enforcement and power grid maintenance were deemed essential and remained active during the shutdown.

Even continued services can be disrupted. During the 2018-19 shutdown, holiday travellers faced delays as many unpaid TSA staff and air traffic controllers didn’t come to work.

Administrations have a lot of leeway to define “essential” workers. During the 2013 shutdown, the Obama administration closed national parks. In 2018, the Trump administration kept many national parks open with limited services using previously paid park entrance fees to cover personnel costs; the Government Accountability Office concluded that this violated federal law.

The second-term Trump administration is expected to continue priorities such as immigration enforcement and might try to focus cuts on areas that have already been slashed. Trump campaigned on a promise to abolish the Education Department, and his administration has shrunk the Environmental Protection Agency.

There have been four shutdowns in recent decades that lasted more than one business day, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget.",https://www.aljazeera.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/AP25240548052490-1756478286.jpg?resize=1920%2C1440,N,,2025-09-29 10:04:22.506760

Meanwhile, on the supply side, veteran uranium supplier Centrus Energy (LEU -2.19%) has seen its shares soar 450%.
The question now is: Is it too late to buy into Centrus stock?
Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?
The problem is, at its present market capitalization of more than $5 billion, Centrus stock is selling for 47 times free cash flow and 48 times earnings.","In case you haven't noticed, nuclear energy stocks are having a moment in 2025. Four months ago, President Trump signed a series of executive orders designed to accelerate the development of nuclear power stations and secure access to supplies of nuclear fuel in the United States.

Investors in nuclear stocks have been quick to respond to the news. Over the past 12 months, shares of start-ups developing small and micro nuclear reactor plants are on the rise. For example, names like NuScale Power and Nano Nuclear Energy are up 246% and 267%.

Meanwhile, on the supply side, veteran uranium supplier Centrus Energy (LEU -2.19%) has seen its shares soar 450%. Does it still have room to run?

Right place, right time

And what lies behind Centrus's amazing rise -- I mean, in addition to the well-timed support from the President?

Well, there's Russia's war in Ukraine, for one thing. The United States imports 99% of the uranium used in American nuclear power plants, and 27% of that comes from Russia. ""Thanks"" to the war, however, the U.S. government has passed laws banning imports of Russian-sourced uranium, effective in 2028, and that means Centrus' role as a buyer and reseller of imported uranium is only going to get more important over time.

Centrus is further cementing its centrality by developing the capacity to enrich uranium domestically, such that the U.S. won't need to import so much uranium from abroad -- even from friendly suppliers such as France's Orano or from the British-Dutch-German company Urenco.

Alongside Urenco, which operates an enrichment facility in New Mexico, Centrus is the only other company licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to produce low enriched uranium (LEU) in the U.S. (Centrus also possesses a license to produce high-assay enriched uranium, or HALEU, for next-generation nuclear reactors.)

The second part of the puzzle is the artificial intelligence revolution, which is driving up electricity demand to levels where only the rapid building of new nuclear power plants can provide the amounts of power needed. This is why everyone -- from Microsoft to Alphabet to Amazon -- has been inking electricity supply agreements with nuclear power companies lately.

It also speaks clearly to a trend of rising demand for enriched uranium fuel -- which is what Centrus aims to supply.

And yet, this is a story that's been developing for more than a year now -- ever since Constellation Energy Group (CEG 1.59%) announced last year that it would need to reopen Three Mile Island in order to provide the kind of power levels that Microsoft needs. By this point, it's hardly a secret that Centrus is sitting in the proverbial catbird's seat, and likely to profit handsomely as this new nuclear story plays out.

This is the reason Centrus stock is up 450% over the past year. The question now is: Is it too late to buy into Centrus stock? I fear it may be.

Is Centrus Energy stock a buy?

Don't get me wrong -- I'm totally on board with the idea that Centrus will perform well as a business as old reactors ramp their power output, and new reactors -- including new types of small reactors from NuScale, Nano Nuclear, and others -- come online. I'll even acknowledge that Centrus is doing just fine already today.

Centrus recorded a profit of $105 million over the past 12 months -- and these are high-quality profits, resulting in the generation of $107 million in positive free cash flow. The company's balance sheet is also flush, with $400 million more cash than debt in the bank. The problem is, at its present market capitalization of more than $5 billion, Centrus stock is selling for 47 times free cash flow and 48 times earnings.

Those valuations might be defensible if Centrus were growing rapidly today. However, most analysts polled by S&P Global Market Intelligence forecast relatively flat profit growth for the next several years, with earnings only really taking off in 2030 and after, once new reactor types start going online.

While it's possible the stock's valuation will prove justifiable in those years, it's also possible something will happen over the next half-decade to upset this nuclear apple cart, and make Centrus stock look less attractive than investors currently hope for.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/835039/nuclear-power-plant-next-to-a-pond-glowing-red-at-sunset.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:14.617123

Africa's renewable energy potential is huge, yet nearly 600 million people still live without access to electricity. How this clean energy transition unfolds will play a big role in shaping future development, regional stability, and progress on climate change.

Investing now in solar, wind, hydro, and geothermal power is not just a moral and development imperative, it is also a strategic choice that strengthens supply chains, creates up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, and makes energy systems more resilient. Through the Global Gateway investment strategy, the European Union is helping accelerate this transition, delivering major investments in generation, transmission, and cross-border electricity trade, while building stable international partnerships.

The €545 million package expands the EU and Team Europe's clean energy efforts in Africa, with new projects supporting electrification, modernize power grids, and improve access to renewables.

Countries with the projects announced include Côte d'Ivoire, Cameroon, Republic of Congo, Lesotho, Ghana, Central Africa. Madagascar, Mozambique, and Somalia. The ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa' campaign is carried out with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen and relies on the policy support of the International Energy Agency. It aims to drive new commitments on policy and finance from governments, financial institutions, the private sector and philanthropists. They are encouraged to pledge capital or provide support such as expertise and technical assistance.

TRANSCRIPT

Welcome to 20/25 Talks, where we're following our democracy in historic times.

The Republican Party, especially, has kind of used Charlie Kirk as a symbol to suppress free speech, whether it's late-night TV show hosts or J.D. Vance encouraging people to report people who said things.

Arkansas high school senior Ariana Minkle says they're watching teachers get fired for online comments about the assassination of conservative activist Charlie Kirk.

Minkle and some of her peers host a youth podcast on community radio in Little Rock, and she says they're concerned to see political speech censored.

Michigan authorities identified the gunman, who they say rammed a pickup into a packed Mormon church and opened fire, killing two.

They haven't said what the motive of 40-year-old Thomas Jacob Sanford, a Narock war vet, was.

President Donald Trump meets with congressional leaders today in a last-ditch bid to avoid a government shutdown.

Tomorrow, he plans to address an unusual gathering of high-ranking military officers.

That meeting is being described as a pep rally for the services.

Domestic violence shelters say funding cuts and confusion about policy changes will put the lives of survivors and their children at real and immediate risk.

The White House now says shelters can't use federal funds to take in undocumented migrants or offer specific protections to trans individuals.

Krista Colon leads the California partnership to end domestic violence.

If I offer a night of shelter to someone who may be undocumented, is my entire funding at risk?

If I sex an individual's pronouns, am I now going to be a target?

Funding levels have never been enough, but federal funding is a cornerstone for programs nationwide.

Tomorrow is the last day to qualify for federal tax credits of up to $7,500 on new electric vehicles, ended in the Republican budget mega-bill.

Critics argue that will undermine clean energy jobs, but Ohio GOP Senator Bernie Marino says the government shouldn't be picking car market winners and losers. - That's not about what kind of car I like or I don't like.

What it's about is letting the marketplace choose.

So get rid of all the incentives, get rid of all the mandates. - Advocates for seniors are warning about the phase out of paper Social Security checks that starts tomorrow.

More than half a million Americans will be forced to use direct deposit or prepaid debit cards.

Maria Friess with the National Committee to preserve Social Security and Medicare says that could be tough for some rural and low-income seniors.

""They may or may not read the material that comes in with their checks.

They may or may not understand the material.

And they may not have any idea that this is coming.""

The administration says it'll improve security.

Critics argue it risks payment delays for folks without bank accounts and gives a windfall to some payment companies.

New York City Mayor Eric Adams has ended his re-election campaign amid extensive accusations of corruption.

Adams was running far behind Democratic Socialist Zohran Mamdani.

Weiss commented, “After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC [investment tax credit].
There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.” The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well.
California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.
The report forecast US storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.","The United States had a record quarter for battery energy storage deployment from April to June, adding 5.6 GW of installations, according to a report released by the ACP and Wood Mackenzie.

Utility-scale storage led the way, adding 4.9 GW in the quarter and growing 62% year-over-year. This is enough to power 3.7 million US homes during average peak-demand hours, said the ACP.

California, Texas, and Arizona each added more than 1 GW of storage in the quarter, said the report. Wood Mackenzie forecast that Florida and Georgia will be major growth markets, ahead, due to aggressive procurement by vertically integrated utilities. For example, Georgia Power just issued a request for proposals for 500 MW of grid-scale storage.

However, supply challenges may hamper utility-scale growth, said Allison Weis, global head of storage at Wood Mackenzie. Weiss commented, “After 2025, utility-scale storage projects must comply with new, stringent battery sourcing requirements to receive the ITC [investment tax credit]. While domestic cell supply is ramping up, supply chain shortages are possible although developers are continuing to consider supply from China to fill in any gaps. A rush to start construction under the more-certain near-term regulatory framework uplifts the near-term forecast. Projects that have not met certain milestones by the end of 2025 are at risk of exposure to changing regulations. There is additional downside risk if further permitting delays threaten solar and storage projects.”

The residential storage market saw a leap in installations in Q2 as well. It added 608 MW in the quarter, representing a 132% increase year-on-year. Most of the growth was driven by California, Arizona, and Illinois, as attachment rates hit new highs and higher-capacity systems gained market share.

Batteries are included at an increased rate in quoted residential solar projects, said a report from EnergySage. Outside of Hawaii, which has a 100% battery attachment rate, California led the way among top-10 solar state markets, with 79% of quoted projects including batteries. This was followed by Texas (61%), Arizona (47%), Utah (44%), Florida (43%), and Illinois (25%).

“Residential storage is expected to outpace solar due to stronger policy resilience, high attachment rates in key markets like California and Puerto Rico, and continued ITC access through third-party ownership,” said Allison Feeney, research analyst at Wood Mackenzie.

The community-scale, commercial and industrial segment expanded 11% in Q2, adding 38 MW. California and New York led Q2 in the segment’s storage installations, accounting for over 70% of total capacity, while Illinois gained traction, said ACP.

The report forecast US storage will reach 87.8 GW by 2029, driven by residential and utility-scale segments.

However, the report warns US utility-scale storage installations could drop 10%, year-over-year, in 2027, largely due to uncertainty over pending Foreign Entity of Concern regulations on battery cell sourcing.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BESS.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 09:01:42.228073

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
More buyouts worry opponents Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Therefore, accelerating renewable energy integration in the power system and electrification of the transport and industry sectors are crucial.
Currently, global markets demand products with smaller carbon footprints, while data centres and electric vehicles (EVs) seek clean electricity.
Notably, this policy applies exclusively to data centres, reflecting the government’s strong commitment to supporting the industry’s growth.
By advancing its energy transition, Thailand can gain a competitive edge in attracting clean investment for data centres.","Thailand updated its Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) in 2022, in which it committed to reducing greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) by 30% below a business-as-usual level, which is about 388 million tonnes of carbon dioxide (MtCO2), by 2030. With adequate international support, Thailand will aim for a 40% reduction, or 333 MtCO2. To meet carbon neutrality by 2050, Thailand will need to reduce its GHG emissions by 73-83% compared to 2015 levels.

Given that the energy sector accounted for about 69% of total emissions in 2019, decarbonising it will be indispensable to cut emissions. Within the energy sector, the power and transport sectors took up to 68% of total emissions in 2022. Therefore, accelerating renewable energy integration in the power system and electrification of the transport and industry sectors are crucial.

The draft RPDP sets ambitious emission reduction targets for the power sector, which reduce CO2 emissions by 18% in 2030 and 38% in 2037, compared to the previous plan. Under this pathway, emissions are projected to fall from 95.5 to 77.7 MtCO2 in 2030, and from 99.7 to 61.8 MtCO2 in 2037.

Achieving these targets will be particularly important given the country’s export-oriented manufacturing strategy, rising demand from data centres and EV adoption. Currently, global markets demand products with smaller carbon footprints, while data centres and electric vehicles (EVs) seek clean electricity. Aligning with international governance frameworks is imperative to maintaining Thailand’s global competitiveness in this era of growth.

Thailand is positioning itself as a regional green manufacturing hub, with a strong focus on electric vehicles. Under its 30@30 policy, unveiled in 2021, the government aims for zero-emission vehicles to make up at least 30% of total auto production by 2030. That target could drive exponential growth in EV adoption over the coming years.

The country is on the right track to promote a rapid EV adoption, which will help attract foreign investment, build new skills, and leverage its long-standing auto industry expertise. But, to fully realise the climate benefits of transport electrification, the power system must evolve in parallel with EV adoption, ensuring that clean energy supplies the rising demand for charging.

According to the RPDP, EVs are likely to account for about 68 terawatt-hours (TWh) of electricity demand by 2037, or roughly 20% of total consumption. The plan also assumes a 40% reduction in peak demand from EV charging through demand-response incentives and vehicle-to-grid integration. Ember’s analysis suggests the projection underestimates the real impact. Adjusting to a more realistic scenario, with peak demand rising to 50% of the normal peak pattern starting in 2026, the forecast adds an extra 3,355 megawatts (MW) above the RPDP baseline – lifting total peak demand to 57,901 MW by 2037.

The EV boom presents a double-edged sword: it risks straining the grid while accelerating the decarbonisation of road transport. Ensuring that clean energy powers EV charging will be crucial.

Thailand is looking to create a booming market for data centres, which is expected to grow at an annual rate of 7.5%-8.5% between 2025 and 2027 due to rising internet and digital payment usage, widespread cloud adoption, and AI integration across sectors.

The country’s “Cloud First” policy is a government initiative to speed up cloud computing adoption in both public and private sectors. The favourable policy has, so far, attracted $2.8 billion from major investors such as Amazon Web Services, Microsoft, TikTok, Huawei, ST Telemedia and NTT. Google also announced a $1 billion investment in data centres last year to meet growing cloud demand and support AI adoption in ASEAN. The country also benefits from strategic connectivity to China and India, alongside growing links to other markets through an expanding submarine cable network.

Thailand’s electricity demand for data centres is forecast to grow at 8% CAGR from 2025 to 2027 and reach 6 TWh by 2030, or 2.2 % of total electricity demand. Our cost-optimal pathway factors this additional demand from data centres with the assumption of the growth rate to remain constant throughout the whole timeframe, adding about 10 TWh of electricity demand in 2037.

To ensure clean energy meets this demand, in late 2024, the Thai government approved a direct power purchase pilot project. This enables investors in data centres of at least 50 MW to purchase electricity directly from renewable energy generators under a direct power purchase agreement (DPPA). The total procurement capacity of the Pilot Project is expected to be 2,000 MW.

For the first time in the country, the single-buyer system is being relaxed to ease the monopoly over electricity trading and transmission access. Notably, this policy applies exclusively to data centres, reflecting the government’s strong commitment to supporting the industry’s growth.

This incentive paves the way for hyperscale data centre companies to invest in Thailand, as many have pledged to 100% use of renewable energy in data centres. For instance, Microsoft is committed to having 100% of its electricity consumption matched hourly by zero-carbon energy purchases by 2030, Amazon set a goal to supply all of the electricity consumed with 100% renewable energy by 2030, but already achieved it 7 years earlier. Google’s next major target is to operate on 24/7 carbon-free energy by 2030.

Malaysia and Indonesia are considering adding more gas capacity or delaying fossil fuel phase-outs to meet rising data centre demand – an approach that runs counter to the renewable energy commitments of major data centre investors. By advancing its energy transition, Thailand can gain a competitive edge in attracting clean investment for data centres.

“85% of our protected habitats are now considered to have an unfavourable status, while one third of our protected species have received the same label – horrifically, over half of native plant species are in decline and more than 50 bird species are of high conservation concern.

“We cannot afford to lose any more species than we already have – the knock-on effect of biodiversity loss is catastrophic for all facets of life.

“Today, I’m visiting the site of August’s fish kill in the River Blackwater, County Cork, where up to 42,000 fish died as a result of an unknown pollutant – this event is emblematic of the government’s approach towards environmental protection.

“Last week, a multi-agency report said the cause of the fish kill cannot be identified – I’m meeting local anglers today to assess the effects of the kill on the local community.

“Meanwhile, Ireland’s nitrate derogation has resulted in the nitrate levels in our rivers jumping by a staggering 16 percent in the first six months of this year – this is disastrous for our water quality and biodiversity.

“Despite our awareness of this issue, the government refuses to plan for any alternative future without the derogation, leaving farmers and rural communities in complete uncertainty.

“Ireland’s transition from a linear to a circular economy has never been taken seriously by the State – our plastic recycling rates, for example, are shockingly low at 30%, lagging behind the EU target of 50% – this is a direct result of poor policy decisions, a lack of enforcement, and chronic underfunding.

“It is the opinion of the Environmental Protection Agency that it is already too late for us to meet our 2025 EU recycling targets – lessons must be learned from these failings.

“Environmental policy must be front-footed to preserve nature in Ireland – Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil have been playing catch-up for years now, allowing the health of our countryside and waterways to degrade at an alarming rate.

“The government must comply with the EEA’s report and introduce urgent, large-scale measures that go beyond the weak plans and policies that have left us in this mess.

“The average EU spending per country on environmental protection measures in the last five years was 2.2% of GDP, but Ireland’s expenditure was just 0.9% – Budget ‘26 must allocate greater funding towards environmental initiatives to ensure this disaster does not become irreversible.

Sean Casten (D-IL) launched a “cheap energy agenda” aiming to address rising energy bills by restoring tax credits for cheap energy, building out a modernized electricity grid, connecting cheap energy to the grid, developing cheap, clean energy, protecting consumers, and involving communities in energy projects.
Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high.
“More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.” Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation.
Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump’s megabill.","“For nine months, we watched this Administration and congressional Republicans do everything to stifle clean energy, and clean energy is the fastest growing and the cheapest source of electricity,” Rep. Mike Levin (D-CA) told the Washington Examiner.

“Republicans are blocking the only sources of energy that can be built fast enough to meet growing demand and cheaply enough to actually keep energy bills in check,” he added, pointing to expiring clean energy tax credits.

Following the passage of Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, Democrats not only leaned into the cuts to entitlement programs such as Medicaid, but have also highlighted the GOP’s aggressive phasing out of clean energy tax credits from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act.

Trump’s multitrillion-dollar spending plan extends the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act. The massive piece of legislation, passed through a process called reconciliation, not only extends the lower individual tax rates that were part of the 2017 law but also makes them permanent.

The cost of electricity has continued to soar for most Americans and is shaping up to be a campaign issue for the 2025 and 2026 elections. In the New Jersey governor’s election this November, Rep. Mikie Sherrill (D-NJ) and Republican Jack Ciattarelli have both shifted their focus as electricity bills are at the top of voters’ minds in the state.

“Day One as governor, I’m declaring a state of emergency on utility costs using emergency powers to end these rate hikes and drive down your bills,” said Sherrill in her first TV ad of the general election.

Ciattarelli pledged to “lower electricity bills” in a campaign ad and has worked to tie Sherrill to the current Democratic governor on electricity prices as he looks to an “all of the above approach.”

The New Jersey gubernatorial race is not the only place where energy prices are being made a center point. Just this week, Gov. Wes Moore (D-MD) announced a rebate program for utility bill payments as part of his latest effort to lower energy costs for Marylanders. He’s up for reelection in 2026.

Levin and Rep. Sean Casten (D-IL) launched a “cheap energy agenda” aiming to address rising energy bills by restoring tax credits for cheap energy, building out a modernized electricity grid, connecting cheap energy to the grid, developing cheap, clean energy, protecting consumers, and involving communities in energy projects.

Levin said his legislation is a direct result of concerns brought to him by his constituents.

“I think there’s a great deal of frustration that you have people in my district and districts all across the country who are really struggling to make ends meet, costs are very high across the board, and electricity bills are going up and up and up, and others that want to do energy efficiency upgrades are finding those upgrades to be extremely expensive without these credits,” Levin told the Washington Examiner.

Many electricity bills come with a monthly chart showing how much energy costs have risen, making it apparent to voters when costs are high.

“Americans want lower costs, and rising energy bills will be a regular, unavoidable reminder to voters that House Republicans have failed miserably at fulfilling their central campaign promise,” Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spokesman Viet Shelton told the Washington Examiner. “Broken promises and working families facing bigger and bigger bills because of the Big, Ugly Law — these will be the leading reasons Republicans will lose their majority next year.”

Rep. Josh Riley (D-NY) has also been highlighting high electricity prices. He introduced the Keep the Lights Local Act, which aims to cut costs.

“Utility bills in Upstate New York haven’t been this high in a decade,” Riley wrote on social media. “More than a million homes are now at least two months behind on payments.”

Electricity prices have increased at a pace almost double that of inflation. For the year ending in August, electricity shot up 6.2%, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Consumer Price Index.

The Trump administration has blamed Biden-era green energy initiatives and the accelerated phaseout of traditional fossil fuels such as coal. Trump called increased reliance on wind and solar energy production “THE SCAM OF THE CENTURY!”

In an interview with the Washington Examiner in August, Energy Secretary Chris Wright backed up Trump’s assessment.

“If you take a grid or a system and grow the renewables penetration, you will raise the price of it,” Wright said. “The president’s 100% correct in that.”

The National Republican Congressional Committee, which is seeking to hold or flip House seats in New York and California, said higher utility rates are the result of blue state leadership.

“Utility rates in blue states are the direct result of the failed leadership, misplaced priorities, reckless spending, and radical policies of governors like [Gavin] Newsom and [Kathy] Hochul,” NRCC spokesman Mike Marinella told the Washington Examiner. “No false attack changes the fact that liberal wish lists in Albany and Sacramento have driven up prices for their constituents while Republicans are left cleaning up their mess.”

A September analysis by Inside Climate News found the average household price of electricity in the United States rose by 9.5% this year, with the highest spikes found in Missouri (38.3% increase), North Dakota (33.6%), New Jersey (28.6%), Iowa (27.5%), and Montana (25.3%)

The blame game comes as the cost of living is a persistent issue for voters across the nation, specifically, concerns about the rising cost of energy.

According to left-wing think tank Data for Progress, 60% of voters reported paying more for electric bills than last year. A PowerLines poll conducted with Ipsos shows that “three out of four Americans, across party lines, say they are worried about rising utility bills.” The Energy Information Administration estimated that average residential electricity prices in the U.S. will jump from $0.1648 per kilowatt-hour in 2024 to around $0.1790 per kilowatt-hour next year.

HALEY STEVENS TO FILE ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT AGAINST RFK JR.

As prices continue to rise, clean energy advocates insist that renewables are not to blame, arguing that some states with the cheapest electricity have built large amounts of wind and solar power. EIA data compiled by American Clean Power show that the top 10 states with the largest share of renewables in their energy makeup have seen significantly smaller electricity price hikes over the last year than the national average (a roughly 2.5% increase).

Along with electricity prices, Democrats continue to message on Medicaid following the passage of Trump’s megabill. From the onset, Democrats labeled the bill the “big, ugly law,” as they held hundreds of events across the country to say that Medicaid cost savings would kick millions of people off their healthcare. Democrats plan to stick to their plan of slamming the bill, even though the tightening of Medicaid eligibility won’t kick in until after the 2026 elections.

Among the emerging technologies, lithium manganese iron phosphate (LMFP) batteries are drawing growing attention as a next-generation solution. Forecasts indicate that the LMFP market will expand from USD 1.85 billion in 2025 to USD 6.79 billion by 2034, advancing at a robust CAGR of 15.55 percent. This surge is being fueled by the automotive sector’s demand for high-quality batteries, accelerating investments in battery manufacturing, and government support for energy infrastructure worldwide.

LMFP batteries represent a significant step forward in battery technology. By introducing manganese to the traditional lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry, these batteries achieve improved energy density and extended performance. Available in prismatic, cylindrical, and pouch formats, LMFP batteries are versatile enough to serve passenger and commercial electric vehicles, energy storage systems, consumer electronics, and industrial applications. Their combination of safety, cost-effectiveness, and adaptability is driving adoption across multiple industries.

In 2025, Asia-Pacific dominated the market, reflecting its leadership in both electric vehicle adoption and battery manufacturing. China, in particular, continues to play a decisive role, supported by abundant raw material resources, rapid expansion of lithium mining, and a robust ecosystem of manufacturers including BYD, CALB, and CATL. The region’s influence was highlighted by BYD’s launch of its second-generation LMFP blade battery in 2024, designed to enhance the driving range of light-duty vehicles. Looking ahead, Europe is set to record the fastest growth rate. Countries such as Germany, France, and Italy are ramping up production of commercial EVs and supporting domestic battery manufacturing through major government-backed initiatives. The recent announcement by Verkor to establish a new battery plant in Dunkirk underlines the region’s determination to compete globally.

The automotive sector remains the cornerstone of LMFP battery demand. Electric vehicles account for the largest share of adoption, as carmakers increasingly rely on LMFP chemistry to extend driving range and improve performance without compromising on safety. At the same time, the energy storage sector is rapidly emerging as a major growth driver. Utilities and grid operators are turning to LMFP batteries for backup power and load balancing, recognizing their reliability in managing fluctuating renewable energy supply. This dual role in both mobility and energy infrastructure positions LMFP batteries as a critical enabler of a more sustainable future.

From a technological perspective, the market reflects both tradition and innovation. Conventional cathode synthesis methods continue to dominate due to their scalability and cost efficiency. However, nano-engineered cathodes and advanced coating technologies are quickly gaining traction, offering superior energy density and improved cycle life. These advancements are supported by a wave of partnerships between battery manufacturers and automotive brands, as companies seek to design solutions tailored for next-generation vehicles and heavy-duty applications such as electric buses and trucks.

Form factor is another area of evolution. Prismatic batteries currently lead the market thanks to their space efficiency, long cycle life, and durability. Their use in electric and hybrid vehicles as well as large-scale energy storage systems has cemented their position. Yet pouch batteries are on the rise, especially in consumer electronics and mobility applications, where their lightweight, flexible design and cost-effectiveness make them attractive. With rising investments in new pouch cell manufacturing plants, this segment is expected to accelerate quickly.

Government support remains a critical factor in shaping the industry’s trajectory. Countries across Asia, Europe, and North America are investing billions to strengthen their battery manufacturing capacity, secure raw material supplies, and promote clean energy technologies. For instance, the UK announced a USD 621 million investment in 2025 to bolster its domestic battery sector, while India and China continue to expand incentives for EV adoption and local battery production. These initiatives not only reduce reliance on imports but also ensure that local industries can compete on the global stage.

The distribution landscape reflects this momentum. Original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) dominate sales channels, as automakers prefer to secure batteries directly from trusted partners, ensuring quality and after-sales support. At the same time, the aftermarket is becoming increasingly important, offering replacement and low-cost solutions for consumers and smaller businesses. The rise of e-commerce platforms such as Amazon and Walmart as distributors of LMFP batteries further illustrates how diversified the sales ecosystem has become.

Challenges remain, particularly around scaling up production and balancing costs with performance. Yet the pace of innovation and investment suggests that LMFP batteries are set to move from niche to mainstream far faster than earlier technologies. Their unique blend of safety, affordability, and energy performance positions them as a compelling alternative in a market hungry for solutions that can support both mobility and energy storage needs.

As the world accelerates toward electrification, LMFP batteries are poised to play a defining role. They embody the convergence of science, industry, and policy, standing at the intersection of consumer demand for greener mobility and society’s broader push toward sustainable energy.

METAIRIE, LA, UNITED STATES, September 29, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- Argent LNG, a leading developer of low-carbon LNG infrastructure, is thrilled to announce that the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) has officially accepted its 25 million tonnes per annum (MMtpa) LNG export terminal at Port Fourchon, Louisiana, into the pre-filing process under Docket No. PF25-11.

Following the submission of the readiness letter on September 2, 2025, and FERC’s subsequent confirmation, this milestone accelerates Argent LNG’s path toward construction and operation, positioning the project to deliver reliable U.S. energy to global markets by 2030.

The FERC pre-filing process, under Docket No. PF25-11, initiates formal collaboration with FERC, federal and state agencies, local regulators, and community stakeholders. This phase enables early environmental reviews, engineering advancements, permitting coordination, and transparent engagement to ensure the project upholds the highest standards of safety, efficiency, and environmental responsibility.

“Our acceptance into the FERC pre-filing process under Docket No. PF25-11 is a pivotal step toward realizing Argent LNG’s vision as a premier global LNG supplier,” said Jonathan Bass, Chairman and CEO of Argent LNG. “Designed for speed, efficiency, and performance, this project leverages modular technology and partnerships with industry leaders like Baker Hughes, Honeywell UOP, ABB, and GTT to strengthen U.S. energy security while creating significant economic opportunities for Louisiana.”

Located on a 900-acre site under a 90-year lease at Port Fourchon, the terminal benefits from uncongested deepwater access, proximity to low-nitrogen feed-gas pipelines, and the port’s resilient energy infrastructure. Once operational, Argent LNG will be among North America’s largest and most competitive LNG export facilities, supplying cost-effective American natural gas to key markets in Europe, Africa, South Asia, and South America.

“Port Fourchon is the heart of America’s offshore energy industry, and Argent LNG’s project under Docket No. PF25-11 marks a transformative step forward,” said Chett Chiasson, Executive Director of Port Fourchon. “With our deepwater access, robust infrastructure, and skilled workforce, this project will position Fourchon as a global LNG export hub, driving economic growth and innovation in our region.”

Argent LNG’s hybrid model combines Baker Hughes modular construction with proven technology from Honeywell UOP, ABB and GTT, to minimize timelines, costs, and environmental impacts, setting a new standard for U.S. LNG development.

The DOE report was written by five contrarian researchers whose work has long been perceived as being outside the vast body of climate science, which has shown for years that the burning of fossil fuels is driving global temperatures higher.

Since the report’s release, there has been push back from the science community about how the report’s assertions conflict with decades of research and hundreds of studies. Among the critics are dozens of researchers whose work was cited by the DOE authors, and a new assessment by the National Academies that directly contradicts the government’s assertions by showing how greenhouse gases are endangering human health.

On Wednesday, Energy Secretary Chris Wright argued that the report’s findings were taken straight from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change and other comprehensive climate reports written by hundreds of scientists, but “just in a format that’s easier or accessible, easier for people to read.”

“There’s nothing different in the science in our report and the science in the IPCC reports or even in the National Academy report,” Wright said at an event hosted by The New York Times during Climate Week in New York. “If you’re honest and sober about climate change, to politicians, to the media, that’s a bit of a threat. It kind of gets in the way of a political movement.”

In fact, there is a major delta between the DOE report and mainstream climate scientists.

Indeed, failure to land a deal on a stopgap funding measure before Wednesday would force a shutdown with sweeping implications for federal programs.

It would trigger lapses in authorizations for myriad energy and environment programs, halt most agency work, restrict disaster relief during hurricane season and prompt the White House to carry out its threat to permanently lay off thousands of federal workers.

Before last week’s recess, Senate Republicans rejected a Democratic funding proposal that would have extended government funding while adding more than $1 trillion in new health care spending and imposing guardrails on the White House’s spending moves.

Then, Senate Democrats blocked passage of Republicans’ “clean” funding extension, which had already passed out of the House. Democrats balked at the bill because it did not include their priorities and was not the result of bipartisan negotiations.

This week, Congress may look to pick up where the Senate left off. Thune is expected to put the Republican continuing resolution up for a vote again and dare Democrats to oppose it a second time before the funding deadline.

“The president wants to talk with [Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.)] about that and say, ‘Don’t do that,’” House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) said Sunday.

House and Senate leaders doubled down on their party’s negotiating stances in television interviews Sunday, appearing to leave little room for compromise. Republican and Democratic leaders have been preemptively blaming each other for the potential funding lapse.

While they welcomed the meeting with Trump, Democrats expressed skepticism that it could be fruitful. A similar meeting between Trump and Democratic leaders in 2018 quickly spiraled out of control.

“If the president at this meeting is going to rant and just yell at Democrats and talk about all his alleged grievances and say this, that and the other thing, we won’t get anything done,” Schumer said Sunday on NBC’s “Meet the Press.” “But my hope is it will be a serious negotiation.”

House Republicans are holding a conference-wide call Monday morning, according to POLITICO, and House Democrats have plans to meet on their own Monday evening in Washington. Jeffries has called on Democrats to be on Capitol Hill this week even though Johnson canceled votes.

House GOP leaders have discussed potentially not bringing the House back into session at all this week if there is a shutdown Wednesday, POLITICO reported.

Jeffries said in a “dear colleague” letter last week that “Democrats will be in town and prepared to get the job done.”

Knapton H2 Storage is a consortium led by gas distributor Northern Gas Networks and partnered with BGS, Centrica Energy Storage+, Third Energy Onshore and the University of Edinburgh. The consortium has been awarded ‘Discovery’ funding by Ofgem’s Strategic Innovation Fund (SIF) to undertake a new study to evaluate geological storage potential in the Knapton area, North Yorkshire. The Ofgem SIF funding is designed to drive innovation in energy networks as part of the ‘Revenue = incentives + innovation + outputs’ (RIIO-2) price control for gas and electricity networks.

Energy storage and backup power will become increasingly important as the UK increases the amount of renewable energy supplying electricity. This study is the first of its kind in the region and will undertake a feasibility assessment of the area’s geology to host energy storage technologies, allowing for the decarbonisation of adjacent gas-fired peaking power plants (those that only run when there is high demand) such as that at Knapton.

The Knapton, Vale of Pickering and North Yorkshire area hosts a fantastic diversity of geology that may be used for storing hydrogen. The region contains numerous depleted hydrocarbon reservoirs that may have potential for repurposing, alongside other porous rock aquifers, salt deposits and rocks that may support lined rock shafts. The study will generate an understanding of what is possible for hydrogen storage at scale in the local area, supporting the area’s local economy and the UK’s energy security.

Keith Owen, Head of Energy Futures at Northern Gas Networks said: As more renewables come online, energy storage will be critical to UK energy security and to clean power. Understanding the full potential for storing hydrogen at scale through Knapton H2 Storage will give us key insights into how we can deliver technologies to provide clean resilience on the days where the sun doesn’t shine and the wind doesn’t blow.

Chris McClane, Energy Transition Interface Manager at Centrica said: “Centrica’s Knapton site is being redeveloped as a clean energy hub for solar generation, green hydrogen production, and battery storage. We’re also exploring hydrogen storage as it offers a reliable, flexible solution to support the energy system of the future that will require diverse fuel supplies ready for when the sun doesn’t shine and wind doesn’t blow. This project will advance the readiness of hydrogen storage technologies by unlocking a replica model to realise its potential at scale to supply hydrogen-to-power generation.”

Edward Hough, Research lead, Underground Energy Storage at the British Geological Survey said: “The natural geology of the area around Knapton will play an important role in supporting the use of hydrogen in the region. Storing hydrogen gives flexibility to the energy system, allowing excess hydrogen to be stored for use during periods when demand exceeds supply. In this project, BGS will build on its extensive laboratory and mapping programmes to help identify areas of the underground geology that may represent future exploration targets for hydrogen storage in bedrock.”

The federal government had come a long way from the heckuva-job-Brownie days of George W. Bush and Michael Brown, the unqualified head of the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) who mangled the Hurricane Katrina disaster response in New Orleans and on the Gulf Coast.

Yet 20 years and another unqualified FEMA leader later, despite reforms intended to guard against future agency heads joking (or not) about the hurricane season, America’s disaster response has devolved into something more akin to the pre-FEMA era’s improvisions. After two decades of major disasters in the 1960s and ’70s like the Hilo, Hawaii, tsunami, the Alaska earthquake (the worst in American history), and major hurricanes including Agnes, the National Governors Association called for a reorganization of the country’s decentralized emergency preparedness and disaster response systems in 1977. FEMA debuted two years later.

The Trump administration’s zeal to stamp out a flawed but essential agency has been interrupted by the mind-numbing display of bureaucratic micromanaging: the federal response to the Central Texas flash floods in July that killed 135 people, among them children vacationing in summer camps. “As sad as that is, unfortunately, that is typically what moves the needle in terms of disaster policy throughout history,” says Jeff Schlegelmilch, director of the National Center for Disaster Preparedness at Columbia University. “It’s not the data forecasting what’s going to happen. It’s the lives lost when it does happen—and this happened in a red state.”

The requirement that Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem sign off on agency expenses above $100,000 compromised FEMA disaster hotline availability and search and rescue missions so severely that FEMA’s head of urban search and rescue resigned in frustration.

None of those facts made it into an August DHS press release that offered an upbeat, wholly unsubstantiated perspective on the agency, declaring that after 200 days, “FEMA is 100% faster in getting boots-on-the-ground to respond to disasters.” Nim Kidd, the head of the Texas Division of Emergency Management, claimed, “I’ve been doing this for more than 30 years, and I can say with confidence that this was the fastest and most effective federal support Texas has ever received.”

Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order that “empowers State, local, and individual preparedness and injects common sense into infrastructure prioritization and strategic investments through risk-informed decisions that make our infrastructure, communities, and economy resilient to global and dynamic threats and hazards.” An administration “review council” will consider what comes next for the emasculated agency, with a final report due in November.

Only the federal government can come up with billions of dollars in the direst catastrophes.

But common sense isn’t so common. Only the federal government can come up with the billions of dollars and assets to backstop the 50 states, local governments, territories, and tribal lands in the direst catastrophes. In an era when storms and wildfires are more frequent, stronger, and more expensive to respond to and recover from, shifting more of that burden onto states and localities after a jumble of executive orders, layoffs, firings, and delaying or withholding funds displays an obsession with cost-cutting by any means necessary and no concern with the ability of states to deal with catastrophes.

One long-held fallacy that cratered FEMA’s public image is the misguided belief that the federal government parachutes in with fists full of dollars to backstop local efforts as soon as the rains end or the last embers flicker out. It’s led to “Where’s FEMA?” outbursts by angry, despondent survivors who aren’t aware of officials scrambling, or have been taken in by mis/disinformation that compounds their agonies.

After a disaster, local and state officials are the first ones on the ground in many cases, not FEMA. The amount of financial assistance that a community might receive depends on the scope of devastation. A small storm or fire that affects few properties, with no loss of life, particularly in areas that are susceptible to severe storms and wildfires, is usually handled by municipalities and states.

Even broader damage might still not reach the federal threshold for a disaster declaration. The federal government has been selective in how it responds. The National Emergency Management Association reports that in fiscal year 2023 there were nearly 25,000 disasters in the United States; of those, only 60 received a federal disaster declaration.

Under the 1988 Stafford Act, the president approves major disaster declarations for cataclysmic situations that are beyond the capabilities of local and state officials, and emergency declarations for smaller upheavals where federal assistance can help stave off more serious consequences.

“The issue that it often comes down to is who is going to pay for those resources?” says Samantha Montano, a Massachusetts Maritime Academy associate professor of emergency management. “That’s why that declaration is so important, because it comes with money.”

FEMA has historically paid most of the costs for major disasters. Urging states to improve how they gear up for seasonal upheavals like tornadoes, hurricanes, and wildfires is not new. Having states budget for disasters as they might for education or health care has had support from Democrats and Republicans. One such proposal, a state disaster deductible proposed by Craig Fugate, the FEMA administrator during the Obama years, evaporated under the first Trump administration.

But swerving from dependence on Washington after a catastrophe to deep budget cuts and homegrown self-reliance in just a few months produced the horror show that played out on the ground in Texas Hill Country.

PRESIDENT BIDEN SIGNED A MAJOR DISASTER declaration for North Carolina after Tropical Storm Helene on September 28, 2024. The day before, Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont (D) approved the deployment of an eight-member volunteer urban search and rescue team to assist local officials in western North Carolina under the auspices of the Emergency Management Assistance Compact (EMAC). The mayor of Norwalk agreed to send a volunteer from the city’s fire department, a hazmat command and communications unit, along with a fire department utility truck and an ATV for the mission.

EMAC, a national mutual aid framework overseen by the National Emergency Management Association (NEMA), provides disaster relief in all 50 states, the District of Columbia, Guam, Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Northern Mariana Islands, with people and equipment, but not funding. States providing assistance can seek reimbursement or send aid at no cost to a receiving state; but that is not linked to a state’s request for a federal declaration or funding. Connecticut and the other New England states also have reciprocal disaster assistance relationships with Canada’s eastern provinces through the International Emergency Management Assistance Compact.

With fewer natural disasters, Connecticut sends more assistance than it receives. “When we put in a bid to help another state, we up front say this is what it’s going to cost, so we know what resources are going to get reimbursed if we send them,” says William Turner, the state’s emergency management director. “[EMAC] is really the mechanism that allows all of us to respond and recover before we have to get FEMA pulled in. We’ve got that piece pretty well figured out. We just need to understand where FEMA is going to end up when the dust settles.”

In New Orleans, local residents have stepped into the city’s disaster preparedness void.

EMAC isn’t safe from a disintegrating FEMA. The mutual aid system runs exclusively on National Incident Management System funding provided through DHS and FEMA. However, in early September, FEMA failed to sign off on EMAC’s annual $2 million grant. Lynn Budd, NEMA’s president, told the national news outlet NOTUS that the episode “certainly flies in the face of the idea that states need to take on more responsibility.” The system finally received its monies, but this snafu raises critical questions about how EMAC can remain effective and navigate the volatile federal environment.

“EMAC works well, as long as there is trust and security among the states that there is going to be funding to pay for those resources,” Montano says. “Once you lose assurance that there is going to be funding for those resources, that can break apart very quickly, not because other states don’t want to help each other, but because the funding isn’t there to do it.”

Before Helene, North Carolina was fairly well off, with a healthy $5 billion in its reserve fund for disasters. Today, about $1 billion has gone to disaster relief, with that account now down to about $3.5 billion. State officials have estimated the total cost of Helene at $60 billion. The proposed state budget for fiscal year 2026 is nearly $34 billion. FEMA has reimbursed about $1 billion.

Trying to work around bureaucratic inertia can backfire. Henderson County in western North Carolina decided not to wait for FEMA funds for debris removal and spent $20 million up front, thinking that the federal payout would be speedier. Across the border, Tennessee took another tack, setting up a Helene Emergency Assistance Loan Program. The $100 million loan fund provides no-interest loans to eligible counties for hauling debris, as well as water and wastewater infrastructure repairs.

Even wealthy states that see frequent natural disasters don’t have the fiscal wherewithal to absorb the multibillions of a major catastrophe. Florida relies heavily on the federal government for response assistance and dollars. In the wildfire sector, California and Washington have devised budgetary formulas based on past disaster costs to allocate funds to disaster accounts. Montana moves a portion of excess general funds once every two years into a wildfire suppression fund. But though those steps have to be taken, particularly now, they don’t deliver enough money.

For some states, moving from “what if” to the “when” in state disaster budgeting is a radical paradigm shift. Historically less-prepared states have had to step up recovery and resilience programs. After several years of federal disaster declarations, an extreme rainfall event in 2015, and Hurricanes Matthew in 2016 and Florence in 2018, South Carolina created an office of resilience. Focusing on coastal and riverine areas, the state encourages strategies to manage waterways and mitigate flooding across communities, recognizing that if a downstream area has strong building codes, storm plans, and public awareness of risks, those efforts may not matter much if an upstream town doesn’t make comparable investments.

Being proactive is critical, says Peter Muller of the Pew Charitable Trusts’ Managing Fiscal Risks project. “They’re trying to put money aside for costs they know they’re going to have, officially, before it happens, so that you don’t have to go and suddenly scramble and pull money from other priorities when a disaster does happen.”

Local residents also have stepped in to fill disaster preparedness gaps. Imagine Water Works, a New Orleans climate and disaster relief group, set up community power stations in neighborhoods after Hurricane Zeta in 2020, when three hurricanes and two tropical storms hit the state, the most in any calendar year. Residents were able to charge devices at homes and businesses that still had or regained power.

With the pandemic raging, residents were also able to pick up hand sanitizer, masks, and other COVID-19 supplies. The group asked fire stations to host charging stations and help people get oxygen for medical devices. They reached out to the city again the following year, and by the third year New Orleans officials began to duplicate their efforts. Fire stations also offer cooling facilities now.

With a robust network of indigenous and LGBTQ people, the group also has locations in Houma and southwest Louisiana as well as other local groups across the Deep South. “My relationship is very good with government. Folks who work in that space will contact me directly and ask for help spreading messages to folks, and we have a large social media presence, and we’re trusted,” says Klie Kliebert, the group’s executive director.

TO MARK THE KATRINA ANNIVERSARY, a group of past and present FEMA employees demanded that Congress wake up to the threat posed by dumping the agency leadership reforms that came out of the 2005 debacle. Some employees were suspended. Restoring FEMA’s independence has support in Congress, but saving FEMA, much less any of the dozens of vital agencies that have been rocketed into oblivion by the Trump administration, hasn’t prioritized faster action.

President Trump’s assault on disaster assistance has had one unifying effect, ginning up varying degrees of outrage and disbelief from every corner of the country. In the short term at least, there’s been the faintest glimmer of off-camera comity between Texas and California, two of the most disaster-prone states in the country, despite the cold civil war over redistricting: In mid-July, Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) sent a three-member human remains detection team to Texas, which boosted urban search and rescue personnel in Texas to 42 people.

Twenty states have sued FEMA and DHS to restore funding that had already been allocated under incentivized mitigation programs like Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities (BRIC), enacted under the first Trump administration. This second time around, FEMA canceled BRIC. A federal judge ordered the White House to halt any reallocation of $4 billion in BRIC funds.

2025 has been a quiet season on the hurricane front—so far. Escaping the threat posed by Hurricane Erin, which steered off into the open Atlantic away from coasts, appears to have dampened any urgency in Washington surrounding this mess. What happens next will signal whether the states can hang together and demand an end to whims disguised as policy or whether federalism is as moribund as the rest of America’s democratic systems. It may take another massive calamity to field-test that proposition.",https://prospect.org/downloads/23597/download/OCT25%20Gurley.jpg?cb=e58d652a1a0ea9dd369144bbb979e0ec&w=1024,N,,2025-09-29 06:57:55.146929

Bridging the gap with fuel cells Fuel cells provide utilities with a proven, flexible solution to meet growing electricity demand.
By integrating fuel cells into their energy strategy, utilities can capture new growth, retain high-value customers and ensure economic development remains in their regions.","The power industry is at the center of America’s economic growth story. Access to power has become a decisive factor in economic growth. For data centers, manufacturers and other large-load customers, the grid is now a gating factor in site selection for new facilities - and they can’t wait for years for infrastructure to catch up. With interconnection queues stretching upwards of five years in parts of the country, utilities must adopt new and agile strategies that deliver power on accelerated timelines.

Fuel cells offer a flexible and responsive approach to meeting electricity demand that is growing at rates not seen since the 1950s. Their modular design allows for rapid deployment close to the load, helping utilities address immediate capacity needs and support large customers.

By integrating fuel cells into their strategy, utilities can bridge power gaps and position themselves to capture new growth, rather than risk losing business opportunities because new prospective customers have to migrate to regions with more accessible electricity.

Power that keeps pace with demand

For utilities, the challenge isn’t just adding capacity — it’s adding it fast enough to keep pace with customers. Failure to deliver on accelerated timelines can mean losing major customers, and the economic development they bring, to other regions.

“The market has flipped in just a few years,” said Scott Dayer, director of utility and IPP origination at Bloom Energy. “Electrification was already accelerating, and now compute demand is surging on top of that. Together, they’ve turned a system that for years had surplus into one where the real challenge is adding capacity fast enough to keep up with large, hard-to-forecast loads.”

Fuel cells give utilities a way to meet that need without waiting for new transmission lines, substations or conventional generation. They are also a faster alternative to constructing traditional forms of colocated generation like gas engines and turbines, where a customer installs and manages its own onsite power.

Bloom Energy, for example, can deliver up to 50MW in as little as 90 days. With 1 GW of annual production capacity today and 2 GW expected by the end of 2026, Bloom can support utilities in bringing hundreds of MW online in under six months.

For utilities, this capability provides a critical bridge. Fuel cells can serve large-load customers immediately while infrastructure upgrades progress. Plus, unlike gas turbines or reciprocating engines, fuel cells operate quietly, have a smaller footprint and carry a significantly lower emissions profile, making permitting easier and deployments more acceptable to neighboring communities.Crucially, fuel cells deliver firm 24/7 power, ensuring utilities can reliably meet customer demand as projects come online.

Power that scales with demand

Fuel cells offer scalable power that can be deployed at customer sites or at distribution substations, giving utilities maximum flexibility to match load growth over time. For example, Bloom’s skid-mounted “copy-and-paste” modular architecture enables rapid deployment at any scale — from hundreds of kilowatts to hundreds of megawatts — without introducing scaling risk.

This flexibility is especially valuable for large-load customers such as colocation data centers, where demand can expand quickly as new tenants move in after construction is complete. The compact, skid-mounted design of fuel cell systems allows utilities to scale power efficiently. For example, a 20,000-square-foot ground mount can provide 30 MW of power. The same footprint, with a four-unit-tall install configuration, can deliver 100 MW.

Case in Point: AEP Delivers for AWS with Bloom Fuel Cells

American Electric Power (AEP) will be utilizing Bloom Energy Server systems to provide immediate, reliable power to Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Cologix data centers in Central Ohio. The fuel cells will enable the customer to begin operations quickly while AEP continues to permit and build out traditional transmission solutions over a multi-year timeline. Under these long-term agreements, the customers cover the full project costs, protecting utility ratepayers and ensuring the region retains economic development that might otherwise migrate elsewhere.

Beyond scaling capacity, fuel cells also provide operational flexibility. They can integrate with microgrids, distributed energy resources (DERs) or other grid assets, allowing utilities to optimize energy delivery, improve resilience and respond to shifting demand patterns in real time.

Power that moves with demand

One of the unique advantages of fuel cells is their mobility. Mounted on skids, crews can relocate them after infrastructure upgrades are complete, allowing utilities to optimize deployment as demand shifts. “Equipment can be redeployed as transmission constraints change, so utilities maintain flexibility and avoid overcommitting to one location or site,” Dayer said.

This modular design enables rapid redeployment to meet evolving load requirements, allowing utilities to position capacity where it’s needed most and respond to changing market dynamics efficiently.

Bridging the gap with fuel cells

Fuel cells provide utilities with a proven, flexible solution to meet growing electricity demand. Bloom Energy’s Solid Oxide Fuel Cell Energy Server® power systems can be deployed behind or in front of the meter, or grid-parallel, in a variety of configurations and contracting models, offering utilities the ability to respond to evolving customer needs with speed and reliability.

With a 17-year record of proven reliability, over 1.5 GW of deployed capacity, Bloom’s modular architecture enables rapid, scalable deployment while delivering high efficiency and firm 24/7 power. By integrating fuel cells into their energy strategy, utilities can capture new growth, retain high-value customers and ensure economic development remains in their regions.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/n1MbtebkFObJvYKXM0nv7ihemeOlTIfWxqBTbOWKRSg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzQwNDEzMjAwLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-29 09:02:02.799757

On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.
“It’s clear that states are taking some of their cues from the federal government,” said Nelson Falkenburg, siting policy manager at Clean Tomorrow and one of the report’s authors.
Of the roughly 300 siting bills introduced in the first half of the year, just under 40 were signed into law.
Stitt also publicly broke with Trump earlier this year on federal efforts to roll back clean energy tax credits, and on the administration’s attacks against wind energy.","This hasn’t been a kind year for developers looking to break ground on renewable energy projects.

On President Donald Trump’s first day in office, he issued a memorandum halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which passed in July with exclusively Republican support, accelerated the phaseout of tax credits promised under the Inflation Reduction Act for wind and solar projects. Subsequent guidance from the U.S. Treasury Department further constrained eligibility rules.

And as bipartisan permitting reform takes center stage in Congress, critics have expressed doubt over whether a technology-neutral bill would still benefit renewable energy development under the current administration.

During a House committee hearing for the SPEED Act on Sept. 10, multiple Democrats expressed concern about their ability to engage in good-faith negotiations with Republicans to accelerate permitting amid the GOP’s attacks on wind and solar. Environmental groups, too, have cautioned that federal efforts to reform permitting could offer little benefit for renewables.

According to a report from the think tank Clean Tomorrow, the battle over renewable development has spread beyond Congress and the Trump administration—with siting policy at the state level now serving as one of the primary battlegrounds for those seeking to curtail the deployment of new clean energy projects.

“It’s clear that states are taking some of their cues from the federal government,” said Nelson Falkenburg, siting policy manager at Clean Tomorrow and one of the report’s authors.

The report’s authors assessed the expected impact of more than 300 state-level siting bills based on factors including their effect on permitting timelines, the predictability and uniformity of siting decisions and whether the bill incentivizes development. Falkenburg said they also used criteria from Columbia University’s Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, when possible, to determine if a policy is restrictive.

According to Clean Tomorrow’s report, from January through June of this year, 148 siting-related bills were introduced across 47 states, seeking to make siting and permitting more restrictive.

That significantly outnumbers bills that would have a neutral impact (89) and those that would be more permissive (68).

Restrictive policies would hinder the development of renewable energy, while permissive policies would facilitate it. Bills that the authors deemed to have a neutral effect are those whose impact on project deployment was negligible or ambiguous, Falkenburg said.

The pushback against renewables, like recent actions at the federal level, is largely driven by the GOP.

Republican state lawmakers introduced nearly twice as many siting bills as Democrats, with an overwhelming number of those likely to restrict renewable development—nine restrictive bills for every one permissive proposal, according to Clean Tomorrow’s analysis.

“There’s a huge subset of these bills that legislators are introducing because they have constituents who are upset about renewable energy or they’re trying to score political points,” Falkenburg said.

“There are some that are purely messaging, and there are others that have real traction and are advancing quickly through their state legislatures.”

A Republican senator in Illinois, for example, introduced SB 160, which would have given local governments the authority to ban or restrict wind and solar projects. That effort had little chance of passing through the state’s Democrat-controlled legislature.

But other anti-renewable bills across the country advanced further through the legislative process. Arizona’s SB 1150, which included a slew of restrictive measures against wind farms, narrowly passed in the state House before stalling in the Senate.

If that bill had passed, Clean Tomorrow’s report says, it would have been the most restrictive wind development law in the U.S.

Thankfully for the renewable industry, the vast majority of those efforts haven’t been successful. Of the roughly 300 siting bills introduced in the first half of the year, just under 40 were signed into law.

Clean Tomorrow’s analysis found that over half of those are expected to have no meaningful impact on the pace of clean energy deployment, with a balance of wins (10 bills) and losses (7 bills) for the renewable industry in the remainder.

One reason the industry avoided some of the worst attacks, according to Falkenburg, is that there was less uniformity in Republicans’ views on renewable energy at the state level when compared to the federal level.

“There’s plenty of nuance in red states, and differences between folks who … have taken on the message from the federal government that clean energy is bad,” Falkenburg said.

“And then there’s plenty of other Republican legislators who are supportive of the industry—but mostly quietly behind closed doors and working to maintain renewable energy production in their states.”

Oklahoma serves as a prime example of that dynamic. The state’s attorney general, Gentner Drummond, has publicly denounced wind energy as a “Green Energy Scam,” and the Republican-controlled legislature passed three bills that would have had a restrictive impact on the deployment of renewable technologies.

Yet Governor Kevin Stitt, also a Republican, vetoed two of those bills—although the GOP-led legislature overrode one of those vetoes—and has been “unabashedly pro-renewables,” according to Clean Tomorrow’s report.

Stitt also publicly broke with Trump earlier this year on federal efforts to roll back clean energy tax credits, and on the administration’s attacks against wind energy.

Clean Tomorrow’s report also points to unlikely alliances in the private sector and local communities as one of the forces pushing back against some of the more egregious attacks on renewables.

For example, the report highlights the role played by a coalition of the renewable industry, business groups and oil and gas interests in Louisiana in defeating HB 615, which would have dealt a significant blow to the state’s emerging solar industry.

Those efforts were mirrored in other states, such as Texas and Oklahoma, where chambers of commerce partnered with ranchers, and the energy sector joined forces with tech companies to oppose some of the more restrictive bills in those states.

In Falkenburg’s eyes, the wrangling over renewable energy siting is likely to intensify in the coming months, with significant potential for states to use siting and permitting to counter anti-renewable actions at the federal level.

“We’re expecting to see a lot of governors introduce executive orders and emergency actions in the next few months to try to mitigate or blunt the impact of the recent federal actions,” Falkenburg said. “And we expect in the legislature in 2026, more states will use this to reform their siting and permitting processes to deploy more energy, more renewable energy projects.”

Some of those actions are already taking root. In May, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore signed the Renewable Energy Certainty Act into law, which aims to standardize siting requirements for solar farms and energy storage devices, and preempts restrictive local zoning rules that prohibit these projects, according to environmental law firm Beveridge & Diamond.

And in California, Gov. Gavin Newsom signed an executive order in late August, fast-tracking the permitting process for energy projects racing to begin construction before federal tax credits expire due to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act’s rollbacks.

According to Falkenburg, such state-level initiatives are going to become increasingly important in the face of the Trump administration’s growing attacks on wind and solar.

“For the renewable energy industry and climate advocates, the lesson here is really stark,” Falkenburg said. “State-level siting policy is a critical and contentious arena for the clean energy transition.”

“As the federal government abdicates its role in energy policy, the future of America’s clean energy economy depends increasingly on the outcomes of state-by-state political battles over where and how clean energy projects can be built.”",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2203448622-1024x682.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 05:59:20.414854

Many executives expressed growing frustration over the obstacles posed by the chaotic trade policies of the Trump administration upon its return to the White House, as well as frequent changes in regulatory guidelines.

For the North American oil and gas industry, which fully supported 'Trump's MAGA-ism,' Trump’s presidency did not make the 'American oil industry great again' as he had promised. Measured by 'production,' U.S. oil output did reach new highs; however, measured by 'business sentiment/profitability/investment willingness,' the industry did not exhibit the strong expansion that Trump had promised, with executive sentiment remaining subdued.

MAGA, short for 'Make America Great Again,' refers both to the core tone of all policies under the Trump-led U.S. government and is also used by some mainstream media to refer to Trump himself and his fervent supporters among U.S. voters.

Making the American oil industry 'great again' essentially equates to 'high production + strong business sentiment + robust investment.' Currently, it is closer to 'high production, low sentiment'—output is impressive, but the central price of U.S. oil, along with policies/tariffs/uncertainty, is suppressing capital expenditure and sentiment. Overall, the entire U.S. oil industry appears more like 'increasing output while suffering internally,' rather than becoming 'great again.'

The Trump administration’s imposition of high steel and aluminum tariffs globally (up to 50% on steel and aluminum) drove up costs for OCTG (oil country tubular goods), pipelines, fracking equipment, and construction, repeatedly cited in the survey report by oil and gas executives as a source of 'rising costs and policy volatility.' On one hand, traditional U.S. energy companies complain about increased costs due to steel tariffs and policy flip-flopping causing 'chaos'; on the other hand, OPEC+ responded to U.S. calls for lower oil prices by ramping up production, thereby capping price elasticity—a development highly unfavorable for profitability in the U.S. oil industry, particularly in shale oil.

Overall, the rapid, concentrated, and directionally inconsistent policy/rule changes under the Trump administration across key areas such as methane regulation, RFS (Renewable Fuel Standard), offshore and public land development, LNG (liquefied natural gas) approvals, carbon emission standards, NEPA (National Environmental Policy Act) procedures, and offshore financial guarantees have made compliance and capital planning difficult to stabilize. These factors collectively fueled collective grievances among executives in the U.S. oil and gas sector—one of Trump’s core constituencies—in the Dallas Fed survey, regarding 'heightened uncertainty and declining investment willingness.'

Collapse of the U.S. shale oil industry

The Dallas Fed's survey, conducted from September 10 to 18, gauged the latest sentiment of 139 oil and gas executives across the most crucial oil and gas regions in the U.S.—Texas, northern Louisiana, and southern New Mexico. The total energy production (primarily oil) from these regions even surpasses that of some of the world’s largest oil-producing nations.

""The U.S. shale sector has already begun to collapse,"" one executive said in the survey. ""Once the most dynamic energy engine in the world, it has now been gutted by political hostility and economic ignorance under the Trump administration.""

""We have entered what might be called the 'shale twilight zone' for this segment of the industry,"" another oil and gas executive commented. ""The U.S. isn't running out of oil, but she (the Statue of Liberty) is certainly running out of oil priced at $60 a barrel.""

""A vibrant oilfield services sector will be critical if the U.S. needs to ramp up production. Right now, we are bleeding,"" an executive from a publicly traded oilfield support services company stated.

Criticism of Trump’s policies is not new, but Wall Street analysts widely noted that the latest commentary represented a significant escalation in tone, with executives describing the U.S. President’s sudden shifts and frequent adjustments on steel tariffs and energy policy as ""kneecapping"" an industry he had promised to support.

The survey also found that executives in the U.S. oil and gas industry now expect West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude prices to remain significantly lower than previously anticipated, forecasting a price of around $63 per barrel by the end of 2025 and staying within the $60 range through 2027; earlier in the second quarter, these executives had predicted WTI would close the year near $68 per barrel and re-enter the optimistic $70 range within two years.

Crude oil futures surged last week due to ongoing attacks by Ukraine on Russian oil infrastructure, undoubtedly adding a rising geopolitical risk premium for long-term buyers of Russian oil such as India and China, along with potential further sanctions from the EU and the U.S.

The cumulative impact of drone strikes became evident as Deputy Prime Minister Alexander Novak announced on Thursday that Russia will impose a partial ban on diesel exports until the end of the year while extending its existing ban on gasoline exports. This move represents a significant obstacle to oil and gas trade for the two major economies, India and China.

President Trump has been consistently and cautiously pressuring U.S. allies to reduce any oil imports from Russia to push President Putin to the negotiating table. Andrew Lipow, president of Lipow Oil Associates, remarked, ""We may see reductions in Russian imports by India and Turkey.""

NATO's warning against further airspace violations has heightened tensions and increased the likelihood of additional sanctions on Russia's oil industry.

Additionally, according to the national news agency, plans to resume crude oil exports from Iraq's semi-autonomous Kurdistan region last Saturday could sustain expectations of oversupply, potentially driving Brent crude prices into a pronounced downward trajectory.

According to reports citing people familiar with the matter, Iraq is in negotiations with one of the most influential giants in the crude oil transportation sector – commodity trading giant Vitol. Once crude oil exports from the country’s Kurdistan region resume after a two-year halt, Vitol will handle the crude sales. This news is evidently negative for the Brent crude price, the international crude benchmark that has been weak for much of this year. The resumption of Kurdish oil exports is expected to intensify expectations of an “oversupplied crude oil market,” potentially pushing the recently rebounding Brent crude price back into a downtrend.

As of last week’s close, the front-month WTI crude contract for November delivery on the New York Mercantile Exchange (Nymex) rose +5.3% to $65.72 per barrel, while the front-month Brent crude contract for November on the Intercontinental Exchange rose +5.2% to $70.13 per barrel. This marks the largest weekly gain for both benchmark crude prices since the week of June 13. Meanwhile, the front-month natural gas contract for October on Nymex rose +0.5% to $3.206 per million British thermal units (MMBtu).

On Friday, Nymex crude, Brent crude, and U.S. natural gas futures rose by 1.1%, 1%, and 0.3%, respectively. The Energy Select Sector SPDR Fund (XLE), representing the energy stock benchmark ETF, gained +3.9% last week but has significantly underperformed the S&P 500 index year-to-date.

Goldman Sachs has emerged as a 'big short' on crude oil: the global oversupply situation is set to worsen, with Brent crude possibly falling below $50 per barrel by 2026.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global crude markets are on the verge of significant oversupply due to OPEC's production increases and expectations that North American shale producers will ramp up output under the Trump administration. The return of Kurdish crude will only exacerbate this surplus. Previous reports indicated that pipeline resumption is initially expected to bring about 230,000 barrels per day to the international market, with the potential for this figure to increase further.

If Kurdish pipelines resume operations as planned, it would marginally weigh on Brent crude prices. An estimated ~230,000 barrels per day are expected to enter the market during the initial phase of Kurdish resumption, potentially rising to as much as 1 million barrels per day later. The IEA assesses that supply dynamics already point toward an oversupply situation in 2025, with the surplus likely to widen further in 2026. The return of Kurdish oil will undoubtedly exacerbate this backdrop of market oversupply.

In its latest commodities research report, Goldman Sachs maintained its forecast for Brent crude and WTI crude prices in 2025, while projecting average prices of $56 and $52 per barrel, respectively, for 2026. However, Goldman Sachs noted that due to the negative impact of increasing global crude oil oversupply, there is a probability that Brent crude futures could fall below the $50-per-barrel threshold by the end of 2026.

The U.S.-based financial institution stated that between Q4 2025 and Q4 2026, the global crude oil market is expected to experience an average daily surplus of 1.8 million barrels, leading to a significant buildup of nearly 800 million barrels in global oil inventories during this period. The report specifically highlighted that inventory increases among OECD member countries will account for one-third of the global total, reaching approximately 270 million barrels. Goldman Sachs added that with worsening oversupply and inventory pressures in 2026, Brent crude prices are likely to fall below current futures market expectations.",https://newsfile.futunn.com/news-thumbnail/20240704/public/1720075538223258302092-news-thumbnail/20240704/public/17200755382238178651278.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 08:01:10.352592

NOAA is using ocean robots to collect hurricane data

Forecasting hurricanes requires a lot of data. To predict when a hurricane will arrive, how strong it will be and where it's headed, meteorologists use sophisticated computer models that interpret measurements from the ocean and atmosphere.

Now, NOAA has another tool in its toolbox for collecting critical ocean information. In collaboration with the University of Southern Mississippi and robotics company Oshen, the agency has launched five small uncrewed surface vehicles.

The craft, called C-Stars, debuted on Aug. 31 by collecting critical weather and marine data off the coast of the U.S. Virgin Islands.

""Understanding weather conditions where the ocean surface meets the lower atmosphere is key to predicting hurricane intensity,"" said Greg Foltz, oceanographer and a lead principal investigator at NOAA's Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory.

""If these miniature uncrewed surface vehicles prove reliable, they could become a critical piece of NOAA's hurricane observing system in the future,"" Foltz added.

NOAA

The C-Stars are currently in a line extending from the U.S. Virgin Islands to Bermuda. The robots can be relocated to various oceanic regions to monitor different weather and marine conditions.

The C-Stars are wind-propelled with solar-powered sensors but are also equipped with electric motor thrusters for when the winds are weak.

The vehicles can operate individually or in fleets when covering a larger area. The C-Stars collect and transmit real-time data via satellite, including wind speed and direction, sea surface and air temperatures, air pressure and relative humidity.

""Although C-Stars have navigated storms with towering 24-foot waves, hurricanes are a whole new level of challenge -- but if it works, the long-term potential is huge,"" said Anahita Laverack, CEO for Oshen.

The C-Stars also collect wave condition information and can capture high-resolution images and videos, which can be retrieved when the craft returns to port.

""If these miniature uncrewed surface vehicles prove reliable, they could become a critical piece of NOAA's hurricane observing system in the future,"" Foltz added.

""We believe that these new, small USVs can move the needle in how we observe and understand hurricanes, while keeping budgets under control,"" Laverack added.

Lavarack told ABC News that the C-Stars are smaller, lighter, and cheaper to make and deploy than larger platforms, like the Saildrone that NOAA has used during previous hurricane seasons.

""Our size and platform cost allow us to field a constellation of many small robot C-Stars. In the future this could mean say 20 datapoints instead of just one within each hurricane, giving a richer understanding of the event,"" stated Laverack.

""We are excited by the role that C-Stars could play in improving hurricane forecasts, which have direct consequences for millions of people along the Gulf Coast,"" said Leila Hamdan, associate vice president for research and professor in the School of Ocean Science and Engineering at the University of Southern Mississippi.

,American Energy,2025-09-29 08:18:55+00:00,Canary Media,Did California just screw up the largest virtual power plant in the US? - Canary Media,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/virtual-power-plants/california-dsgs-funding-2025-legislation,"But the last-minute negotiations left one key money-saving measure on the cutting-room floor — continued funding for what might be the world’s largest virtual power plant.
If not, they’ll have to put those customers on hold — and California could lose hundreds of megawatts of cost-effective grid relief.
First, under DSGS, customers can be paid for sending power to the grid from their home batteries that have been charged up by rooftop solar, he said.
Most other VPPs in California only allow homes to reduce their consumption from the grid to zero, not to send power back to the grid.
As Sunrun CEO Mary Powell pointed out in a LinkedIn post, that’s more capacity than many of the state’s fossil-gas power plants provide.","California lawmakers managed to pass a slate of bills aimed at controlling the state’s high and rising electricity costs in the final days of the legislative session this month. But the last-minute negotiations left one key money-saving measure on the cutting-room floor — continued funding for what might be the world’s largest virtual power plant.

Now, companies like Sunrun and Tesla that have enrolled tens of thousands of customers in that VPP program don’t know if they can pay them to participate next year, because it’s unclear if any other state funding can be cobbled together. If not, they’ll have to put those customers on hold — and California could lose hundreds of megawatts of cost-effective grid relief.

Lawmakers ​“are consistently undervaluing what distributed solar and storage can deliver for the system,” said Kate Unger, senior policy advisor for the California Solar and Storage Association, a trade group that supports the program. ​“We find this to be very shortsighted and frustrating, because DSGS is a cost-saving measure.”

DSGS stands for the Demand Side Grid Support program, which pays utility customers to help relieve costly peaks in electricity demand during extreme events like heat waves. They do this by cutting their own power consumption with devices like smart thermostats or by feeding extra power to the grid from backup batteries that have been charged by rooftop solar. Customers have already installed and paid for those systems, so making use of them is cheaper than building new power plants or grid infrastructure to manage those peaks.

DSGS has grown quickly since its 2022 launch to more than 1 gigawatt of grid-relief capacity, Unger said, about 700 megawatts of that from batteries in homes and businesses, which can be deployed rapidly. That’s much bigger than other similar programs in the state.

Backers say that’s because DSGS, which is administered by the California Energy Commission, is far less onerous for participants than VPP programs run by the state’s utilities.

It’s also more cost-effective, according to an August analysis from consultancy The Brattle Group. That report, which was commissioned by Sunrun and Tesla, found that solar-charged batteries in DSGS could deliver between tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars in net savings to all California utility customers over the next four years. Those projected savings are predicated on the program nearly doubling its current capacity, which is a credible goal given that California residents are adding backup batteries in increasing numbers.

But instead of expanding its funding to achieve that growth, state lawmakers cut it this year in the face of budget shortfalls, just like they did last year. A provision that lawmakers inserted in August into a bill reauthorizing the state’s greenhouse-gas cap-and-trade program would have provided DSGS with a stable funding stream into the middle of next decade, but it was stripped from the bill that emerged from closed-door negotiations between Gov. Gavin Newsom (D) and legislative leaders days before it was passed. That leaves DSGS with a dwindling pool of previously committed funding that is very likely to be depleted this year.

The remaining budget currently stands at about $64 million, according to the program administrator. DSGS would need at least $75 million more to continue operating in 2026, according to a letter sent to California lawmakers in August by dozens of companies, trade groups, and advocacy organizations.

DSGS backers are hoping the program might be able to secure a slice of the $1 billion in reserves to be disbursed annually from the state’s newly reauthorized cap-and-trade program. But Unger warned that competition for that money will be fierce — and lawmakers won’t make decisions on that spending until next year.

Without new funding, companies that have been active in DSGS will likely have to tell their customers they won’t be able to participate in 2026, said Brad Heavner, executive director of the California Solar and Storage Association. ​“How do you put your customers in a program if you don’t know they’ll get paid?”

Why DSGS is better than California’s other VPPs

The failure to fund DSGS is particularly frustrating, Heavner said, because it’s the rare example of a successful virtual-power-plant program in the state. Though California has ostensibly prioritized VPPs, it has little else to show for its efforts.

For more than a decade, the state has required its major utilities to incorporate rooftop solar systems, backup batteries, smart thermostats, and other distributed energy resources (DERs) into their grid operations and planning. But utilities have done very little to actually tap these devices beyond launching pilot projects (and terminating many of them), even as the number of DERs in the state has grown dramatically. A June progress report from the California Energy Commission found the state has barely expanded its demand-side capacity over the past two years, and remains far from hitting its goal of 7 gigawatts by 2030.

“California is really excellent at deploying DERs, but really lags in DER utilization,” said Gabriela Olmedo, regulatory affairs specialist at EnergyHub, a company that manages demand-side resources and virtual power plants in the U.S. and Canada. Many of those programs have grown to play a significant role in reducing stress on utility grids during peak demand, she said, including a large-scale initiative in neighboring Arizona. But California’s ​“fractured, overlapping, and confusing load-flexibility programs really preclude scale,” she said.

DSGS, one of many programs created in response to California’s grid emergencies in 2020 and 2022, has broken that pattern, said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid-edge research for analytics firm Wood Mackenzie and lead author of a recently released report on virtual power plants. In particular, DSGS has avoided the types of problems that have limited customer participation in other VPP programs, he said.

First, under DSGS, customers can be paid for sending power to the grid from their home batteries that have been charged up by rooftop solar, he said. Most other VPPs in California only allow homes to reduce their consumption from the grid to zero, not to send power back to the grid. That’s a legacy of these programs’ genesis as traditional demand-response offerings that reward customers for reducing power use.

DSGS is also superior to the Emergency Load Reduction Program (ELRP), the other large-scale VPP program created as a response to California’s grid emergencies, Heavner said. One of the biggest differences is that ELRP is triggered only during specified grid alerts, warnings, or emergency declarations by the California Independent System Operator, which manages the state’s energy markets. Those emergencies are relatively rare, so participants are idle most of the time.

DSGS, by contrast, is triggered whenever wholesale prices on the state’s transmission grid exceed a threshold of $200 per megawatt-hour, so it plays a more active role in suppressing the price spikes that drive up costs for utilities and customers, Heavner said.

DSGS is also open to customers of all utilities in the state, unlike ELRP and most of the state’s other VPP programs, which are managed separately by each of California’s three large investor-owned utilities. Companies that have participated in both sets of programs say it’s easier to sign up customers and get them paid promptly under DSGS than under utility-managed efforts.

Killing California’s most promising VPP right as it’s getting big

A set of laws passed this year instructs state regulators to develop new VPP plans and programs, which could augment the current limited options. But ​“it will take years to establish that,” Heavner said. Meanwhile, ​“companies that have invested in dynamic grid response are left holding the bag right now.”

California may miss out on big money-saving opportunities as a result, he said. A 2024 analysis from The Brattle Group found that VPPs could shave more than 15% of the state’s peak demand by 2035, saving utility customers about $550 million each year.

The loss of funding for DSGS is particularly galling given the scale it has achieved, Heavner said. In a July test of the DSGS and ELRP programs, California’s three major utilities were able to dispatch about 540 megawatts of power from Sunrun and Tesla batteries, in what utility Pacific Gas & Electric described as ​“the largest test of its kind ever done in California — and maybe the world.”

Most of those batteries were enrolled in the DSGS program. Sunrun batteries alone accounted for at least 360 megawatts of capacity. As Sunrun CEO Mary Powell pointed out in a LinkedIn post, that’s more capacity than many of the state’s fossil-gas power plants provide.

Sunrun had enrolled more than 56,000 customers with solar-battery systems to participate in California VPP programs as of May, the majority of them in DSGS. The company offered participants up to $150 per battery enrolled in the 2025 season.",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/solar-ca-homes-neighborhood.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=eff1726590319d11b9d913c0e3c78e9a,N,,2025-09-29 09:02:06.867769

By 2030, blue hydrogen will likely supply 25–30% of clean hydrogen demand worldwide, ensuring industries can decarbonize while green hydrogen scales.","The Global Blue Hydrogen Market has emerged as one of the most promising segments of the clean energy transition, bridging the gap between traditional fossil fuel-based hydrogen and fully renewable green hydrogen. In 2024, the market was valued at USD 2,242.24 million and is projected to reach USD 2,511.31 million in 2025, before expanding further to USD 2,812.67 million in 2026. Long-term forecasts indicate the market could reach USD 6,964.06 million by 2034, representing a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 12% between 2025 and 2034.

Blue hydrogen is produced using natural gas through steam methane reforming (SMR) or autothermal reforming (ATR) combined with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). This process significantly reduces greenhouse gas emissions compared to traditional “grey” hydrogen, making it a crucial transition fuel on the path to net-zero emissions. Governments and energy companies are increasingly investing in large-scale projects to deploy blue hydrogen at commercial levels, particularly in North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

Demand is being driven by multiple sectors: refineries, ammonia production, steelmaking, long-haul transport, and power generation. For example, global hydrogen demand is expected to exceed 200 million tons annually by 2030, with blue hydrogen positioned to meet a significant portion of that demand due to its cost competitiveness and lower carbon intensity compared to green hydrogen.

Regional insights show that the United States, Canada, Germany, the UK, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are among the frontrunners in developing blue hydrogen infrastructure. Investments from energy giants such as Shell, BP, and Equinor highlight the strategic importance of blue hydrogen in decarbonizing heavy industry and transport.

As the global energy landscape evolves, the blue hydrogen market in 2025 stands at a pivotal stage, offering a scalable and cost-effective solution while paving the way for the long-term adoption of green hydrogen.

What is Blue Hydrogen Companies?

Blue Hydrogen companies are organizations engaged in the production, distribution, and commercialization of hydrogen generated from natural gas, coupled with carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) technologies. Unlike “grey” hydrogen, which emits large amounts of CO₂, blue hydrogen captures up to 90% of the carbon emissions produced during manufacturing, making it a lower-carbon alternative and a vital bridge to a net-zero economy.

In 2025, the global blue hydrogen market is projected to reach USD 2,511.31 million, growing steadily toward USD 6,964.06 million by 2034 at a CAGR of 12%. Blue hydrogen companies form the backbone of this growth, with major players such as Shell, BP, Equinor, and Air Products leading investments in large-scale projects. For instance, Shell’s blue hydrogen facility in the Netherlands is expected to produce 60,000 kg/day of hydrogen by 2025, supporting industrial decarbonization.

The role of these companies extends beyond production. Many are developing value chains that integrate hydrogen transport, storage, and end-use applications in refineries, power plants, and mobility sectors. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that hydrogen could meet 10% of global energy demand by 2050, and blue hydrogen companies are expected to supply a substantial portion of this demand over the next decade.

Geographically, companies in the USA, Canada, Germany, UK, Japan, and Saudi Arabia are investing billions in infrastructure. The U.S. Department of Energy alone has allocated over USD 8 billion for regional clean hydrogen hubs, many of which prioritize blue hydrogen.

USA Growing Blue Hydrogen Market

The United States has rapidly emerged as one of the leading markets for blue hydrogen, driven by strong policy support, abundant natural gas reserves, and accelerated investments in carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) infrastructure. In 2025, the U.S. blue hydrogen industry is projected to contribute nearly 30% of global revenues, equivalent to USD 753 million, out of the USD 2,511.31 million global market. This growth is reinforced by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022, which provides tax credits of up to USD 3 per kilogram of low-carbon hydrogen, making blue hydrogen financially competitive against both grey and green alternatives.

The Department of Energy’s Hydrogen Shot initiative aims to reduce the cost of clean hydrogen to USD 1 per kilogram by 2031, and blue hydrogen is a critical pathway toward achieving this goal. Large-scale projects in Texas, Louisiana, and California are being developed by companies like Shell, ExxonMobil, and Air Products, with planned production capacities exceeding 1 million tons annually by 2030. For example, Air Products’ Louisiana Blue Hydrogen Plant, valued at USD 4.5 billion, is one of the largest such projects in the world, expected to capture over 5 million tons of CO₂ per year.

Beyond industrial production, the U.S. is integrating blue hydrogen into heavy transport, refineries, and power generation. Hydrogen fueling infrastructure is expanding, with California alone expected to host over 200 hydrogen stations by 2027, many sourcing supply from blue hydrogen.

With robust federal funding, private sector leadership, and natural gas availability, the U.S. blue hydrogen market is positioned for sustained double-digit growth, establishing itself as a global hub in the clean hydrogen economy.

A recent analysis from EnergySage shows how changes in the federal budget could reshape the way many Americans go solar, and leasing might now be the smarter play for some households.

The update comes as the U.S. prepares for the expiration of many Inflation Reduction Act tax credits in 2025, shifting the financial landscape for both purchased and leased rooftop systems.

While outright ownership has traditionally been the go-to, Emily Walker, director of insights at EnergySage, explains that third-party ownership options such as leases and power purchase agreements may become more popular.

If you lease your solar panels instead of buying them, the company that owns the system can still get the 30% tax credit for a couple of more years. That means leased solar projects have until mid-2026 to start or until the end of 2027 to be finished.

""That extra time is consequential for installers,"" Walker said. ""It allows them to continue developing residential projects with the tax credit, even as the credit for purchased systems disappears. For some homeowners, that will make TPO [third-party ownership] the most accessible entry point into solar.""

Going solar remains one of the best ways to cut utility bills and slash the pollution fueling Earth's overheating.

EnergySage makes it simple with free tools to compare quotes and get estimates, helping homeowners see what works best for their budget.

Solar panels don't just clean up the grid. They also put money back into people's pockets over time. With EnergySage's marketplace, the average homeowner can save up to $10,000 on solar installations. Its mapping tool also breaks down the average cost of systems and available incentives by state, so you know exactly what savings might be on the table where you live.

Pairing solar with efficient home appliances such as heat pumps can drive utility bills even lower. EnergySage even has a free comparison tool for heat pumps, making it easier to find the right option and installer for your home.

EnergySage emphasizes that while the policy changes may complicate the math for owned systems, TPO options will still allow families to tap into clean energy.

Whether you buy or lease, going solar sooner rather than later could mean significant savings for your household and a healthier planet.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/solar-leasingimage-rectYAfove5uLJ1pt-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-29 06:58:08.321890

The five active stations are in Berea, Grayson, Hazard, Richmond, and Sparta. All of the awarded stations are expected to open in 2026. They represent an investment of $31.6 million in obligated NEVI federal formula funds.

“Accessible fast-charging stations across the Commonwealth will make a real difference for Kentuckians and visitors alike,” said KYTC Secretary Jim Gray. “We look forward to having nearly 50 NEVI funded fast charging stations up and running in the Commonwealth next year. Kentucky is leading the charge on the EV front.”

Kentucky is a leader in automotive production and is the EV battery production capital of the United States, helping create thousands of high-quality jobs for Kentuckians. Kentucky touts $13.5 billion in EV-related investments in the state with the creation of nearly 10,200 full-time jobs statewide.

The 46 awarded sites are along the state’s interstates and parkways. Each station must have at least four charging ports of 150 kilowatts or more, be accessible to the public 24 hours a day/seven days a week, and work with most EV models.

KYTC does not develop, own, operate or maintain the charging stations. Each developer must fund at least 20% of the construction and operational costs and is required to maintain and operate the charging station for at least five years.

Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 2 percent, though Biden carried it by 4 percent in his 2020 victory.
In order to stand out among so many candidates, O’Rourke said she will emphasize affordability and her personal story.
After graduating from Cornell, O’Rourke worked as a Senior Environmental Advisor for the United States Agency for International Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 2013.
While at Cornell, O’Rourke said she and her family utilized the Women, Infants, and Children program, Medicaid and the Headstart program.","In her own words, Cornell alumna and ecologist Megan O’Rourke, Ph.D. ’09 is running for Congress because she “has a backbone.”

A Blairstown, New Jersey native, O’Rourke is emphasizing her working-class background in an effort to contrast her personal story with other candidates in the race. She’s also made affordability and opposition to Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill a centerpiece of her campaign.

O’Rourke has joined a primary field in New Jersey’s 7th district so crowded with competitors that national Republicans have called it a “clown car.”

The district, expected to be one of the most competitive of the 2026 midterms, is currently held by a Republican, Tom Kean Jr., but votes regularly for both parties. Donald Trump won the district in 2024 by 2 percent, though Biden carried it by 4 percent in his 2020 victory.

Candidates for the Democratic primary include fighter pilot Rebecca Bennett, Biden Small Business Administration official Michael Roth and magazine executive Brian Varela, among others.

In order to stand out among so many candidates, O’Rourke said she will emphasize affordability and her personal story.

“Growing up poor, issues with food security were troubles in our family. We often relied on our church's food pantry,” O’Rourke said. Her family’s struggles, along with her love for nature, compelled O’Rourke to pursue an “intersection of environment and food” in her career.

After graduating from Cornell, O’Rourke worked as a Senior Environmental Advisor for the United States Agency for International Development in Phnom Penh, Cambodia, before joining the Virginia Tech faculty in 2013.

Eventually, she decided to work for the federal government once again, this time as a program leader for climate in the Department of Agriculture, where she managed grants on sustainability that the department awarded to universities.

In July, she resigned from her position in protest of the Trump administration’s decisions to cut many of the same grants she had worked on only a year before. Since then, she has been running for Congress full-time.

O’Rourke said her decision to run this August was in part because she believed “there was some weakness” in the field, and that the candidates already in the race didn’t have the “strength” it took to defeat incumbent congressman Kean.

“People don’t have to doubt whether or not I have sacrificed,” O’Rourke said, referring to her decision to leave the Trump administration. “People don’t have to doubt whether or not I have the backbone.”

O’Rourke has lived in Blairstown, New Jersey, since she was born, moving only for college. She attended SUNY Stony Brook University before getting her master’s at Iowa State University and her doctorate in Agricultural Ecology from Cornell in 2009.

Attending graduate school at Cornell while raising a family made O’Rourke “stand out,” she says, especially on a graduate student’s stipend, which she estimated was around $25k.

While at Cornell, O’Rourke said she and her family utilized the Women, Infants, and Children program, Medicaid and the Headstart program. She also started a community garden in Slaterville Springs, where she lived, to make some extra money.

“It was really hard, but we buckled down, because from a young age — for whatever reason — I wanted to do a Ph.D.,” O’Rourke said.

Though O’Rourke’s platform centers around affordability, during an interview with The Sun, she did not outline any specific priorities or policy proposals to combat the cost-of-living crisis that a majority of New Jersey voters say is their top issue. A review of her campaign website found that O’Rourke does not specify any policies to address affordability.

O’Rourke was also noncommittal on her stances regarding accepting corporate PAC money, whether she would vote for Democratic leader Hakeem Jeffries, sending aid to Ukraine and Taiwan or a position on the Israel-Gaza war.

“We need to look at the conflicts as they come, because [between] right now and 2026, they are going to be completely different,” O’Rourke said. “I’m not going to be pinned down on every controversial vote, but the principles I will bring to the table are that we need to be proactive, we need to take a multilateral approach.”

However, O’Rourke did emphasize a few issues she would take a side on. She expressed support for a Congressional stock trading ban, the reversal of the 2010 Citizens United decision — that led to the rise of large political action committees’ influence in politics — and maintaining a state-and-local tax deduction.

Turning to her Alma Mater, she gave a message to Cornell students.

“My district, New Jersey’s 7th, may not be your home, but you can still pay attention to it, contribute to it,” O’Rourke said. “Don’t be apathetic in this current political situation. You can make a difference.”

By Michele N. Siekerka, NJBIA President and CEO On Sep 29, 2025

A new state law, which NJBIA helped push to the legislative finish line, is making the largest investment in manufacturing in this state’s history.

Manufacturers are the engine that drives New Jersey’s economy – a $58 billion industry that produces everything from pharmaceuticals and chemicals to food products and the advanced technologies that support supply chains and catalyze innovation.

“Made in NJ Manufacturing Day” on Oct. 3, presented by NJBIA’s partners at the New Jersey Manufacturing Extension Program (NJMEP), will showcase these fantastic companies and their products at the largest gathering of its kind in the state. Hundreds of manufacturers, business leaders, students, and elected officials – including the two candidates running in the Nov. 4 election to be New Jersey’s next governor – will be there.

Look for our manufacturers to have an extra spring in their step about their Jersey-made products because a new state law is now making the largest investment in manufacturing in this state’s history. The “Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program,” which NJBIA was proud to help push across the legislative finish line, provides $500 million in tax incentives to spur investments, create jobs, and position our state as a national manufacturing leader.

The tax credits will attract global investment in a wide range of manufacturing activities, including advanced manufacturing, food and beverage production, life sciences, and clean energy component manufacturing, which includes nuclear, solar, geothermal, and green hydrogen. Amid the economic uncertainty caused by federal tariffs and supply challenges, this economic boost couldn’t have come at a better time for New Jersey.

Beyond incentivizing manufacturing investments, the program will also boost workforce development efforts to fill thousands of new positions from the machine operators and assemblers on the factory floors to the engineers and scientists whose cutting-edge research drives innovation in pharmaceuticals, chemicals, and other advanced materials.

The NJEDA’s website has the details about the program, but here are the basics: tax credits for companies that make, acquire or lease investments of $10 million or more at a New Jersey manufacturing facility and successfully create at least 20 new full-time jobs that pay at least 120% of the median salary of manufacturing workers in that county.

Importantly, funding for the program comes from the New Jersey Economic Development Authority’s existing Aspire and Emerge tax credit programs. No new money is involved.

The Next New Jersey Manufacturing Program is the one bright spot for the industry in a FY26 state budget that unfortunately zeroed out the Manufacturing Voucher Program geared toward smaller manufacturers and cut funding for NJMEP in half. Nevertheless, the new tax credits, coupled with the pro-manufacturing tax changes made on the federal level, make this an exciting opportunity to grow manufacturing businesses in New Jersey.

No, not the fear of water, but lab work centered on better battery science.

Hydrophobicity — when materials naturally repel water — has been one of the obstacles to implementing promising, safe, and low-cost water-based batteries that could be more widely used for grid storage and powering electric vehicles, according to the university's news release.

The key components of these batteries are common and not flammable, making them an attractive alternative to the lithium-ion batteries that use expensive and combustible parts. But how to solve the hydrophobicity issue …

The Tohoku researchers have developed an electrode material that works well with a water-based electrolyte, eliminating the problem. They say their new organic redox polymer could also help enable recycling, another long-standing hurdle for batteries of this type.

""By combining high charge storage capacity with recyclability, we can open new directions for sustainable battery research,"" associate professor Kouki Oka said in the release.

Their solution involved combining some components with the right attributes.

P-dihydroxybenzene is an organic molecule that has high charge storage capacity. Through a condensation reaction, the team ""introduced"" the molecule into a polyamine, ""which is water-soluble due to its positive charge,"" according to the release.

The combo tackles the hydrophobicity issue. It can also be broken back down into its component parts in water. A rendering provided with the release shows a circular process, from battery production through use and recycling.

""This study provides a design strategy for making hydrophobic redox molecules compatible with aqueous systems,"" Oka said.

Experts in Korea, at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and elsewhere are also developing innovative water-based batteries.

It's important to note that common lithium-ion packs are generally high-performing, safe, and reliable. Gas-powered cars are more likely to catch fire than EVs powered by the existing battery type, according to reports. Recurrent has also reported that Goldman Sachs said battery prices could fall 50% by next year, compared to 2023 prices, due to cheaper chemistries, better performance, and more recycling.

Through August, global 2025 EV sales grew 25% compared to the prior year, though that 12.5 million total includes plug-in hybrids, according to Ars Technica. Sales are growing more slowly in the United States as federal policy changes have nixed up to $7,500 in tax breaks for the cleaner rides beginning Oct. 1. But certain states are continuing to offer their own perks. And EV owners continue to enjoy about $1,500 a year in gas and maintenance savings.

What's more, less-expensive EV options are on the way. Ford is retiring two popular gas-guzzlers in favor of a $30,000 electric pickup set to debut in the coming years, for example.

Each EV that replaces a gas-powered car prevents thousands of pounds of heat-trapping air pollution, per government data. And the tailpipe exhaust is among the gases linked by the National Aeronautics and Space Administration to greater risks for the extreme weather that's compromising human health and safety as well as impacting insurance coverage and pricing.

Continuing to improve and diversify EV batteries and grid storage through water-based innovations should only strengthen the global clean energy transition.

The biggest push has come from Premier Danielle Smith's government, which put a short-term moratorium on renewable energy projects in 2023 before introducing new rules on where they can go.
The restrictions only apply to renewable energy projects.
While residents aren't keen on new turbines, Oliver said, they're on board with an improved status quo.
Noel wrote in a recent report that about 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy projects were cancelled in 2024.","In Pincher Creek, Alta., wind is king, roaring down the eastern Rockies, delivering power for generations, so much so the municipal district made a windmill part of its corporate logo.

Not anymore.

District Reeve Rick Lemire said the windmill image, which sits alongside other Alberta icons on the logo — a wild rose, wheat, a pumpjack and cattle will soon be erased.

""It's not us anymore,"" Lemire said in an interview.

There are few places where the wind blows as hard and as often as it does in Pincher Creek, Alta., where clusters of windmills tower over farmland, with mountains in the distance.

But in a few short years, new rules and changing attitudes have delivered a sharp pivot away from wind projects.

The biggest push has come from Premier Danielle Smith's government, which put a short-term moratorium on renewable energy projects in 2023 before introducing new rules on where they can go.

Regulations forbid renewable energy developments within a 35-kilometre buffer zone from the Rocky Mountains, which applies to Pincher Creek, mainly on the grounds of preserving jaw-dropping Prairie viewscapes. The restrictions only apply to renewable energy projects.

Rohit Sandhu, spokesperson for Alberta's department of affordability and utilities, said exemptions are available for wind projects currently in the buffer zone and the Alberta Utilities Commission can approve new projects on a case-by-case basis.

The commission declined to comment on the matter.

The district has more than 255 turbines producing nearly 511 megawatts of energy, says a third-party report commissioned last year by the town and district.

The issue is also about money.

Lemire said stopping renewable development means lost revenue down the line if companies can't repower their wind farms once existing ones reach the end of their life.

About 30 per cent of the district's budget relies on revenues from renewable electricity generation, says analysis by the Pembina Institute think tank, and landowners also collect a percentage of revenue generated by each turbine.

Despite the potential profit lost, Lemire said he believes residents are willing to take the hit.

""We're starting to slide,"" he said of the district's renewable energy revenues. ""We're coming down — we understand that. Administration knows that.""

Lemire said residents soured on wind projects years before the moratorium took effect, because they found new transmission lines connecting turbines to the grid to be unsightly.

But he said if the aging turbines are allowed to be replaced by fewer yet more efficient models, everyone wins.

Wayne Oliver, an intergeneration supervisor at TransAlta Corp. and a town councillor in Pincher Creek, agreed. Repowered wind farms, he said, would also likely have fewer turbines that produce the same amount of electricity and continue to provide revenues to the district.

While residents aren't keen on new turbines, Oliver said, they're on board with an improved status quo.

""The people that live around that Castle River wind farm with 60 turbines, when they hear that six or seven turbines can replace that, they get excited,"" he said.

A spokesperson for TransAlta said it's continuously assessing the future of existing facilities but couldn't comment on specific sites.

Regulations 'popped a bubble'

Oliver, a resident of Pincher Creek for over 30 years, said he finds it remarkable how quickly times have changed in a few years.

""It popped a bubble,"" Oliver said of the renewable moratorium. ""It just shows you the power of government policy to change the direction of society.""

Will Noel, a senior analyst at the Pembina Institute, said what the industry needs is certainty. Noel wrote in a recent report that about 11,000 megawatts of renewable energy projects were cancelled in 2024.

Forrest also advocates for the energy transition and has committed his business to achieving ‘real zero’ in a swipe at net zero targets, which he says include “scams” such as carbon credits or carbon offsetting.

Instead, the business aims to eliminate all of its emissions and help build the technologies needed to reach ‘real zero’ worldwide.

Indeed, solar PV, wind and green hydrogen have all been noted as critical technologies in the business’ real zero strategy.

Solar partnership to power mining operations

LONGi will serve as Fortescue’s strategic technology partner, supplying the latest-generation PV products for the company’s iron ore operations in the Pilbara region of Western Australia.

The partnership focuses on leveraging LONGi’s expertise in lowering the levelised cost of energy (LCOE) to ensure the projects remain competitive.

Under the agreement, LONGi will supply solar PV modules and participate in joint venture projects to develop integrated green energy solutions across multiple markets.

The artificial intelligence boom is reshaping global energy demands in profound ways, with data centers at the epicenter of this transformation. As companies race to deploy advanced AI models, the electricity required to power these operations is skyrocketing. According to a recent report from the International Energy Agency, AI could drive a surge in electricity demand from data centers, potentially doubling or tripling current levels by 2030. This isn’t just a minor uptick; it’s a fundamental shift that challenges existing power infrastructures worldwide.

In the United States alone, projections indicate that data centers could consume up to 8% of the nation’s electricity by the end of the decade, up from about 2.5% today. Industry insiders point to the voracious appetite of AI training and inference processes, which require immense computational power. For instance, training a single large language model can consume as much electricity as thousands of households over several months, highlighting the scale of the issue.

Nuclear and Renewable Energy as Potential Solutions

To meet this burgeoning demand, tech giants are exploring unconventional energy sources. Small modular nuclear reactors are gaining traction as a reliable, low-carbon option, with companies like Microsoft partnering with nuclear firms to revive plants and secure dedicated power supplies. A commentary from the IEA notes that while renewables like solar and wind offer promise, their intermittency poses challenges for the always-on needs of data centers.

Grid constraints are exacerbating the problem, particularly in high-demand regions like Northern Virginia, home to a cluster of data centers. Utilities are struggling to keep pace, leading to delays in new connections and rising costs. Posts on X from industry figures, such as investors highlighting AI’s power bottlenecks, underscore a growing consensus that energy scarcity could become the next big hurdle after chip shortages.

Global Implications and Economic Pressures

Internationally, the energy crunch is even more acute. In China, rapid data center expansion is outpacing power generation, prompting massive investments in new capacity. Meanwhile, in Europe, stringent environmental regulations are clashing with AI ambitions, forcing a reevaluation of energy policies. The Dallas News recently detailed how data centers’ insatiable power needs might lead to shortages, with experts warning that there simply may not be enough electricity to go around without significant infrastructure upgrades.

Economic ramifications are already evident. Electricity prices in key U.S. markets have risen by over 30% in the past three years, driven partly by AI-related demand. Bloomberg’s analysis in a recent article suggests creating a market for compute resources, akin to oil futures, to better allocate energy and spur investment.

Innovative Strategies and Future Outlook

Forward-thinking solutions are emerging, including on-site power generation and advanced cooling technologies to reduce consumption. For example, some firms are turning to geothermal and hydroelectric sources for sustainable alternatives, as outlined in reports from RCR Wireless News. Yet, challenges persist, with heatwaves and AI growth pushing global gas demand higher, according to the World Economic Forum.

Looking ahead, the integration of AI into energy management itself could provide relief. Smart grids powered by AI algorithms might optimize distribution and predict demand spikes, transforming the sector. However, without coordinated policy efforts and massive capital inflows—estimated at trillions of dollars—the AI revolution risks stalling amid energy constraints. Industry leaders must navigate this delicate balance to ensure technological progress doesn’t come at the expense of reliable power supplies.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-f4cf9881-0604-416c-9ec1-968ab184d4c2.jpeg,N,,2025-09-28 23:58:45.476449

The EPA is doing everything it can to revitalize the coal sector in the United States

During his first term, Donald Trump stated that he would “drill baby, drill”. At the time, what he meant by that was a mystery. However, once he began his second term, the meaning behind that statement became clearer. Trump wants to revitalize the coal sector, particularly in the United States. His administration, led by his EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, has now stated that they will roll back the coal-ash rules implemented by the Obama administration.

In 2015, the Obama administration finalized long-sought federal rules for disposing of coal ash, which is a byproduct of incineration at coal-fired power plants. That rule aimed to prevent contamination of groundwater and surface water by establishing technical guidelines for power plants’ coal ash disposal. During his first term, the Trump administration did little to enforce those rules, and now plans to remove the regulatory barriers that the rule imposes.

Utility companies were ordered to report coal ash contamination in groundwater to the EPA by February 2026. As well as install groundwater monitoring systems by May 2028. They were also required to begin drafting remediation plans if contamination was found.

The EPA has shifted its stance to allow for more state involvement

On July 19, the Trump-led EPA announced it would extend the deadline for utility companies to address the rules by at least one more year. The EPA stated that it aims to put more power in the different states’ hands, as opposed to keeping the rules tightly wound up by the federal government. Which has not gone down well with environmentalists.

“Trump tried and failed to bail out the coal industry during his first term in office. Given the realities of the market, whatever he tries to do this time should fail as well.… Instead of trying to prop up the fuels of the last century, this administration should be working to build the grid needed for the 21st century.” – Christy Walsh, a senior attorney at the Natural Resources Defense Council

A court has intervened in the Duke coal-ash cleanup, which only strengthens the stance being championed by the current administration. The EPA released a statement on the matter.

“Due to the receipt of adverse comment, the EPA is withdrawing the direct final rule titled “Hazardous and Solid Waste Management System: Disposal of Coal Combustion Residuals From Electric Utilities; CCR Management Unit Deadline Extension Rule,” which published on July 22, 2025 (90 FR 34358).” – United States Environmental Protection Agency

Today, energy policy is investment policy, and Indonesia risks being left behind.

Clean energy is no longer just about meeting climate targets. For many companies, it has become a make-or-break factor when deciding where to expand, build and invest.

Companies in sectors like manufacturing, textiles, food processing and technology have set ambitious decarbonization goals, many targeting net-zero emissions before 2050. To meet their goals, they need to power their operations with clean energy. In practice, that means locating in countries where renewable power is available, affordable and accessible through the central grid or via clear purchasing pathways.

Indonesia has taken important steps to expand its renewable energy supply, with 76 percent of new capacity additions within the Rencana Usaha Penyediaan Tenaga Listrik 2025 (RUPTL 2025), or Indonesia’s Electricity Supply Business Plan, coming from renewables.

Nonetheless, corporate buyers are seeking a more diversified menu of procurement options. Unbundled Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) are currently the most viable option for corporate procurement in Indonesia. But while useful, RECs do not support the large-scale, long-term investments businesses are planning. Companies are looking for structural solutions to source renewables locally, such as Corporate Power Purchase Agreements (CPPAs) and the joint utilization of transmission and distribution networks, known globally as power wheeling.

A recent paper by Climate Group’s RE100 campaign, Institute for Essential Services Reform (IESR) and the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) explained how shared use of Indonesia’s transmission and distribution network would allow different stakeholders to deliver electricity from generation sources to load centers. These mechanisms would allow companies to contract clean electricity directly and at scale from renewables-rich areas to business hubs, through state electricity company PLN’s grid.

Other countries in the region are already moving faster – with both Vietnam and Malaysia introducing schemes that allow third parties to supply or buy electricity through the existing grid network. Thailand has enabled eligible customers to purchase both energy and RECs from large renewable energy projects by rolling out the second phase of its Utility Green Tariff (UGT2). These policies give companies flexible and transparent pathways to scale their clean energy use, and they are attracting investment.

Indonesia risks falling behind. While Vietnam sourced over 14 percent of its electricity from solar in 2023, Indonesia’s share of solar and wind remains below 3 percent. An estimated Rp 278 trillion (US$16.64) in annual investment is needed if its targets for added renewable capacity are to be met.

The priority therefore is delivering on this plan. With the country’s sovereign wealth fund Danantara launched earlier this year, Indonesia has a timely opportunity to turn capital, policy alignment and partnerships into renewable energy projects. Fossil fuels still account for a significant share of Indonesia’s capacity, and policymakers have sent mixed signals on coal drawdown. While recent geothermal announcements are promising, Indonesia will need a decisive push to match its renewable commitments with bankable projects that draw the investment that is required.

Other Indonesian business leaders share this sense of urgency. Some 88 percent said they want most of the country’s energy supply sourced from renewables within the next ten years. A majority said they would consider relocating operations and contracting supply chains to other countries if Indonesia cannot deliver adequate renewable supplies.

This should set off alarm bells. Sectors like textiles and light manufacturing are already major employers in Indonesia, and many of these companies are under pressure from their customers to clean up supply chains. Global tech firms looking to build data centers are clear in their message: renewable energy access is a key part of site selection.

There is an economic prize waiting for those moving faster on renewable energy. Research shows that meeting clean energy targets will create jobs, boost wages and improve resilience to global fuel price shocks, as shown in ACEC’s May 2025 publication Asia’s Clean Energy Breakthrough. Renewables also reduce dependence on volatile fossil fuel markets, providing more stable pricing for both industry and consumers.

All of this is especially relevant for Indonesia, which has set a target of eight percent annual gross domestic product growth by 2029. Unlocking clean energy investment can be a key enabler of that growth as it’ll attract capital, lower energy costs, improve energy security and fulfill a government promise to create 19 million jobs.

Indonesia still has time to lead the charge on the regional energy transition, but the window is closing. If the country can move quickly, it will be well positioned to compete with its neighbors on energy, and in every sector of the economy that depends on it.

The companies are ready. The demand is real. It is now time for policy to catch up.

As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.","The concrete seawall that runs along the edge of Lake Pontchartrain, stretching from the Industrial Canal to West End, is a favorite spot for joggers, cyclists, fishermen and families.

Gonzales resident Connie Thompson, who grew up in Gentilly, said she had always been curious about the seawall’s history. Thompson asked about the seawall’s construction and history, along with the scope of the wall: “I always wonder why the seawall was built around Lake Pontchartrain only on the New Orleans side? The year it was built? Was it to put people to work?”

The northshore has a similar, although smaller, seawall. The Mandeville concrete seawall was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project. The story of the New Orleans seawall is a bit of a deeper dive.

Kristi Trail, executive director of Pontchartrain Conservancy, reached back into the early days of European settlers and south Louisiana’s alluvial flood plain to begin to describe the seawall’s importance.

A growing city looks outward

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the city began expanding, looking for ways to grow outward, Trail said. Back then, what is now the Lakeview, Gentilly and City Park neighborhoods were all swamps. By the late 1800s, the Lakefront was in constant use for commerce and recreation. Fishing camps were set up with elevated walkways and structures, but had to maneuver around Lake Pontchartrain’s tidal pattern. The Port Pontchartrain lighthouse, which still stands today, was floating out on the water, unconnected to land, Trail said.

Mechanical engineer Albert Baldwin Wood, whose impact on New Orleans drainage cannot be overstated, opened up new possibilities with his screw pump invention, patent filed in 1913. The screw pump could pump massive amounts of water, allowing for quick drainage of swampland — although this mass draining would eventually cause subsidence issues.

In the 1920s, the Orleans Levee Board began a huge project of reclaiming land from the lake. The lakefront development used clam shells from the lake to mix with sediment dredged from the lake bottom for this new land. In 1930, the Orleans Levee Board started what would be about a 21/2-year project to build an 8-foot-high concrete seawall, according to the Lakefront Management Authority. The seawall was set into place to halt shoreline erosion and offer flood protection for the newly created area.

“The mud they are pumping in from the lake to fill in all that area, from Allen Toussaint to the seawall, it’s just mud, and it’s so soft to build on,” Trail said. “So this is when the clamshell dredging began in the lake.”

Those clams were taken out of the lake to mix in with those soft soils in the neighborhoods, Trail said. “Those neighborhoods are all built on reclaimed land, as a result of the sea wall going in, which allowed those neighborhoods to be built,” she said.

Dredging lake environment

The project indirectly led to Trail’s current job — large-scale clam dredging led to massive environmental lake degradation. In the wake of this degradation, environmental advocacy groups popped up to defend the lake, one of which became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Since clamshell dredging was banned in 1990, the lake has started to bounce back. As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.

“It’s solid concrete installation techniques. …I would bet it’s probably sunk a pretty good bit over time, but I don’t have the data on that,” Trail said. “We’re out there every day, we see it. It’s still there. It’s still doing its job.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/theadvocate.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/c/86/c86fa899-225e-5e0d-9a9b-e62df2d7fc3d/68d5c14feb11b.image.jpg?crop=1763%2C926%2C0%2C124&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-29 00:59:33.549273

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote.","HARRISBURG, Pa., Sept. 28, 2025 (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone (a financial company separate from from BlackRock) has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

Buyers procrastinating the purchase of an electric vehicle are running our of time.

The deadline for a federal tax credit expires on Tuesday.

“As part of the mega-tax bill signed into law in July, the expiration date of the federal clean vehicle tax credit was pushed up to Sept. 30 from its original expiration date of 2032,” according to the Detroit Free Press. “That means the deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying new EV, and up to $4,000 on a used EV, is closing in.”

Cars.com released data on Sept. 18 showing that nearly half of consumers considering buying an EV are now accelerating their purchases.

“EV sales just hit a new record in the U.S.: This month, they’re on track to make up 12.2% of new car sales, according to J.D. Power and Associates,” reports Fast Company. “Meanwhile, gas car sales dropped compared to the same month last year.”

The electric vehicle tax credit was created by President George W. Bush, who initiated a tax credit program for fuel-efficient vehicles in 2005 and expanded it in 2008 to include plug-in vehicles with the goals of reducing U.S. dependence on foreign oil and lowering emissions.

As of late, the incentives have created some anxiety for dealers, who report that the IRS has been slow to pay for the tax credits since mid-September.

“The delays began in earnest in mid-September, according to accounts shared with CNBC from three dealers in different parts of the country,” according to CNBC. “Auto analysts and two national trade associations also confirmed to CNBC dealership reports of delays. The dealerships say it forces them into a tough choice: carry the cost to keep offering the credit, or pull back and risk losing vehicle sales.”

Some analysts expect EV sales to fall off significantly for the rest of the year.

“Karl Brauer, executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, said once the federal tax credit ends, EV sales are ‘going to crater. It’s going to be quite the whipsaw effect. You’ve got the rush to the dealership to take advantage of these incentives now ... but what’s going to happen in the next three to six months? There’ll be almost no buyers.’” according to the Detroit Free Press.

Brauer said EVs comprise about 8% of the total U.S. new vehicle market share, he expects that to drop to 1% to 3% by year's end and settle in at 4% of total market share by early next year.

But not all analysts agree.

“In a recent survey with Morning Consult, analysts at Cox Automotive found that 65% of respondents who were in the market for a new EV said they would still consider an EV without the tax credit,” according to Fast Company. “Even though the end of the incentive has spurred sales, the tax credit generally hasn’t been the deciding factor for most buyers, says Loren McDonald, who runs an EV data and analysis firm called Chargeonomics.”",https://s3.amazonaws.com/media.mediapost.com/dam/cropped/2025/09/28/ev-charger_ipDJ3BJ.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 19:00:35.414802

A shared comprehensive understanding of the landscape needs to be integrated into the green economy transition.","India stands at a crossroads requiring a leap beyond traditional growth models to adopt a greener, more resilient economic future. India’s bioeconomy grew dramatically from $10 billion in 2014 to $165.7 billion in 2024, expanding 16 times over the 10 years and accounting for 4.25% of the country’s GDP. This growth has been bolstered by over 10,000 bio-economy start-ups.

The industrial bioeconomy — comprising biofuels and bioplastics — accounts for the largest share at approximately 47%, followed by pharmaceuticals at 35%, with emerging areas such as research and IT (including clinical trials and bioinformatics) also expanding rapidly. India has also achieved major milestones, with the government ensuring 20% ethanol blending in petrol and the country being the world’s third-largest pharmaceutical producer by volume.

According to the India Bioeconomy Report, the bioeconomy is expected to create 35 million jobs by 2030. The growth in consumer spending in rural India is surpassing that of urban areas, with 9.2% rural per capita spending growth vs 8.3% urban (August 2023 to July 2024), suggesting improving rural purchasing capacity and evolving consumption patterns. Hence, the green economy is no longer distant, utopian, or abstract, but inevitable, imminent, and an undercurrent under way. Given India’s climate vulnerabilities and global market shifts — such as carbon border taxes and rising demand for sustainable goods — the transition is a necessity for sustained jobs, environmental returns, competitiveness, and social wellbeing. As it expands, there is a need for recognition that rural communities vulnerable due to poverty and climate risks are no longer just beneficiaries but climate frontline leaders.

Disruptions and disparity

India’s green economy is under pressure from international economic headwinds, but remains a priority for energy security, job creation, and long-term competitiveness. Although the global economy is expected to slow down at 2.5%, India’s GDP is expected to grow at 5.9%. Climate disruptions also directly impact inflation, further worsening the rural bioeconomy context, especially pressures from losses in agriculture, fluctuations in energy demand, and disrupted supply chains. There is a huge hidden disparity that also needs attention. The BioE3 policy was rolled out in 2024 to promote the bioeconomy, but regulatory frameworks remain fragmented, and it remains a very urban-centric, industrial-scale economy.

Maharashtra, Karnataka, Telangana, Gujarat, and Andhra Pradesh contribute more than two-thirds of the total bioeconomy value, while the eastern and northeastern regions together account for less than 6%. Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh, which are rich in agriculture, forest biomass, mineral-rich and non-timber forest products, have a huge potential for tribal-led bioeconomy models. In Uttar Pradesh, which is the largest sugarcane producer, opportunities in ethanol, biofuels, and biomass power are emerging in the State. Bihar, Odisha, Jharkhand, and West Bengal have had a low industrial bioeconomy footprint probably due to discouraged investment by the Freight Equalisation Policy, but they are abundant in agri-waste and forest produce, which needs to be tapped.

Despite a projected addition of 35 million green jobs by 2047, women held only 11% of jobs in India’s rooftop solar sector, even as renewable capacity surged 250% between 2015 and 2021. Women’s representation in key roles remains particularly low: 1% in operations and maintenance, and 3% in construction and commissioning. There is a green economic rural-urban divide where the urban areas attract green investments, EV infrastructure, solar rooftops, and green jobs, whereas the rural regions lack access to clean energy, water-saving irrigation, and sustainable livelihoods, with slower, inequitable technology adoption. A huge digital divide furthers the disparity as tech-driven solutions such as smart grids and measurement, reporting, and verification for carbon markets are not inclusive of landscapes and communities with low digital access. Even in the waste management sector, urban areas account for nearly 75% of the country’s total solid waste, due to higher consumption, packaging, and commercial activity, whereas rural waste is now consuming more, seeing penetration of plastics, e-waste, and so on, along with biowaste, but is unsegregated and often burnt or dumped. With 500 million tonnes of crop residues, 3,500-plus medicinal plant species, largely sourced from forest-fringe rural areas, 7,50,000-plus rural haats and agri-mandis, MGNREGA-supported green infrastructure, the rural is still under-represented in the bioeconomy boom.

Green economy trade-offs

As India strives to balance economic growth, social equity and environmental returns, there are many green economy trade-offs. One of the biggest trade-offs is promoting renewable energy, but also subsidising fossil fuels to up to potentially 40%. Also, while promoting renewable energy solutions such as solar pumps, do we check the promotion of groundwater extraction? Massive industrial expansion in hard-to-decarbonise sectors such as steel, cement, power, and utilities — which together account for 23.2% of India’s GHG emissions —puts significant pressure on the upfront investment in green technologies, with unit costs exceeding those of traditional options by more than four times(10). As much as 85% of global clean energy investment flows to advanced economies, while India and other developing markets receive only 15%.

A rapid green shift — if not carefully managed — can disproportionately affect rural areas, vulnerable groups such as coal sector workers, MSMEs, and small-scale manufacturers reliant on traditional energy. With agriculture supporting 58% of rural livelihoods, seasonal as well as climate variations often impact income stability and over-dependence on public system or markets.

A woman from Belkhedi, Madhya Pradesh, painfully shares how markets do offer economic opportunities, especially during festivals such as Holi, but exploit or even at times disturb local resources by introducing synthetic materials into their ecosystem. A just transition demands targeted skill-building for workforce readiness, reskilling programs, and local bioeconomic diversification to avoid adverse social and environmental impacts.

Road transport dominates the nation’s freight and passenger movement, and food miles now account for nearly 3 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent annually, which is a trade-off between emissions and food security. For instance, Bijapur and Sukma in Chhattisgarh still get food transported from more than 400 km away and have one of the highest percentages of malnourished children under five years of age.

Biodiversity underpins India’s economic sectors such as agriculture, forestry, fisheries, and tourism, directly supporting over 200 million livelihoods and contributing resources worth billions annually. There are competing agendas of crop diversification versus an ecosystem of policy and market incentives, almost like working for the promotion of monocropping, especially for wheat and paddy. India’s aggressive push for ethanol blending has brought the maize trade-off between ethanol and animal feed. There is a need to adopt a deep dive into sector-wise localised approach that takes into consideration the cross-overs of benefits as well as losses between different strategies, conflicting policies, multi-stakeholder collaboration, and a focus on both local realities and global opportunities.

Landscape approach to green economy

What is required is a commitment to a growth model that puts sustainability, climate action, and social inclusion at the heart of development, with measures to address these regional disparities, integration in less-developed, high-potential states, and the need for the creation of robust green economy ecosystems. To navigate through these trade-offs, disruptions, disparities and the pressure on achieving green growth, an assessment of landscapes is crucial. Landscapes are to be viewed as an integrated, interconnected and interactive system of many parameters such as landforms, land cover, water resources, flora-fauna, energy systems, local markets, local institutions and communities together. A shared comprehensive understanding of the landscape needs to be integrated into the green economy transition. This method allows us to assess and improve ecological functions — such as air and water quality, habitat support, and climate regulation— while also boosting human benefits such as health, food and water security, recreation, and livelihoods. These efforts help us stay within the ecological ceiling, ensuring landscapes can continue to regenerate. A defining feature could be the shift to truly participatory pathways of landscape assessment right from nano (village level) to macro (landscape level).

First, leveraging the 2.5 lakh Panchayati Raj Institutions (PRIs), 12 million women-led institutions, and 0 million local authorities at every stage, from design to monitoring of this transition. Promotion of circularity, green energy and bioeconomy, with gender mainstreaming through targeted policies for leadership and technical roles for women, inclusive governance, stakeholder collaboration, and investments in green infrastructure and nature-based solutions generate multiple returns over time.

For instance, a woman from Kulgaon village in Chhattisgarh aspires to start an enterprise of cold-pressed oil extraction from Tori seeds for supplying to her village for better health, better availability of raw materials, promoting local production and local consumption. A supportive ecosystem for such aspirations can be co-created with shift in the metrics from not just decreased poverty and job creation, but also to improved social and environmental returns. Landscape-driven planning, ownership and clarity, integrating ecosystem valuation into policy and economic strategies, will help in setting the right direction and course. Many low-hanging fruits can be targeted with pivots such as green budgeting, clearer enforcement roles, targeted fiscal incentives, green government procurement, deeper involvement of gram panchayats, local authorities and CBOs, prioritising skills, gender inclusion, and local capacity building in greening all sectors.

Addressing the bottlenecks, such as improved waste management at all levels with SOPs for enforcement, financing cum O&M ecosystem for decentralised renewables, policy coordination between departments for responding to aspirations of communities, and greening the R&D spend, will also ensure a push for many sectors with bio-economy potential. With such models, India can not only achieve its climate and sustainable development goals but also unlock new engines of growth, resilience, and wellbeing for its landscapes and all its citizens.",https://th-i.thgim.com/public/incoming/9uahbn/article70106598.ece/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1200/IMG_Govt-tightens-n_G1LE_2_1_64EN9606.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 17:59:46.852102

The criticism followed a recent study that gave the local utility a ""C"" grade, which is a major jump from the company's 2021 ""F"" score.

The Sierra Club, America's largest grassroots environmental organization, released on Monday, September 22, its annual Dirty Truth report, which evaluates and scores utilities for their plans to transition to clean energy. The Dirty Truth report focuses on three metrics to gauge impacts on affordability and public health due to fossil fuel pollution: Utility efforts to retire coal plants by 2030; not build new gas plants through 2035; and build clean energy to replace fossil generation and serve new load by 2035.

CPS Energy's ranking

According to the report, CPS Energy scored a ""C"" due to the company making some investments in additional solar and battery storage and its closure of one coal unit. However, the Sierra Club noted the company is doubling down on gas as part of its current and future portfolio. Over the years, the Dirty Truth has given CPS Energy the following grades: ""C"" in 2025, 2024 and 2023; ""D"" in 2022 and ""F"" in 2021.

Public Citizen, an American non-profit, progressive consumer rights advocacy group, reviewed the Dirty Truth report and demanded that CPS Energy ""make better plans and additional investments in clean energy rather than continuing its reliance on fossil fuels to meet increasing customer demand.""

""CPS Energy should prioritize its customers' pocketbooks at a time when so many San Antonians are enduring an affordability crisis,"" DeeDee Belmares, who is based in San Antonio as a clean energy advocate for the Texas office of Public Citizen, stated in a release. ""Embracing wind, solar and battery storage can offer the savings and reliability residents need. The old way of doing things - burning gas and coal - delivers higher costs and dirty air.""

Belmares commended CPS Energy for approving a plan in 2023 to phase out and shut down a coal plant by 2028. But, Belmares added, the company took a step backward after it acquired four power plant facilities in Southeast Texas. CPS Energy acquired Missouri-based PROENERGY natural gas plants in Harris, Brazoria and Galveston counties.

All four facilities are in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas network. Together, the plants provide an electric capacity of approximately 1,632 megawatts, which can power approximately 325,000 to 408,000 average homes per year, depending on the time of day and energy use.

CPS Energy responds to the report

CPS Energy told MySA the company remains ""committed to delivering reliable, affordable energy that keeps pace with San Antonio's growth, while investing in resources that reduce emissions and strengthen long-term sustainability.""

""As we phase out coal, we continue to expand wind and solar resources and add more energy storage to our portfolio,"" CPS Energy stated. ""Natural gas remains an essential part of our generation mix as it is cost-effective, produces fewer carbon emissions than coal, and helps us transition away from older and less efficient units while maintaining reliability and affordability for our customers. Our upcoming generation plan refresh will take into account how our community can continue to benefit from a diverse and sustainable energy portfolio.""

Texas utilities deliver mixed results

Other Texas utilities were scored in the Dirt Truth report. The Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) got another ""F,"" the lowest score of all utilities in Texas. LCRA has received an ""F"" score for years due to the company keeping the Fayette coal plant open east of Austin, near La Grange, and planning for zero investment in affordable renewables, according to the Sierra Club. LCRA sells its power wholesale to 29 cities and four rural electric cooperatives across Texas.

Xcel Texas has maintained its ""B"" grade, largely due to ""forward-looking plans to retire the expensive, dirty, and water-guzzling Tolk coal plant in the Panhandle as the Ogallala Aquifer continues to dwindle,"" the Sierra Club stated.

For this year, all the utilities studied scored 15/100, earning an ""F,"" worsening their overall score by 3 points since the organization's first report in 2021. The Sierra Club studied 50 parent companies that own the most fossil fuel generation, comprised of 75 operating companies, which collectively own half of all remaining coal and gas generation in the U.S.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/15f58_lG9fZ9blGjalhHhw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/mysa_hearst_708/ee54783045eb4ea04855b6004a84e083,N,,2025-09-28 23:58:48.244108

Starting Sept. 30, drivers of electric and alternative fuel vehicles will no longer be allowed to drive alone in HOV lanes or drive toll-free in the express lanes on Interstate 85 in Gwinnett County.

The exemption for these vehicles expires at 11:59 p.m. Sept. 29, meaning these drivers must pay tolls in the express lanes unless they have two or more people in the car.

“You pay extra for the EV decal on the vehicle, so you kind of want some sort of benefit to it,” Seyat Nuriyeva, a Tesla driver affected by the change, said.

“Now that they’re taking it away, it’s kind of like, well, what’s the point in paying extra for the plate now?” she said.

These express lanes on I-85 through Gwinnett County were once HOV lanes. However, since becoming toll lanes, the state allowed drivers of electric and alternative fuel cars to use them free of charge.

The state tollway authority reports that nearly 40,000 trips are made daily on I-85’s express lanes, and nearly 17,000 on the express lane extension, with roughly 20% of those trips being toll-exempt.

The change is likely to put more electric and alternative fuel vehicles in the main travel lanes, potentially causing greater congestion.

Startup NatPower reported that it is investing more than $1.1 billion into a giant 32-acre battery energy storage facility near Middlesbrough that will store renewable energy for later use, allowing more clean power to supplement the grid.

The Teesside Gigapark will be located at the energy and utility service Sembcorp Utilities' site. It will be the largest and longest-duration storage facility of its kind once completed in 2028, Interesting Engineering and NatPower reported.

""The Teesside Gigapark is more than a storage project. It combines large-scale batteries with industrial electrification … setting a new standard for the U.K. energy sector,"" IE's Sujita Sinha wrote.

NatPower touts the privately funded project as a money-saving grid support that could conserve $4.1 billion in efficiencies annually by saving typically wasted renewable energy. It will use lithium-ion batteries that can store electricity for four hours, per IE.

Holding the cleaner power is crucial for using it during peak demand times, such as early evening hours when the sun goes down, but power use remains high. NatPower plans for the Teesside facility to eventually be able to provide electricity over an impressive eight hours, IE's report added.

Battery storage is being developed in the United States, too. In Texas, Tesla Megapacks are key grid contributors. A nearly 5,000-acre solar panel/battery storage facility is operational near Las Vegas.

It's a concept that can be realized at home, as well. Rooftop solar panels combined with batteries can generate and store free solar energy that can reduce or eliminate your utility bill. EnergySage is a free resource that can help you secure tax incentives while they last, compare quotes, and find a timely professional installer. It's advice that can save you up to $10,000 if you buy the panels before rebates expire at the end of the year due to federal policy changes.

The cleaner energy, at homes and at larger facilities, also limits planet-warming pollution produced when dirty fuels are burned to generate power. Air pollution impacts nearly everyone on the planet, according to the World Health Organization. And Earth's overheating is even hurting academic performance, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At Teesside, NatPower officials have some interesting plans for the battery project. Around 200 construction jobs will be created. Looking forward, officials intend to work with colleges and environmental groups on training programs for future clean-energy jobs. A focus of the project will be powering ships at a nearby port, allowing the vessels to turn off dirty diesel engines, all according to IE.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/tYpVk4nl0kLnJ9EZ_XvLvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02ODM7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/b2819a6d614aa2d36f8e4b9e95dc7438,N,,2025-09-28 17:59:52.180475

Leaders discussed how renewable energy and electrification will serve as the foundation for prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness in the years ahead.
For households and communities, the shift to renewable energy will mean lower electricity bills, greater energy independence, and new job opportunities.","A diverse group of government leaders, private sector executives, financiers, and civil society representatives came together in New York for the High-Level Session on Renewable Energy Abundance, one of the flagship events of Climate Week NYC and the official opening of the Global Renewables Summit. The session was held at a pivotal moment in the global energy transition, just days ahead of the UN Climate Summit, where countries are expected to present their updated national climate action plans (NDCs).

The gathering highlighted the collective commitment of governments and industry to accelerate the development of zero-emissions infrastructure, which will reshape economies and societies worldwide. Participants stressed that renewable energy technologies are no longer a distant vision but are already reducing costs for businesses and communities while creating opportunities for innovation, competitiveness, and long-term resilience.

Key leaders who addressed the event included Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; William Ruto, President of Kenya; Philip Davis, Prime Minister of the Bahamas; Chris Bowen, Australia’s Minister for Climate Change and Energy; Andrew Forrest, Founder and Executive Chairman of Fortescue; Bruce Douglas, CEO and Founder of the Global Renewables Alliance; and Mike Rann, Chair of the Board of Climate Group.

Ursula von der Leyen noted that 2024 saw nearly two trillion dollars invested in clean energy, with spending on renewables now outpacing fossil fuels by a factor of two to one. She underlined that while the economic case for renewables is strong, momentum alone is insufficient, and decisive action is required. She called on governments to create enabling regulatory environments and on businesses and investors to commit their capital, innovation, and technology to areas where the impact would be greatest. According to her, renewable energy is not only about climate mitigation but also about energy security and economic prosperity.

Prime Minister Philip Davis of the Bahamas emphasised the need to frame renewable energy as a driver of prosperity rather than sacrifice. He argued that the narrative around clean energy should highlight opportunities, not constraints, and stressed that every solar panel installed, every regulation reformed, and every upgraded grid contributes to a more abundant and secure energy future. He urged global leaders to focus on progress over perfection, noting that collaboration strengthens the chances of success.

The session also explored how the global economy is shifting from an era of energy scarcity to one defined by abundance. Leaders discussed how renewable energy and electrification will serve as the foundation for prosperity, productivity, and competitiveness in the years ahead. They agreed that a clean energy system can simultaneously deliver affordability, security, and sustainability, creating widespread economic and social benefits.

Francesco La Camera, Director-General of the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), noted that investments in renewables have grown steadily by 14 percent annually since 2018 despite global challenges such as pandemics and inflation. However, he pointed out that emerging markets and developing economies still receive less than 10 percent of energy transition financing, despite accounting for a third of global GDP. He urged global leaders to place equity and inclusivity at the core of the transition as the world moves toward the target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030, as agreed under the UAE Consensus.

Bruce Douglas, CEO of the Global Renewables Alliance, reinforced that phasing out fossil fuels while building renewable energy abundance is the only path to long-term prosperity, stability, and security. He urged immediate collective action to accelerate this transformation. Similarly, Ambassador André Corrêa do Lago, President-Designate of COP30, highlighted the growing integration of renewables with broader agendas such as energy justice, independence, and affordability, stressing how simpler technologies and scalable infrastructure can drive economic growth.

For households and communities, the shift to renewable energy will mean lower electricity bills, greater energy independence, and new job opportunities. For industries, it offers a platform to power innovation in areas such as advanced manufacturing and artificial intelligence, supported by abundant clean energy resources. The High-Level Session, jointly organised by Climate Group, Fortescue, and the Global Renewables Alliance, reinforced the message that renewable energy abundance is not just an environmental goal but a central driver of economic transformation and global prosperity.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GRS-high-level-opening-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 22:58:27.368912

The Department of Energy still has an Office of Fusion Energy Science, but the Chinese equivalent is out-spending it at a ratio of 2:1.
The Chinese government has made fusion power a national priority and last month launched the state-owned China Fusion Energy Co (CFEC) with $US2.1 billion in capital.
So he's hardly likely to back fusion energy to replace coal and oil and help stop global warming.
If China beats the US to fusion energy, its supremacy will be assured.","Late last week, US President Donald Trump used separate social media posts to announce several new tariffs, described later as the ""bonfire of the bathroom vanities.""

That's because there's a new 50 per cent tariff on imports of kitchen and bathroom cabinets, plus 100 per cent on pharmaceuticals, 30 per cent on upholstered furniture, and 25 per cent on heavy trucks.

In truth, it's the bonfire of the 80-year-old global trading and financial system and America's leadership of it, along with global economics, technology and science.

A monumental deal

On the same day as Trump took aim at America's foot with those new tariffs, something else happened that was potentially much more momentous for global geopolitics: the Italian energy giant, Eni, agreed to buy $1 billion worth of electricity generated from nuclear fusion by the US company Commonwealth Fusions Systems (CFS).

Eni — not an American power company — will take electricity from the Commonwealth's Virginia-based ""Arc"" facility, which is due to start construction in 2027 or 2028 and deliver grid electricity in the early 2030s.

This is the first commercial fusion-power deal and marks the beginning of what will be the next great energy transition.

Fusion happens when two atomic nuclei, usually the hydrogen isotope deuterium, join together and form a heavier element, releasing a lot more energy than the current form of nuclear power, fission, which involves breaking atoms apart.

Like fission power generation, fusion is free of greenhouse gas emissions, but unlike fission, it's completely safe, creates little waste, and the fuel is much more plentiful than uranium.

Deuterium is found in water, and there is enough of it in the world's oceans to power the world for millions of years.

And fusion energy looks to be another way in which America is yielding global supremacy to China.

Loading

CFS was spun out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology's Plasma Science and Fusion Center in 2018, which was set up in 1976 with funding from the US Department of Energy.

It's been a 50-year scientific journey so far. By comparison, it took 16 years to get from the discovery of nuclear fission to the first nuclear power plant (in the USSR). Fusion is much harder to do than fission.

Trump's 2026 budget slashes funding for science and universities, and while no specific cutbacks have been announced for MIT's fusion and plasma research, it is clearly at risk, along with all basic scientific research in the US.

The Department of Energy still has an Office of Fusion Energy Science, but the Chinese equivalent is out-spending it at a ratio of 2:1.

The Chinese government has made fusion power a national priority and last month launched the state-owned China Fusion Energy Co (CFEC) with $US2.1 billion in capital.

There is now a race between China's CFEC and America's CFS to generate fusion electricity, and both are talking about 2027 as the year they enter the final lap. But with the Trump administration cutting back science funding and China increasing it, you'd be brave to back America in this race.

Meanwhile, in a speech to the United Nations earlier last week, Trump doubled down on his opposition to renewable energy, calling climate change the ""greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion"", and added that he had signed executive orders to hunt for oil because ""we have the most of any nation in the world"".

""And if you add coal, we have the most of any nation in the world,"" he said.

""I call it clean, beautiful coal.""

So he's hardly likely to back fusion energy to replace coal and oil and help stop global warming.

Elsewhere in that speech, he said that everyone thought Russia would win the war in Ukraine in three days, ""but it didn't work out that way"".

That's true, and one reason for that is drones, which have now become the key weapon of war and evened up the battlefield between the bullied and the bully.

From ANZUS to AUKUS

In World War I, coal-powered trains were the key to military success, getting troops and supplies to the front. In World War II, it was oil-powered tanks and planes. Now it's cheap, electric battery-powered drones.

In June, the French Institute for International Relations published a paper that said: ""… the Russian invasion of Ukraine has become the theatre of a massive drone-driven transformation of military operations. This phenomenon is unprecedented, both in quantitative terms — with several million drones now produced and destroyed each year —and in its influence on the dynamics of operations and the structure of forces.""

American supremacy in the second half of the 20th century rested on having built global leadership in three things that it did while World War II was still going: harnessing nuclear fission with the Manhattan Project in 1942, making an alliance and oil deal with Saudi Arabia in 1943, and hosting the Bretton Woods conference in New Hampshire in 1944 that established the post-war financial system with the US dollar and free trade at its centre.

So, when Australian prime minister Sir Robert Menzies retired in 1966, he said, justifiably: ""If I were asked which was the best single step that had been taken in the time of my government, I think I would say the ANZUS Treaty.""

But now ANZUS, signed in 1951 and entrenched and expanded by AUKUS in 2021 (if the Americans don't bail), is the proverbial old generals fighting the last war — the submarines it is supposed to provide will be useless against drones, including underwater ones.

More broadly, for the next few years at least, the US is an autocracy that is unreliable and unfocused, in what might be called the set-up phase.

At least Trump's authoritarianism is out in the open; China's is cloaked in fine-sounding rhetoric, but it is mature and very focused.

China's weak climate target

Chinese President Xi Jinping also addressed the UN last week, saying: ""This year marks the 80th anniversary of the victory of the World Anti-Fascist War and the founding of the United Nations. Eighty years later, while the historical trends of peace, development, cooperation and mutual benefit remain unchanged, the Cold War mentality, hegemonism and protectionism continue to haunt the world.""

He announced China's emissions reduction targets for 2035, contrasting his approach with Trump by talking about how China is at the forefront of the energy transition, that it would increase solar, wind and hydropower to run more than 30 per cent of its power system over the next decade and said in China, ""new energy vehicles are the mainstream in the sales of new vehicles"".

But then he came out with about the world's weakest 2035 target (apart from America's non-existent one, of course): 7 to 10 per cent down from the peak, whatever that was.

Experts were baffled and unhappy, but I suspect it's simply because China is more focused on electrifying its economy than reducing carbon emissions, so it's building every type of generation, as fast as possible, including both coal and fusion.

That's because it's not just warfare that is becoming electrified through drones, but the new technology that is revolutionising civilian life: artificial intelligence.

On Friday, the chief executive of Walmart, Doug McMillon, said: ""It's very clear that AI is going to change literally every job.""

The military industrial complex on which American power has been based is morphing into the ""electro tech stack"".

China is driving hard to supplant the US in this new military industrial complex, and has already achieved leadership in electric vehicles, batteries, drones, renewable energy and is working on semiconductors and AI.

Someday, nuclear reactors the size of shipping containers could power your hometown, but a huge number of regulatory hurdles will have to be cleared before nuclear power starts popping up in your backyard – and public buy-in will be critical.

After decades of relatively little change in nuclear power technology, there is currently a flurry of nuclear energy innovation taking place around the world. Scientists are looking into how to make nuclear power production more efficient, cost-effective, safe, and streamlined in response to an ever-growing need for reliable and carbon-free energy production. Like renewable energies, nuclear power is carbon-free, but unlike solar and wind power, the production potential of nuclear power is steady and constant, making it an attractive option for energy security in the decarbonization era.

Some of the potential new nuclear technologies garnering investor attention are small reactors and microreactors. In recent years nuclear energy development has been trending toward much smaller models in the interest of lowering up-front development costs and making new nuclear projects more easily deployable.

Most of the excitement and investment has been geared toward small modular reactors (SMRs), which many advocates believe could be the backbone of a nuclear renaissance in the United States and other countries that have begun to move away from nuclear power production. These modular models can be mass-produced in a factory setting and installed on-site alone or in clusters to create utility-scale nuclear power plants more quickly and cheaply than traditional large-scale models.

Microreactors, which have so far received less attention and funding support than SMRs, are much smaller. While a full-scale nuclear power plant would produce, on average, upward of 700 megawatts, and an individual SMR would produce about 300 megawatts, a microreactor’s output would be around 10 megawatts.

While microreactors are much smaller, they could be used to power entire towns for a relatively low up-front cost, and they have unique selling points compared to SMRs and traditional nuclear power plants. They’re safer than larger models, and they’re so small that they could be brought in on a truck or barge, hugely easing the installation process. Plus, microreactors do not require any on-site workers for their operation and maintenance, and can be operated remotely and autonomously.

“Microreactors have the ability to provide clean energy and have passive safety features, which decrease the risk of radioactive releases,” Euro News reported earlier this year. “They are also much cheaper than bigger plants as they are factory-built and then installed where they are needed in modules.”

All of these benefits mean that microreactors could be enormously useful in a wide range of contexts. A recent article in The Conversation touts their utility, saying that “this technology could benefit college campuses, remote communities in Alaska primarily powered by oil and diesel, tech companies looking for reliable electricity for AI data centers, companies in need of high-temperature heat for manufacturing and industrial processes, mining operations that need a clean energy source and even military bases in search of a secure source of energy.”

The problem is that while the microreactors themselves would be relatively low-cost, building the facilities to construct these microreactors would be a massive and expensive undertaking. And so far no one has been willing to take that risk. Investors want guaranteed orders before they build such a factory, and potential buyers want to see the technology built, tested, and proven before they place an order. “It’s a catch-22,” says The Conversation’s Aditi Verma.

There’s another considerable downside to widespread deployment of microreactors and small modular reactors – surprisingly large amounts of nuclear waste. A Stanford study found that “most small modular reactor designs will actually increase the volume of nuclear waste in need of management and disposal, by factors of 2 to 30,” said lead author Lindsay Krall. “These findings stand in sharp contrast to the cost and waste reduction benefits that advocates have claimed for advanced nuclear technologies.”

Community buy-in is essential to get microreactors off the ground, but those communities need to seriously consider the cost of managing all that nuclear waste. The many benefits of microreactors may still be worth it, but nuclear waste is a major cost to taxpayers that should not be overlooked.

Despite Tesla's EV struggles, the strength of its competitors indicates that the overall EV marketplace has remained relatively strong. Further, consumers now have more EV choices than ever before, with options ranging from sporty coupes to powerful pickups and everything in between.

In addition to producing less planet-heating pollution per mile than gas-powered vehicles, EVs can save owners thousands of dollars per year in fuel costs, according to the Department of Energy.

To take the environmental benefits and cost savings of driving an EV even further, you can pair an electric vehicle with a home solar system. Charging an EV from home solar is cheaper than doing so from the electrical grid or at a public charging station, plus you get the added benefit of knowing that your vehicle is powered by cleaner, renewable energy from the sun.

EnergySage makes it easy to find the home solar option that is right for you with free online tools that allow you to compare quotes from pre-screened local installers and easily identify available rebates and other incentives in your area, saving customers up to $10,000.

However, with federal tax credits on electric vehicles set to end Sept. 30, 2025, and tax credits for home solar sunsetting Dec. 31, the time to act is now if you want to take advantage of thousands of dollars in potential savings.

By Aidan Hughes for Inside Climate News

The energy and natural resource sector has spent hundreds of millions of dollars lobbying the federal government so far this year, according to data compiled by the nonprofit OpenSecrets.

That spending comes amid a wave of policy wins for fossil fuel interests—and significant setbacks for environmental and green energy groups.

Nearly $240 million poured in during the first and second quarters of 2025, with about 2,200 lobbyists representing the sector—nearly half of whom are former government employees themselves. That spending puts the sector slightly ahead of last year’s pace, when its yearly total reached $435 million.

This year’s expenditures make energy and natural resources the fifth-largest lobbying sector that OpenSecrets tracked over this period—ahead of transportation, defense and labor.

Electric utilities represented the largest share of those expenditures, totaling nearly $75 million.

That’s more than half of what it spent in all of 2024 combined—the industry’s biggest year in over a decade.

And with about $71 million already spent on lobbying this year, the oil and gas industry continues to significantly outpace the renewable industry’s lobbying expenditures of roughly $40 million.

The totals for oil and gas so far this year put the industry slightly below the pace of last year’s expenditures, which totaled over $150 million—its highest since 2009.

However, watchdog organizations say the industry’s steady funding is actually the result of its existing influence within the federal government.

“When you’ve got a White House that has made clear that they’re going to do whatever you want, you don’t have to spend as much money to get results,” said Tyson Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program. “They had to spend more when you had bipartisan, shared control over government, and you didn’t have a rubber stamp in the Oval Office. Now they do.”

Since President Donald Trump took office, his administration and Republicans in Congress have pushed through a slew of regulatory and legislative measures fulfilling the priorities of fossil fuel interests, often at the expense of renewables.

The party’s signature legislation, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, has been criticized as a handout to the fossil fuel industry that increases lease sales for drilling and mandates that millions of acres of federal lands be made available for mining.

Mike Sommers, president of the American Petroleum Institute, told CNBC at the time that the bill “includes almost all of our priorities.”

The administration has also granted Clean Air Act exemptions to dozens of fossil fuel-burning power plants, delaying their need to reduce emissions of mercury and other air toxins.

And the EPA’s announcement that it intends to rescind its “endangerment finding” for greenhouse gases would remove the basis for its ability to regulate emissions from motor vehicles, power plants and oil and gas operations.

These moves have come amid a reversal of government support for renewable energy projects. The One Big Beautiful Bill Act included a phaseout of tax credits for wind and solar that critics say runs counter to the administration’s goal of achieving “energy dominance.”

Wind energy, in particular, has been singled out as a target by the administration. Trump issued a presidential memorandum on his first day in office halting approvals, permits, leases and loans for both offshore and onshore wind projects. The administration later took the unusual step of issuing stop-work orders for some offshore wind projects that were already under construction.

Multiple watchdog organizations told Inside Climate News that the real source of the fossil fuel industry’s current influence stems in part from industry insiders who have been strategically placed into key government positions. That list includes Energy Secretary Chris Wright, a former oil and gas executive, and a range of political appointees with ties to the industry within the EPA.

In an emailed statement, a White House spokesperson did not directly address concerns about administration officials’ ties to fossil fuel interests, but said that “President Trump has kept his Day One promise to unleash American energy, protecting our national security and lowering costs for families and businesses.”

According to Robert Maguire, vice president for research and data at Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, those ties have meant that the fossil fuel industry hasn’t had to increase spending on lobbying to secure key wins.

“This has been a hallmark of both [of] Trump’s terms, where essentially he fills his administration with lobbyists and industry officials who, in many cases, have no government experience,” Maguire said. “Their only qualifications for the jobs that he’s putting them in is the fact that they want to do the industry’s bidding within the government.”

A source within the oil and gas industry, however, downplayed the effect of the “revolving door” of industry insiders gaining positions within the government, and instead emphasized that Trump came into office with an already-friendly attitude toward oil and gas.

The source, who requested anonymity to speak freely on the topic, said that industry lobbyists have had conversations with people in government who are “more engaged or more willing to talk for any number of reasons,” saying that there is “expertise” within the current administration on matters tied to the oil and gas industry that didn’t exist during the Biden administration.

Although the source emphasized that the industry has still fought difficult policy battles this year, including over tax credits for clean hydrogen projects, they said that this expertise has meant that industry lobbyists haven’t needed to spend as much effort educating lawmakers or officials on key issues.

Utilities, meanwhile, continue to have a “massive” amount of influence in D.C., according to David Pomerantz, executive director of the watchdog Energy and Policy Institute.

But he noted that far fewer utility insiders have been appointed to positions within the federal government during Trump’s second term.

And unlike the oil and gas industry, the agendas of various utility companies are more complex, and sometimes reveal significant differences between what utilities want and what the Trump administration wants.

“Where the utilities are lobbying for policies or regulatory changes that will allow them to burn more coal and gas, they’re successful,” Pomerantz said.

“The EPA basically said, ‘If you want waivers so that you do not have to comply with pollution limits, all you have to do is send us an email.’”

Still, Pomerantz said that not all utility companies sought out those exemptions—and that some utilities have also lobbied unsuccessfully against some of the Trump administration’s anti-renewables policies.

“Even [with] their considerable political power notwithstanding, the utilities have tried … to prevent some of the worst attacks on wind and solar,” Pomerantz said, “and they’ve basically failed at every turn.”

Although the renewable energy industry continues to lag behind oil and gas, its spending so far of roughly $40 million puts it on pace to eclipse last year’s record of $63.7 million.

This year’s spikes are driven in part by massive increases from the renewable industry’s top spender—the American Clean Power Association (ACP).

ACP’s expenditures in the second quarter of 2025 alone, which reached $3.8 million, were nearly twice the amount the trade association spent in all of 2024 combined.

The $4.3 million it has spent so far this year places it ahead of any of the oil and gas industry’s trade associations. The American Petroleum Institute, by comparison, spent just under $4 million, while American Fuel & Petrochemical Manufacturers spent less than $3 million

But Slocum, director of Public Citizen’s Energy Program, suggested that ACP’s efforts have been unsuccessful.

“The American Clean Power Association sort of is on the outside looking in, and I’m not sure that any amount of money is going to be able to overcome this,” he said.

Slocum also said that the association had “badly misjudged their strategy” by assuming they could appeal to both Democrats and Republicans.

“They thought that they could build a bipartisan appeal for renewable energy, and you see that with a few senators like [Chuck] Grassley and [Lisa] Murkowski, but for the most part, you know, mainstream Republicans just do not want to challenge Trump publicly,” Slocum said.

In an emailed statement, ACP suggested that its efforts on Capitol Hill helped the renewable energy industry avert even worse outcomes—and defended the association’s attempts to build bridges with key Republican legislators.

“The ability to successfully remove the destructive excise tax [from the One Big Beautiful Bill Act] and secure a more reasonable phase out of clean energy tax credits required a sophisticated response to underscore the impact of these policies on consumers and the communities we represent,” said Jason Grumet, the CEO of ACP.

“Despite the highly polarized environment, a group of Republican senators came forward to support the core interests of the clean energy industry,” Grumet said. “Securing this support for provisions that the entire Republican caucus originally voted against is an important accomplishment.”",https://cdn.prod.dailykos.com/images/1442146/story_image/AP25140741660616.jpg?1749501029,N,,2025-09-28 15:01:58.636131

“When Democrats had one-party rule in Washington, you saw them appropriating tens of billions of dollars to go through their well-connected left-wing environmentalist NGO friends, former Biden and Obama officials, and Democratic donors,” Zeldin said on Newsmax’s “Sunday Report,” referring to nongovernmental organizations.

He added that President Donald Trump often talks about ending the Democrats’ Green New Deal “scam” and that the administration has been dismantling it all year long, saying it has been “abusing the wallets of Americans.”

Zeldin said voters made clear last November that they wanted a new direction, sending Trump back to the White House. He argued that the final years of the Biden administration were marked by regulatory decisions aimed at “suffocating out of existence entire sectors of our economy.”

Looking ahead, he said the Trump team is focused on unleashing U.S. energy dominance, lowering costs, and fostering innovation. “We need to make America the AI capital of the world,” he said. “We need to be able to better afford energy costs to ramp up energy production.”

The Trump administration last week announced it was canceling nearly $680 million in federal funding for 12 offshore wind projects, including the first terminal on the Pacific coast. California Gov. Gavin Newsom’s office criticized the cuts as an attack on clean energy and jobs.

Zeldin countered that private investors are eager to build new energy projects without taxpayer money, but offshore wind only survives with massive subsidies.

“We need to be massively ramping up baseload power in this country,” he said. “People and companies want to invest. They’re not asking for money to get them to build these projects. They’re looking for the government to just get out of the way.”

He added that offshore wind economics don’t add up.

“These projects would not exist without government subsidy,” Zeldin said. “On the one hand, we can massively, efficiently ramp up baseload power without having to subsidize it with federal dollars,” he said. “On the other hand, we could be pursuing these other energy sources, really lying to ourselves and the country as if it is a substitute for baseload power … The president is looking at the economics, and it’s a no-brainer for him.”

Zeldin also pointed to earlier federally backed projects that faltered, including California’s Ivanpah solar facility, which will close in 2026 after receiving more than $1.5 billion in federal loan guarantees during the Obama administration.

“You’re talking about a project into the billions, not millions,” he said. Farmers and landowners across the country, he added, don’t want to see vast amounts of land taken up by solar panels that wear out prematurely. “And then what? Now you have all of these solar panels just sitting around. You might have these wind projects just sitting around.”

He said the debate over renewables also ignores the cost of battery storage needed to back up intermittent sources like wind and solar.

“Those battery storage sites cost a whole lot of money, and they then catch on fire,” Zeldin said. “Local municipalities, fire departments, they’re not prepared for those massive fires … That should be part of the discussion as well. And unfortunately, it hasn’t been.”

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON (AP) — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

As of Monday, Weld County approved its own regulations on oil and gas, adding stricter regulations regarding pipeline placement.
That’s a scary world.” Also at the roundtable, Barron shared his desire to encourage the revival of nuclear energy in Weld County at the Colorado House of Representatives this fall, now that nuclear energy was deemed a clean energy source by Colorado lawmakers.
Jared Polis signed a bill into law reclassifying clean energy as energy with little to no carbon emissions.","U.S. Rep. Gabe Evans and other Colorado Republicans have set their sights on reducing environmental regulations in an effort to increase oil and gas production and revive nuclear power in Weld County.

Evans and State Reps. Carlos Barron and Scott Slaugh, who was recently appointed to District 64 after Ryan Armagost resigned, visited Aims Community College on Monday for a workforce roundtable. Evans’ message to the students and faculty who attended was clear: if we don’t improve our energy production, then Colorado will suffer.

Evans discussed China and its innovations in artificial intelligence and drone technology. For every 100,000 drones made in the U.S., China makes a million, he said. Evans praised AI for lessening workloads and promoting more “long-term strategic planning,” but the technology requires a lot of energy, he noted.

“Energy security is national security,” Evans said. “Energy security fuels our economy, which fuels our ability to manufacture and make things. That fuels our position as the global leader in a lot of these technologies and a lot of other technologies that require energy.”

Colorado remains the fourth-largest oil-producing state, accounting for 4% of the U.S. total crude oil output, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. Weld County is responsible for 80% of the state’s production.

In 2024, Colorado produced five times as much oil as it did 10 years earlier. Between 2024 and 2025, the total number of permits in effect in Weld County increased by 42%, resulting in the construction of 3,124 oil and gas wells within the county.

Evans believes the state needs to continue invest in oil and gas to better support the country’s energy security. At the roundtable, he blamed Colorado lawmakers for working against federal interests and implementing further regulations that support renewable energy while restricting oil and gas.

If the regulatory burden were reduced by consolidating the various regulatory forms required by the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act into a single regulation, Evans said, the permitting process could be sped up by several years. Evans said this would lead to a boost in the local economy, creating more jobs for people across the state as more oil and gas wells could be constructed.

“The problem that I’ve seen in the workforce, in both private and public, is people worrying about the stability of their job with respect to the decisions from the people above them,” said Thomas Hall, a student from Aims and a former intern at the Greeley Water Department. “It can be scary when there are doubts about whether or not their job will be funded this year. This is a trend that I’ve seen at every place that I’ve worked for.”

State lawmakers have cited environmental concerns such as air quality and safety as they’ve continued to push for regulations on the energy industry.

As of Monday, Weld County approved its own regulations on oil and gas, adding stricter regulations regarding pipeline placement. These regulations also emphasized the need for more in-depth emergency action plans to ensure that accidents are properly addressed and that the sites are safer for workers and residents, according to Weld County Oil and Gas Director Brett Cavanaugh.

Weld County Air Policy Analyst Annareli Morales said though more oil and gas wells would result in more air pollution, they would not necessarily be enough to cause problems with air quality. The effect of additional wells depends on how many more there are and where they are located, she said.

“Logically speaking, if you had more wells, you would have more emissions, even if they are cleaner,” Morales said. “But it’s the context of, relatively speaking, how much more is emitted with these additional permits compared to what vehicles emit during rush hour per day? Is it comparable? Is it less?”

According to a state report from October 2024, 60% of Colorado’s air pollution originates from the oil and gas industry, with 45% of that coming from Weld County alone.

Evans dismissed the concern, saying that 70% of the detected emissions in Weld County originate from outside Colorado, specifically Canada and China. Though Morales was hesitant to confirm this percentage, she did say more than half of ozone pollution is attributed to the base quality of the atmosphere as a whole.

“The latest data we have, which is very old, tells us that a significant amount of the total ozone is out of our local control,” Morales said. “There’s a very small portion that is human-caused. And then within that, there is an even smaller portion that the state actually has jurisdiction over to do something about.”

According to Morales, however, the current regulations in place, even if they are lessened to streamline the permitting process, would still be more stringent than those in other states. She backs Evans’ claim that unless Colorado reduces its regulations surrounding oil and gas, developers will go elsewhere, where they don’t have to deal with the regulatory burden.

“If we can’t build it here, China will happily build it for us, and we can lose our position of global leadership,” Evans said. “If we don’t do it, China’s going to do it, and if you think the world is a scary place now, wait until China’s the global leader on AI. That’s a scary world.”

Also at the roundtable, Barron shared his desire to encourage the revival of nuclear energy in Weld County at the Colorado House of Representatives this fall, now that nuclear energy was deemed a clean energy source by Colorado lawmakers. In March, Gov. Jared Polis signed a bill into law reclassifying clean energy as energy with little to no carbon emissions.

“It is the cleanest, safest, most reliable form of energy produced. Period,” said Weld County Commissioner Scott James, a proponent of “everything and anything energy related.”

“Now, granted, there is nuclear waste, but under the newer forms of reactors, they can take that spent fuel and get even more fuel out of it. The technology has so dramatically increased around nuclear power generation that the amount of radioactive material has dramatically decreased.”

Its this jump in technology surrounding nuclear energy over the past 40 years that Evans says will be critical to bringing nuclear power back to Colorado. In the effort to promote reusability, Barron suggested that Fort St. Vrain, an old nuclear plant in Platteville that was shut down in 1989, could be converted into a modular nuclear plant — a smaller-than-average plant with a reduced environmental footprint —and utilize the used fuel that is still stored there.

“It’s laughable that we are a growing economy that has a massive demand for electricity as we move from an agricultural to an industrial economy, as we transition from an industrial economy to a data economy,” James said. “We have to have that conversation about nuclear power. I think we’re foolish for not doing so.”

Despite the strong push for more oil and gas production and the revival of nuclear energy in the county, Evans did not want to give the impression that he’s against wind or solar energy. Barron, who works in the oil and gas industry, added that since oil drilling sites are often in remote locations, oil and gas companies often must use solar energy to power their equipment.

As the roundtable came to a close, Evans and his Republican colleagues reiterated their commitment to increasing jobs and ensuring Weld County remained a top energy producer in the state. Both he and Barron promised to continue pushing for further deregulation this year on both the state and federal levels.",https://www.greeleytribune.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/GRE-L-WREvans_a531e6.png?w=1024&h=528,N,,2025-09-28 15:01:06.867259

First, they undermine the development benefits sought by multilateral development bank projects.

This change is being prompted in part by the new U.S. administration and is also supported by developing country experts.

Yet, the reality remains that fossil fuel emissions, and specifically the climate change they induce, can severely undermine multilateral development bank projects and overall developing country growth prospects.

Most emissions, however, come from richer big economies, not poorer developing ones. Given the negative effects of these emissions, multilateral development banks need to push richer economies away from fossil fuels, even as they consider softening restrictions on lending for fossil fuel projects in poorer countries.

Last decade, multilateral development banks began restricting funding for fossil fuel projects due to concerns about emissions, but also under pressure from the U.S., European and other key stakeholders.

For example, the World Bank announced in 2017 it would largely stop funding gas drilling and extracting projects. Other multilateral development banks followed suit.

Many have noted the economic benefits being denied to poor countries by these restrictions, such as export revenues and power plants fueled by domestic gas reserves. Sub-Saharan Africa and South America have contributed little to historical global emissions — 2 percent and 3 percent, respectively, a trend projected to continue.

As the International Energy Agency consistently highlights in its climate scenarios, the emissions reduction needed to avoid dangerous levels of climate change must come, unsurprisingly, from the world’s biggest economies. This includes China, with 33 percent of carbon dioxide emissions in 2022, followed by the U.S. with 13 percent, the European Union taken as a block, Russia and then Japan. Together, these countries generate 60 percent of the global total. India is also a large emitter, but its level is driven more by a massive population than wealth.

These emissions, and specifically the climate change they drive, present two significant risks for multilateral development banks. First, they undermine the development benefits sought by multilateral development bank projects. Second, they create financial risks for these banks by potentially weakening the capacity of developing country borrowers to repay their loans.

The massive 2022 flooding in Pakistan illustrates the potentially devastating economic impact of climate change, as the country suffered over $30 billion in losses — nearly 10 percent of its GDP. This degree of devastation is not feasible to plan for or adapt to. It needs to be avoided.

Unfortunately, various factors stunt a proper appreciation of climate change’s potential destructive impact. First, there is the inability to see the future. Looking back or even to the present does not provide a full sense of the future potential destructive impact of climate change.

Second, climate change’s impact grows over time, producing more destruction in a more distant future. Its small impact on today’s stock market contrasts significantly with its potentially large-scale economic damage 15 to 20 years from now as climate change worsens.

That longer period is particularly relevant to multilateral development banks, whose projects often take years to mature, and whose corresponding loans extend beyond 15 years.

Third, this sense of uncertainty is being exploited by climate minimizers to play down the long-term perils of emissions relative to the shorter-term benefits of fossil fuel projects.

As a result, multilateral development banks are caught in a tricky dynamic: responding to pressures from key shareholders — notably the U.S. — to loosen restrictions on financing for fossil fuels while working to limit greenhouse gas emissions that negatively affect development.

Earlier this year, the World Bank’s president proposed an “all of the above” shift in approach, with more natural gas development projects, as well as nuclear power and other alternatives. Although this proposal was welcomed by some, the World Bank’s board in June deferred a decision on natural gas, even as it approved nuclear power.

The writing is on the wall as the U.S. pushes multilateral development banks to fund more fossil fuel projects. This debate will continue, including at the upcoming World Bank Annual Meetings next month.

In order to reduce the risks climate change poses for multilateral development banks, these organizations should launch an initiative to encourage the largest greenhouse gas violators to reduce their emissions.

Although these countries aren’t susceptible to influence by multilateral development bank lending policies, they are all leading shareholders and active on multilateral development bank boards. This involvement provides an avenue for multilateral development banks to engage with these countries.

The initiative for change could be built around analytic work, convenings and outreach regarding the negative development impact of wealthy country emissions. It could even be launched at October’s annual meetings.

""The Ivanpah plant was a financial boondoggle and environmental disaster,"" she said, via AP.","A multibillion-dollar solar plant is set to close down next year because it's supposedly not 'serving its purpose', which has left everyone saying the same thing.

An eye-watering $2.2 billion was reportedly spent on the Ivanpah Solar Power Facility, a solar thermal plant based in the Mojave Desert in California.

The plant, made up of three 459-foot towers and nearly 174,000 computer-controlled mirrors called heliostats, opened in 2014, but it will be switched off for good next year after failing to meet its energy targets despite hopes it was going to make America 'a world leader in solar energy'.

Next year's closure comes 13 years earlier than planned. The likes of Pacific Gas & Electric and NRG Energy Inc. were supposed to have contracts that lasted until 2039, Associated Press reported, but news broke back in January that they were ending their respective agreements early.

""PG&E determined that ending the agreements at this time will save customers money,"" the company said in a statement on its website at the time.

Meanwhile NRG dubbed the project 'successful' but that it unable to compete with rival photovoltaic solar technology.

Plans for the planet were approved back in 2010, and a year later, former President Barack Obama’s Department of Energy issued $1.6 billion in three federal loan guarantees.

With this in mind, Ivanpah Solar Electric Generating System's upcoming closure has left a lot of Americans saying the same thing: that the whole debacle was a waste of taxpayers' money and government funding.

""Both a waste of money and an environmental disaster that will take decades to clean up,"" somebody said on Twitter, as another fumed: ""Yet another left-wing taxpayer-funded boondoggle turns out to be a useless waste of money.""

A third added: ""Another total failure and waste of taxpayer dollars by Gavin Newsom. Guy fails at everything he does.""

As another person insisted that the solar power plant 'was always a boondoggle'.

Julia Dowell of environmental organization The Sierra Club echoed similar sentiments earlier this year.

""The Ivanpah plant was a financial boondoggle and environmental disaster,"" she said, via AP. ""Along with killing thousands of birds and tortoises, the project’s construction destroyed irreplaceable pristine desert habitat along with numerous rare plant species.

Dowell continued: ""While the Sierra Club strongly supports innovative clean energy solutions and recognizes the urgent need to transition away from fossil fuels, Ivanpah demonstrated that not all renewable technologies are created equal.""

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
Big players on both sides The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the US, where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.","HARRISBURG, Pennsylvania, Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence (AI) race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants, and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the work

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9 percent stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible October 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a date center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the US and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the US, and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10 percent returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the US, where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19 percent premium — to affect electric rates.",https://cdn4.premiumread.com/?url=https://www.manilatimes.net/theme_manilatimes/images/TMT_1920x1008.jpg&w=1920&q=100&f=webp&v=1,N,,2025-09-28 15:01:50.001446

Gonzales resident Connie Thompson, who grew up in Gentilly, said she had always been curious about the seawall’s history. Thompson asked about the seawall’s construction and history, along with the scope of the wall: “I always wonder why the seawall was built around Lake Pontchartrain only on the New Orleans side? The year it was built? Was it to put people to work?”

The northshore has a similar, although smaller, seawall. The Mandeville concrete seawall was built in the 1930s as a Works Progress Administration project. The story of the New Orleans seawall is a bit of a deeper dive.

Kristi Trail, executive director of Pontchartrain Conservancy, reached back into the early days of European settlers and south Louisiana’s alluvial flood plain to begin to describe the seawall’s importance.

A growing city looks outward

After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, the city began expanding, looking for ways to grow outward, Trail said. Back then, what is now the Lakeview, Gentilly and City Park neighborhoods were all swamps. By the late 1800s, the Lakefront was in constant use for commerce and recreation. Fishing camps were set up with elevated walkways and structures, but had to maneuver around Lake Pontchartrain’s tidal pattern. The Port Pontchartrain lighthouse, which still stands today, was floating out on the water, unconnected to land, Trail said.

Mechanical engineer Albert Baldwin Wood, whose impact on New Orleans drainage cannot be overstated, opened up new possibilities with his screw pump invention, patent filed in 1913. The screw pump could pump massive amounts of water, allowing for quick drainage of swampland — although this mass draining would eventually cause subsidence issues.

In the 1920s, the Orleans Levee Board began a huge project of reclaiming land from the lake. The lakefront development used clam shells from the lake to mix with sediment dredged from the lake bottom for this new land. In 1930, the Orleans Levee Board started what would be about a 2½-year project to build an 8-foot-high concrete seawall, according to the Lakefront Management Authority. The seawall was set into place to halt shoreline erosion and offer flood protection for the newly created area.

“The mud they are pumping in from the lake to fill in all that area, from Allen Toussaint to the seawall, it's just mud, and it's so soft to build on,” Trail said. “So this is when the clamshell dredging began in the lake.""

Those clams were taken out of the lake to mix in with those soft soils in the neighborhoods, Trail said. ""Those neighborhoods are all built on reclaimed land, as a result of the sea wall going in, which allowed those neighborhoods to be built,"" she said.

Dredging harmed lake environment

The project indirectly led to Trail’s current job — large-scale clam dredging led to massive environmental lake degradation. In the wake of this degradation, environmental advocacy groups popped up to defend the lake, one of which became the Pontchartrain Conservancy.

Since clamshell dredging was banned in 1990, the lake has started to bounce back. As for the Lake Pontchartrain Seawall, it remains in place, battered but still gamely holding up against the waves of the lake.

The company announced that it has secured $9 million in seed funding. Eclipse led this significant investment round.

The funding will significantly accelerate the deployment of Anode’s mobile battery energy storage system, or mBESS, technology. This will involve working closely with their initial customers and forging strong partnerships with strategic collaborators, allowing their innovative solutions to reach a broader market and address critical energy needs.

Anode’s mBESS technology, along with their comprehensive microgrid solutions, presents a distinctly superior alternative to traditional power rental services. These older services typically depend heavily on noisy, polluting generators and the logistical complexities of fuel delivery. Anode operates with a vertically integrated business model, meaning it manages every aspect of its offering. This includes developing purpose-built hardware specifically designed for their systems, crafting proprietary software that powers their operations, and providing AI-powered services that optimize performance and efficiency.

Through this integrated approach, Anode can deliver highly flexible and remarkably high-performance solutions. These solutions are tailored to meet the demands of some of the largest entities that frequently rely on temporary power, including essential utilities, rapidly expanding data center owners, general contractors overseeing large-scale projects, and operators of growing electric vehicle and autonomous vehicle fleets.

There has been a profound and ever-increasing demand for electricity, a trend largely fueled by the exponential growth of AI data centers, the widespread adoption of electric vehicles, and the ongoing expansion of industrial automation. This escalating demand is placing immense strain on an electrical grid that is already showing its age and struggling to keep up.

The pervasive effects of climate change are only magnifying the risks of significant business disruption for an economy that is becoming increasingly reliant on electrification. Historically, the temporary power industry has attempted to offer a stopgap solution through the use of traditional generators and mobile refueling services. But these analog solutions are deeply problematic; they are environmentally polluting, notoriously inefficient, and often prohibitively expensive, failing to meet modern demands for sustainable and cost-effective power.

Anode’s innovative technology and forward-thinking business model are together creating a completely new paradigm in the energy sector. They are introducing the concept of mobile batteries and on-demand energy delivery, transforming how temporary power is accessed and utilized.

By intelligently capitalizing on the continuously declining costs of battery technology and the rapid advancements in artificial intelligence, Anode is uniquely positioned to deliver energy at prices that are not only competitive with traditional grid electricity but also a mere fraction of the cost associated with older fossil-fuel-powered solutions. This makes their offering economically attractive and environmentally responsible.

The team at Anode is built for substantial scale and impactful growth. The company’s founding members bring together a rich and diverse range of expertise. Their backgrounds include extensive experience in the complex field of autonomous vehicle development, specialized knowledge in electric vehicle powertrain engineering, critical insights from battery manufacturing processes, and a solid understanding of renewable energy project finance.

KEY QUOTES:

“U.S. electricity consumption is growing 5 times faster than recent historical averages, and our electric grid is struggling to keep up. The rapid electrification of our economy is creating transmission bottlenecks and electricity shortfalls, increasing demands for flexible, cost-competitive, grid-independent power. Anode’s AI-orchestrated microgrid solutions create a new model for large electricity users who can’t wait on the grid or be held back by legacy technologies to scale their operations.”

Paul Huelskamp, co-founder and CEO of Anode

“Anode is solving one of the most urgent challenges in the energy transition: Access to reliable, clean, and on-demand power. Their vertically integrated model and world-class team enable them to scale rapidly and electrify some of the most critical industries of the future. Anode is uniquely positioned to bridge the gaps in existing electrical infrastructure by delivering scalable energy solutions that will unlock growth across transportation, manufacturing, and beyond.”",https://cdn.pulse2.com/cdn/2025/09/Anode-Logo.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 14:00:00.570581

While political shifts in the United States are pulling the emergency break on clean energy policy mechanisms, the international energy sector is plowing full-steam ahead. “This is no longer a distant promise: it is happening now, at a pace and scale that was unthinkable even five years ago,” writes Reuters, “and it is being driven not just by advanced economies but increasingly by developing ones.”

As clean energy becomes cheaper, more reliable, and more decentralized, increasing adoption of renewable and clean energy technologies is a no-brainer for many countries. It’s not even about clean energy policy anymore – it’s basic economics. Take Pakistan – one of the world’s largest new adopters of solar power, at what may be the fastest rate in history. The nation’s traditional energy model based on fossil fuel imports has led to rolling blackouts and punishing energy prices for locals. As a result, citizens are increasingly turning to rooftop solar with attached battery systems to power their homes more affordably and reliably.

And Pakistan is just one example of many emerging economies that are turning to clean energy technologies to provide energy affordably, reliably, and locally. “The new generation of wind and solar power, batteries, and electric vehicles are on the verge of, or have already achieved, escape velocity, breaking free from the gravity of political capriciousness,” reads a recent article from Vox. “In a lot of places, especially in power generation, the cleanest option is also the fastest, the cheapest, and the one most likely to turn a profit. That’s true whether or not you care about the climate.”

A recent analysis from Ember shows that roughly two-thirds of the world’s emerging and developing economies are now leapfrogging the United States and Europe in their shift to clean energy. And it's clear why – the Ember report also calculates that 91 percent of new solar and wind developments are even cheaper than the cheapest fossil fuel plants when accounting for fuel cost. As a result, last year a whopping 87 percent of energy generation investment in emerging economies and China went to clean energy projects.

China has been instrumental in bringing clean energy to emerging economies around the globe. Through their ambitious Belt and Road international infrastructure project and well-established trade relationships, China has established itself as the central player of the global clean energy market. “Since 2018, Kenya, Yemen, Sri Lanka, and Tanzania have imported an amount of Chinese solar equal to roughly half the capacity of their entire power grid,” reads a recent report from Yale Environment 360. Recent United States policy has only served to solidify those trade relationships and incentivise closer ties between China and many emerging economies who have been targeted by steep tariffs.

However, developing nations still need a leg up in terms of climate financing if global targets are to be met. A coalition of rich and poor governments around the globe has prepared an open letter for this week’s U.N. General Assembly in New York this week urging global leaders to act swiftly in what is to be a ""decisive decade"" for the climate.

""Stark disparities in access to energy and investment remain,"" the statement warns. “Much more needs to be done to ensure the transition not only advances globally but also benefits the people and economies that need it most."" Africa, which has some of the greatest clean energy production potential in the world, has received only a fraction of global climate financing, despite the fact that its people are already suffering the impacts of climate change brought on by emissions from the Global North.

While the clean energy transition makes good economic sense, and has reached “escape velocity” in some contexts, scientists say that it needs to be significantly hastened to avoid the worst impacts of global warming. While clean energy projects are ramping up internationally, so too are fossil fuel developments.

The United States is facing an uphill battle in the wind sector thanks to several measures being championed by the current administration that aim to roll back the progress in the sector made during the Biden administration. The CVOW has the potential to completely transform the region and deliver short-term employment during the construction phase, as well as long-term jobs for Virginians.

The Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project is the largest of its kind in the United States

Wind power remains a crucial part of the energy sector in the United States, as it should. One would struggle to argue with the advantages that wind power presents to the energy sector. Wind is free, and as such, the inevitable costs that Virginians will need to fork out are exceedingly low. The project is located a mere 27 miles off the coast of Virginia Beach in federal waters.

Those federal waters may pose a risk to the completion of the project, as Donald Trump aims to prevent wind projects from making any progress during his administration. Which we must remember is only in year one of four. In August of this year, the project reported that over 130 turbine foundations have been installed.

Couple that with the fact that all undersea transmission cables are in place, and specialized U.S.-built installation vessels are being deployed from Virginia’s shores, and the construction progress is well on track to reach its 2026 completion date. Once that happens, the 176 Siemens Gamesa turbines will produce roughly 2.6 gigawatts of electricity, or enough to power up to 660,000 Virginia homes.

Dominion Energy reports that the project is approximately 60 percent complete

Dominion Energy has reported that the major components are on track for full deployment by the end of 2026. Which will provide crucial employment for local residents in the short and long term. Once operational, the site is expected to generate more than $210 million in annual economic output. Roughly 900 jobs have been created during the construction phase, with another 1,100 long-term jobs being created in the final phases.

According to Dominion Energy filings with the State Corporation Commission, the project is expected to reduce fuel costs by more than $3 billion over the first decade of operation. The project will have an environmental impact as well. Once operational, the project will reduce carbon dioxide emissions by a staggering 2 million metric tons.

The project plays a crucial role in the Virginia Clean Economy Act

The Virginia Clean Economy Act aims to mandate 100% carbon-free electricity by 2050, as well as set a target of 5.2 gigawatts of offshore wind energy by 2035. The economic and environmental impact on the Virginia region will be substantial, to say the least. Despite the stance of the current administration, the project is on track to achieve its lofty goals and deliver crucial energy for the residents of Virginia, as well as deliver employment to thousands.

The longer summers have given these native bloodsuckers an extra three weeks on average to find a host.
It can make all the difference.” Advertisement REASON TO HOPE Maine scientists believe that people can help the environment adapt to the changing climate.
In certain areas, when the conditions are just right, they may be able to create new cold spots, she said.
“We can’t stop our rivers from warming, but we can slow down how fast it is happening,” Ouellet said.","When she looks at the Narraguagus River, Valerie Ouellet sees what others can’t: a thermal mosaic that explains why it’s one of the last places in America where wild Atlantic salmon come to spawn.

This 55-mile-long waterway in Downeast Maine is a hodgepodge of cold-water pockets hidden within the warmer river where adult salmon can find refuge from the state’s increasingly hot summers.

Atlantic salmon do their best growing and spawning in 68-degree water. Any higher and they stop eating; they lay fewer, smaller eggs. At 73 degrees, they swim erratically. If they don’t find cold water created by shade trees, spring-fed tributaries or groundwater seepage, some will die.

Ouellet is an ecologist with the Atlantic Salmon Federation and is part of a state and federal research team that has spent two years documenting the river’s temperature and flow to explore how close, how big and how cold these spots must be for salmon to survive.

Her research suggests cold water spots are shrinking or disappearing, especially during drought years. The Narraguagus now spends a lot of July and August above 73 degrees, according to U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service monitoring data. On July 17, 2023, a legendary salmon pool in the Cherryfield section topped 83 degrees.

“Wild salmon are an indicator of ecosystem health,” Ouellet said. “If they go away because the water is too warm or not clean enough, what, or should I say who, do you think is in trouble next? That’s us.”

“If we lose them,” she said, “that means we’ve failed ourselves, too.”

The salmon’s struggle — which is shared by alewife and brook trout — is part of a much larger story unfolding across Maine. Projected to heat up by as much as 10 degrees by the year 2100, the state’s landscape is changing in ways that scientists are only just starting to understand, from its deepest waters to its highest peaks.

There is already a phenological disconnect in some areas — the dwarf bilberry shrub, for example, is flowering before the bumblebee and flies are ready to pollinate it. Experts say these are powerful indicators of a biological rhythm thrown out of sync by rising temperatures.

The Portland Press Herald/Maine Sunday Telegram spoke to two dozen experts this summer about the ways increasing heat is affecting Maine’s environment, ranging from the short-term impacts of heat waves on bats and birds to the long-term effects of warming lakes, forests and oceans.

A FOREST IN FLUX

Maine’s evergreen cloak is beginning to show strain.

The state’s iconic spruce and fir populations are declining and heat-tolerant hickories and oaks are taking their place. Even the tree line is changing, inching up the warming mountainsides by about a foot a year, putting the squeeze on the plants and animals that had adapted to the harsh conditions at the top.

This is perhaps nowhere more visible than at Acadia National Park, where the red spruce’s prickly yellow-green needles scent the trails like orange rind when crushed by hikers’ boots. It is where the boreal and temperate forests meet. Many trees there are at the edge of their range.

With summer temperatures projected to warm by as much as 8 degrees, the amount of suitable red spruce habitat at Acadia is expected to drop by 50% by 2100, according to a 2022 U.S. Forest Service report that outlined how a warming climate would change the park.

“Acadia National Park is experiencing unprecedented change,” Laura Gibson, who runs a climate adaptation program at Friends of Acadia, said at a lecture this month about finding new ways to protect Acadia’s forests. “Thinking about the future can certainly be daunting at times.”

The red spruce provides winter cover for American marten and white-tailed deer and food for grouse, snowshoe hare and white-winged crossbill, whose twisted bill is designed to pry open spruce cones to get at its seeds.

As Acadia’s forest changes, the songbirds that make up its soundtrack could disappear. The Maine Audubon, a statewide wildlife and habitat conservation group, predicts that as many as 60 bird species will leave the park by 2150.

The husky call of the boreal chickadee will be replaced by the cardinal’s telltale pew-pew-pew or the red-bellied woodpecker’s shrill churr.

“Nature is clearly trying to tell us something, but we’re not listening,” said Sally Stockwell, the director of conservation at Maine Audubon. “We’re watching one species after another decline. … I never thought I’d see such dramatic changes right here in Maine.”

WILDLIFE FEEL THE HEAT

Moose can be quite vocal. During the fall mating season, males make deep grunts while females will use a long, nasally call to attract a mate. Calves often call out to their mothers. Both sexes will use snorts or roars when they are in danger, in distress or in a fight.

Then there is another, manmade sound — a kind of digital death rattle — that comes when Maine moose die. It is the notification tone Lee Kantar, the only state-appointed moose biologist in the country, hears come from his phone when a tracking collar has not moved for six hours.

It almost always means a moose is dead, he said, and it’s nearly always climate change, or more specifically the winter tick, that is to blame. The longer summers have given these native bloodsuckers an extra three weeks on average to find a host.

And once one latches on, it and tens of thousands of its friends will cling to that single host from fall through spring, slowly bleeding the moose to death. Kantar and others say it has turned the animal, which once numbered more than 100,000, from a symbol of Maine into one of climate change.

“As a scientist, I try to be objective, and maintain an emotional distance, but it can be difficult,” Kantar said in an interview this month after the debut of the film “Guardian of the Giants,” which highlights his work.

“With our changing climate, and what that means for winter ticks, I end up dealing with a lot of death,” he said.

The rising heat is also taking a direct toll on endangered bats, rare turtles and various species of birds that fall from their nests or are hit by cars when roused from dormancy too early.

At the Center for Wildlife in York, director Kristen Lamb sees the consequences. The nonprofit rehabilitation facility treats about 500 sick, injured or orphaned wild animals a year. During heat waves, chimney swifts are admitted with broken wings after the spit they use to hold their homes together dissolves in the heat, causing whole nests to drop to the ground.

The center often treats bats, already stressed from deadly white nose syndrome, that are injured after falling from exhaustion during a heat wave when the caves they use for roosting become dangerously hot, and the tiny creatures, unable to cool down, simply fall, Lamb said.

Extreme heat also confuses some animals, throwing their natural instincts out of sync. Normally dormant in summer, turtles are waking up in response to the warm ground. They begin to move across roads in search of food and water, only to be hit and injured or killed by cars.

“Every single wild animal that comes into our clinic tells a story,” Lamb said. “Many of the stories serve as a warning for humans. Because what we do to wildlife, well, we are also doing that to ourselves. Their problems will be our problems.”

WARMING WATERS

The average surface water temperature of Maine’s 100 biggest lakes has risen by 5.5 degrees between 1980 and 2020, according to monitoring data collected by the Maine Department of Environmental Protection. That’s faster than Maine’s air and its oceans.

Those changes can result in a bumper crop of algae and invasive plants, according to researchers at Lakes Environmental Association and Lake Stewards of Maine. Algal blooms, once a rare occurrence, are becoming more frequent in shallower lakes and ponds as temperatures climb. These blooms can be toxic, posing a risk to human health and wildlife.

Consider Lake Auburn, a critical reservoir for the Lewiston-Auburn area. Historically, its deep, cold waters have been remarkably resilient. Now, longer, hotter summers have increased stratification — where oxygen levels in the deeper layers are dropping, impacting aquatic life and water quality, research from the Lake Auburn Watershed Protection Commission shows.

Rising lake temperatures also allow harmful bacteria and pathogens, such as E. coli, to survive longer, said Ben Peierls, research director for Lakes Environmental Association. This risk is compounded on hot days when more people visit lakes to cool off, which can increase the spread of these bacteria.

That exposure can sicken people, but it can also harm fish, Peierls said, causing infections, weakened immune systems and growth and reproduction problems.

At the same time, the Gulf of Maine is one of the fastest-warming bodies of water on the planet, and its transformation is sending ripples through the aquatic food chain, down to a tiny zooplankton called Calanus finmarchicus.

Advertisement

This minuscule crustacean is a temperature-sensitive species whose decline impacts a broad array of other marine wildlife and shows how interconnected they can be, said Kathy Mills, a senior scientist at the Gulf of Maine Research Institute.

As the zooplankton moved out of the Gulf of Maine, past the Bay of Fundy and into a new habitat in the Gulf of St. Lawrence, both the herring and the critically endangered North Atlantic right whale followed, according to a separate studies on the species.

But the habitat switch brought new dangers. According to the National Marine Fisheries Service, 12 right whales out of 450 died in the Gulf of St. Lawrence from ship strikes or fishing gear entanglement in 2017, leading to regulatory changes that reshaped lobstering on both sides of the border.

A warmer Gulf of Maine is also less suitable for herring, the fish that puffin, a beloved symbol of Maine’s coast, likes to eat and feed its chicks, said Don Lyons, the director of conservation science at the Maine-based Audubon Seabird Institute.

During marine heat waves, they’ll often fall back on Atlantic butterfish, a less heat-sensitive species, but its round body can be too large and oddly shaped for puffin chicks to swallow, Lyons said.

“We’ve found butterfish piled up outside of burrows with dead chicks inside,” he said. “It’s not that there was no food at all, but it wasn’t the right food. A few degrees warmer, a different fish supply. It can make all the difference.”

REASON TO HOPE

Maine scientists believe that people can help the environment adapt to the changing climate.

Researchers at the Appalachian Mountain Club are investigating whether alpine plants that grow atop southern New England mountains — which may have evolved with a higher heat tolerance — could be transplanted to Katahdin, the Whites and even Acadia National Park.

Maine’s puffin colonies had a successful nesting season this summer thanks to a break from the year-on-year heat waves that have dominated the Gulf of Maine over the last decade. Scientists counted 672 active puffin burrows at the Seal Island National Wildlife Refuge, about 100 more than the previous census five years earlier.

Some chicks drowned at Eastern Egg Rock and Hog Island, the two sites monitored by Audubon Seabird Institute, when storms in May and August flooded the low-lying burrows, but those that survived the storms had plenty of bite-sized fatty fish to eat, Lyons said.

This summer, Ouellet, the salmon researcher, is focused on the indirect impact of a warming climate — drought, which leads to lower water levels and reduces the ability of rivers to absorb and dissipate heat, making them more susceptible to warming, and thus more harmful to salmon and other aquatic life.

“It’s not looking good for Atlantic salmon this year,” Ouellet said.

She and the research team conducting thermal mapping of the Narraguagus are still processing their data, trying to determine the farthest a salmon will swim between cold spots, but they have already started sharing some with conservation groups.

In certain areas, when the conditions are just right, they may be able to create new cold spots, she said. If the thermal maps identify a warm pond spilling into a tributary, that’s fixable, Ouellet said. If too many trees have been cut back, they can plant more. A drainage ditch dumping warm water into a stream can be rerouted.

“We can’t stop our rivers from warming, but we can slow down how fast it is happening,” Ouellet said. “We created this problem, so we have a responsibility to fix it when we can.”

Although it remains unclear whether air pollution is directly linked to breast cancer, research in this field is expanding.","On a tree-lined street in a quiet suburb known by some as “Arbor City”, Eileen Miranda often watched her grandson race around the yard, trusting – like most – that the air they were breathing was clean. But data from an air quality sensor she recently installed outside her home showed otherwise. Now she wonders if it was the air that contributed to her eldest son’s childhood struggle with asthma.

“It overwhelmed me,” Miranda said. “I thought the numbers would be low. This community is nice, but lo and behold”

At 66, the grandmother of eight, who lives in La Mirada, a suburb south-east of Los Angeles, began noticing in her everyday life the cars idling on congested streets and the dizzying pace of heavy-duty diesel trucks coming in and out of an industrial hub a mile from her home.

“These are the things that got me thinking this cannot be good for the air,” she said.

Eileen is one of a growing number of Latinos across the US who, motivated by rising pollution concerns, have installed air quality sensors outside their homes, businesses and churches to better understand the air they’re breathing and advocate for change in their communities.

The grassroots monitoring comes as Donald Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) moves to scrap almost all pollution regulations by rescinding a key 16-year-old legal finding, alongside a barrage of other rollbacks of life-saving rules.

Although more than half of the US population resides in areas with unhealthy air quality, communities of color are disproportionately affected, comprising 50% of those breathing in toxic air pollutants, despite representing just 41% of the US population, according to a recent analysis by the American Lung Association. Latinos are nearly three times more likely than white individuals to live in communities with poor air quality.

Although agencies such as the EPA collect air quality data, researchers note that this information may not present the complete picture since some sensors are primarily located in wealthier, predominantly white neighborhoods. Meanwhile, companies can bypass air quality rules by using data from monitors located farther from pollution sources, where the air is cleaner, or by not collecting data at all, as a recent Guardian analysis found.

Sensors in specific neighborhoods can help people better understand the air quality where they live, while also helping to fill data gaps. This local data can then be published for the public and shared with government agencies to inform where regulations and enforcement are needed.

In Miranda’s case, the air quality sensor is provided by the Hispanic Access Foundation, a national non-profit organization. Through a three-year grant funded by the Biden administration, the group aims to engage communities most affected by measuring air pollution in 12 areas with significant Latino populations.

The locations have some of the highest air pollution rates in the US, and all but one have asthma rates higher than the national average among adults.

Using PurpleAir monitors, everyday citizens and community leaders, known as “site managers”, gather data and track levels of harmful air pollutants, especially the type scientists call PM2.5 – particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers.

While not visible on its own, PM2.5 in large amounts – such as from car exhausts, coal-fired power plants and other industrial sources – can cause serious health problems for humans. Particulate matter has been linked to respiratory diseases such as asthma as well as neurological disorders, cardiovascular disease and other health issues.

A 2021 study found people of color faced higher exposure to PM2.5 pollution regardless of region or location. The study’s authors note that because of a legacy of housing policy and other factors, racial-ethnic exposure disparities continue to persist even with a decrease in the overall exposure.

PM2.5 levels are also worsened by heatwaves and wildfires, both of which are becoming more intense and widespread due to human-made global heating.

“When it comes to climate, everything is really interconnected. The wildfire smoke we’re seeing in California, we’re seeing that in other parts of the world,” said Hilda Berganza, the Hispanic Access Foundation’s climate manager, overseeing the project called El Aire Que Respiramos (The Air We Breathe).

In southern Idaho, Cecy Ruano, 50, and her family host one of the 12 air monitors in Caldwell, a small city surrounded by acres of farmland that is 38% Latino.

In 1989, many laborers migrated to Caldwell in search of employment in the agricultural industry. Likewise, Ruano migrated as a young child with her parents, harvesting and packing beets and onions in the fields, and she eventually stayed to raise a family of her own. Driven by her faith and family, she actively works to educate others and nurture a caring relationship with the environment.

“My mother suffers from asthma, and my great-grandmother also had breathing problems, so for me it’s very important, and not just for my mom but for the people in my church,” Ruano said. “I’ve got to take care of them; I need to make sure they’re OK.”

Located in a valley with Oregon to the west and Boise to the east, Caldwell faces wildfire winds from both directions from May to October. Worsening drought conditions across Idaho, along with extreme heat, are increasing wildfire risks in the area and lengthening the wildfire season.

Ruano’s mother, Maria A Espinoza, 66, her voice soft and raspy, gets winded easily and tries to stay indoors during those months.

Just eight miles south of Caldwell, at the Deer Flat national wildlife refuge, Cecy’s daughter Aimee Benitez and her husband, Bryan Benitez, both 29, informed residents in English and Spanish about the latest air quality data from their Caldwell sensor and how they can reduce exposure when the air quality is poor.

The project aims to compare three years of data with EPA data, enabling the sharing of this information with local officials and giving them a fuller picture of potential exposures.

“It’s just the start of what we can do,” said Benitez.

Down the road from Eileen in Commerce, California, a line of freight trucks idles as they prepare to enter the freeway next to Iglesia Bautista La Resurrección, where Pastor William Carcamo, 69, had an air quality sensor installed through the Hispanic Access Foundation as part of his commitment to serving the community.

“We Hispanic people worry about paying the rent, paying off the car and having money to sustain ourselves. But I tell my congregants, what’s the point of having a nice car if our air is polluted?” Carcamo said in Spanish.

The city of Commerce faces significant air quality challenges due to its location between the 710 freeway and a major rail yard that transports international goods to the ports of Los Angeles and Long Beach.

California is widely known for some of the worst air pollution in the country, yet significant challenges persist when it comes to implementing and enforcing regulations.

In January, California rolled back a law aimed at curbing air pollution by requiring trucks to run cleaner by 2035. The law would have phased out diesel trucks at the ports of LA and Long Beach to a hydrogen and electric future. The rule was withdrawn from EPA approval just ahead of the return to office of Trump, who had previously threatened to revoke California’s clean air standards.

Since taking office, Trump has issued multiple executive orders rescinding previous efforts by previous administrations to tackle environmental injustice. So far, the EPA has cut more than 600 grants aimed at addressing the climate crisis and environmental justice because of what it considers unnecessary spending. These rollbacks come in response to the rapid growth of community data-collection projects over the last several years.

Democrats are accusing the EPA of illegally canceling billions of dollars in congressionally appropriated funds.

When asked whether current EPA monitoring networks adequately reflect air quality realities in communities of color, the agency clarified that although it provides technical and financial support, most monitoring stations are operated by state, local and tribal air agencies. It stated that the largest networks, which measure PM2.5 and ozone, are typically located in urban and rural areas chosen to represent broader regions or neighborhood-scale zones. The EPA did not address whether support would be renewed for expiring grants related to air quality monitoring.

“The Trump EPA is committed to enhancing our ability to deliver clean air, water, and land for ALL Americans regardless of race, gender, creed, and background,” the agency said.

The Hispanic Access Foundation was among 127 projects in 37 states that received grants from the EPA under the Biden administration in 2022 to monitor air quality in communities with environmental and health disparities stemming from pollution and the Covid-19 pandemic. Its grant remains in place through September 2026.

Industrial facilities foul nearby neighborhoods

In the historically Latino and working-class neighborhoods of Barrio Logan and Logan Heights in San Diego, California, industrial development near homes has led to increased health risks for residents and fueled decades of activism for cleaner air.

The neighborhoods face disproportionately high levels of air pollution that come from nearby industrial facilities, a naval base, a freeway and marine terminal operations, which have also limited access to the waterfront. The contrast is stark when compared with the wealthy community across the Coronado Bridge, where residential areas are kept separate from industry.

“You don’t need to live here to help us advocate, just caring is enough. It’s not right to have these negative statistics.” said Maritza Garcia, 33, a second-generation resident whose mom has breathing issues and led her to get involved with Environmental Health Coalition, a non-profit that has been working to reduce pollution and improve health since the 1980s.

While they’ve seen some success, such as advocating for a policy with the port of San Diego that would require a transition from diesel trucks to electric trucks by 2030, they still face uncertainty about what these policies will truly deliver and how effectively they will be enforced.

Recently, the Environmental Health Coalition faced a funding setback to its clean air project when one of its grants was cut by the EPA in May. While the remaining funds will allow it to continue its work for now, the organization is now seeking alternative sources of support to sustain its efforts.

“This is not a position against industry,” said José Franco García, executive director of the Environmental Health Coalition, “It really gets frustrating to hear the way environmental justice is being attacked as if it were a luxury or something that people are trying to take advantage of for funding, when in reality, it’s people who have been taken advantage of for years and have been suffering.”

At a South Bronx Unite (SBU) community meeting in May, about 20 residents packed into a small room in the Bronx, while others joined online to discuss data from 65 air monitors tracking particle pollution across the borough.

Much of that pollution comes from heavy truck traffic, industrial sites such as waste transfer stations, and local power plants. The Bronx is 55% Latino and 29% Black and has some of the highest rates of asthma in the country.

One of those 65 sensors is mounted on the concrete facade of the building where Grace Gonzalez, 56, lives. A lifelong Bronx resident, she lives less than half a mile from the Bruckner Expressway, a major truck route, and just a mile from the industrial waterfront.

Grace has lived in the building for 56 years and has asthma that has worsened with age, now limiting her ability to go on walks and jog like she used to.

“I try to live a normal life as much as I can,” she said. Every day, she climbs the five flights of stairs, taking breaks in between, to get to her apartment. For the past three years, she’s been having to use a nebulizer when her asthma flares up. “I call her nebu,” Grace chuckled.

She remains in good spirits and has become known in her building as a sort of messenger, making an effort to share information about air quality and updates from the SBU meetings with her neighbors and family.

Her daughter Gracie, 35, was diagnosed with breast cancer in 2021, despite having no family history of the disease. Grace’s asthma, her daughter’s diagnosis and those of five other women in the building led the mother and daughter to question the air they were breathing – and what it might be doing to their health.

“I’m not going to be a statistic on a paper,” said Gracie, a patient care navigator at a care management agency. She trusted her instincts, advocated for herself and pushed for answers until she received a diagnosis. Gracie underwent chemotherapy and radiation, and now stays on top with regular follow-ups.

Although it remains unclear whether air pollution is directly linked to breast cancer, research in this field is expanding.

With two younger daughters, Gracie hopes more can be done to improve quality of life for Bronx residents. She loves her neighborhood and doesn’t want to leave. “We’re kind of the overlooked borough,” she said.

Even before Trump’s second term, nearly 73 million people lived in counties where neither ozone nor PM2.5 are monitored, according to a recent study by the American Lung Association, creating a gap in public health data likely to worsen as funding is cut.

“People need to know what’s in the air they’re breathing,” said Diana Van Vleet from the American Lung Association. “Stepping up and using these more localized air monitors and even filling in some of the gaps with satellite information is more useful and helpful than ever, especially as we’re seeing more areas impacted by wildfire smoke.”

Efforts to block community air monitoring projects have also gained traction. In May 2024, Louisiana passed a law that effectively bans community groups from using their own air pollution monitoring equipment and publishing the results, imposing fines for violations. In response, a coalition of environmental and community organizations filed a federal lawsuit in May challenging the law, arguing it violates their first amendment rights by restricting the publication of collected data.

Meanwhile, the Hispanic Access Foundation’s attempts to expand its air quality project were blocked when two subsequent grant proposals submitted to the EPA were rejected. The proposals aimed to grow the project to 20 additional sites, stretching from New Mexico to Florida.

Despite these challenges, experts believe it’s essential to continue the data collection to track trends over time.

“Latino communities are, on average, dealing with higher levels of air pollution, so nationwide this is definitely a trend,” said Dr Christopher Hennigan, from the University of Maryland, who’s been doing data analysis for the Hispanic Access Foundation project. “Is it fair for people to be exposed to higher levels of air pollution because of their ethnicity?”

Hennigan said that raising awareness and education remain the primary focus as the project’s future is uncertain.

Back in California, Eileen Miranda has been working to educate both her family and her community.

“Climate change is happening,” she said. “We made this problem; now we have to fix it. We have the tools to fix this.”

Miranda says she looks forward to presenting the data to local elected officials and remains undeterred by recent federal funding cuts.

“Now that I know, my eyes are open,” she said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a3128555c71f544a37dde1c37491d392d8d70a0e/0_0_3000_2400/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=b5bc826a17fee993d4f4f6f555e7184e",N,,2025-09-28 10:59:27.727063

Westchester County’s trusted clean energy nonprofit makes it easy for residents to take action, with vetted programs, local contractors, and free energy advising

September 16, 2025 – With federal clean energy tax credits set to expire, many homeowners are asking: “Is it still worth upgrading my furnace, boiler, or AC system in Westchester?” The answer is yes.

Through its relaunched EnergySmart Homes campaign, Sustainable Westchester is making it simple for residents to make the switch to clean, efficient home energy systems that make homes more modern, cost-efficient, comfortable, and ready for the future.

“Now is the time for Westchester homeowners to take action,” said Noam Bramson, Executive Director of Sustainable Westchester. “EnergySmart Homes makes the process simple, connects residents with trusted contractors, and ensures they benefit from the best available rebates. Our role is to help homeowners navigate options and move forward with confidence, so they don’t miss out.”

This relaunch comes at a pivotal moment: as federal incentives wind down, energy costs rise, and many households are confronting the high costs of keeping outdated furnaces, boilers, and AC units running. With winter approaching, it’s an ideal time for homeowners to schedule free energy assessments and “button up” their homes with insulation and air sealings to improve comfort and lower bills. As a trusted local nonprofit and municipal partner, Sustainable Westchester provides clear, unbiased guidance to help homeowners make smart energy choices without the guesswork.

What is EnergySmart Homes?

EnergySmart Homes is Sustainable Westchester’s free program that guides homeowners step-by-step through upgrading outdated systems—such as old furnaces, boilers, and air conditioners—with modern clean-energy systems such as:

Air source heat pumps

Geothermal heat pumps

Energy efficient insulation and air sealing

Heat pump water heaters

“This campaign is about setting a new standard of efficiency and comfort in Westchester homes,” said Lauren Brois, Director, EnergySmart Homes, Sustainable Westchester. “A modern home feels comfortable year-round, runs efficiently, and uses clean technology instead of outdated fossil-fuel systems. Whether it’s better insulation, air sealing, or upgrading to a heat pump, EnergySmart Homes guides homeowners toward solutions that fit their homes, budgets, and long-term goals.”

Are Clean Energy Rebates Still Available?

With federal tax credits sunsetting, homeowners can still tap into statewide programs like NYSERDA’s Comfort Home and EmPower+, which provide rebates for insulation and weatherization. Utilities such as Con Edison and NYSEG also offer incentives for heat pumps via the Clean Heat Program and offer equipment upgrades and smart thermostats. And with electricity rates rising and technology costs falling, clean energy upgrades often make economic sense even without incentives.

“Westchester residents are hearing mixed messages when it comes to federal incentives,” said Lauren Brois, Director, EnergySmart Homes at Sustainable Westchester. “The truth is: support is still available, the process is simple, and homeowners don’t have to figure it out alone. We guide families step by step, from understanding rebates and improvements to choosing the right contractor.”

Key Benefits of Energy-Smart Upgrades:

Lower bills: More efficient systems often result in lower utility bills. For example, adding insulation and sealing air leaks can save homeowners an average of 15% on heating and cooling costs. (1)

Greater comfort: Consistent year-round temperatures, gain air conditioning in the summer, and less drafty homes in winter.

Health & safety: Cleaner and safer living conditions at home and fewer greenhouse gas emissions in the environment.

Community resilience: Recent analysis in Westchester County found that pairing insulation with heat pumps can reduce peak summer demand by up to 8% and cut outage times by more than 60%, strengthening neighborhoods during extreme weather events. (2)

How Does the EnergySmart Homes Process Work?:

Sign Up – Residents connect with Sustainable Westchester’s Energy Smart Homes team to get started.

Assess – A vetted local installer completes a home energy / site assessment and provides a detailed report.

Review – Homeowners choose improvements and financing options that fit their needs.

Upgrade – Contractors install the technologies, delivering greater comfort and reduced emissions.

A Westchester Family’s Story

Mike Beilstein and Amy Kwan wanted their 105-year-old Pelham home to be the perfect place to raise their two children — but without air conditioning, poor insulation, and an oil-fired heating system, comfort was hard to come by.

After connecting with Sustainable Westchester’s EnergySmart Homes team, the family installed a geothermal heating and cooling system, a heat pump hot water heater, new insulation, and replacement windows.

“Our home finally feels comfortable in every season,” said Kwan. “The upgrades made a huge difference for our family — and having Sustainable Westchester’s guidance took the stress and guesswork out of the process.”

The discussion took place on Reddit's r/heatpumps subreddit, where a Canadian homeowner shared their experience with three local HVAC contractors. The homeowner wanted to replace their furnace with a heat pump, but each contractor suggested one that would be far too small to heat their 2,400-square-foot home.

""Is it because gas is so cheap that they just assume everyone will switch to gas [at sub-freezing temperatures]?"" the homeowner wondered.

Commenters quickly chimed in, saying the contractors likely did expect the homeowner to continue using gas-powered heat during the cold Canadian winters, but that burning dirty fuels wouldn't be necessary.

""What you are seeing is the dinosaurs of the industry showing their age,"" one commenter wrote. ""You can meet all your heating needs with a heat pump.""

By capturing heat from the ambient air, heat pumps don't need to burn dirty energy sources to keep a house warm. This makes them not only better for the environment but also more energy-efficient.

That efficiency results in lower monthly energy bills, and thanks to available tax credits and rebates, the upfront cost may also be lower than you'd expect. With EnergySage's Heat Pump Marketplace, you can see exactly what that cost is.

This free tool from EnergySage allows homeowners to get estimates from several local, verified HVAC installers, letting you quickly compare quotes to find the right heat pump — and right installation company — for your home and budget.

""Your home will be comfortable year-round with only a heat pump,"" one Reddit commenter wrote. ""No question whatsoever.""

To really amp up the savings on an electric heat pump, savvy homeowners could pair it with rooftop solar panels. Even in cold or cloudy climates, solar panels can generate enough power to bring monthly electricity bills down to nearly nothing.

Even better, EnergySage can help out with solar shopping, too. Thanks to their free tools, homeowners can compare solar-installation quotes — and according to EnergySage, the average homeowner can save up to $10,000.

Several eco-friendly credits and rebates, including the federal solar tax credit, will expire at the end of this year.

For those who were eyeing the most affordable version of the Tesla Cybertruck, the most recent news must feel like a rug being pulled out from under them. The company decided to pull the plug on its most affordable base model, the rear-wheel-drive Cybertruck.

What's happening?

According to a report from Quartz, Tesla decided to discontinue the RWD version of the Cybertruck only five months after the vehicle's launch. This model was billed as the most affordable, with a relatively low price tag of about $61,000, and was released this year. But now, the cheapest option available will be the all-wheel drive model, which starts at about $80,000, a $19,000 difference that represents a significant financial hurdle for many prospective buyers who have already placed reservations.

Why is this concerning?

This isn't just about one truck model. It's about accessibility. When the most affordable version of a high-profile electric vehicle disappears, it shrinks the pool of potential buyers and can slow down the transition to cleaner cars. Fewer EVs on the road have a real impact on community health by keeping more polluting gas-powered cars in circulation.

The decision also adds to a list of recent challenges for the company. While Tesla has seen sales growth in key markets such as China, its sales have recently plummeted across several major European countries. Adding to the concern is the shocking trend of preowned Cybertrucks losing their value much faster than expected, making it a tougher investment for buyers.

What can I do to help?

If you're thinking about buying your first electric vehicle, remembering the reason is important. Electric vehicles are far better for the environment, your family's health, and can save you a ton of money on repairs and gas. They are a win-win for everyone.

While you can't force an automaker to sell a specific model, you can still make informed choices. The good news is the EV market is bigger than just one truck, and there's plenty of information out there for those considering making their next car electric. Exploring all the options is the best way to find a vehicle that fits your budget and lifestyle.

Buying new isn't the only path, either. As the EV market matures, more affordable preowned options are becoming available. Some automakers are even expanding leasing programs for their used vehicles, creating another avenue for drivers to get into an electric car without the high upfront cost.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/x0l.GuQxHbRKqsubC6HGFw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5e6aeb983c58513ecb78ea855583f383,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:44.212482

The federal EV tax credit was implemented in 2022 under the Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act, and since then sales of EVs have been steadily increasing.

Data from Argonne National Laboratory tracking EV sales found that EV sales in the U.S. for August 2025 were up 14.7 percent over the same time period in 2024. In 2024, EV sales were up 7 percent over the number of vehicles sold in 2023.

The laboratory found that, cumulatively, more than 7.3 million plug-in EVs have been sold in the U.S. since 2010.

Used EV sales were up nearly 60 percent in August 2025 over the same period last year, according to data from Cox Automotive shows.

""As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,"" Cox said in its report.

Some experts predict that interest in EVs will come to a halt once the tax incentive ends on the 30th.

Karl Brauer, the executive analyst at iSeeCars.com, told the Detroit Free Press that EV sales are ""going to crater"" once the incentive wraps.

He predicted that there will be ""almost no buyers"" after the 30th because EVs are typically priced higher than gasoline vehicles.

Tim Horvick, the owner of San Tan Ford dealership in Phoenix, told CBS News that the end of the credit is a concern for him, and admitted ""it could be challenging"" to move EVs once the incentive expires.",https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_independent_635/cc9b24a3eda7cf0b4e7c240917a82e60,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:41.257903

Jeremy Lardeau of Cascale outlines why outdoor brands must collaborate and align with this shift to stay competitive and climate-resilient.

China’s rise as a low-carbon production leader

China is rapidly evolving into a hub for low-carbon, circular, and technology-driven production. China built nearly twice as much utility-scale wind and solar capacity as the rest of the world combined in 2024 and 2025, and with national initiatives pushing for textile recycling by 2025, the country is making measurable strides toward sustainability in its textile and apparel sector. Just this week, China announced its goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by between 7 and 10 percent by 2035, solidifying its commitment to renewables.

As Cascale’s recent analysis shows, many Chinese textile manufacturers are no longer just meeting compliance standards; they’re turning sustainability into a competitive advantage. Factories that adopt renewable energy and improve efficiency to offer “low-carbon apparel” are changing the conversation for brands.

However, ongoing US-China trade tensions are prompting some American importers to rethink sourcing strategies. While not all apparel categories are equally affected, unpredictability adds complexity to long-term planning.

Action points for outdoor brands

So, what does this mean for the outdoor industry?

First, outdoor brands should initiate discussions with their Chinese suppliers about their climate goals, greenhouse gas emissions and energy sources. Tools, like Cascale’s Higg Facility Environment Module (Higg FEM), enable this dialogue between brands and suppliers, by reporting and validating sustainability performance. The Higg FEM is a key tool for the industry value chain, striking a balance between reporting and benchmarking.

Second, collaboration in a pre-competitive environment is key to progress. Although it is promising to see many outdoor brands individually moving towards decarbonization, brands often source from the same facilities. This means some initiatives may force manufacturers and suppliers to work to different standards and specifications. Instead, outdoor brands should collaborate to develop aligned plans in partnership with each other and their supply chains, helping to build trust and transparency in the process.

From sourcing to strategy

Finally, outdoor brands must take a considered approach to their sourcing practices. To reach the industry’s sustainability ambitions, companies need to evolve the buyer-supplier engagement to foster long-term collaboration, climate investment, and shared accountability. There can be no meaningful progress towards deep, complex, and capital-intensive decarbonization efforts without a true commercial partnership between buyers and suppliers. Tools like the Better Buying Purchasing Practices Index can help brands understand the impact of their current purchasing practices and provide a blueprint for improvement.

Our recent Cascale Annual Meeting, which brought together over 700 stakeholders, underscored a critical truth: collective action is no longer optional. It’s the only way forward. For the outdoor industry, the path is clear. Sustainability isn’t just an added value; it’s an ingrained strategy. China’s evolving manufacturing landscape is a call to action we can’t afford to ignore.",https://sustonmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Cascale-Hero-WEB.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:18.673104

Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK) is one of the biggest regulated utility companies in the US. Its bread and butter is Electric Utilities & Infrastructure—serving 8.6 million electric customers across the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Ohio, and Kentucky, with a hefty 55,100 megawatts of generation capacity. Its Gas Utilities & Infrastructure arm delivers natural gas to 1.7 million customers in five states. A smaller Renewables & Other unit dabbles in wind, solar, and storage, but regulated operations still make up over 90% of the company’s revenues. In short: most of Duke’s money comes from stable, rate-based businesses where profits are closely tied to the capital it invests and the tariffs regulators approve. Duke’s in a business with big walls—think regulated monopolies and high costs to compete—giving it a defensive moat and cash flows that are about as reliable as you’ll find. Its closest rivals by size? NextEra Energy, Southern Company, Constellation Energy, and American Electric Power. Like its peers, Duke’s growth depends as much on regulators agreeing to raise rates as it does on its own investment plans.

Recent Performance

Duke’s stock returned about 4.9% in the past year, lagging well behind the S&P 500’s 15.1% gain. Rising interest rates and a stubbornly hawkish Federal Reserve dented utility valuations, while tech stocks and cyclical sectors pulled the overall market higher. On top of that, storm costs and Duke’s relentless investment in new infrastructure have taken their toll on near-term earnings clarity.

Fundamental Analysis

Growth Prospects

Duke’s rolling out a hefty five-year, $87 billion capital plan to cover grid improvements, cleaner energy, and growing demand from things like data centers. Management is calling for earnings per share to grow at a 5–7% annual clip through 2029, mostly thanks to steady rate case approvals and the returns on all that new investment. Still, near-term sales growth is running at 5.08%—behind the overall market’s 8.72%—and remains heavily dependent on how quickly regulators sign off and whether demand from industrial customers keeps rising.

Quality & Moat

Duke’s operating margins are solid at 29.00%—firmer than its five-year average of 23.36% and higher than the market’s 18.71%. That’s the benefit of having pricing power and scale on its side. Return on invested capital has risen to 5.46% from 4.47% over five years, though that’s still less than half the market average of 11.14%—a reminder that this is a capital-heavy industry. Duke’s free cash flow yield is finally positive at 0.58% (up from a negative five-year average of –0.21%), but the market beats it at 1.91%. The bottom line: Duke’s seasoned management and its regulated franchise keep profits consistent, but the moat is more practical than spectacular.

Valuation

Duke trades at 21.5 times forward earnings—cheaper than the market’s 25.9 times—so investors are getting a bit of a discount for that stability and dividend focus. But its EV/Sales of 6.11 stands above both its own five-year average (5.60) and the broader market (4.69). In other words: the market’s paying up for reliability, even if top-line growth is slow. That disconnect—lower earnings multiple but richer sales valuation—highlights the tug-of-war between Duke’s defensive cash flows and its limited growth.

Market Sentiment

With a beta of just 0.18, Duke’s stock barely budges when the wider market swings. The 50-day trend is up by 0.20, and volatility at 11.7% is half that of the S&P 500’s 23.1%. These numbers add up to a classic defensive play. Most analysts see Duke as a hold, institutional investors own a chunky share, and there’s little short interest—so sentiment’s generally steady as she goes. Recent moves—like selling a 19.7% stake in Duke Energy Florida to Brookfield—have been well-received because they tidy up the balance sheet.

Key Risks

Regulatory Approval: Duke’s growth relies on promptly securing new rate approvals and a friendly regulatory climate. Red tape or unfavorable decisions could crimp returns and slow down earnings.

Leverage and Interest Rates: Net debt to EBITDA stands at 5.41 times, far above the market’s 1.37 times. That makes Duke vulnerable if borrowing costs climb or if the credit rating comes under pressure.

Weather and Climate: Severe weather events and hurricanes hit utilities hard, racking up restoration costs and making it longer for Duke to get repaid, squeezing short-term cash flow.

Capital Intensity: That $87 billion in planned capital spending? It might mean more share sales, diluting existing investors, and could strain how much spare cash Duke generates.

Bull Case

Regulated Rate Base Growth: The $87 billion capex plan is set to grow Duke’s rate base and earnings for years—assuming regulators play along.

Defensive Cash Flows: Duke’s monopolistic businesses throw off reliable cash flows and strong margins, backing up those regular dividends.

Valuation Buffer: Trading at a forward P/E below the market gives some cushion, and there’s room for the stock to move up if investor sentiment shifts.

Low Volatility: With a beta of 0.18 and much lower volatility than the average stock, DUK suits risk-averse investors who still want some equity exposure.

Bear Case

High Leverage: Net debt to EBITDA at 5.4 times means more financial risk—especially in a world where rates could climb higher still.

Slow Organic Growth: Sales growth lags the market, and if regulators become more stingy on allowed profits, the returns on all that spending could disappoint.

Regulatory Uncertainty: Future investment could hit a wall if rate cases drag out, are denied, or if regulators clamp down on how much Duke can earn.

Weather-Related Costs: Restoration costs from storm damage are unpredictable and can put a dent in both cash flows and returns.

On Our Radar

Q3 2025 Earnings: Results due in early November 2025. Expect updates on how Duke is managing its spending plan, regulatory battles, and storm-recovery costs.

Carolina Utilities Merger: Regulators are reviewing the planned January 1, 2027 tie-up between Duke Energy Carolinas and Duke Energy Progress, designed to deliver $1 billion in customer savings by 2038.

Brookfield Stake Closing: Brookfield expects to make an initial $2.8 billion payment for a piece of Duke’s Florida operations in early 2026, which should shore up Duke’s balance sheet.

Investment Conclusion

Duke Energy is a classic defensive utility: stable cash flows, a healthy dividend, and trading at a bit of a discount compared to the broader market. But it comes with baggage: high leverage, constant need for new investment, and the risk that regulators might not always see eye to eye. For long-term, income-focused investors, Duke could offer a reliable way to get equity exposure with less drama. Value investors might also like the below-market P/E, but should be comfortable with the capital-hungry business model and the realities of regulatory risk.",https://finimize-img.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fchivas-assets.s3-eu-west-1.amazonaws.com%2Fstatic%2Fimages%2Fasset_snapshot_placeholder.original.png?ixlib=python-3.1.2&s=733c218a6175c5f3b8215b90512f96d8,N,,2025-09-28 13:02:24.461521

After about 25 to 30 years, solar panels wear out. Over the years, heating and cooling cycles stress the materials. Small cracks develop, precipitation corrodes the frame and layers of materials can start to peel apart.

In 2023, about 90% of old or faulty solar panels in the U.S. ended up in landfills. Millions of panels have been installed worldwide over the past few decades – and by about 2030, so many will be ready to retire that they could cover about 3,000 football fields.

As an electrical engineer who has studied many aspects of renewable energy, recycling solar panels seems like a smart idea, but it’s complicated. Built to withstand years of wind and weather, solar panels are designed for strength and are not easy to break down.

The cost conundrum

Sending a solar panel to a landfill costs between $1 and $5 in the U.S. But recycling it can cost three to four times as much, around $18. And the valuable materials inside solar panels, such as silver and copper, are in small amounts, so they’re worth about $10 to $12 – which makes recycling a money-losing prospect. Improvements in the recycling process may change the economics.

But for now, it’s even hard to reclaim the glass in solar panels. Many layers are glued together and need to be separated before they can be melted down for reuse. And if the separation is not precise enough, the glass that is recovered won’t be of high enough quality to use in making other solar panels or windows. It will be suitable only for lower-quality uses such as fill material in construction projects.

Other panels, usually older ones, may contain small amounts of toxic metals such as lead or cadmium. It can be difficult to tell whether toxic materials are present, though. Even experts have trouble, in part because current tests, such as the toxicity characteristic leaching procedure, can give inaccurate results. Therefore, many companies that own large numbers of solar panels just assume their panels are hazardous waste, which increases costs for both disposal and recycling. Clearer labels would help people know what a solar panel contains and how to handle it.

If someone wants to recycle a solar panel, and is willing to bear the cost, there aren’t many places in the U.S. that are willing to do it and are equipped to be safe about it.

Designing for a new life

Despite the Trump administration’s cuts to subsidies for solar projects, millions of solar panels are already in use in the U.S., and millions more are expected to be installed worldwide in the coming years. As a result, the solar industry is working on ways to minimize waste and repeatedly reuse materials.

Some ideas include sending used solar panels that still work at least a bit to developing nations, or even reusing them within the U.S. But there are not clear rules or processes for connecting reused panels to the power grid, so reuse tends to happen in less common, off-grid situations rather than becoming widespread.

Future solar panels could also be designed for easier recycling, using different construction methods and materials, and improved processing systems.

Making panels last longer – perhaps as long as 50 years – using more durable materials, weather-resistant components, real-time monitoring of panel performance and predictive maintenance to replace parts before they wear out would reduce waste significantly.

Building solar panels that are more easily disassembled into separate components made of different materials could also speed recycling. Components that fit together like Lego bricks – instead of using glue – or dissolvable sealants and adhesives could be parts of these designs.

Improved recycling methods could also help. Right now, panels are often simply ground up, mixing all of their components’ materials together and requiring a complicated process to separate them out again for reuse. More advanced approaches can extract individual materials with high purity. For example, a process called salt etching can recover over 99% of silver and 98% of silicon, at purity levels that are appropriate for high-end reuse, potentially even in new solar panels, without using toxic acids. That method can also recover significant quantities of copper and lead for use in new products.

A shared journey

Increasing the practice of recycling solar panels has more than just environmental benefits.

Over the long term, recovering and reusing valuable materials may prove more cost-effective than continually buying new raw materials on the open market. That could lower costs for future solar panel installations. If they are fully reused, the value of these recoverable materials could reach over $15 billion globally by 2050.

In addition, recycling panels and components reduces American reliance on materials imported from overseas, making solar power projects less vulnerable to global disruptions.

Recycling also keeps toxic materials out of landfills. That can help ensure a shift to clean energy doesn’t create new or bigger environmental problems. Also, recycling solar panels emits far less carbon dioxide than manufacturing panels from raw materials.

There are already some efforts underway to boost solar panel recycling. The Solar Energy Industries Association trade group is working to collect and share information about companies that recycle solar panels.

Governments can provide tax breaks or other financial incentives for using recycled materials, or ban disposing of solar panels in landfills. California, Washington, New Jersey and North Carolina have enacted laws or are studying ways to manage solar panel waste, with some even requiring recycling or reuse.

These efforts are important steps toward addressing the growing need for solar panel recycling and promoting a more sustainable solar industry.

With mounting energy demands from coastal urban areas and new data centers, offshore wind advocates still insist there can still be a future for U.S. offshore wind.
Meanwhile wind power opponents keep pressuring the Trump administration to do even more to foreclose on surviving projects.","The U.S. Justice department intervened Sept. 27 in a lawsuit brought by New Jersey opponents of offshore wind power, with a motion asking the federal court to remand previous approvals for the already-stalled Atlantic Shores project.

“This filing means federal agencies are going back to the drawing board,” said Bob Stern, president of the local activist group Save LBI, in an email to supporters Saturday. The group, a coalition of seaside homeowners, businesses and commercial fishermen, had filed their lawsuit July 11 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia, and has won allies in the Trump administration’s drive to shut down offshore wind development.

Earlier this year Save LBI successfully petitioned the administration and federal Environmental Protection Agency to suspend the Clean Air Act permit issued for Atlantic Shores construction. The latest move in the group’s larger federal lawsuit would completely reverse the construction and operations plan and record of decision issued by the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management a year ago, among a flurry of wind power plans approved in the last year of the Biden administration.

“This is a significant admission by the federal agencies that the Atlantic Shores approvals cannot withstand legal scrutiny in their current form,” said Thomas Stavola Jr., a lawyer for Save LBI. Over years of local organizing and fundraising the activists mounted what they call “a comprehensive, multi-statute challenge to the Atlantic Shores project, citing data deficiencies, injurious impacts to marine mammals, tourism, economy, and electric rates and failures to assess cumulative impacts across the broader offshore wind buildout.”

Atlantic Shores, a joint venture of EDF Renewables and Shell, had been planned as 197 turbines as close as 8.7 miles off Long Beach Island, in an array rated for potential power up to 2,800 megawatts. The proposal faced fierce resistance from residents of beachfront communities who feared effects on tourism and property values, commercial fishermen and some environmental activists resisting what they see as a future industrialization of waters in the New York Bight.

Like another ill-fated New Jersey project,Ørsted’s Ocean Wind,Atlantic Shore’s financial prospects deteriorated with global inflation following the covid-19 pandemic, war in Ukraine and supply chain problems. Atlantic Shores’ backers had hope to submit an updated bid for future power production to New Jersey energy planners, but in June asked the state Board of Public Utilities to cancel its original bid.

Partner Shell withdrew from the venture and wrote down a $1 billion loss on U.S. offshore wind investment after the Trump administration moved aggressively against the industry. Those attacks continue, with mixed results. A federal court allowed Ørsted to resume construction on its Revolution Wind project off southern New England, already almost 80 percent complete when Interior Secretary Doug Burgum issued a temporary stop-work order.

An earlier administration order to shutter the 810-MW Empire Wind project off New York was reversed in mid-May after negotiations between the Trump administration and state officials. With mounting energy demands from coastal urban areas and new data centers, offshore wind advocates still insist there can still be a future for U.S. offshore wind.

Meanwhile wind power opponents keep pressuring the Trump administration to do even more to foreclose on surviving projects.

In a Sept. 25 letter to Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth, Rep. Jeff Van Drew, R-NJ, argued that wind projects pose “long-term effects and impacts…on national security and the radar used for marine vessels and military and commercial aircraft.”

Van Drew singled out Equinor’s Empire Wind project, reportedly reprieved after Tump administration and New York State officials agreed to reconsider proposed natural gas pipeline links to supply Northeast states.

Interior Secretary “Doug Burgum and his team at the Department of Interior have already identified significant insufficiencies in several projects approved under the prior administrations,” Van Drew wrote.

He asserted “the prior administration also downplayed the threats to our national security posed by the large scale offshore wind industrialization including radar used for missile defense, air traffic, marine traffic, as well as sonar impacts from electromagnetic interference, the impact on training grounds off the northeast coast, and potential hazards posed by these structures during a time of conflict.""",https://s3.divcom.com/www.workboat.com/images/Atlantic shores crop.png.medium.800x800.png,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:31.461580

These investors aren’t just backing flashy data centers anymore. They’re going after local utilities that deliver power to everyday people and the massive servers running AI models like ChatGPT.

According to reporting from the Associated Press, billions of dollars from firms like Blackstone and BlackRock are now flowing into electric companies in New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin, and Minnesota.

These utilities supply power to more than 150 million people across millions of miles of power lines, and the profit potential is turning heads fast.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a finance professor at the University of North Carolina who studies private equity and hedge funds.

Greg said investors are now stacking up power plants, data centers, and energy services, all thanks to the surge in demand since the late 2022 launch of ChatGPT.

Blackstone targets utilities while Minnesota fight escalates

Blackstone is pushing regulators to approve its purchase of both Public Service Company of New Mexico and Texas New Mexico Power, based in Albuquerque and Lewisville. Wisconsin has already cleared the sale of Superior Water, Light and Power, and last year, Northern Indiana Public Service Company sold a 19.9% stake to Blackstone.

But in Minnesota, things are far messier. A major fight is unfolding over whether BlackRock, through one of its subsidiaries, can team up with the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board to take over Allete, the parent company of Minnesota Power. That utility provides electricity to 150,000 customers and runs a mix of coal, gas, wind, and solar power.

This isn’t just another transaction. Google might be building a data center in the area, and whoever controls Minnesota Power stands to make serious money from feeding power to it. The proposed $6.2 billion deal offers $67 per share, a 19% premium to Allete’s stockholders.

Allete claims this deal helps them hit Minnesota’s 2040 law requiring utilities to use 100% carbon-free power. They estimate needing $4.3 billion for grid and clean energy projects in the next five years. They also argue that BlackRock isn’t under short-term stock market pressure and can take a more “patient” approach.

Opposition slams deal as profit play on ratepayers

Not everyone’s on board. Critics say the whole thing is just a profit scheme. Karlee Weinmann, a policy advocate at the Energy and Policy Institute, said, “Private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice.”

Mark Ellis, a former utility exec turned consumer advocate, testified against the deal. Mark said he’s personally talked to private equity firms looking to jump into utility ownership. “It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” he said. He added these companies don’t come up for sale often, but when they do, they’re golden.

Utilities generate about 10% returns, not by selling power, but by spending money. The more they invest in substations, poles, and wires, the more they can charge customers under rules set by regulators. That’s where critics say the danger lies, the incentive is to overspend so investors can overcharge.

This fight over Minnesota Power mirrors battles in other parts of America, where people are pushing back against having data centers built near their homes. In this case, Gov. Tim Walz and building trades unions support the buyout.

But the Minnesota Attorney General’s office and large industrial power buyers (like U.S. Steel, Enbridge, and pulp and paper mills) are pushing against it. These industrial players use two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity.

In its filing, Allete insisted that BlackRock’s ownership wouldn’t change its operations or strategy, and promised the deal wouldn’t raise rates. But filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission show Allete already said it was “well positioned” to meet its funding needs without new owners.

Things got even worse for BlackRock in July, when Administrative Law Judge Megan McKenzie told regulators to block the deal. She said the record showed the buyers plan to do what private equity always does — “pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

With the 30% federal home solar tax credit set to expire at the end of this year, homeowners everywhere are showing mixed reactions. And, in the case of nearly 30% of our readers, a sense of urgency. Nearly four in ten (38.7%) of our solar survey responders said that they were “deeply concerned” about the credit ending, and moving up plans to install a home solar system before the credit is gone.

That response suggests the industry could see a meaningful surge of demand in the final quarter of the year as households look to lock in tax benefits while they still can.

Another 19.2% said they were aware of the credit, but it wasn’t a major factor in their solar plans one way or the other (if you’re curious, I fall into this second category).

Meanwhile, 16.4% of Electrek survey respondents admitted they had no idea there even was a 30% federal solar credit. That fact, while frustrating, serves to highlight the need for better public awareness around both clean energy incentives, and the potential benefits to adding solar power to your home.

Interesting, but does it matter?

That said, it’s important to consider the source here. Electrek readers tend to be more educated in general than the American public at large to begin with (check out our Partner Program page for some of that demographic data), and you’re certainly more educated and informed about things like EVs, home battery backups, and – of course – solar power.

The general public? The people who don’t read Electrek, don’t follow the cimate tech blogs, and generally have no idea what’s going on in the world of clean energy incentives? Getting rid of a tax credit they don’t even know exists may not move the market one way or the other. And, frankly, I don’t think it will.

What do you guys think? Is the march towards more universal home solar system deployment already too far along to stop, or do you think eliminating the tax incentive will turn off enough people to do the industry in for good? Head to the comments and let us know.

Kevin Rabinovitch, global VP of sustainability at Mars, said the agreement ""lets us bring demand for all the electricity used in our value chain to the clean energy market in a highly efficient manner.""","As demand for energy soars around the world, so does the pollution that comes from the burning of coal, oil, and gas. That is why it is so refreshing to hear large corporations are actively trying to use clean energy sources to reduce their carbon footprint.

With that in mind, the food and snack corporation Mars just signed a massive new energy deal with a company called Enel North America. According to Electrek, Mars has agreed to purchase all the energy produced by three large Texas solar farms. The amount of energy is equivalent to the power necessary for 150,000 homes annually.

Large-scale community solar farm projects like the ones involved in this Mars deal are great for everyone because they lower energy costs, provide more stability for the electrical grid, promote energy independence, and create new jobs. And they help provide a cleaner and cooler future for all because solar energy does not release toxic emissions into the atmosphere.

And this is only the latest good news on the solar front. A massive solar farm in Illinois called Double Black Diamond is set to provide 800 megawatts to the grid. And another large solar project developed in California will be able to power up to 14,000 homes.

Of course, for individuals, installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack because it can bring your monthly energy costs to at or near $0. And it is now easier than ever thanks to a company called EnergySage. It offers a free online tool that allows potential customers to compare quotes from vetted contractors. It can also save customers up to $10,000.

Another way for individuals to save energy and money with their solar panels is to install appliances such as heat pumps. Mitsubishi can help customers find the right, affordable heat pump to fit their needs.

The leaders behind the massive agreement were understandably excited about the future it offers.

Michele Di Murro, CEO of Enel North America, said, per Electrek, ""Through these agreements, we're adding clean capacity to the Texas grid while supporting a leading manufacturer's sustainability goals.""

Waaree Energies affirmed its US investment plans, including the Texas facility expansion and exploring US solar cell manufacturing, are unaffected by a US tariff evasion investigation. The company is cooperating with customs officials, asserting no material duty exposure or operational disruption. Waaree views the US as a strategic, high-growth market for continued clean energy investment.

A US investigation into potential solar tariff evasion will not impact Waaree Energies' investment plans, including the expansion of its Texas facility and exploration of setting up a solar cell manufacturing capability in the high-growth, strategic US market, the company said Sunday.

Waaree is one of the largest vertically integrated companies in the manufacturing of solar modules, which convert sun rays into electricity. It has an operational capacity of 13.3 GW in India.

It commenced operations at its US solar module manufacturing plant in Houston, Texas, in January this year with an initial installed capacity of 1.6 GW. The Texas facility is being scaled to 3.2GW by FY27.

US customs officials last week launched an investigation into whether Waaree bypassed tariffs on Chinese-made solar cells and panels by falsely labelling them as manufactured in India.

""The investigation has no impact on our investment plans. The Texas plant expansion from 1.6 GW to 3.2 GW is already underway,"" the firm said.

Live Events

""Our recent acquisition of US-based Meyer Burger assets further strengthens its long-term manufacturing footprint in the country. The United States is a high-growth, strategic market for Waaree, and it continues to invest in local jobs, technology, and capacity.""

""Waaree Energies will continue to operate with integrity, and we reaffirm our strong commitment to the US market - both as a clean energy partner and as a growing localised manufacturer,"" the firm said in a written Q&A to PTI.

The firm said it is providing all required information to the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP) in its ongoing inquiry.

""As a responsible corporate citizen, we have consistently complied with all applicable local laws and regulations,"" the company said.

""Our internal assessment indicates no material duty exposure, and we continue to engage transparently with CBP throughout this process.""

Importantly, there has been no operational disruption, and the US manufacturing operations and customer deliveries continue as planned.

""Based on our current assessment, we do not expect any material financial impact from this inquiry.""

The demand in the US solar market, it said, remains extremely strong and is growing rapidly, making it one of the most lucrative clean-energy markets globally.

""Our diversified global supply chain and our domestic US production provide natural insulation from geopolitical or policy shocks, ensuring business continuity.""

Asked about manufacturing solar cells as well in the US, Waaree said backward integration was a key strategic priority for the company.

""In India, we have already built significant solar cell manufacturing capability and are exploring similar opportunities in the United States,"" it said.

""We are evaluating options for US cell manufacturing in line with policy incentives and market demand, and any future investments will support our goal of becoming a holistic clean-energy transition company serving US customers end-to-end.""

Waaree Solar Americas primarily serves the US market through its Texas manufacturing facility, which currently operates at 1.6 GW with expansion underway to 3.2 GW, thereby reducing reliance on imports.

""Where imports are required, we maintain a diversified supply chain across multiple countries to avoid any single-source dependence, and all such imports strictly comply with US trade regulations, including AD/CVD rules and rules of origin. Our long-term strategy is to progressively localise more production within the United States to further reduce import needs, and detailed country-wise volumes are provided to regulators as required, though not disclosed publicly for competitive reasons.""

He said one of the programs that will expire on Dec. 31 incentivizes residents to invest in high-efficiency appliances.
Carsner said another program, which provides tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, will expire at the end of September.
Q: How can Iowans take advantage of these programs before they go away at the end of the year?
Q: With your role with the Iowa City Sierra Club, I'm curious, what has the Iowa City community said about this?","In his role with the Sierra Club’s Iowa City Chapter, Tom Carsner has spent a lot of time in recent months thinking and talking about the ways the federal government incentivizes energy efficiency.

Tax incentives intended to encourage Americans to invest in energy-efficient appliances and renewable energy, like solar panels, were part of the Inflation Reduction Act passed in 2022, under the Biden administration.

But the Big Beautiful Bill Act — which Carsner refers to as the “Big Bad Bill” — that was passed by Congress and signed by President Donald Trump this summer, rolls back those incentives. Many are scheduled to end Dec. 31.

As political director for the Sierra Club’s Iowa City Chapter — a position he’s held for eight years — Carsner has followed the legislation that will end these incentives. He said one of the programs that will expire on Dec. 31 incentivizes residents to invest in high-efficiency appliances.

The Home Electrification and Appliance Rebate program, or “HEARS,” provides rebates to low- and moderate-income households when they purchase high-efficiency electric appliances like heat pumps, electric stoves and dryers, as well as for electrical upgrades to their homes, like installing solar panels.

Carsner said another program, which provides tax credits for electric vehicle purchases, will expire at the end of September.

The Gazette spoke with Carsner about these programs and how they might affect the state and its residents.

This interview has been edited for brevity and clarity.

Q: How can Iowans take advantage of these programs before they go away at the end of the year?

A: It's just contacting your appliance dealer, whether it is for a heat pump or water heater, Iowans should contact their dealers directly. That hasn't changed; you have to contact a registered or qualified contractor to make an appointment and get set up with them.

Some things with solar panels are tightening up partially because you don't know what the weather is going to be. It may be slower in November and December to put them in since it is outdoors. But these other ones like an electric stove, a heat pump, water heater, and other things like that can be done year-round since it's not really weather dependent.

Q: What makes this program important, and what will the loss look like for Iowans when this program does cease at the end of the year?

A: Every wind turbine you see in the State of Iowa has been subsidized by taxpayers, to some degree, because those are all built with tax rebates. The problem is that it will make all of those attempts to build the utility-scale wind farms or solar farms that much more expensive for the companies putting them up. If it's more expensive for them, it's going to be more expensive for the utility as well. So, electric rates are bound to go up as well on that large utility scale basis.

There are all sorts of estimates that show many of the rebates are in the 30 percent range. It's not necessarily a one-to-one ratio but there's no doubt that having those large-scale rebate programs taken away, it will increase electric costs across the board for all people who use utilities, which is pretty much everybody.

Q: From your perspective, what makes programs like this such a partisan issue?

A: It's the fossil fuel industry. Many Republicans in today's world rely on fossil fuel campaign financing and when they vote to take away subsidies for non-fossil fuel or renewable energy type of programs, they are doing the bidding of the fossil fuel industry, so they get more campaign contributions. That's the real problem.

Now, they also turn a blind-eye to the fact that fossil fuel industries have, for a century, gotten tax credits, and tax favoritism through the Internal Revenue Service, but they conveniently ignore that. It's quite disingenuous for Republicans to vote for the “Big Bad Bill” that just passed, and then to still claim they support renewable energy. The two just don't go together.

Q: What will the direct impact of this look like for Iowa? Will it be more significant in Iowa, rather than other Midwest states or across the country?

A: Iowa is already producing over 60 percent from clean, renewable energy, which is mostly wind, with a little bit of solar. For the consumer, the real problem is that they will end up consuming more gas when it comes to heating and cooling their home, making electricity more expensive for the consumer.

But a secondary issue is every one of these solar panels, heat pumps or water heaters are distributed by a local appliance dealer. When the rebates go away, it's going to drive their sales down to some degree. It's hard to predict how much, but if you think of an appliance store in a medium-sized Iowa town, and it sounds good to be able to get a rebate on an efficient hot water heater, they'll buy it. But if rebates go away, they're going to be less inclined to purchase the new hot water heater that's more electrically efficient.

Q: With your role with the Iowa City Sierra Club, I'm curious, what has the Iowa City community said about this? What have you been hearing from the public?

A: I don't think you'd have to stretch very deep to find a solar panel company who would tell you there's a rush right now to finish projects before the end of the year. But I'm not sure how many people truly understand that this was part of the “Big, Bad Bill” of things going away at the end of the year. People might be surprised by this. When I talked to people about it, some were aware, and some were not.

Q: For those who are not as aware about this issue or this deadline that's coming up, what have you been recommending they do?

A: They should call their dealer as soon as they can because, especially solar panel installation, it is getting increasingly busy as the end of the year comes. Appliance dealers are probably the same. It's just a race to get a project started or get a contract signed at least by Dec. 31.

Q: Looking forward, are there opportunities for programs like these to come back for Iowans to use?

A: There's still uncertainty. There is a state version of some of these programs. The money is less, but there's still $120 million for a state-run program, where you can get it deducted immediately from your bill. I don't know how much it was or wasn't affected by the “Big, Bad Bill,” but it would soften the blow. It wasn't created to be a replacement by any means, but it would soften the blow somewhat.

The French state wants much more offshore wind by 2035 and 2050.","France awarded the Centre Manche 2 offshore wind tender to a team led by TotalEnergies with RWE. The wind farm will have 1.5 GW of capacity and sit more than 40 km off the Normandy coast. It’s now the country’s largest renewable energy project.

The power price is fixed by the tender at €66/MWh. Expected output is about 6 TWh each year, enough for over one million homes. The plan calls for a final investment decision by early 2029 and first power in 2033.

RWE Signals an Exit

RWE has said it wishes to exit the consortium after a strategic review. This step needs approval from French authorities. TotalEnergies plans to proceed as operator and may invite a new partner later.

Why This Project Matters

Scale: 1.5 GW, France’s largest offshore wind award so far.

Location: More than 40 km off Normandy, near Calvados.

Output: ~6 TWh/year, powering 1M+ homes.

Price: €66/MWh as set by the tender.

Timeline: FID by early 2029; generation from 2033.

Money, Jobs, and Local Plans

TotalEnergies says the project will require about €4.5 billion in investment. It’s the company’s largest investment in France in three decades. The firm plans to favor European suppliers, especially for turbines and cables.

Construction could employ up to 2,500 people over three years. Local factories and ports should see steady work. The operator also plans crowdfunding so residents and authorities can invest.

Community and nature funds are part of the plan. There’s a €10 million territorial fund for training, education, and culture. Another €45 million is for environmental measures, and €15 million for a biodiversity fund in Normandy.

At a Glance: Key Facts

Item Detail Capacity 1.5 GW Location > 40 km off Normandy Annual Output ~6 TWh Households Served 1M+ equivalent Tender Price €66/MWh Investment ~€4.5 billion Jobs Up to 2,500 during build FID / First Power Early 2029 / 2033 RWE Status Wishes to exit; approval needed

Company View and Strategy

TotalEnergies’ CEO called the award a major step in the firm’s shift to low-carbon power. The company says the project proves its long-term commitment to France. It also points to competitive prices for French customers after startup.

The French state wants much more offshore wind by 2035 and 2050. This award supports that plan and sends a clear signal to suppliers. The project also helps build a skilled workforce in Normandy.

What Comes Next

The operator will continue studies, permits, and supplier work. Grid timing is linked to the national plan, so design must stay aligned. A new partner could join once approvals are in place.

There’s still risk, of course. Offshore wind faces supply chain tightness and changing rates. But early planning, local sourcing, and fixed pricing can help. The project’s funds for nature and training also build community trust.

Quick List: What Readers Should Know

Biggest yet: Centre Manche 2 is France’s largest renewable project.

Set price: Power will sell at €66/MWh under the tender.

Local stake: Crowdfunding and a €10 million territorial fund are planned.

Nature focus: €45 million for environmental steps and €15 million for biodiversity.

Last year, China spent $12.6 billion on U.S. beans, but the number stands at zero dollars as of now due to tariff disagreements between the two countries. China has basically admitted to withholding purchases of U.S. soybeans as a tariff protest.Hopes for a tariff agreement were high after a recent U.S. — China TikTok accord, but no further deals come forth.

The American Soybean Association has called upon the current administration to resolve the tariff issues. Meanwhile the government will use other tariff dollars to ease losses sustained by the bean farmers. However, farmers are looking for long term solutions that will allow them to earn their incomes directly from crops. With bumper crops and few options to sell their harvest, farmers are running short on storage facilities to hold the corn and beans as bulls hope the Chinese will come to American markets by winter.

Late Week Copper Droppers

Global demand had kept copper prices up through Thursday. However, a decision to exempt the 50% tariff on the raw material, fears of recession, and a slowdown of Chinese factory work caused a sell-off late in the week. Copper’s use in electric vehicles as well as in AI infrastructure adds to its versatility.

Declining and unreliable mine supply along with increased production and mining costs have created the supply issue. Freeport McMoRan, the largest producer of the metal, has dropped Indonesian production by 35% due to mudslides in their mines. The company declared a force majeure contract situation, a clause that allows previous contract agreements to be broken due to natural causes such as fires and mining accidents.",https://www.cnhi.com/wp-content/themes/cnhi/images/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-28 09:59:48.851740

Powered by Emtribe, the event convened senior leaders from finance, policy, and technology to explore practical strategies for embedding ESG into business models.

""As a partner of CARE, we're proud to back a platform that focuses on what really matters — getting the right people in the room and driving honest, outcome-focused conversations,"" said Mohammed Saleem, Founder of Emtribe. ""There's a lot of talk in this space. CARE stands out by pushing for action that's practical, collaborative, and needed.""

Regional Energy Transformation

Across the MENA region, renewable energy adoption is accelerating. Installed solar capacity reached 24 GWAC in 2024 — a 25% year-on-year increase, with projections indicating a surge past 180 GW by 2030. Over the next five years, MENA is set to add 62 GW of new renewable capacity, with countries like the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Egypt investing heavily in solar, wind, and green hydrogen. Expanding renewable energy to 30% of the power mix could create up to 1.2 million jobs by 2050.

In Saudi Arabia, the energy transition is a cornerstone of Vision 2030, with over $266 billion committed to renewable energy and sustainable development. The Kingdom aims to achieve 50% renewable electricity by 2030, powered by giga-projects like NEOM, expansive solar parks, and pioneering green hydrogen initiatives. CARE KSA will unite innovators and stakeholders to accelerate projects, finance mechanisms, and climate-tech solutions aligned with this bold vision.

Over nine months into his second presidency, there is no sign that electricity prices will be lower anytime soon.
In fact, electricity prices have only risen, outpacing the rate of broader inflation.
For PJM Interconnection alone, wholesale electricity costs are set to jump by 22%.","Simultaneously, however, the Trump administration has stymied the development of solar and wind — some of the fastest energy sources to connect to the grid — and has yet to implement the reforms necessary to upgrade transmission to allow new power sources to supply homes, factories, and more.

Meanwhile, energy demand is only expected to grow.

Trump’s promise

Throughout his campaign, Trump vowed to cut the cost of energy and electricity for consumers dramatically.

“Under my administration, we will be slashing energy and electricity prices by half within 12 months, at a maximum 18 months,” he said during an August campaign rally in North Carolina.

“We’re going to get your energy prices down. We’re going to get your energy prices down by 50%,” Trump repeated in Pennsylvania just a few days later.

Over nine months into his second presidency, there is no sign that electricity prices will be lower anytime soon. In fact, electricity prices have only risen, outpacing the rate of broader inflation.

In the latest Consumer Price Index report released by the Bureau of Labor Statistics, electricity prices rose by 6.2% for the year ending in August. This is more than double the rate of inflation, which increased slightly to 2.9% for the year.

Brendan Pierpont, director of electricity modeling at climate and energy research firm Energy Innovation, told the Washington Examiner that this has resulted in some households spending 10% or more on their utility bills compared to this time last year.

While officials like Energy Secretary Chris Wright have affirmed the administration still hopes to bring these costs down, even some Republicans are not convinced they will be successful.

“I don’t see prices going down, hopefully, the increases can be slowed,” Steve Milloy, a senior legal fellow with the Energy and Environment Legal Institute and former Trump Environmental Protection Agency transition team member, told the Washington Examiner.

Milloy said he was confident that the Trump administration’s policies are still addressing the energy demand in the right way by focusing on extending coal and building out more natural gas. Like Trump, Milloy has blamed higher prices on the accelerated integration of renewables such as wind and solar.

“The system has been loaded up with all this green crap,” Milloy said. “Prices have been going up for some time because of all the green stuff. And you know … prices would have continued to — would have exploded with the demand and the failure of green to keep track of it to supply the power.”

What is driving higher prices?

The Trump administration has increasingly blamed renewable energy efforts for higher prices, but evidence suggests that the underlying cause of higher electricity prices is not that simple.

There are several factors driving costs, including the replacement and maintenance of transmission lines and their distribution infrastructure, Pierpont said. Utilities also face increased wildfire risk and more extreme weather, which require them to spend more money on risk mitigation. Plus, older legacy generation plants are experiencing rising costs related to maintenance and operation, he said.

“We at Energy Innovation took a look at the coal fleet in the U.S., and between 2021 and 2024, the average coal plant costs rose by 28%, outpacing the rate of inflation,” Pierpont said.

The growth in artificial intelligence and data centers, which are highly energy-intensive, has been linked to the rising energy demand. The Center for Strategic and International Studies forecasts that by 2030, AI data centers in the United States will consume nearly 84 gigawatts, compared to only 4 gigawatts consumed by data centers last year.

Grid operators have moved to significantly increase their capacity prices due to the growing need for power. For PJM Interconnection alone, wholesale electricity costs are set to jump by 22%. When the rates take effect in the summer of 2026, consumers in the PJM region are expected to see a 1.5% to 5% increase in energy bills.

That’s not to say renewable energy doesn’t play a role.

As many analysts point to the need for additional transmission infrastructure, critics have blasted utilities for failing to plan necessary upgrades and grid expansions properly.

Republicans have often accused utilities of prioritizing building new green energy projects instead of making these upgrades while removing traditional baseload energy, like coal, from the grid.

As these renewable projects have integrated more slowly into the grid than demand calls for, some suggest that this has forced grid operators and utilities to raise their prices.

“They don’t make any money from keeping a coal plant or an old coal plant or an old gas plant,” Milloy said. “They make money from a new wind farm or a new solar farm. So it’s that sort of corruption that has led to where we are now, which is, for electricity, skyrocketing prices.”

Who is to blame?

The Trump administration has repeatedly pointed fingers at former President Joe Biden and his administration for the electricity price hikes, blaming their accelerated phase-out of fossil fuels and focus on renewables.

At the same time, some energy experts dispute the idea that Trump has done much to lower costs.

“Whatever he promised, there’s no action in the direction of reducing electricity prices,” James Sweeney, emeritus professor of management science and engineering at Stanford University, told the Washington Examiner.

Sweeney argued that the administration’s efforts to boost fossil fuels, limit renewable energy, and impose sweeping tariffs have not contributed to lowering power costs.

He said that wind and solar power have been the primary sources of new electricity generation in recent years, were previously supported by federal subsidies, and often offered cheaper energy than traditional sources. However, he noted that the administration’s actions to restrict energy development have led utilities to pay more for green energy, which is now reflected in higher electricity prices.

Additionally, Trump’s tariffs on materials such as steel and aluminum, key components in energy infrastructure, have increased construction costs for various energy projects.

“I have not seen anything he’s done that would reduce electricity prices,” Sweeney said.

Frank Macchiarola, chief advocacy officer of American Clean Power, also told the Washington Examiner that it is important to examine the Biden administration’s policies aimed at restricting oil production.

Macchiarola explained that the Trump administration appears to be pursuing a similar strategy with renewable energy sources, the fastest-growing source of electricity in the U.S.

“It would only be natural that energy prices would increase at a time when the American consumer is facing inflation concerns about the economy, and this has exacerbated it,” he said.

“This is an administration that has really kind of stressed the importance of American energy dominance, and what we’ve seen from President Trump is American energy weakness,” Macchiarola added.

As electricity prices rise, Democrats have placed the blame on Republicans.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said earlier this week on a conference call at Climate Week that “Trump and Republicans are doing what the American people hate most, and that is raise costs.”

“You may remember the biggest issue they had against Biden is raising costs,” Schumer said. “They’re making it much worse, and the American people are realizing it.”

Where should the focus be?

Still, some experts caution against placing any blame too quickly, as the energy system is highly complex.

David Hill, executive vice president of the Bipartisan Policy Center’s Energy Program, explained that the federal government has limited influence over power prices and that the electricity system is “very complicated.”

“I would say to the policymakers who are trying to point fingers of blame: There’s a lot of blame to go around,” he told the Washington Examiner. “Instead of trying to figure out how the finger of blame can be pointed, it’s, ‘How do we actually address this going forward?'”

To curb electricity price hikes and meet growing energy demands, Hill said the U.S. needs to focus on utilizing energy from all sources and reform permitting to accelerate the construction of transmission infrastructure and new generation.

Passing permitting reform has become a top priority for both Democrats and Republicans in Congress, with discussions currently revolving around reforming lengthy environmental reviews.

Earlier this month, the House also passed legislation that would expedite the interconnection process for dispatchable and baseload energy projects, allowing traditional power sources to connect to the grid more quickly. This bill, known as the Guaranteeing Reliability through the Interconnection of Dispatchable Power Act, passed with bipartisan support and is now with the Senate for consideration.

ELECTRICITY PRICES ROSE FURTHER IN AUGUST AS TRUMP BLAMES RENEWABLES

Hill said the administration’s emphasis on energy reliability is essential, adding that Americans want an energy system that is “reliable, affordable, and clean.” This puts the country in a unique position to move forward in a bipartisan manner, he said.

“The fact that affordability and reliability are concerns right now do allow for some bipartisan agreement on some important changes that need to be made that help us meet the challenge,” he said.","https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image-collage-lxulk5m1r-1758916796616-e1758922777303.jpg?1758908372&resize=1024,683",N,,2025-09-28 07:59:25.018773

Opinion: How Western North Carolina can turn Helene disaster into opportunity Opinion: Who will care for our public lands?","As we mark the one-year anniversary of Helene, the images of floodwaters tearing through Western North Carolina are still vivid. Lives, homes, and livelihoods were lost. Roads and trails were washed out. Families were displaced. Yet what stays with me most is not only the devastation. It is what came after: the unmistakable truth that we are in this together.

Storms like Helene don’t just wash away roads and homes. They compromise every layer of community life: infrastructure, from bridges to water systems; economy, as businesses close and jobs disappear; health and safety, when hospitals are stretched and families face trauma; and communications, as power outages and downed networks leave people cut off. In those first days, it felt like the very systems we depend on had collapsed.

First responders worked around the clock to save lives. Nonprofits mobilized food, clothing, and emergency support. Conservation groups began the hard work of restoring rivers and repairing damaged landscapes. Volunteers cleared debris, ran supply lines, and checked on neighbors. Local governments stepped up with the tools they had. Every sector of our community did its part. The work was not perfect, but it was shared.

I saw a sign written by a child offering some of their stuffed animals to children who had lost theirs in the flood. That simple act of kindness said as much about recovery as any truckload of supplies. I remember churches opening as shelters and staging grounds. Volunteers carried food, water, and essentials into areas where roads had washed out, moving them by foot, mule, and ATV. That is what recovery looked like in real life.

Meanwhile, so much of the daily news seems determined to divide us. We are told that we are red or blue, rural or urban, us or them. But Helene told us a different story. When the waters rose, those lines blurred. Neighbors showed up with bottled water, hot meals, chainsaws, or simply their presence. Not once did anyone offering aid ask me about my politics, what god I worshiped, or whether I was a citizen. What mattered was that someone needed help, and someone else was there to give it. Volunteers came from around the country to stand with us. That too is community — people answering the call to care for one another in a time of need.

Helene also changed how we prepare. I still keep cases of bottled water and MREs stacked in my home. Others have stocked generators, radios, or emergency kits. But the most important preparation is not physical. It is relational. The real safety net is not only what is stored in our basements, but the strength of the connections we build with one another.

The question now is whether we will carry those lessons forward. We do not need to wait for another storm to practice the kind of community that got us through Helene. I joined volunteers for a day in Marshall as the town dug itself out. The effort was strategically organized, yet 100 percent citizen-led. That kind of initiative is what keeps communities alive. We can support the local businesses that reopen against the odds. We can strengthen the nonprofits that mobilize in every crisis, from food banks to conservation groups. And we can stay engaged with local governments that keep essential services running when everything feels uncertain. These choices matter. They strengthen the networks that will hold us together when the next storm comes, whatever form it takes.

In that sense, Helene is a metaphor for our larger moment. We are living through an era of change, uncertainty, and anxiety from climate disaster to economic strain to bitter polarization. The forces around us may try to pit neighbor against neighbor, but when the storms come, whether literal or figurative, we only have one another.

That may sound romantic to some. But the truth is practical: communities survive because we need one another. Alone, no household could have faced what Helene brought. Together, we found not just resilience, but abundance in compassion, shared labor, and the will to keep going.

At the end of the day, we do not just share roads and rivers. We share a future. And if Helene taught us anything, it is this: we are in this together, and we will need to lean into one another even more than before. Institutions may falter, but Helene showed us who we truly are: neighbors helping neighbors. That is the America I want to live in.

By 2030, the original equipment manufacturer will add a still-unnamed hybrid vehicle to production — the fourth car on its Ridgeville line.
“Many places in America are still not ready for full electric cars,” Samuelsson said.

Ten years after Volvo Cars launched its first North American manufacturing plant in Ridgeville, executives are working on an aggressive timeline to make the most of its $1.3 billion investment that has struggled to meet capacity.

The plant has an annual output of about 26,000 cars. But with the Sept. 23 announcement of an all-new hybrid vehicle to be made in the U.S. in 2030, the production line should finally hit the 150,000 vehicles a year it was built for.

Tariffs have accelerated the increased production plans,

CEO Håkan Samuelsson said while visiting stateside for Volvo’s 10-year anniversary celebration.

“To have faster deliveries, we need to build where we sell,” he said. Currently, cars imported to the U.S. from Sweden and the European Union face 15 percent tariffs.

By 2030, the original equipment manufacturer will add a still-unnamed hybrid vehicle to production — the fourth car on its Ridgeville line. The boost is expected to double its workforce to 4,000.

While few specifics have been confirmed about the hybrid under design in Sweden, Volvo has held clinics with American consumers to determine the present market needs. Samuelsson confirmed it will be a second-generation hybrid and “more of an electric car with a backup engine.”

First-generations are more derivative of a combustion car, he said, but the new vehicle will have “very fast acceleration,” be agile and quiet, and have an onboard charger.

“Many places in America are still not ready for full electric cars,” Samuelsson said. “Then this will be a very good solution.”

The future hybrid will accommodate the specific demands of the U.S. market, with its larger size with “room for big families and luggage and everything they bring along,” specific colors and even how it's marketed, Samuelsson said.

It will join Ridgeville's existing lineup that includes the fully electric Volvo EX90 SUV and the Polestar 3. In July, the company announced it would bring production of its XC60 to South Carolina from its plant in Gothenburg, Sweden. The midsize SUV is one of the manufacturer’s key U.S. products and is set to roll off the local assembly line in 2026.

Volvo sold more 27,000 XC60s in the U.S. between January and August 2025, an increase of almost 20 percent year over year.

With U.S. production, the vehicle should bring the Ridgeville plant to about 50-60 percent capacity, while the new hybrid will take it to 100 percent within the next decade, said Francesca Gamboni, chief industrial operations officer of Volvo Cars.

“This plant should be used for production for the American customers, which means bringing the cars that are closer, that are more adapt, suited for the American customers, and then build them locally,” Gamboni said.

She joined Samuelsson at the Ridgeville event, along with Luis Rezende, president of Americas for Volvo; David Stenstrom, vice president of manufacturing for the U.S.; and Sweden’s ambassador to the U.S., Urban Ahlin. Gov. Henry McMaster and U.S. Rep. Nancy Mace, R-Charleston, also attended.

While Volvo’s goal has been to go fully electric by 2040, the U.S. still lacks infrastructure, incentives and affordable options that encourage people to buy EVs.

The Biden administration had previously set ambitious goals for automakers to electrify more of their fleets and reduce emissions by 2032, but current leaders have pushed back of late.

Aiko Toyoda, the chairman for Toyota and former CEO for 13 years, told Forbes last year that customers, not regulations or politics, should drive production and that battery electric vehicles will most likely never gain majority market sales, “no matter how much progress the BEVs make.”

President Donald Trump has further voiced skepticism of EVs, including at a 2023 rally when he criticized, “They don’t go far. They cost a fortune.”

Ramping up more jobs in Ridgeville

With increased production in the U.S., Gamboni wants to localize the majority of Volvo’s suppliers to make the plant “more resilient” and “quicker to respond to the demand.”

“We have done a good job with it on the EX90, I think so far,” she said. “We have 60 percent … of suppliers who are in the Americas and 11 percent within the state of South Carolina.”

With the expansion news Sept. 23, Volvo’s stock trading in Sweden jumped over 3 percent.

Volvo also operates three auto production plants in China, as well as one in Belgium.

Here in South Carolina, the carmaker employs a staff of 2,000 with plans to grow to 4,000 with the increased output of the XC90 and the on-deck hybrid.

Stenstrom said ReadySC, the workforce training arm of Trident Technical College, has been instrumental to helping fill those roles in the last 10 years and the company will look to them again.

Kelly Steinhilper, vice president of communications with the SC Technical College System, said as of now, they haven’t been asked to support the future ramp-up.

Starting salaries begin at $23 an hour with raises every six months based on hourly output, staff said.

Gamboni reiterated the jobs would not be automated. Currently, any robotics are “complementary” to support human output and make jobs more efficient.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/postandcourier.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/0/8e/08ebb4f0-0435-4e20-8231-af6c8fe25096/68d2f9c090f90.image.jpg?crop=1768%2C928%2C0%2C0&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-09-28 10:59:55.118236

The study, titled “Reshoring Solar Module Manufacturing to Europe,” provides a detailed cost gap analysis and policy impact simulation, offering strategies to accelerate domestic solar manufacturing while building a resilient and innovative solar industry.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO of SolarPower Europe, emphasized that Europe has the potential to deliver up to 30 gigawatts of solar manufacturing by 2030, creating thousands of local jobs and retaining economic value within the region. She stressed the need for urgent action from the EU and its Member States, warning that without targeted policy interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar manufacturing.

The report shows that producing a solar module in Europe using EU-made solar cells currently costs around 10.3 €ct/Wp more than producing the same module in China. This cost difference is driven by higher expenses in equipment, building and facilities, labor, and materials, with labor costs alone being 280 percent higher in Europe. For utility-scale solar installations, the total cost amounts to approximately 60.8 €ct/Wp for European-made modules, compared to 50.0 €ct/Wp for Chinese modules, resulting in a Levelised Cost of Electricity that is 14.5 percent higher for European production.

Despite these higher costs, European-made modules already fall within the 15 percent additional cost limit set under the Net-Zero Industry Act auction rules, suggesting that competitiveness is achievable with the right support. However, the report also identifies a cost difference of 2.2 to 5.8 €ct/Wp between NZIA-compliant EU-made and non-EU-made modules. While the NZIA’s resilience criteria can help diversify module supply chains and boost imports from other regions, reshoring production to Europe will require additional policy measures.

The analysis suggests that combining CAPEX and OPEX support for both manufacturers and project developers, along with output-based incentives similar to those used in the United States and India, could reduce the cost gap to below 10 percent, especially if solar factories reach 3–5 GW capacity. The report estimates that achieving the 30 GW target for European solar manufacturing by 2030 would require annual industry support of between €1.4 billion and €5.2 billion. Up to 39 percent of these costs could be recovered through macroeconomic benefits, including the creation of 2,700 jobs and up to €66.4 million in annual tax and social contributions per gigawatt-peak of installed capacity.

The report recommends establishing an EU-level output-based support scheme for solar manufacturing, combining grants, loans, and de-risking instruments to cover both CAPEX and OPEX. It also calls for the implementation of NZIA policy schemes across Member States, including “Made-in-EU” bonus points in rooftop support programs and public procurement initiatives. The Net-Zero Industry Act, adopted in June 2024 with secondary legislation in May 2025, sets out rules for Member States on incorporating non-price criteria in renewable energy auctions. Under the act, at least 30 percent of auctioned volumes, or six gigawatts annually, must apply non-price criteria, which account for 15 to 30 percent of overall evaluation metrics.

Resilience under Article 26 is defined as sourcing from non-dominant suppliers, and Member States are required to implement these provisions from January 2026 onward. The act provides a historic opportunity for reshoring clean technology manufacturing in Europe, but its success will depend on how effectively Member States apply the non-price criteria in their auctions. The report concludes that with targeted policy support, Europe can successfully build a competitive solar manufacturing sector, enhance supply chain resilience, retain economic value domestically, and contribute significantly to the region’s broader climate and energy transition goals.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/4-3.png,N,,2025-09-28 05:58:49.338055

But at salvage auctions across Australia, a new type of buyer is emerging, and they are interested in one thing: the high-powered batteries inside electric vehicles.

The demand for secondhand EV batteries is surging, with buyers repurposing them for everything from solar storage units to off-grid energy systems that can replace diesel generators.

Brendon Green, the general manager of automotive solutions at Pickles, says the auction house is selling about 100 salvaged EVs every month, and interest is surging.

“It’s only very early days, but they are certainly in strong demand,” says Green.

“We’ve got this new element of second-life battery startups. That industry really didn’t exist 18 months ago.”

Battery hunters

Salvage auction houses started regularly seeing salvage EVs in early 2024, most of which were Teslas, the first mass market electric vehicle on Australian roads.

Battery hunters are now also seeing alternatives, such as BYDs and MGs, in line with the growing number of different makes on the market. Many of the wrecked vehicles are two-to-three years old, and include a mix of complete write-offs and those that are repairable.

The appeal for EV batteries is obvious, given they are about five times as powerful as a typical home energy storage unit.

Andrew Chadwick, a lithium battery repair specialist, says even ageing EV batteries have plenty of life in them for other purposes.

“The output requirements for a solar battery are a lot less than what you need for an electric vehicle,” says Chadwick, from Second Life Battery Sales.

“Even if they are no longer good for an electric vehicle, with a little finessing, they’re perfect for a solar system.”

Consider an EV battery that is down to 70% capacity. While this will considerably reduce the range of the vehicle, making the car undesirable, it still holds plenty of charge for less-intensive uses.

You could even put a trailer load of second-hand EV batteries together, and power an entire music festival.

A music event in Queensland’s Sunshine Coast was postponed in June over council concerns its power usage would disrupt nearby businesses. The punk and indie-alternative festival went ahead in early September, powered by repurposed EV batteries.

“Our trailers powered the whole event for the day, including speakers, food trucks, everything, and had plenty of power left over,” says John Myler, co-founder of MyNu Energy.

“People really like them as an alternative to a diesel generator. If you’ve got sound equipment or food trucks, having a noisy, smelly diesel generator probably isn’t the atmosphere you’re looking for, whereas these batteries are silent, pollution free, and hold huge amounts of power.”

After the event, the trailers were recharged using solar, ready for their next deployment.

Life extension

At Pickles auctions, the demand for EV batteries is evident.

Financial year sales of salvage EVs increased 200% over the prior year, with the wrecked vehicles now boasting much higher price tags than combustion engine cars.

Buyers know that EVs contain some of the world’s most advanced battery technology, ready to be deployed.

About one in 10 new car sales in Australia are battery-powered, with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 and the BYD Seal and Atto the most popular models in 2024, according to the EV Council.

After a comparably slow roll out in Australia marked by political headwinds, motoring experts believe EV sales will surge as prices become more competitive and charging infrastructure catches up.

Currently, many batteries are shredded, with the material then separated into components ready to be rebuilt into new batteries, with the process often including multiple facilities in different countries.

A repurposed battery can reduce this process, with some second-hand buyers believing they can get about 20 years of usage from them.

Myler says repurposed EV batteries are part of the solution to Australia’s intensifying energy needs.

“We need a huge amount of short term energy storage to help us transition to sustainable energy solutions,” he says.

“As a country, we need every bit of storage we can get our hands on.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/8ca30e0a113e6b14984e1c8ca49a5919bc681343/338_0_4551_3640/master/4551.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=5726f1cd121240f0d12d34d2028cacab",N,,2025-09-28 05:59:08.665348

Leaving the tight-knit community his family had called home for five generations along the Louisiana coast was one of the hardest things Chris Brunet has had to do.

But three years ago, he felt he had no other choice.

The Gulf of Mexico’s swelling waters were gradually consuming Isle de Jean Charles—the narrow strip of land in Terrebonne Parish that has been the homeland for the Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians since the 1830s.

“This is where I was awakened to my Native American identity,” Brunet says on a sticky late afternoon in August as he sits in his wheelchair, gazing upon the tattered remains of his family’s island home. “I would want to be here if I had any choice in the world.”

In 2016, Louisiana received $48.3 million in federal Community Development Block Grant money to relocate 37 residents or families of Isle de Jean Charles as climate-charged hurricanes and sea-level rise made the once thriving fishing community uninhabitable. The plan was the first relocation of an entire community that was fully funded by the federal government.

The island used to encompass more than 22,000 acres but has shrunk to about 320 acres due to erosion, land loss caused by severe storms, manmade canals and sea level rise spurred by climate change.

Isle de Jean Charles is a shell of a place once filled with life. The remaining strip is now dotted with the dilapidated homes of those who fled; a few properties are used as recreational camps by their owners.

Brunet says it’s hard to watch his beloved Louisiana coast wash away.

“I never expected that relocation was going to happen in my lifetime,” Brunet said. “Now that I see that it has happened, it’s not a celebration.”

This new chapter for former island residents is no fairy tale. They say their new homes are substandard, with rainwater seeping through doorways, malfunctioning appliances and flooded yards causing costly repairs.

“I just wish they would have given themselves a little bit more time to try to prevent so many of the issues that we had over here,” Brunet said. “Some things that immediately just broke down right away—whether it be electrical, whether it be plumbing, whether it be exterior, interior.”

And ironically, their new community—dubbed New Isle—could literally become an island surrounded by water if predictions of accelerating coastal land loss and inland flooding come to pass.

What was supposed to be a model for how the government could get people out of harm’s way along the country’s steadily eroding coastlines has instead become a cautionary tale for the estimated 2.5 million Americans who could be forced to relocate away from the coast over the next 25 years.

Louisiana is the state projected to have the most land impacted by coastal flooding caused by rising sea levels and severe storms in the United States. But leaders there have rejected a controversial nearly $3 billion plan—paid primarily by BP to compensate for a massive 2010 oil spill—designed to shore up the coastline.

And Louisiana has no further plans to help residents and businesses move away as rising water, hurricanes, storm surges and flooding eat away at the land underneath them.

In fact, the U.S. Government Accountability Office found the United States has no national strategy for relocating coastal communities from harm’s way—and “limited” funds to do so.

Some of that money is being targeted for elimination by the Trump administration, which is seeking to defund the Building Resilient Infrastructure and Communities program, which has provided $4.5 billion to mitigate harm from natural disasters and climate change. Trump also has cut about 10 percent of the Federal Emergency Management Agency staff, arguing states should be in charge of their own disaster relief.

In Alaska, more than 30 indigenous villages face imminent relocation due to flooding, land erosion, permafrost thaw or combinations of all the above because of climate change. But thus far, only one village, Newtok, has made successful strides in that direction—and even that took nearly two decades and about $60 million in federal funds.

Relocation Causes Rift

Brunet and the other 37 residents living on the island packed up their lives to move to a new community in Gray, Louisiana, 9 miles north of Houma and 40 miles north of their old homes. They are now dealing with substandard housing, and they accuse state leaders of ignoring their input in a rushed attempt to build their new community.

“It made us angry,” said Chief Deme Naquin, the leader of Jean Charles Choctaw Nation. “We thought we were going to have a community and we were going to be able to own and run it as a tribe. Once that (money) was awarded, then we were pretty much pushed away.”

It was Naquin’s uncle who devised the original plan, seeing it as a way to reunite the tribe in a safer community after some had already fled the storm-ravaged island. But after the chief of another tribe, Citizens of the United Houma Nation, learned of the relocation funding, he lobbied for his members living on the island to be included.

The conflict led state officials to determine that any residents still living on Isle de Jean Charles or those whose homes had been disrupted by a 2012 hurricane would be eligible to relocate. That ended the original intent of the relocation and sparked a rift between the Choctaw Nation and the state.

Mathew Sanders was the point person for Louisiana’s Office of Community Development on the relocation. He says island residents had a “significant voice” in the process, but the state had to balance individuals’ goals with those of the tribal leaders.

“One of the things that we heard very early on in the project from the residents was that they didn’t really want either of the tribes to represent their interests,” Sanders said. “We wanted to do what the community was telling us they wanted to do. So, I would push back on the notion from either tribe saying they didn’t have a say.”

But looking back, he acknowledges that Louisiana officials—despite their experience with coastal planning and gauging flood risk—“were not prepared to really take on this type of effort.” In fact, no other state had ever attempted such a move, notes Sanders, who now works on disaster planning at the nonprofit Pew Charitable Trusts.

Marvin McGraw, spokesman for state’s OCD, wouldn’t say whether the agency considers the relocation a success. He said in a prepared statement that honoring the wishes and needs of “Old Isle” residents was the highest priority but “stakeholder wishes did not always align with federal laws and regulations governing the use of funds.”

McGraw pointed out that the Isle de Jean Charles relocation project was designed to relocate the community, not just certain tribal members.

“While most residents are Native American, some identify with one tribe, others with multiple tribes, and some with no tribal affiliation,” he wrote. “Federal guidelines prohibit determining eligibility for housing in the new community based on tribal affiliation.”

Louisiana: Leader in Severe Flood Risk

Louisiana tops an analysis by the nonprofit Climate Central when it comes to the amount of land projected to experience severe coastal flooding—approximately 9,200 square miles—over the next 25 years.

Those projections, released in April, were based on the assumption that the United States will honor its greenhouse gas emission goals. That means the outcome could be worse given the Trump administration’s systematic kneecapping of the climate-focused initiatives of the previous administration.

Louisiana’s coast contains 40 percent of the nation’s wetlands, which serve as an important protective barrier from severe storms.

For the past 20 years, Louisiana’s Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority (CPRA) has led the state’s efforts to address its shrinking coastline through a master plan the agency updates every six years. That plan is essentially an unfunded wishlist of projects and science-backed initiatives designed to reduce rapid coastal land loss.

But in July, the agency cancelled the Mid-Barataria Sediment Diversion project, the nearly $3 billion centerpiece of the effort. Officials said the controversial project had become too costly and was stalled by permitting issues and ongoing litigation. The project also faced criticism from Republican Gov. Jeff Landry, who said it would negatively impact the coastline instead of helping it.

The project broke ground in 2023. It was designed to reintroduce freshwater and sediment from the Mississippi River into the basin, rebuilding up to 30,000 acres of coastal wetlands over 50 years. It was funded by the $8 billion-plus settlement Louisiana got from oil giant BP following the 2010 Deepwater Horizon oil spill.

Advocates with Restore the Mississippi River Delta, a coalition of national and local conservation groups, said the state was “throwing away more than $618 million” that had already been spent on the project.

Gordon “Gordy” Dove, chair of the CPRA, said the state will honor its “commitment to coastal restoration” by investing in a less costly and smaller sediment diversion project in the same area.

But Emily Guidry Schatzel, spokeswoman for Restore the Mississippi River Delta and the National Wildlife Federation’s Gulf Restoration Program, called that project “outdated.” She noted the CPRA had discarded it from earlier master plans because it “failed to meet science-backed benchmarks” and couldn’t “deliver the scale or speed of land-building required to keep up with the coast’s rapid collapse.”

CPRA acknowledges the need for flood mitigation to protect businesses and people living along the coast, suggesting an organized retreat from the shoreline would be needed. But the agency says any such actions should be left to “community members and their local elected officials.”

Owners Report Leaking Doors, Broken Appliances

The original plan for The New Isle settlement included more than 100 homes, walking trails, a community center, commercial and retail development and other amenities.

“We knew the money that was awarded wasn’t going to be enough,” Naquin said about the relocation project. “But we had opportunities for more funding.”

According to the OCD, the homes in New Isle would be energy efficient, able to withstand 150 mile-per-hour winds, have insulation in the walls, ceiling and under floors; certified energy-efficient appliances and compliance with the Americans with Disabilities Act.

Brunet grew up loving the marsh, the sound of boats slicing through swamp waters, the quiet stillness and wildlife encounters that came with living along the coast. He knew living in the suburbs would bring unforeseen challenges.

One thing he didn’t anticipate was their new homes breaking down.

Brunet’s neighbor, Kristi Naquin, says the handles on her front door leak from rainwater. During strong downpours and hurricanes, they put down towels to keep the water out. The shower also leaks onto the floor, she said. And the dishwasher and air conditioner have malfunctioned.

And Naquin says it feels like the house is leaning and there’s no insulation. She and her husband, Simon, Chief Deme Naquin’s brother, have had to pay for repairs.

“I’m honestly pissed,” Naquin said. “We should not have this many complaints. We should not have this many problems. It should have been (built) better than what it was.”

She added: “To come to a house that is falling apart, and we got no help, no help at all. They just washed their hands of us.”

Sanders had already left his position with the Louisiana development agency by the time construction began. But he says there was a sense of urgency to get New Isle developed because the state had a deadline of 2021 to use the federal money or risk losing it.

“You know, that’s a very short timeline to build out a 500-acre development,” he said, noting the COVID-19 pandemic slowed construction. “I mean, that’s almost impossible.”

In response to the complaints about the quality of the homes in New Isle, McGraw says all items that were under warranty were timely handled by the building contractors. After the warranty period on items had expired, he said, “responsibility for repairs shifted to the residents.”

Community-Driven Relocation Touted

University of New Orleans urban planning Professor Marla Nelson and Traci Birch, director of the Coastal Ecosystem Design Studio at Louisiana State University, recently wrote about the pitfalls of relocation initiatives in that state. The best approach, they say, is to deeply involve the people who need to move away from the coast.

“It’s about the individuals and communities coming to the decision that, ‘Hey, you know, this isn’t viable to live here anymore,’ and what can be done to help expand people’s options,” Nelson said. “How do we empower individuals and communities who want to move, or need to move, to move?”

Renia Ehrenfeucht, professor of community and regional planning at the University of New Mexico, was a co-author on the piece. In 2018 and 2019, the three interviewed nearly 60 former residents who lived on the Louisiana coast and more than two dozen coastal planning professionals to understand the factors contributing to household decisions about relocating or adapting to sea level rise.

They concluded that even though residents living along the Gulf Coast recognized the need to relocate, the loss of historical ties, family bonds and cultural connections made them hesitant to leave. Local elected officials perceived the loss of tax revenue from property buyouts as “politically unacceptable.” And without funding or policies to relocate entire communities, many people decided to “focus on today’s problems” instead of the “problems of the future.”

Although Louisiana officials have no specific relocation plans for coastal residents, they have developed strategies, dubbed Louisiana’s Strategic Adaptations for Future Environments (LA SAFE), for moving away from the shifting shoreline:

Unless there is a “clear and present risk to life,” all relocation initiatives must be community-driven and voluntary.

If possible, resettled communities should retain access to abandoned lands for cultural, social or economic reasons.

All relocation efforts must lead to a demonstrable reduction in risk.

All resettlements should entail total residential abandonment of the original community.

While that state has acknowledged the need for relocation since 2005, the researchers wrote that no agency in Louisiana has developed the funding or infrastructure to do so.

“True management would mean we’re thinking through the process from beginning to end,” Birch said. “There’s kind of ‘Do nothing.’ And then on the other end of the spectrum is, ‘We’re going to move everybody all at once.’ But the reality is, most of life happens somewhere in the middle.”

“This Conversation Is Hardly Happening”

Cultural anthropologist Maida Owens along with Shana Walton, coordinator of the Bayou Culture Collaborative, have spent the past few years leading workshops discussing environmental adaptation, climate migration and relocation planning.

When asked if cities are ready for the shifts in population that climate-driven relocation will cause, Owens replied, “The simple answer is ‘no.’ ”

“It’s hard to get people to prepare for storms and hurricanes. It’s even harder for them to think about all this,” Owens said. “It’s hard because our brain is ‘Get fed today.’ I need food for today, and I’ll worry about tomorrow, tomorrow. And that’s just as true for government officials.”

Owens, a Baton Rouge native, grew up enduring major hurricanes. But it was rain and floods in 2016 and 2017 that sent Owens and Walton into the climate preparation business. Owens said it was the flooding in 2016 that swamped most of the Baton Rouge metro area and damaged or destroyed over 100,000 homes.

For Walton, “What really tipped my boat was a heavy precipitation event in 2017 where I watched my car float away down the street in New Orleans … and this is just rain!”

Now they run relocation workshops aimed at the public and state and local officials.

There are many challenges government leaders need to consider: Is their infrastructure sufficient to withstand climate impacts? Is there housing for relocatees? Are there jobs for the people once they arrive?

“It just gets immensely complicated, really quickly,” Owens said. “Within (Louisiana) state government, this conversation is hardly happening.”

At the federal level, then-President Joe Biden’s administration tried to start the conversation about a national relocation effort. It published two reports identifying next steps federal agencies could take toward community-driven relocation and existing federal resources to get started.

But all traces of those reports were scrubbed shortly after Trump took office.

Floodlight made multiple inquiries to the federal Office of Community Development about those reports and the question of coastal relocation but never received a response.

“I think states and local governments need to lean in on the idea that they’re going to have to be engaged in relocation activities before they think they need to,” said Sanders, formerly of the Louisiana Office of Community Development. “They need to really take this seriously before it becomes a dire sort of emergent situation like it was in Isle de Jean Charles.”

High Insurance Costs Driving Coastal Retreat

And even if the water is not wiping out homeowners—yet—the cost of insurance might be.

U.S. Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, said sharply rising property insurance premiums caused by climate-fueled disasters are already prompting people to move away from the coasts. And the cost of insuring homes there is convincing the companies themselves to pull out.

“(Insurance companies) are a pretty good witness of what’s coming at us and they’re saying, ‘Hey, coastal areas, wildfire adjacent areas, we’re outta here’,” Whitehouse told reporters in July during an interview hosted by Covering Climate Now.

Whitehouse, one of the loudest voices on Capitol Hill when it comes to climate change-related issues, says historically when coastal areas were hit by hurricanes and floods, the federal government would swoop in to help people rebuild. But that doesn’t mean they can—or should—stay.

“The fact that it’s going to continue to happen and continue to get worse and worse and worse, this isn’t like a one off thing where you come in and rebuild the house and everything’s back to normal,” Whitehouse said. “This is a continually degrading situation.”

Scientist Joshua Elliot argues the federal government must step in to subsidize insurance programs tied to flooding if they want coastal areas to remain habitable.

“At what point does the cost of inaction then become so great that it overcomes the political will for inaction?” said Elliot, chief scientist for Renaissance Philanthropy, a nonprofit that works on climate mitigation, including “advanced research for climate emergencies.”

“There are things that can be done,” Elliot said. “And there are things that are being done. Although, we need to do a whole lot more if we actually want to get ahead of this problem and not end up instead in the position of having to play catch up when it’s too late.”

Bolstering Wright’s argument is the fact that – despite its recent growth spurt – solar power generates less than 3% of global energy, according to Energy Department data.
“One of the big problems with solar and wind is they only produce electricity,” Wright said.
Solar power could approach that milestone as soon as 2050, according to the Energy Department’s latest International Energy Outlook report.
Free-market conservatives have cheered Trump’s moves to roll back Biden-era subsidies for solar power.","The Trump administration has a dim view of the sun.

Solar panels provided most of the electricity capacity added to the U.S. power grid last year, and they will account for most new power built in America for the rest of President Donald Trump’s term, according to Energy Department data. But Trump and his Cabinet secretaries have argued this form of energy is so unreliable and expensive that it’s unlikely to play an important role in powering the world.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright has said solar panels are “just a parasite” on the grid that couldn’t power the planet even if they blanketed the entire surface of the Earth. The Energy Department’s X account – which once cheered solar projects during the Biden administration – now says solar panels are “essentially worthless when it is dark outside.”

In a speech to the U.N. on Tuesday, Trump told world leaders “the high cost of so-called green renewable energy is destroying a large part of the free world and a large part of our planet.”

The administration has used these arguments to justify policies that slow solar development while promoting fossil fuels – particularly natural gas, the industry where Wright made his fortune before becoming energy secretary. In an interview with the Washington Post, Wright stood by his criticism of solar power and his prediction that it would always play a minor role in global energy.

“If solar continued to grow at its current (rate) it could theoretically catch up to gas, but I don’t think that’s likely,” Wright said.

Bolstering Wright’s argument is the fact that – despite its recent growth spurt – solar power generates less than 3% of global energy, according to Energy Department data. The vast majority of the global economy runs on oil, gas and coal.

Switching to solar isn’t as simple as replacing fossil fuel power plants with solar farms, either: Roughly 80% of global energy consumption comes from cars, trucks, planes, ships, factories and furnaces that directly burn fossil fuels. They aren’t designed to run on electricity, so they’d have to be replaced with electric versions or burn expensive fuels made using electricity.

“One of the big problems with solar and wind is they only produce electricity,” Wright said. “We’ve been talking about ‘electrify everything’ for a while. Today, 15% of energy in manufacturing comes from electricity, same as it was 25 years ago.”

Despite the long-term challenges of powering the world with renewable electricity, many countries are investing in generating more electricity from solar and wind, which don’t cause as much planet-warming pollution and are often cheaper than fossil fuels. In the meantime, electric vehicle sales have surged in China and Europe, and electric heat pumps have started to replace fuel-burning furnaces. Both trends have gradually raised the share of global energy that comes from electricity.

“One hundred fifty years ago, zero percent of our energy consumption was coming from electricity, roughly,” said Josiah Neeley, a senior fellow at the R Street Institute, a center-right think tank. “A lot of [energy] consumption that isn’t electricity-based right now could move over to being electricity-based.”

The Trump administration’s solar policy makes the United States “an outlier” among world governments, according to Robert Stavins, a professor of energy and economic development at Harvard University.

“The European Union is going forward. China is going forward. India has not changed its position. Brazil is moving forward. So, the U.S. is really an exception,” Stavins said.

The Trump administration’s solar stance also puts it at odds with some right-leaning think tanks and political figures within the U.S., including Elon Musk, the former head of the U.S. DOGE Service, who posted on X, “Solar power is so obviously the future for anyone who can do elementary math.”

In a chippy exchange with the libertarian-leaning venture capitalists who host the “All-In” podcast, Wright said Musk “has a wildly exaggerated view of where solar and batteries will go.”

“If we could make a bet 50 years out, I’ll make a bet solar never gets to 10 percent of global energy,” Wright said.

Solar power could approach that milestone as soon as 2050, according to the Energy Department’s latest International Energy Outlook report.

When the report was released in 2023, the department estimated the world was on track to get about 8 percent of its energy from solar power by mid-century – potentially as high as 10 percent if costs keep falling or as low as 6 percent if the technology does not get cheaper. But the modelers wrote that big, unforeseen energy policy changes could “dramatically shift the course of energy system development.”

Two years later, Trump took office and wound down tax credits for solar power, restricted solar development on federal land and raised tariffs to block imports from China and other big solar manufacturers in Southeast Asia.

Solar installations in the U.S. may be 18 percent lower over the next five years in response to Trump administration policies, according to a September analysis from the energy research firm Wood Mackenzie.

Free-market conservatives have cheered Trump’s moves to roll back Biden-era subsidies for solar power.

“I agree with the Trump’s stance on solar, which is to repeal subsidies for solar so that energy sources can have a fair, level playing field,” said Austin Gae, a research associate at the Heritage Foundation’s Center for Energy, Climate, and Environment.

They’ve been less thrilled with his vow to block permits for solar projects.

“If Secretary Wright has confidence that fossil or thermal is the answer and that solar power is not going to succeed, then you don’t have to try and support fossil and place restrictions on solar,” said Neeley, the R Street Institute fellow. “Just let them compete and that’s what will happen.”

But Travis Fisher, director of energy and environmental policy studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, argued that the Trump administration’s meddling in the energy market is a mirror image of the Biden administration’s moves to block fossil fuel projects.

“The pearl clutching has been ironic to me because it’s like, ‘Hey guys, this has been the ballgame from the left for decades now,’” Fisher said. “So, the fact that it’s now the ballgame from the right – I’m not wild about it, but there’s a sense of irony that comes with it.”

Energy experts, meanwhile, say Trump’s policies are kneecapping the fastest-growing source of electricity in a country that is running out of power.

“What they’re doing right now is making it much, much, much harder than necessary to build economically competitive wind and solar resources across the U.S., while going out and saying all kinds of things in public that just aren’t true about them,” said Jesse Jenkins, an energy systems engineer at Princeton University.

Even without government support, most experts think solar will continue to grow.

“I think it’ll find its place, and it’s probably going to be less than the solar maximalist bros are talking about, and it’s probably going to be more than Trump is talking about,” Fisher said. “But the only way to know for sure is to see where it lands in the market.”

STATE HOUSE and BEYOND

Only about two weeks into the Trump administration, House Speaker Ron Mariano declared in February that Massachusetts had ""lost our federal partner."" That was long before July's final passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill, the landmark law that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans believe will put the nation on a path of progress and prosperity. Local analysts have a dimmer view, asserting that the law will set back social welfare programs and health care efforts that were carefully cultivated over many years by draining a range of federal supports, including clean energy incentives, that are central to the state economy. Now, as the calendar turns to October, there's a possibility that the federal government may shut down due to the inability of Republicans and Democrats in Washington to find common ground on spending plans. State finance officials this week called on executive branch agencies to consider contingency plans and ways to protect residents and meet payrolls if a shutdown occurs on Wednesday. The shutdown threat comes as executive and legislative branch leaders hold an invite-only public session Tuesday to discuss the economy and shifting federal policies. A report is due by week's end on potentially pivotal September tax collections. And inside the Healey administration, the governor still doesn't have an official answer from the Legislature about her request for expanded budget cutting authority, should she need to exercise it. Calculations within the Executive Office for Administration and Finance must also consider the import of Oct. 15, the statutory deadline for the executive branch to deliver any recalibration of available budgeted revenues, taking into account tax collections, probable economic growth, anticipated federal fund receipts, and expected growth in wages and salaries.

PUBLIC HEALTH COMMITTEE: Public Health Committee holds a public hearing on nearly 40 bills, including multiple proposals that look to overhaul the closure process for hospitals and other essential services. Problems with the existing process were magnified by the Steward Health Care crisis, as the company bypassed required time periods to submit closure notices; the Department of Public Health also lacks the authority to force hospitals to stay open, even if they're deemed essential. A Sen. Rush bill (S 1622) looks to establish a working group focused on establishing and operating an acute care hospital in Norwood; Steward had abandoned the under-construction facility during bankruptcy proceedings. A proposal from Rep. Sabadosa (H 2532) would create a pilot program for nonprofit therapeutic centers that offer psilocybin treatment for ""mental and physical health needs."" Massachusetts voters last year rejected a ballot question that would have legalized certain psychedelic substances, including psilocybin. (Monday, 9 a.m., Room A-2 |Agenda and Livestream)

According to Environment Texas, while Texas ranks third in the country for solar power, it's only ""20th for per capita small-scale solar.""
Environment Texas Executive Director Luke Metzger said, ""When it comes to Texas's solar energy potential, the sky's the limit.""
The new legislation is a win for residents because installing solar panels can save them up to $3,000 a year on energy bills, depending on how big their system is.
In addition to saving you money, solar panels are more environmentally friendly because they don't run on dirty energy sources that warm the planet and intensify extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts.","A new law in Texas is making it easier and faster for its residents to install solar panels on their homes. According to Environment Texas, while Texas ranks third in the country for solar power, it's only ""20th for per capita small-scale solar."" That's due to a lack of incentives.

The Senate Bill 1202 allows for faster permitting, enabling third-party professionals to conduct reviews to avoid delays. Once a third party submits the approvals, construction can begin right away. Standards, laws, and rules must be posted for transparency. Additionally, the reviewers are the ones who are accountable for negligence, not the government.

If you're looking for installers in your area, EnergySage has a handy tool you can use to search for them, like you do flight deals and compare prices.

Environment Texas highlighted an analysis done by Brown University's Climate Solutions Lab, which shows that having third parties use permitting software ""could reduce the cost of rooftop solar systems in the state by $2,100 in 2030 and $4,900 by 2040.""

Environment Texas Executive Director Luke Metzger said, ""When it comes to Texas's solar energy potential, the sky's the limit.""

He added, ""Our state's energy security and independence can grow to new heights.""

The new legislation is a win for residents because installing solar panels can save them up to $3,000 a year on energy bills, depending on how big their system is.

EnergySage is also an excellent resource for tapping into these savings by making the process easy. The energy company can also help you save up to $10,000 on installation costs.

Additionally, EnergySage has a helpful mapping tool that shows what solar costs in each state, and the incentives that are available in your area.

To really lower your utility bills, you can install heat pumps with your solar.

In addition to saving you money, solar panels are more environmentally friendly because they don't run on dirty energy sources that warm the planet and intensify extreme weather events like hurricanes and droughts.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Texas-solar-panel-installationimage-recBXea31Q9KZmp8b-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 05:59:13.168579

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company.
Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.
A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON D.C., DC — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

What the EU president said:

The European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, speaking at the event, said, “The choices Africa makes today are shaping the future of the entire world. A clean energy transition on the continent will create jobs, stability, growth and the delivery of our global climate goals. The European Union, with the Global Gateway investment plan, is fully committed to supporting Africa on its clean energy path.”

More insights

While the continent’s renewable energy potential is tremendous, nearly 600 million people still live without access to electricity, according to the statement. Renewables investment is expected to create up to 38 million green jobs by 2030, the commission said.

The ‘Scaling Up Renewables in Africa’ campaign is carried out with the international advocacy organisation Global Citizen and relies on the policy support of the International Energy Agency.

The Pumphouse property is reportedly owned by Xcel, and a Colorado Parks & Wildlife spokesperson said CPW owns the parking lot and boat ramp.
Aside from the eventual transfer of the three assets, the county commissioners remain opposed to the current financial compensation package proposed in the Just Transition Solicitation.
“We have serious concerns that the outcome will fall short of meeting the needs of Routt County residents,” Macys said.
The PUC recently completed deliberations for the first phase of the Xcel Energy Just Transition Solicitation Electric Resource Plan Phase 1 that included a proposal for how much energy Xcel will need to build or acquire to serve its customers through the next five years.","The Colorado Public Utilities Commission has verbally ordered Xcel Energy to eventually transfer ownership of three physical assets to Routt County governments, according to a statement from county commissioners.

“While we are disappointed with the PUC’s approach to several key aspects of the transition, we do expect the final order to include some positive outcomes,” stated Sonja Macys, chair of the county commissioners. “These include the preservation and dedication of assets that benefit the broader community, such as the rail spur, water rights and the Pumphouse property, an important access point for residents and visitors to the Yampa River.”

The rail spur that leads to the Hayden Generating Station — stopping and looping through Xcel property — would be transferred after it is no longer in use by Xcel, Hayden Town Manager Mathew Mendisco said. The town manager discussed the status of the Just Transition program, designed to support communities where coal plants are retiring, during a Sept. 4 Hayden Town Council meeting with county commissioners Macys and Tim Redmond in attendance.

The Pumphouse property is reportedly owned by Xcel, and a Colorado Parks & Wildlife spokesperson said CPW owns the parking lot and boat ramp.

The water rights transfer is expected to happen after 2050. That timing is due to a change in state law approved in May 2024. While current Colorado law stipulates that a water right can be considered abandoned after 10 years of nonuse, Senate Bill 24-197 changed the law in the specific case of electric utilities that own a water right in state water Division 6, including the Hayden Station, to allow the plant to keep its water rights through 2050.

“The conditional water right may be used to support a specific project or potential future generation technologies or concepts that have the potential to advance progress toward Colorado’s clean energy and greenhouse gas emission reduction goals,” according to SB 24-197.

Aside from the eventual transfer of the three assets, the county commissioners remain opposed to the current financial compensation package proposed in the Just Transition Solicitation. Xcel Energy previously agreed during an Electric Resource Plan process conducted in 2021 to six years of property tax replacement after coal operations are retired, while Routt County and Hayden leaders in April asked for a larger contribution of 10 years of financial support calculated at $89 million.

“We are extremely disappointed that the PUC did not seriously consider the request that we made for 10 years of replacement property tax revenue,” Macys said in an email Friday.

Coal-fired operations at Hayden Station are set to retire by the end of 2028, and discussions continue as to what type of energy generation may happen on the site after 2028.

Mendisco said the PUC maintaining the six years of property-tax financial compensation agreement was “really, really unfortunate news.”

“If the PUC sticks to the six years with no economic adjustments as proposed by Routt County governments, we plan to file an official appeal to the PUC to ask them to re-look at the issues,” Mendisco said Wednesday.

Mendisco said taxing districts in western Routt County for fire, library, school and cemetery services “will be the most impacted by this poor decision the PUC has contemplated making.”

“West Routt County has roughly a population of 2,800 people if you include everyone in Hayden and the unincorporated areas,” Mendisco said. “The PUC seems to think that other communities around the state, such as Pueblo and Craig, should receive 10 years of property-tax backfill, except the smallest area in the state that has the fewest resources to transition, which is Hayden/West Routt County.”

“The Just Transition Office, Colorado Energy Office and Consumer Advocacy Office all testified that Hayden/Routt County should be treated equally; indications from the PUC would say otherwise,” Mendisco said. “The town of Hayden feels the PUC was directed by the state through the Just Transition legislation to make this a fair and just process. Anything that is short of what others around the state are receiving is simply wrong, and certainly not ‘just.'”

Mendisco said the town “will continue to strive to mitigate the loss of Hayden Station through economic development efforts.”

PUC Spokesperson Megan Castle said the final written decision is expected “in the coming weeks now that deliberations are complete.” Castle said interested individuals can listen to the state commission deliberations on the Just Transition Solicitation process on the PUC YouTube page at https://tinyurl.com/daac5vz7 .

“We have serious concerns that the outcome will fall short of meeting the needs of Routt County residents,” Macys said. “We believe this limited focus does not adequately reflect the intent, or potentially the mandate, outlined by the state legislature in 19-1314, which established a ‘moral commitment to assist the workers and communities that have powered Colorado for generations’ by supporting ‘a just and inclusive transition’ away from coal.”

The county commissioners’ statement this week reiterated that the current level of funding offered “would have significant negative consequences for Routt County, the town of Hayden and numerous special districts, including fire protection, school districts, libraries and cemeteries.”

“We will continue to review and assess the final order once issued and remain committed to advocating for a truly just transition that fully supports our community, local governments and special districts during this critical period of economic transformation,” according to the county commissioners’ statement.

The PUC recently completed deliberations for the first phase of the Xcel Energy Just Transition Solicitation Electric Resource Plan Phase 1 that included a proposal for how much energy Xcel will need to build or acquire to serve its customers through the next five years. The commission approved a plan that may result in the acquisition of more than 6,000 MW of new generation, a level that would make it the largest acquisition ever approved by the commission, according to a PUC media release.",https://swiftmedia.s3.amazonaws.com/mountain.swiftcom.com/images/sites/10/2025/09/25213736/Coal-train-B-may-1-2025-between-hayden-and-Steamboat-scaled-1-1024x623.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 05:58:54.617912

What's happening?

In September 2015, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a notice to Volkswagen for alleged violations of the Clean Air Act.

The EPA accused Volkswagen of intentionally installing software in models manufactured between 2009 and 2015, ""defeat devices"" designed to conceal emissions of nitrous oxides ""up to 40 times"" above existing federal standards.

Ultimately, Volkswagen and the EPA reached a settlement that required the automaker to create a $2.7 billion mitigation trust fund. Florida received $166 million, funds invested in electric buses for schools and public transit.

The Miami Herald reported that $41 million of those funds had yet to be spent, and that an August draft proposal from the FDEP indicated the agency intended to divert tens of millions to ""'new diesel' and compressed natural gas.""

Citing ""equipment supply challenges"" and ""shifts in federal incentive structures"" among other factors, the FDEP proposed a cessation in funding electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) in favor of investing in ""new clean diesel and compressed natural gas replacements.""

Why are energy experts objecting to the proposal?

Anne Blair, the Electrification Coalition's vice president of policy and freight, talked to the Herald about what the FDEP's proposal entailed.

Blair cut to the chase, explaining that the ""alternative fuels"" outlined in the draft ""aren't nearly as clean as electrification."" She acknowledged they could reduce emissions to a degree, but unlike electric vehicles, the proposed alternatives weren't ""emissions-free.""

Energy sciences expert Kevin Lofgren works with biofuels, and he emphasized that biodiesel and renewable diesel are not interchangeable, as they have different qualities and impacts.

Lofgren explained that the production of renewable diesel can result in carbon dioxide emissions, and he referred to the process as ""energy-exhaustive."" Lofgren characterized renewable diesel as a form of greenwashing.

""Renewable diesel is a little bit of a greenwash scam. It's great for business, not necessarily great for the environment. The temperatures and the pressures it takes to make this stuff is really extreme,"" Lofgren said.

""As much as I wish that these things were just God's gift to mankind, they aren't, and they do have their downsides,"" he lamented.

Florida's swift turn away from clean energy wasn't entirely surprising: In March, the Tampa Bay Times speculated that the federal government might ""claw back"" the state's mitigation funds.

What can be done about it?

As the Miami Herald noted, the FDEP's plan was a draft proposal.

The outlet indicated that a public comment window closed on September 19, before the article was published.

The cleaner the cloud, the greener the vehicle.","As the auto industry accelerates towards electrification and software-defined vehicles (SDVs), a new sustainability dilemma is emerging: the hidden energy footprint of Artificial Intelligence (AI).

From the sprawling data centres powering connected mobility to the chips embedded inside vehicles, AI is fast becoming the next climate paradox. Are automakers truly steering towards sustainability, or is the horsepower of AI quietly heating the planet?

Cloud dependency and energy demand

Today, much of the AI mobility stack from connected services to data-driven R&D relies heavily on external cloud and data centre infrastructure. High-volume model training, fleet management and large-scale data ingestion often take place off-vehicle.

Advt

“Core tasks like deep learning model training, simulation, HD map updates and remote diagnostics are typically performed in remote cloud/data centres rather than solely on vehicles or at the edge,” explains Jay Shah, Global COE Head - Data Science, Tata Technologies.

Shifting intelligence to the edge

To mitigate this footprint, he says both automakers and their cloud partners are increasingly sourcing 100% renewable energy for data centres. Edge computing, too, is gaining traction, shifting more analytics and inference tasks directly into the vehicle.

Processing data locally reduces latency and carbon footprint, while cutting down energy-intensive round-trips to the cloud. Moreover, OEMs are deploying AI-based systems that use sensor arrays and predictive algorithms to dynamically adjust cooling intensity based on real-time thermal loads, driving style, and weather conditions.

The efficiency paradox

Still, the paradox persists. “AI and autonomous technologies inherently increase energy consumption, especially due to large-scale data processing and connectivity requirements,” says Rajeev Ralhan, Partner and Leader, Decarbonisation, PwC India.

Yet, they also unlock profound capabilities for efficiency, optimisation, and emission reduction throughout the value chain. “AI, when incorporated into vehicle platforms, manufacturing processes, and grid management, can substantially reduce wasted energy and enhance resource use,” he adds.

Ralhan explains how state-of-the-art AI applications from predictive energy management to real-time carbon tracking and dynamic load balancing enable precise allocation of energy and curtail unnecessary consumption. This often results in significant operational cost savings and energy reductions in manufacturing scenarios.

Advt

According to him, AI-enabled manufacturing achieves significant reductions in energy consumption, substantial decreases in waste, and improved resource use across the supply chain, directly reducing the carbon footprint of automotive operations.

“Digital twins help optimise designs and manufacturing workflows for minimal material and energy use, enabling lifecycle assessments, recycling potential, and circular economy innovations through every stage,” he says.

Research flags rising energy use

A study by the University of Michigan suggests that connected and autonomous vehicles may increase primary energy use and greenhouse gas emissions by 3–20 per cent compared to conventional vehicles. This rise is attributed mainly to the energy demands of AI systems, sensors, and data networks.

“To counterbalance these impacts, drivetrains must transition to electric — given their superior energy efficiency compared to internal combustion engines — and that the electricity powering them increasingly comes from clean, renewable sources,” says Charith Konda, Energy Specialist, IEEFA (Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis).

He adds that tech-infused driving assistance systems, available in connected and electric vehicles, can facilitate eco-driving and reduce energy consumption. In his view, regulators are primarily focused on ensuring human safety and cybersecurity in the context of connected and autonomous mobility. The good news is that the adoption of electric and hybrid vehicles is accelerating across many regions, which should help alleviate concerns about rising energy use to some extent.

Regulations are catching-up

Emerging regulations like the EU AI Act already mandate environmental impact assessments for AI systems, requiring transparency and risk management throughout AI lifecycles. Future frameworks will likely require companies to measure and report carbon emissions, pushing responsible AI development, efficient algorithms, and renewable energy use in data centres and vehicles.

This will mirror current automotive standards for emissions and safety, thereby ensuring sustainable AI innovation in mobility. “Regulators are expected to increasingly scrutinise AI’s environmental footprint in mobility, similar to emissions and safety,” says Shah.

Beyond data centres: The ESG challenge

For automakers, that means sustainability will soon be measured not just at the tailpipe, but also in the cloud. “It is still early, but regulators are beginning to recognise AI’s indirect environmental costs like energy-hungry data centres and compute requirements,” adds Ankita Sabharwal, Head of Data Privacy, Chadha and Chadha.

“We may not see rules as structured as emissions and safety standards right away, it is realistic to expect disclosures, reporting requirements, or sustainability guidelines around AI in mobility within the next few years, especially as governments push broader climate goals,” she says.

Studies show that high-intensity AI activities, such as those required for autonomous vehicles, connected mobility, and smart city applications, are associated with significant added CO₂ emissions. Concerns about the “hidden” footprint from rare earth minerals in chips to upstream energy use for cloud-based AI modelling are prompting calls for regulation similar to existing standards on vehicle emissions and safety.

According to Ralhan, the pace of AI adoption in transport could amplify these impacts unless monitored and balanced with sustainability targets. Governments and organisations are putting environmental practices of tech and automotive companies under closer inspection.

“ESG frameworks now increasingly call for transparent reporting not just of tailpipe or manufacturing emissions, but technology-enabled footprints - including data centre usage and AI-driven operational impacts,” he points out.

The future impact of AI on the environment hinges on robust strategies integrating AI with clean energy, hardware innovation, carbon accounting, and regulatory frameworks. With conscious design, AI will drive transformative sustainability, outweigh its own environmental footprint and catalyse the automotive sector’s transition to net zero.

The road ahead is clear. The cleaner the cloud, the greener the vehicle.

On Sept. 9, the Hernando County Board of County Commissioners discussed several projects to submit to seek state funding for during the next legislative session.

Request: Fire Station to Serve Weeki Wachee Area

Public Information Officer Dominique Holmes began her presentation with a proposed request for a new fire station along US 19 at Atlanta Avenue. Population density in the Weeki Wachee area has increased and additional home construction warrants a need for a fire station that will meet the needs of the community without reducing the effectiveness or response time of existing fire and EMS locations. The proposed funding is $8 million, and Hernando County would pay $3 million of that cost.

Commissioner Champion challenged the $8 million cost as being too cost-prohibitive when the state is trying to be fiscally responsible.

Request: Public Safety Training Center

The second proposal was a training center for the county’s public safety departments, not just fire safety and EMS personnel, but the sheriff’s office as well. A similar request has been made annually since 2012.

The cost for just the first phase of the facility is approximately $8 million, with Hernando County providing just over $1 million for the project. With 60 acres available, a local training center would resolve several issues: personnel could remain available for emergency situations, reduce the current scheduling conflicts that occur between multiple agencies and counties, and would provide sufficient and varied training environments.

Though located in Hernando County, this training center would be available for use by agencies across the state as well. A critical aspect is the benefit of providing continuing education, increasing the requisite skills for these departments’ effectiveness during emergencies or critical situations such as natural disasters.

Commissioner Champion said Governor DeSantis vetoed this request during last year’s legislative session. He also reminded the board that the item is being put on a referendum.

Request: Waterways/Multi-Agency Building

Ms. Holmes addressed the third item: a building to accommodate the three agencies which need access to Hernando County’s marine waterways. The beneficiaries of an updated building are the Waterways Division of the Parks and Recreation Department, Florida Fish and Wildlife Commission, and the HCSO Marine Unit.

While the county has such a building, it was built 65 years ago. Two recent storms revealed how susceptible it was to natural disasters. It sustained significant but repairable damage from Hurricane Idalia in 2023. In 2024, however, Hurricane Helene’s 5-foot storm surge damaged the concrete block structure, an out-building and fencing beyond repair. Everything must be demolished on that property, and on the adjacent property the county purchased with BOCC approval.

Floodplain maps have changed since the original building was erected and any new building(s) at that site must adhere to the Flood Insurance Rate Maps and current building codes. The proposed office building at the original site will be elevated and ADA accessible. The 4,340 sq. ft.-space will be jointly used by FWC, HCSO’s Marine Unit and the Waterways Division, with maintenance and storage for boats and equipment below the office, at ground level. It will include parking areas for the agencies’ staff and visitors.

Repairing and/or upgrading the existing docks and adding a new dock for the HCSO’s Fire Rescue boat are also part of the proposed project. An additional building for boat storage and unknown future needs is included. New infrastructure will be added for both properties.

The primary beneficiary of the new facilities is the public using the waterways. Emergency services will be able to reach them faster, navigation aids can be repaired quickly, and in the case of severe weather, provide safe harbor.

The cost for this funding request is $3.5 million. The county’s matching portion is approximately $725,000.

Commissioner Champion stated concern that this would not be approved due to the proposed cost.

Request: Taxiway and Infrastructure Project at Brooksville-Tampa Bay Regional Airport

Both Economic Development Director Valerie Pianta and Ms. Holmes discussed this proposal. Mrs. Pianta requested board approval to submit a grant application for funds to construct/resurface a new taxiway from an inactive runway at the Brooksville-Tampa Bay Regional Airport. Current water and sewer infrastructure would be extended across the infield area. Opening hundreds of unused acres is designed to attract additional industry in both aviation and non-aviation fields.

Pem-Air Turbine Engin Services, LLC and Judah 1, Inc. have pledged to both provide funding and create new jobs by either expanding their existing facilities or constructing additional ones. Combined, their financial contributions will be significant. The higher-wage jobs the companies will provide are even more beneficial.

The project cost is estimated at $17 million. Between the EDA Disaster Supplemental Grant funds and FDOT Aviation Grant Program funds total of $13.6 million, the county match would be $1.6 million. Ms. Holmes stated the county could request $1 million from the state’s legislature, reducing the county’s matching funds to just $600,000.

Request: Hermosa Lift Station Upgrade

There are six wastewater lift stations that feed into the Hermosa lift station, which forwards the wastewater to the Hernando County Airport Water Reclamation Facility. The Hernando Beach area continues to see growth and the Hermosa lift station was not engineered to handle the amount of wastewater that flows through it.

The lift station is older and the control system as well as the electrical system are at risk due to equipment stress, potential overflows and other issues. An engineering analysis also recommended the lift’s electrical panels should be elevated.

There are several factors being considered such as public health hazards from overflows or flooding, potential system failures and future wastewater needs. Protecting Weeki Wachee Springs by preventing nitrogen seepage to the aquifer is also of serious concern.

The design phase is still in progress, Ms. Holmes said. The funding request is $3.4 million, with the county match of $850,000.

Request: Septic-to-Sewer Conversion – District A Phase 2

The Weeki Wachee Springs area is under the protection of the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (FDEP). One reason water quality is impaired is high nitrate levels from wastewater and agricultural runoff. This can cause algal growth, reduce water clarity and damage the springs ecosystem.

Hernando County participates in a Basin Management Action Plan (BMAP) to help improve water quality by reducing the amount of nitrogen that enters the groundwater. One way to do this is to convert homes from using septic systems and connecting them to the sewer system. Phase 1 conversion is in progress.

Phase 2 builds on this and will include approximately 350 properties. The property locations are even closer to the Springs than Phase 1. The goal is to improve the Springs water quality by reducing even more nitrogen in the water. A secondary benefit is having more reclaimed water.

The funding request for Phase 2 is $26 million. The county’s cost would be $1.8 million.",https://www.hernandosun.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tingey-injury-law-firm-yCdPU73kGSc-unsplash-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 05:59:03.386467

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., visited Woodstock Soapstone to raise awareness about those impacted by tariffs.
The cost increases aren’t life-threatening for Woodstock Soapstone, which has no debt and owns its property, tools and supplies, Morrissey said.","WEST LEBANON — As the burden of tariffs and expiring tax credits begins to weigh on the only woodstove manufacturer in New Hampshire, the company has begun downsizing.

“What you do if you’re in business and you’re dealing with tremendous uncertainty is that you contract,” said Tom Morrissey, the president of Woodstock Soapstove in Lebanon.

Five of the firm’s 25 manufacturing positions have been left unfilled in recent months, said Morrissey, who has been with the company for all of its 47 years.

The company is also reducing inventory, decreasing the number of models in production and increasing lines of credit, General Manager Lorin Day said.

The stove manufacturer recently had to pay $40,000 in tariffs on a shipment of material for which they would have paid just a couple hundred dollars in the past, Morrissey said.

“We’re just like a little acorn in this hurricane,” Morrissey said.

Any steel and aluminum materials coming from outside the U.S. are now tariffed at 50%, including the steel and cast iron that Woodstock Soapstone uses to make its stoves.

The company at one point got its cast iron from Randolph-based Vermont Castings, which stopped supplying it to Woodstock Soapstone’s specifications. Their cast iron now comes from a foundry in Spain.

And while most of its steel is North American, some of it comes from Canada, which is subject to tariffs, Morrissey said.

There’s also uncertainty about whether the soapstone — a naturally occurring rock — will be tariffed, as it comes from Canada, but isn’t produced in the U.S., Morrissey said.

Morrissey said he expects the tariffs to raise retail prices of his stoves by around 12% to 15%. This will begin in the next seven to 10 days, Day said.

As a small business that sells directly to “working class” customers mostly, Woodstock Soapstone is at a disadvantage to larger manufacturers that have more leeway on prices, Morrissey said.

And while the increase will have to happen soon, the company has been holding it off, Morrissey said. It hasn’t started shipping products built from the tariffed goods, using more of their reserve supplies as they try to “put off the pain as long as (they) can,” Morrissey said.

“It’s essentially an unexpected unilateral tax on materials that we buy from outside the United States — that we can’t get from the United States,” Morrissey said.

The manufacturer requires a certain grade and format of metal that is not available in the United States, Day said.

For example, the business buys some steel from China, which is not produced well domestically, for a specialty part that reburns smoke.

“I can show you what you can get in the United States, but you’d be disgusted,” Morrissey said.

In addition to the raised tariffs, the federal tax credit on wood heaters is set to expire at the end of December, instead of 2032, as previously set. This credit reduces the price of woodstoves approved by the Environmental Protection Agency by 30%.

Morrissey said he expects the surge in orders to increase as more people learn that the credits are ending. This will help in the near future, but hurt sales long term.

It will also strain the company’s ability to build enough stoves on time, he said.

The strain is worsened by bureaucratic red tape. For example, Woodstock Soapstone has been awaiting the EPA’s approval of a new stove model since April.

There are currently $300,000 to $400,000 in orders that can’t be fulfilled because of the lack of approval, Morrissey said.

In the past, a phone call to EPA administrators could have resolved the issue in a matter of days, Morrissey said. But he hasn’t been able to reach anyone in the agency for the last five months, he said.

A spokesperson for the EPA wrote in an email that the processing time for new certifications have been “longer than usual” due to “resource issues and the need to prioritize renewals of expiring certifications.”

The spokesperson also wrote that Woodstock Soapstone’s new model is scheduled for a detailed review starting on Sep. 29.

But at a certain point, Morrissey has to tell customers that he’s “not sure I’ll be able to fulfill their orders,” he said.

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., visited Woodstock Soapstone to raise awareness about those impacted by tariffs.

“The only thing that’s going to move this administration is when they hear from businesses (and) consumers that they’re being hit by these tariffs in a way that makes it hard to do business,” she said.

In January, Shaheen introduced Senate Bill 151, which seeks to deny tariffs imposed through the act that the Trump administration used on metal imports. The bill was blocked by Republican senators, but she has continued to push the issue.

“We need to continue to bang that drum so that people make the connection between the tariffs and what they’re seeing in their pocketbooks – and what small businesses, in particular — are seeing with the impact of tariffs,” she said.

The cost increases aren’t life-threatening for Woodstock Soapstone, which has no debt and owns its property, tools and supplies, Morrissey said.

But as Woodstock Soapstone braces for the near future, it is beginning to look into other markets that aren’t regulated by the government, such as furniture — which can be built in their shop, Morrissey said.",https://i0.wp.com/vnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20250924-vn-shaheen-jmp-177-copy.jpg?fit=2400%2C1602&quality=89&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:16.509028

The DOE report, written by a small group of high-profile climate contrarians, stands in stark contrast to decades of assessments published by the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s preeminent authority on research into the planet’s warming.

The DOE launched its science review in March and published the findings just four months later, after a secretive process that drew a sharp rebuke from a federal judge. DOE disbanded the group, but the authors pledged to advance their work outside of government. At the IPCC, scientists are nominated and vetted for their expertise and spend years reviewing hundreds of studies to evaluate their strengths and look for trends. One section of the IPCC report alone, on climate impacts, adaptation and vulnerabilities, had more than 270 reviewers, 34,000 citations and received more than 62,000 comments.

Contrary to Wright’s assertions that divergent voices are pushed out of the scientific process, experts said, scientific papers that disagree often receive more attention and discussion from reviewers.

Wright’s claim that dissenting views are silenced is “at best preposterous and arrogant and at worst a deliberate ruse to undermine decades of rigorous science,” said Camille Parmesan, an ecologist at the National Scientific Research Institute of France who served as a coordinating author for the IPCC.

“I personally believe this is a deliberate attempt to sabotage real science and replace it with unfounded and dangerous ideology,” Parmesan wrote in an email.

Some of the discrepancies are semantic. Climate scientists are reluctant to declare a trend, for instance, unless they have decades of data to back it up.

In the case of hurricanes, the best data extends only to around 1980, when satellites began comprehensively tracking storms as they crossed oceans. Curry, one of the DOE report authors, says that timeline is “not good enough to discern a meaningful trend.”

But a large majority of scientists disagree, arguing that the data shows rising dangers.

The percentage of intense hurricanes has likely grown compared to the overall share of storms, said Jim Kossin, a prominent hurricane researcher and a retired NOAA atmospheric scientist who served as a lead author for the IPCC.

He said the DOE report “is clearly designed to mislead the audience into believing that there are no trends.”

There’s another problem: Scientists have not predicted that climate change would lead to more hurricanes, as DOE suggests. Instead, they have found that hurricanes are intensifying and dropping more rain.

The lack of discussion in the DOE report about water — not wind speed — being the biggest danger from hurricanes is “a dead giveaway” that the report authors had downplayed the climate risks, said Kerry Emanuel, a hurricane expert and professor emeritus at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

The DOE report’s focus on the hottest daytime summer temperatures is misleading. The 1930s were unusual because of the Dust Bowl, a period of intense drought and high heat across parts of the central and southern U.S., exacerbated by severe soil erosion caused by unsustainable farming practices of the time. Many temperature records at locations in the region did topple nearly a century ago — but most scientists say it was a statistical outlier that skewed heat trends for decades afterward.

“It was hot in the 1930s, yes! But that does not undermine the rising trend in extreme heat over the past few decades and the associated societal consequences,” said Deepti Singh, a climate scientist at Washington State University Vancouver.

It’s true that some areas of the central and southern U.S. haven’t seen an increase in daytime summer temperatures, a pattern known as the “U.S. warming hole.” Scientists believe many factors are at play, including the Dust Bowl’s statistical legacy. But outside the warming hole, the U.S. is seeing increases in extreme summer heat.

All kinds of other highs are also rising in the U.S., including maximum temperatures over the entire year, winter temperatures, and nighttime summer temperatures.

Researchers are aware that not all regions of the country are warming evenly. But there’s a clear upward pattern. One regional anomaly doesn’t change that fact.

The DOE report relies on studies or reports that have sometimes been amplified by the fossil fuel industry, or are connected to conservative groups that oppose government efforts to address climate change.

For example, the report cites a blog post that DOE report author Roy Spencer wrote about “faulty” climate models. He wrote the post for the Heritage Foundation, the same organization that produced the Project 2025 playbook that called for jettisoning climate policy and defunding science.

Spencer argued in his writing that climate models are biased and show no meaningful warming trends. He urged policymakers to “proceed cautiously and not allow themselves to be influenced by exaggerated claims based on demonstrably faulty climate models.”

But his assertions about the models’ track record are false. Climate models in the 1970s accurately predicted current global warming. And peer-reviewed assessments of models since then have shown that they generally performed well.

“This notion that there's a fundamental disconnect between simulations and observations is incorrect,” said Ben Santer, a former climate scientist at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. “The DOE report also cherry picks in terms of which model simulations and which observations they show.”

The Heritage piece is one example of some of the DOE authors’ current and past affiliations with conservative groups that have tried for years to undermine climate regulations placed on polluting industries.

“Any current or past affiliations with other organizations do not define any of our perspectives on climate science,” said Curry, a climatologist and professor emeritus at the Georgia Institute of Technology. She added, “The policy preferences of these organizations are not relevant in any way to our perspectives on the science.”

Other than Koonin, who worked as chief scientist for BP, the authors’ actual research has not been directly funded by the fossil fuel industry. But some of them have been paid by industry groups and conservative think tanks to opine on how their findings raise questions about mainstream science.

Spencer, a researcher at the University of Alabama in Huntsville, has held roles at the Heritage Foundation and the Heartland Institute. Both groups promote climate misinformation and have pushed to eliminate fossil fuel regulations. They have received funding from foundations linked to Exxon Mobil and Shell, and the Koch brothers network.

Koonin is a fellow at the conservative Hoover Institution, whose scholars have downplayed climate science and argued against regulations.

McKitrick, an economist at the University of Guelph in Ontario, Canada, is also listed as a senior fellow at the Fraser Institute, a right-wing think tank in Canada that is critical of climate policy. Fraser has received funding from the Koch brothers network, Exxon and foundations that oppose regulations.

The DOE report amplifies supposed conflicts among climate scientists — even when there isn’t any.

For example, it’s not true that there is “substantial debate” within climate science over whether the sun could be a primary driver of global warming.

But the DOE report makes that claim nevertheless. The idea has been pushed for years by Willie Soon, a researcher favored by industry groups and promoted by Republican lawmakers.

There’s no dispute among scientists that the sun affects the Earth’s climate. But the idea that it’s responsible for the warming observed over the last 50 years is “considered scientifically invalid,” said Theodosios Chatzistergos, an astrophysicist at the Max Planck Institute for Solar System Research in Germany.

Curry said the DOE authors were planning to “modify some of the text” because the group did not have time to review all the references on the topic.

The DOE report was released on the same day in July that the Environmental Protection Agency proposed rescinding the so-called endangerment finding, which gives the agency its legal authority to reduce climate pollution from sources like power plants and cars.

EPA pointed to the DOE report as evidence that climate risks have been overblown. When EPA asserted that hurricanes, floods and wildfires have not gotten worse, it cited the DOE report. When it argued that climate models erroneously predicted warming trends, drought and melting ice, it cited the DOE report. And when it claimed it’s overly difficult to attribute rising temperatures to human activity, it cited the DOE report.

It was a clear example of how the Trump administration will use the findings of a few researchers to cast doubt on the vast scientific consensus that rising temperatures pose a danger to humans — a determination that has led many governments around the world to impose measures for confronting the peril.

Curry said it was the authors’ hope that the report would be published on its own, but DOE and EPA instead “elected to publish this at the same time as the filing on the Endangerment issue.”

Altogether, EPA pointed to the report 16 times in its bid to roll back climate regulations — a move that drew criticism from a federal judge in Massachusetts. The judge allowed the citations to stand but rebuked DOE for describing the report as a scientific exercise, when he said it was overtly political.

HARRISBURG, Pa. (AP) — Private investment firms that are helping finance America’s artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

“The reason is very simple: because there’s a lot of money to be made,” said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI’s ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock’s CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is “at the beginning of a golden age.”

“We believe that there’s a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy” and energy, Fink said.

Deals are in the works

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that’s a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

More buyouts worry opponents

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

“It’s no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don’t have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,” said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech’s data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he’s talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

“It’s just a matter of what’s the price and will the regulator approve it,” Ellis said. “The challenge is they’re not going to come up for sale very often.”

That’s because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

Big players on both sides

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don’t want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general’s office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power’s electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock’s ownership, Minnesota Power’s operations, strategy and values wouldn’t change and that it doesn’t expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock’s ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota’s law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete’s suggestion that it’ll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is “well positioned” to meet its financing needs.

Skepticism from regulators

It hasn’t been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group’s “intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.”

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie’s concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power’s parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

“For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,” the staff wrote. “For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity ‘wins’ and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.”

The pressure to reduce emissions has not decreased, and the new network could be an essential component of the United States’ energy portfolio in the future.

Turning ambitious plans into reality as the vision for clean energy takes shape

The plan is bold yet simple. Establish hydrogen stations that pump globally: this will create a network of hubs established with highways, ports, factories, etc. Not only concerns powering trucks, but also the aim is to ensure that hydrogen becomes a clean, flexible fuel for industries that are hard to electrify.

Financial assistance and incentives in promoting the development of this gas are provided by the government. Efforts like the Clean Hydrogen Hubs of the Department of Energy aim at having areas cooperate, helping make sure the necessary infrastructure is established, and more clean hydrogen is produced to be consumed in the nation.

Building a low-emission future one hydrogen hub at a time

The significant hydrogen hub is being installed and is part of a $7 billion program taking roughly $1 billion. States like Texas, California, the Midwest, and the Gulf Coast will have an advantage. The investment will be used to aid in producing, storing, delivering, and fueling this natural gas to trucks and to the general public transportation system.

The ARCHES project, being located in California, receives up to $1.2 1.2billion of federal funds, along with community and individual investments, to construct clean hydrogen infrastructure in the state. It aims at making hydrogen a viable transportation and industrial fuel with no emissions.

Understanding the project’s plans, schedule, and important checkpoints

Officials want to shift the hydrogen hub locations from the planning phase to the construction phase. The success will be measured in terms of the number of fueling stations constructed, the amount of gas generated, emissions minimized, expenses controlled, and employment opportunities generated, just like this unexpected underground discovery changing everything we’ve known.

Several hubs have already entered into preliminary deals, and production and distribution will grow in a slow process.

Overcoming obstacles and concerns as the project moves toward its goals

The manufacture of clean hydrogen is expensive. Green and blue hydrogen have challenges in terms of finances and scale. Construction of pipelines, storage facilities, and fueling stations is attended to with permits and safety checks, and it is feared that the network can always serve the long-haul routes. The activists of environmental justice require more openness and improved security. Other projects involve natural gas mixed with carbon capture, and opponents do not note that this would leave fossil fuel infrastructure alive.

The people in the local communities are concerned about the emissions, the risks to their health, and whether these projects will have fair benefits for them. The proponents argue that hydrogen expansion will create thousands of new jobs and clean the air in the industrial regions, as well as enhance U.S. opportunities to achieve the 2030 and 2050 climate objectives.

These are advantages that point to economic and environmental benefits. With this project, it will not only be fueling stations, but also a new energy highway. It will only succeed as an expensive experiment or become an essential component of a low-carbon future of America if it is carefully planned and implemented.",https://www.eldiario24.com/en/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/1001350099.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 01:59:47.163801

Details about how GRIT will operate remain unclear. “The answer is, they’re not really sure just yet. They’re waiting to see what the suggestions are,” said Ed Hirs, an energy fellow at the University of Houston. Hirs pointed to ongoing concerns about investment in Texas energy infrastructure. “I think ERCOT, the Public Utility Commission, and of course the governor who appoints these folks, are acutely aware that they’re losing investment to other states with more reliable electricity,” he said.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration projects demand will grow by 7 percent this year and 14 percent next year. has steadily increased, climbing from 84.4 gigawatts in 2021 to 92.1 gigawatts this past summer. The increase is driven in part by population growth and the expansion of data centers, though some facilities are capable of producing electricity themselves.

The state’s growing reliance on renewable energy sources at the same time that natural gas plants are retired due to age, also poses challenges. “We’re going to have more wind and more solar and more batteries, and this will lead to more volatility in terms of supply coming on and off the grid,” Hirs said.

New Mexico Governor Michelle Lujan Grisham has announced that Pacific Fusion, a commercial fusion energy company, has selected New Mexico as the site for its first Research and Manufacturing Campus.

The $1 billion facility at Mesa del Sol positions New Mexico at the forefront of the emerging fusion energy industry and cement its role as a national leader in advanced energy innovation. Fusion, the same process that powers the sun and stars, has long been considered the holy grail of clean safe energy, and with the potential to generate near-limitless on-demand power.

“Pacific Fusion’s decision to build in New Mexico proves that our state can compete—and win in the race to attract the most innovative companies in the world,” Lujan Grisham said. “This project will create good jobs, expand our clean-tech economy, and ensure New Mexico continues to lead in the industries of the future.”

Pacific Fusion will build a state-of-the-art research and manufacturing facility, housing its Demonstration System, which is designed to achieve net facility gain—producing more energy from a fusion reaction than the total energy used – by 2030. Reaching this milestone would mark a historic breakthrough toward commercial fusion power. future,” Albuquerque Mayor Tim Keller said. “Today is proof of the assertion that we have passed a turning point—that our city is not only on the map, but can define the next chapter of clean-energy innovation.”

Pacific Fusion was founded in 2023 to deliver affordable fusion energy. Its technology builds on New Mexico’s legacy of applied physics and clean-energy innovation, including decades of research at Sandia National Laboratories, home to some of the world’s leading fusion experiments. In addition to its historic leadership in applied physics and energy innovation, New Mexico offers a growing clean-tech ecosystem and a workforce that aligns with Pacific Fusion’s future hiring needs.

“We’re excited to expand our operations to New Mexico for many reasons, chief among them the close partnership we’ve developed with state and local leadership, who have made this project possible,” said Keith LeChien, co-founder and chief technology officer of Pacific Fusion. “Working alongside the Governor’s office, the Economic Development Department, the City of Albuquerque, key legislators from both parties, and the national labs, we’ve built true partnerships over the past several months. That collaboration gives us confidence that together we’ll be able to move quickly to deliver on the promise of low-cost fusion power.”

Upon finalization, the project will bring more than 200 long-term jobs to the state, along with hundreds more construction jobs, workforce development programs, and regional economic activity. It is an anchor investment for a broader fusion ecosystem in New Mexico. “This is a groundbreaking project that puts New Mexico at the forefront of fusion energy,” said Economic Development Department Cabinet Secretary Rob Black. “Welcoming a world-class company like this into our state opens the door to an entirely new era of clean energy innovation. It means thousands of potential future jobs, a new supply chain, and the opportunity to cement our state’s leadership in clean technology for decades to come.”

Pacific Fusion has raised more than $900 million in private capital from General Catalyst, Lowercarbon Capital, Breakthrough Energy Ventures, Lightspeed Venture Partners, DCVC, UP.Partners and other leading investors. The New Mexico State Investment Council’s commitments to investing in key sectors and VC firms actively sourcing New Mexico opportunities played a pivotal role in Pacific Fusion’s choice to make New Mexico the home for its next major facility.",https://losalamosreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/seal_of_the_governor_of_new_mexico-1-1-1.png,N,,2025-09-27 23:58:31.303428

In response, Larry Behrens from Power the Future told The Center Square that “by returning $13 billion, the Department of Energy under President Trump is showing respect for taxpayers and a willingness to end funding for programs that don’t work.”

Power the Future is a nonprofit dedicated to Americans who work in reliable energy sources.

Behrens told The Center Square that the Department of Energy’s action “is a welcome step toward restoring accountability and letting free markets – not bureaucrats – determine our energy future.”

“The American people made it crystal clear at the ballot box that they don’t want another taxpayer dollar wastefully spent on green scam pet projects,” Behrens said.

Diana Furchtgott-Roth of the Heritage Foundation told The Center Square that with the return of $13 billion, “the deficit will be lower than otherwise.”

When asked what other actions the Department of Energy should take to end wasteful spending, Furchtgott-Roth said that “the Department should comb through its budget and see what projects can be accomplished by the private sector, then end those projects.”

“The Department should also look through its regulations and see which ones impose costs on businesses and families,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

“For instance, the Department should eliminate appliance regulations that prevent companies from producing the gas stoves, boilers, or water heaters that people want to buy,” Furchtgott Roth said.

The Department of Energy announced Wednesday its “intention to return more than $13 billion in unobligated funds initially appropriated to advance the previous Administration’s wasteful Green New Scam agenda.”

The department said its announcement reflects “the [Trump] Administration’s commitment to halt wasteful spending and refocus the department to its core mission.”

For instance, Trump signed the Working Families Tax Cut into law earlier this year, the release said, which “directed the Energy Department to rein in bloated federal spending and expedite the return of unobligated funds to the U.S. Treasury to support hardworking Americans.”

“The Department of Energy is working to advance its critical mission of unleashing affordable, reliable and secure energy for all Americans while increasing efficiency and promoting better stewardship of taxpayer dollars,” the release said.

The Department of Energy has not yet responded to The Center Square’s request for comment.

U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in the news release: “The American people elected President Trump largely because of the last administration’s reckless spending on climate policies that fed inflation and failed to provide any real benefit to the American people.”

“Thanks to President Trump and Congress, those days are over,” Wright said.

Renewable energy group American Council on Renewable Energy has not yet responded to The Center Square’s two requests for comment.

Behrens told The Center Square, “keep in mind it was Biden’s DOE that funneled billions to an electric vehicle charging program that failed to deliver results.”

“Over $6 billion in EV charging funding has now been flagged as wasteful,” Behrens said.

Behrens also referred The Center Square to a White House document entitled “Ending the Green New Scam.”

Furchtgott-Roth informed The Center Square that “in general, states with the most expensive electricity require renewables (with the exception of Alaska), and states with the least expensive electricity do not require renewables.”

“States should prioritize affordable, resilient, reliable energy,” Furchtgott-Roth said.

“This means getting rid of requirements that a share of electricity be produced with renewables,” Furchtgott-Rott said.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/1/2e/12e92fc9-5d82-4dd4-9e40-615fb416e680/68b21418b8d6b.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:26.764426

LIMBONG: How does President Trump's hostility to climate action impact momentum on the world stage?
LIMBONG: So how do you bring the whole world along when the U.S. isn't playing ball?
LIMBONG: Climate action isn't a light switch, right?
LIMBONG: Wopke Hoekstra is the European Union climate commissioner.","ANDREW LIMBONG, HOST:

At the United Nations this week, more than a hundred countries met to discuss commitments to cut pollution by 2035 as part of a global effort to counter climate change. Also at the U.N. this week, President Trump called climate change, quote, the ""greatest con job"" ever perpetrated on the world, and he called green policies a scam. And he said he was worried about Europe. We're joined now by the climate commissioner for the European Union, Wopke Hoekstra. Hi, Commissioner. Welcome.

WOPKE HOEKSTRA: Thank you very much for having me on the show.

LIMBONG: So let's start with some of the new commitments announced earlier this week to cut pollution levels, to address global warming. What stands out to you?

HOEKSTRA: First of all, it is hugely important that the world continues to make this effort because, frankly speaking, this problem is getting worse before it gets better, right? So if you just look at the sheer impact on our economies, on geopolitics, on the ecosystem we live in, the damage simply is huge. It is imperative that the global community, the world together also tries to fix this.

LIMBONG: And so what have you heard this week?

HOEKSTRA: We learned, for example, about the Chinese example, which, in my view, is a step, but at the same time, disappointing in where they land. They're not going to do much more than some 10% reduction by 2035. And given that they are the largest emitter on the planet, responsible for roughly 30% of global emissions, it would have been hugely important for them to take more responsibility, more leadership and do more.

LIMBONG: So Commissioner, help us understand, what are the EU's commitments for 2035?

HOEKSTRA: So our commitment is a range between 66.3- and 72.5% and...

LIMBONG: To reduce emissions.

HOEKSTRA: Of reduced emissions compared to '99, which was our peak here. You always take the peak and then, you know, the percentage that you managed to drive down by 2035. If you were to put into perspective - because I can fully understand that it's hard to assess, is this is good? Is this mediocre? Is this bad? - this will put us at the top or very near the top of the most ambitious. Great Britain is probably going to have a target that is even higher, but we will come as a close second, I think.

LIMBONG: How does President Trump's hostility to climate action impact momentum on the world stage?

HOEKSTRA: I think it is diplomatic to basically refrain from trying to be a pundit and analyze his specific speech. But if I zoom out, what I can tell you is that American leadership matters, and frankly speaking, all matters that we have, whether it's geopolitics, whether it's the economy or whether it's climate, the U.S. simply is the most formidable player across the globe. You are the No. 1 economy, and you are the second largest emitter. So the fact that the U.S. is no longer being part of these conversations is a major blow to international efforts. That's just a reality.

LIMBONG: So how do you bring the whole world along when the U.S. isn't playing ball?

HOEKSTRA: It makes it more complicated, and it makes conversations with China also more complicated. And with all the other large emitters, all the large industrial nations, which we typically call the G20, together responsible for roughly 85% of global emissions, it does do something with the dynamics. At the same time, the problem is not going to go away, right? The ecosystem, the planet doesn't give a damn whether this is easy or difficult. It's simply warming up. And the impact in terms of droughts, wildfires is basically continuing, and that will have increasingly a very, very significant economic cost. So forget about all the lingo about saving the planet. This is an economic reality we need to face.

LIMBONG: Climate action isn't a light switch, right? It's not particularly nimble. Like, businesses have invested, and there are new market realities, but how do you face the big challenges when you have these big swings in American policy?

HOEKSTRA: So the interesting thing is, when I talk to businesses, whether they're from the U.S. or from Europe or wherever, it is crystal clear to them that the future will be decarbonized and that if you don't expose yourself to that economy, you will have a very bad chance of surviving as a company, not in the very short run, but in the longer run for sure. So that is why, in so many industries, CEOs are making sure that they do go into change mode. They might not always use that anymore under the header of climate or of clean, but for many of them, it simply makes business sense to step up.

And the numbers show that they are right. Just to give you one number that I've always found absolutely spectacular, if you look at what happened to the price of solar, that dropped by roughly 95% in terms of cost just in this decade or in this century, so in these 25 years, alone. And the costs are ever further going down. So it is just attractive from a commercial perspective to have exposure to that.

LIMBONG: The EU has made progress in its clean energy transition, but it still imports Russian gas. And I think that reliance is problematic for the bloc's climate and broader policy goals. So how are you working to reconcile this?

HOEKSTRA: We're trying to eradicate that as quickly as we can, Andrew. I just - no doubt about it. We have made a severe mistake years ago to believe that, you know, this dependency was actually OK and that it was with a trustworthy partner. And then the Ukrainians turned out to be at the receiving end of an absolutely illegal, horrible war the Russians have forced upon them. And immediately, when we then started to side with the Ukrainians, the effect was that the Russians were trying to threaten us with this dependency. So never again. The good news is, we have actually eradicated this dependency already for 90%. The last 10% is the most difficult, but you're absolutely right. We should step up and make sure that we get rid of that.

LIMBONG: Often, you know, regular people get lost in these conversations, right? So what stories do you hear from people about what is changing their lives? And what can people concerned about climate do themselves?

HOEKSTRA: I fully understand that people, on the one hand, are saying, look, I'm worried about all the news I'm getting and what this will mean for my life or for the life of my kids, and at the same time, wonder about how measures governments are taking might impact our lives. If you're working in the coal industry and the plant is going to close, well, you might intellectually agree that that is good for climate, but of course you wonder about how you're going to feed your kids. And then it matters whether there are actually jobs available in new industries and whether there's training available to make sure you get skilled in a way that gives you a decent chance for a great job in that new industry. But it is important to make sure that we facilitate these type of things, in my view.

LIMBONG: Wopke Hoekstra is the European Union climate commissioner. Commissioner, thank you so much for joining us.

HOEKSTRA: Thank you very much for having me. Transcript provided by NPR, Copyright NPR.",https://www.wunc.org/favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-28 07:59:50.460628

The logic seems impeccable: eliminate the need for paper production, which involves deforestation, energy-intensive manufacturing, and transportation, and replace it with digital storage in efficient data centers. Yet, recent scrutiny reveals this transition might not be the environmental panacea it’s often portrayed as. According to a report in FE Week, the idea of going paperless via the cloud is more “pie-in-the-sky” than practical, with hidden energy costs undermining the purported CO2 savings.

The FE Week analysis highlights how data centers, the backbone of cloud services, consume vast amounts of electricity—often from non-renewable sources—leading to emissions that can rival or exceed those from traditional paper use. For instance, storing and accessing digital files requires constant power for servers, cooling systems, and network infrastructure, which globally accounts for about 1-2% of total electricity use, per estimates from the International Energy Agency.

The Hidden Energy Appetite of the Cloud

This energy hunger is escalating with the rise of AI and big data, where cloud providers like Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure report surging carbon footprints despite green pledges. A 2024 study in Carbone4 notes that major cloud platforms such as AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud saw emissions spikes of up to 20% in recent years, driven by data center expansions. While proponents argue that cloud efficiency aggregates resources better than on-premises servers—potentially cutting emissions by a billion metric tons over four years, as forecasted by IDC in 2021—the reality for paper replacement is more nuanced.

Paper’s lifecycle emissions, from tree harvesting to recycling, are indeed significant, but digitization doesn’t eliminate them entirely. Employees still print documents for reviews or legal requirements, and the cloud’s always-on nature means idle servers burn energy around the clock. Posts on X from users like environmental researchers emphasize this, with one noting that a single data center can guzzle electricity equivalent to 50,000 homes, rivaling the airline industry’s carbon footprint, drawing from MIT Press insights.

Weighing Real-World Trade-Offs

Industry insiders point to case studies where the switch has backfired. In education sectors, as detailed in FE Week, schools aiming for paperless operations via cloud tools like Google Workspace or Microsoft 365 found that device charging and data syncing added unexpected emissions, often offsetting paper savings. A 2023 analysis in ScienceDirect on cloud computing’s carbon reduction potential suggests that while technology innovations like carbon trading could help, the industry’s growth trajectory—projected to consume 13% of global electricity by 2030, per Xomnia estimates—demands more than just migration.

Moreover, not all clouds are created equal. Providers using renewable energy, such as Google’s carbon-free data centers, offer better outcomes, but widespread adoption lags. A recent X post from AMD highlighted a packaging firm’s 10% emissions drop by optimizing cloud instances, yet this requires sophisticated strategies beyond simple paper replacement.

Policy and Innovation Imperatives

For true CO2 reductions, experts advocate hybrid approaches: combining cloud efficiencies with reduced printing through better workflows. The MIT Press Reader’s ethnographic work on server farms underscores the ecological toll, from water usage for cooling to e-waste from outdated hardware. Current news on X reveals growing sentiment for “green coding” practices, like using efficient languages such as Rust to minimize computational waste, as noted in discussions around sustainable software.

Regulatory pressures are mounting too. With the EU’s Green Deal pushing for digital sustainability reporting, companies must audit their cloud footprints. A 2025 post on X from AI at Meta discussed carbon-driven AI models reducing emissions by 9%, hinting at future tech solutions.

“It’s only very early days, but they are certainly in strong demand,” says Green.

“We’ve got this new element of second-life battery startups. That industry really didn’t exist 18 months ago.”

Salvage auction houses started regularly seeing salvage EVs in early 2024, most of which were Teslas, the first mass market electric vehicle on Australian roads.

Battery hunters are now also seeing alternatives, such as BYDs and MGs, in line with the growing number of different makes on the market. Many of the wrecked vehicles are two-to-three years old, and include a mix of complete write-offs and those that are repairable.

Andrew Chadwick, a lithium battery repair specialist, says even ageing EV batteries have plenty of life in them for other purposes.

“The output requirements for a solar battery are a lot less than what you need for an electric vehicle,” says Chadwick, from Second Life Battery Sales.

“Even if they are no longer good for an electric vehicle, with a little finessing, they’re perfect for a solar system.”

Consider an EV battery that is down to 70% capacity. While this will considerably reduce the range of the vehicle, making the car undesirable, it still holds plenty of charge for less-intensive uses.

You could even put a trailer load of second-hand EV batteries together, and power an entire music festival.

A music event in Queensland’s Sunshine Coast was postponed in June over council concerns its power usage would disrupt nearby businesses. The punk and indie-alternative festival went ahead in early September, powered by repurposed EV batteries.

“Our trailers powered the whole event for the day, including speakers, food trucks, everything, and had plenty of power left over,” says John Myler, co-founder of MyNu Energy.

“People really like them as an alternative to a diesel generator. If you’ve got sound equipment or food trucks, having a noisy, smelly diesel generator probably isn’t the atmosphere you’re looking for, whereas these batteries are silent, pollution free, and hold huge amounts of power.”

After the event, the trailers were recharged using solar, ready for their next deployment.

Life extension

At Pickles auctions, the demand for EV batteries is evident.

Financial year sales of salvage EVs increased 200% over the prior year, with the wrecked vehicles now boasting much higher price tags than combustion engine cars.

Buyers know that EVs contain some of the world’s most advanced battery technology, ready to be deployed.

About one in 10 new car sales in Australia are battery-powered, with the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 and the BYD Seal and Atto the most popular models in 2024, according to the EV Council.

After a comparably slow roll out in Australia marked by political headwinds, motoring experts believe EV sales will surge as prices become more competitive and charging infrastructure catches up.

Currently, many batteries are shredded, with the material then separated into components ready to be rebuilt into new batteries, with the process often including multiple facilities in different countries.

A repurposed battery can reduce this process, with some second-hand buyers believing they can get about 20 years of usage from them.

Myler says repurposed EV batteries are part of the solution to Australia’s intensifying energy needs.

“We need a huge amount of short term energy storage to help us transition to sustainable energy solutions,” he says.

“As a country, we need every bit of storage we can get our hands on.”",https://images.inkl.com/s3/article/lead_image/22544904/1000.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:13.367435

Shifting global dynamics India’s role as a growing solar module exporter is gaining significance as the global clean energy transition accelerates.","Indian solar panel manufacturer Waaree Energies has said it will fully cooperate with United States authorities following the launch of a formal investigation into its solar exports. The probe, initiated by the US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), focuses on whether the company misclassified Chinese-made solar cells and modules as Indian-origin products to bypass import tariffs.

According to official communication, CBP stated that it has “reasonable suspicion” that certain imports linked to Waaree were not properly labelled to reflect long-standing antidumping and countervailing duties applied to Chinese and other Asian solar products. As part of the interim measures, the agency has asked Waaree to place cash deposits while the inquiry is underway.

Company response and US expansion

In a public statement, Waaree reiterated its commitment to compliance, highlighting that it has always cooperated with US regulatory processes and will continue to do so. The company emphasised that the US remains a core market in its international expansion strategy.

Waaree Solar Americas, its US subsidiary, currently operates a 1.6 GW module manufacturing facility in Texas, with plans to scale capacity to 3.2 GW. The subsidiary recently acquired assets of Meyer Burger US to strengthen its domestic production footprint. Waaree underlined that these investments reflect its long-term goal of building a sustainable manufacturing base in the US market.

“We are a responsible corporate citizen in every country we operate in and abide by all applicable laws and regulations,” the company said in its statement.

Why the scrutiny matters

The investigation follows a petition from the American Alliance for Solar Manufacturing Trade Committee, a coalition representing US-based solar producers including First Solar and Qcells. The group has argued that some Indian solar products benefit from cost advantages by using Chinese cells without paying the required US duties.

Over the last two years, US imports of Indian solar panels have risen sharply, especially after tariffs were imposed on solar imports from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam. India’s exports now account for nearly 8% of US solar module imports, positioning it as one of the top suppliers outside Southeast Asia.

Market and financial implications

News of the investigation has already impacted Waaree’s market performance. On Friday, shares of Waaree Energies fell 6.76% on the Bombay Stock Exchange, closing at Rs 3,213.35 per share.

The inquiry also comes at a time when the US Department of Commerce has begun a separate investigation into solar photovoltaic cells and module imports from India, Indonesia, and Laos. Analysts say these probes could shape the trade environment for Indian solar exporters in the medium term.

Shifting global dynamics

India’s role as a growing solar module exporter is gaining significance as the global clean energy transition accelerates. In 2024 alone, the US imported 54 GW worth of solar modules, with India contributing 4.4 GW. While this has boosted India’s visibility in the renewable energy supply chain, regulatory hurdles such as the ongoing US probe underline the challenges of competing in tightly scrutinised international markets.

For Waaree, the outcome of the investigation will be crucial in determining not just its US strategy but also its standing in global solar trade. As the company expands its manufacturing base in the United States, compliance with trade rules will remain central to sustaining growth in one of the world’s most competitive renewable energy markets.",https://www.manufacturingtodayindia.com/cloud/2025/08/01/waaree.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 22:58:58.259322

This shift, driven by a surge in supply from early adopters trading up and aggressive manufacturer incentives, is making battery-powered cars more accessible than ever. Yet, for buyers eyeing these deals, the question looms: Does the lower upfront cost translate to long-term value, or are there hidden pitfalls in maintenance, resale, and infrastructure?

Data from recent analyses shows that the average price of a used EV now hovers around $28,000, compared to about $28,900 for a comparable used gas vehicle. This parity marks a dramatic reversal from just a few years ago when EVs commanded premiums of 20% or more. Factors like the expiration of federal tax credits for new models are pushing more inventory into the secondary market, flooding dealership lots and online platforms with options from Tesla, Nissan, and Chevrolet.

The Economics of Ownership

Beyond the sticker price, operating costs remain a strong selling point for used EVs. Charging at home equates to roughly $1.41 per gallon equivalent in fuel savings, as highlighted in reports from energy think tanks. Maintenance is often simpler too, with fewer moving parts—no oil changes or transmission repairs—potentially saving owners thousands over a vehicle’s life. However, these advantages hinge on access to reliable charging; in rural areas or apartment complexes without dedicated spots, the convenience factor diminishes sharply.

Battery degradation emerges as a critical concern for used EV shoppers. Models like the older Nissan Leaf can lose up to 30% of range after five years, according to reliability studies, which might necessitate costly replacements exceeding $5,000. Buyers are advised to scrutinize vehicle history reports and opt for certified pre-owned programs that include battery warranties, often extending coverage to 100,000 miles.

Market Dynamics and Buyer Profiles

The influx of used EVs stems partly from lease returns and fleet disposals, with companies like Hertz offloading thousands of Tesla Model 3s at steep discounts after high-profile rental challenges. This has created bargains, such as a 2021 Chevy Bolt for under $20,000, but it also underscores volatility—resale values for EVs have plummeted 25% in the past year amid broader economic pressures.

For industry insiders, the real calculus involves total cost of ownership. A study by the nonprofit publication Grist emphasizes that while the $900 price gap favors EVs, variables like insurance premiums (often 10-15% higher due to repair complexities) and regional electricity rates can tip the scales. In states with robust incentives, such as California, used EV buyers can still claim up to $4,000 in rebates, amplifying affordability.

Risks and Opportunities Ahead

Skeptics point to infrastructure gaps: Only about 50,000 public fast-chargers exist nationwide, far short of demand, leading to “range anxiety” for long-haul drivers. Moreover, emerging technologies like solid-state batteries could render current models obsolete, depressing future resale values further. Analysts from Hacker News discussions note that early adopters might face depreciation hits if autonomous features or longer-range packs become standard.

On the flip side, environmental benefits and policy tailwinds position used EVs as a smart bet for urban commuters. With global pushes toward net-zero emissions, demand is projected to surge, potentially stabilizing prices. Publications like LAist, republishing insights from Grist, argue that for budget-conscious buyers with short commutes, these vehicles offer unmatched efficiency—up to 100 miles per gallon equivalent—outweighing drawbacks.

Strategic Considerations for Buyers

Industry experts recommend thorough due diligence: Test drives should include highway speeds to assess real-world range, and third-party inspections for battery health are non-negotiable. Financing options have improved, with lenders offering EV-specific loans at competitive rates, sometimes bundled with home charger installations.

Ultimately, whether a used EV represents a good deal boils down to individual circumstances. For tech-savvy millennials in electrified cities, the savings and eco-credentials shine. But for those in colder climates where battery performance dips, or with unpredictable travel needs, traditional hybrids might edge out. As the market matures, informed decisions will separate savvy investors from those caught in the hype.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-f9b1fe2c-2781-4834-9acc-7459f07ea522.jpeg,N,,2025-09-27 22:00:07.258301

Rachel Carson, a biologist and nature writer from Pennsylvania, authored the book to expose the hidden costs of widespread pesticide use, particularly focusing on their devastating effects on birds, insects, and the broader natural environment.

Carson focused especially on the pesticide DDT (dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane) and warned . that pesticides don’t stay where we put them; they get into the soil, our water-ways, wildlife and even inside us. They move through the food chain (whether absorbed by crops or consumed by animals) exposing people, even those living far from farms, to harmful chemicals.

Many of these substances are linked to serious health risks, including respiratory problems, neurological disorders, reproductive health issues, and increased cancer risk. Decades after Silent Spring, we are still discovering just how far these chemicals can travel and how deeply they affect human health and wildlife. Carson knew that something needed to change.

Pen to Paper Activism

Carson started a whole movement without a single marth – just her written word. Before Silent Spring, she had already achieved acclaim, her books The Sea Around Us and Under the Sea Wind, introduced millions to the importance and beauty of oceans and coastal ecosystems, even impacting the opinions of those who might never be able to sea the ocean. Her writing combined poetic language with rigorous science; making the truth of human impact on the environment digestible and impactful.

What gave Silent Spring the unique ability to motivate action was its urgency. Carson’s words were not just celebratory of nature and all its beauty, but cautionary of the risk of losing it. She warned that if humanity did not change course, we could one day experience a spring without birdsong. That DDT and other pesticides would eventually kill all the birds, leaving behind a silence that would signal not peace, but deep loss and absence. The early mornings, once filled with chirping and fluttering life, would be still.

Corporate Foes Failed

Carson faced fierce opposition. Chemical companies attacked her credibility. She was dismissed as “hysterical,” and accused of being a Communist whose agricultural methods would just reduce the food supply.

At the time, she was also battling breast cancer, which she kept a secret so she could not be accused of blaming the pesticide industry for her ill health. Along with her penmanship, she testified on the dangers of these toxic chemicals before Congress, insisting that the government had the duty to protect its citizens from contaminants. Sadly, she did not live to see the full impact of her work, but the rest of the world did.

Carson ignited an environmental consciousness in the United States and the world with her urgent message laying out the intellectual and moral groundwork for what would become the modern environmental movement. Her work created the climate that made the first Earth Day, held in April 1970, possible and mobilizing 20 million Americans in a national call for clean air and water for all. This pressure directly led to the creation of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency later that year, and paved the way for landmark legislation including the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act.

In the years that followed, Carson’s warnings proved prophetic. The bald eagle, America’s national symbol, teetered on the edge of extinction. DDT caused eggshell thinning in these majestic birds. This thinning led to fragile eggs that often cracked under the weight of incubation, resulting in widespread reproductive failure. The pesticide accumulated up the food chain, affecting eagles who consumed contaminated fish and prey. Public outrage grew and by 1972, the U.S. banned DDT for agricultural use. The recovery of the bald eagle is now one of the most celebrated conservation success stories in American history.

Where Are We Now?

Rachel Carson’s legacy doesn’t belong to any single organization or policy. It belongs to anyone who listens to a bird’s song and understands that its presence is not guaranteed. It belongs to those who believe that science should serve life, not only profit. And it belongs to those who still care enough to fight for a future where springs are full of sound.

The battle against pesticides has not gone away. In her honor, help us speak out and oppose Section 453 of the Interior Appropriations Bill, which would grant pesticide manufacturers broad legal immunity, even when their products cause harm.",https://www.earthday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250927_article_silentspring.jpg,N,,2025-09-28 02:58:19.673176

The event, held on the 10th anniversary of the Paris Agreement, featured the launch of the 2025 Global Carbon Neutrality Annual Progress Report, a comprehensive study on the world's climate transition.

Framed around the theme ""Global Progress and China's Practice,"" the forum opened with a dialogue featuring Liu Yang, Deputy Director General, Department of Climate Change, Ministry of Ecology and Environment, China, who outlined China's latest progress toward its ""dual carbon"" goals and its newly announced NDC. Her remarks were followed by international perspectives, including a call to action from Patricia Espinosa Cantellano, former UNFCCC Executive Secretary.

For the first time, the report is guided by a 13-member international Advisory Committee, co-chaired by He Kebin of Tsinghua and Erik Solheim, former UNEP Executive Director, underscoring its mix of Chinese leadership and global perspective.

This year's report identifies a ""profound structural imbalance"": while ambition and innovation are driving progress, they are being severely undermined by bottlenecks in climate finance and international cooperation. This has created a critical ""implementation gap"" between stated goals and tangible results.

The report's rigorous methodology has earned praise from international climate leaders. ""This is the type of research into climate that reinforces our sense of purpose and our sense of hope,"" said Patricia Espinosa Cantellano. She added, ""What stands out is the four-part framework — target, policy, action, effectiveness — a game-changer for tracking climate progress.""

The findings and dialogues from the forum are intended to provide a scientific basis for shaping stronger NDCs and informing the critical discussions at the upcoming COP30 in Brazil. By highlighting both the irreversible momentum of the green transition and the urgent need to close the implementation gap, the event concluded with a strong call for renewed international efforts to translate commitments into concrete action.",https://www.prnewswire.com/content/dam/prnewswire/icons/2019-Q4-PRN-Icon-32-32.png,N,,2025-09-27 19:02:00.023761

The U.S. Department of Energy announced a record $9.63 billion loan to BlueOval SK for the construction of three battery manufacturing plants in the country, which was finalized in 2024.

Once the three locations are up and running, with one in Tennessee and two in Kentucky, they're expected to deliver more than 120 gigawatt-hours of battery production each year.

This move will strengthen the domestic supply in the U.S. and was estimated to add 5,000 construction jobs and 7,500 operations jobs across the facilities, according to the DOE at the time of the announcement.

Bolstering the development of more sustainable transportation technologies is key to achieving our clean energy goals and reducing the proliferation of gas-powered vehicles that spew planet-warming tailpipe pollution and run on dirty fuels.

InsideEVs also reported that this investment is being made while Ford faces pressure from local rival General Motors and tough competition from other automakers like Hyundai and Kia.

Additionally, the outlet noted that Ford's EV sales have declined in the first half of the year, with F-150 Lightning sales dipping 17%, and E-Transit sales down 34%.

Still, the Ford F-150 Lightning beat out Tesla's Cybertruck in sales numbers for the second quarter in a row, proving that it's headed in the right direction.

It doesn't help that the Trump administration's actions to cut environmentally friendly programs, credits, and rebates — reversing course from the previous administration's push to support them — are having a negative impact on EV sales in the country.

GM, which claims to be the largest OEM battery cell producer in North America, has its own joint venture in Tennessee with LG Energy Solution under the name Ultium Cells.

In fact, both Ford and GM are developing more affordable lithium-iron-phosphate battery cells, which Reuters notes are gaining traction in the industry.

Notably, both companies are partnering with Redwood Materials for recycling efforts to build up the circular economy in the U.S. and diversify the supply chain.

The company claims it has been able to recover lithium, cobalt, nickel, and copper with a rate of above 95% efficiency.

Ford's CEO Jim Farley shared that the company aims to retool its Louisville Assembly Plant to deliver a next-generation electric truck to replace the aging Escape and Lincoln Corsair crossover models in what it's calling a Model T moment.

The company's new midsize electric truck will be built on a Universal EV Platform and is expected to debut in 2027 with an MSRP of around $30,000, proving that its EV plan is still moving forward with vigor.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BlueOval-SKimage-recghhCJGrfcLipds.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 19:01:44.916347

The numbers are huge: the report estimates that 6.3 to 9.5 million job years of new construction work will be from now to 2050. This is equivalent to an average of 235,000 to 350,000 ongoing new construction jobs over then next quarter-century – a 20-30% step increase in overall construction employment in Canada.

The report estimated the construction job-creation spurred by three big categories of investment:

Non-emitting energy production and transmission (including hydro, wind, solar, nuclear, and geothermal).

Energy-efficient industrial and commercial building construction and retrofits, and construction of district energy systems.

Sustainable transportation infrastructure (including urban transit, inter-urban high=speed rail, and electric vehicle charging infrastructure).

About half of the new jobs would arise in commercial and industrial building activity, including new construction, deep-energy-saving retrofits, and construction of high-tech district energy systems (which integrate heating and cooling systems with new geothermal, battery, and other technologies to achieve huge gains in energy efficiency).

The job-creation estimates do not include indirect jobs created in the supply chains that feed these investment projects, nor the downstream or induced jobs that would result from additional employment and consumer spending by hundreds of thousands of construction workers. In short, these huge investments will stimulate an unprecedented boom in demand for construction labour.

Sean Strickland, President of the CBTU, concluded these investments are an enormous opportunity for building trades workers:

Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.
A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption.","WASHINGTON D.C., DC — The White House is moving forward with a deal that would allow the U.S. government to take a small equity stake in a Canadian company that is developing one of the world's largest lithium mines in northern Nevada, an official said.

The Department of Energy and Lithium Americas, developer of the proposed Thacker Pass lithium mine and processing plant about 200 miles north of Reno, have agreed on changes to a $2.3 billion federal loan that could allow the project to move forward to extract the silver-white metal used in electric vehicle batteries. General Motors has pledged more than $900 million to help develop Thacker Pass, which holds enough lithium to build 1 million electric vehicles annually.

The proposed equity stake in Vancouver-based Lithium Americas is the latest example of President Donald Trump's administration intervening directly in private companies. The government is getting a 10% stake in Intel through the conversion of billions in previously granted government funds and pledges. The administration spent $400 million of taxpayer money in July on MP Materials stock to make the U.S government the biggest owner in the Las Vegas rare earths miner. Trump also made a deal with Nvidia and AMD to give the U.S. government a 15% cut of revenue from selling certain chips to China.

A White House official declined to specify the size of the U.S. stake in Lithium Americas, but said it would be “very small” — less than 10% — and serve as “a cash buffer” for the company. Lithium Americas asked the Energy Department to restructure the federal loan, which was approved last year by the Biden administration.

“We support the project moving forward,'' said the White House official, who was granted anonymity in order to talk about a deal that is not yet completed.

“Critical minerals like lithium are very important' to boost the U.S. economy and restore domestic manufacturing,"" the official said, adding: “We're trying to do this in a way that is fair to the taxpayers. We don't believe in free money.”

A spokesman for Lithium Americas declined to comment, but the company said in a statement that it is in discussions with DOE and General Motors regarding the DOE loan.

“The topics of these discussions include certain conditions precedent to draw on the DOE Loan and associated loan specifics, as well as incremental requests from the DOE for potential further conditions” to gain access to the loan, the statement said.

Jim Cain, a GM spokesman, said Friday the company remains “confident in the project” but declined to comment on ongoing negotiations.

Thacker Pass is considered crucial to building a domestic supply chain to make batteries for electric vehicles and other electronics. It also represents a rare point of agreement between Trump and former President Joe Biden. Both Republicans and Democrats support the mine project as a way to boost American critical minerals production and cut reliance on China, the world’s largest lithium processor.

Thacker Pass is expected to produce 40,000 metric tons of battery-quality lithium carbonate per year in its first phase, enough to help power 800,000 EVs.

Environmental groups and leaders of three tribes spent years fighting the mine, which they say borders the sacred site of a massacre of more than two dozen Native Americans in 1865.

The DOE under Biden backed the project as a way to help mitigate climate change by speeding the shift away from fossil fuels.

Trump has aggressively moved away from confronting climate change, labeling it “ the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world ” in a speech this week at the United Nations. “If you don’t get away from the green energy scam, your country is going to fail,"" Trump told world leaders on Tuesday.

The bid to boost the lithium project comes as the pace of U.S. electric vehicle sales has slowed as the industry struggles to attract mainstream buyers who remain concerned about charging infrastructure and affordability.

A law approved by congressional Republicans and signed by Trump is likely to deal another blow to EV adoption. The massive tax law approved this summer phases out federal incentives for new and used EV purchases, effective at the end of the month.

Consumers rushed to dealer lots this quarter to take advantage of the credits before the phase-out takes effect. The credits have saved car buyers up to $7,500 off the cost of their EV.

Without the incentives, many automakers will struggle to make sales.

Besides batteries for cars, cell phones and other electronics, lithium is also used in the manufacture of glass, chemicals and pharmaceuticals. Lithium batteries are also used to store wind and solar power.

Tapping into solar power at an individual level can just as easily contribute to avoiding those outcomes while saving yourself a few bucks.","Ampion has announced an impressive advancement in its community solar power service, according to Solar Power World.

The company runs a community solar credit business, where customers pay for a portion of a large-scale solar plant's output and receive a proportional credit on their utility bill in return. This allows residents to benefit from the savings of solar power without using solar power directly. Ampion generally guarantees at least 10% savings with this scheme. It says it's possible to cover an entire utility bill with these solar energy credits.

Traditionally, this plan has required homeowners to be in the same state as the solar energy farm, but Ampion has just announced its ability to start participating across state lines.

Ampion's model hinges heavily on government policy to exist. Local jurisdictions have to mandate that utility providers accept solar energy credits and attach them to specific subscriber accounts.

By that token, this new Synthetic Community Solar program is made possible by a federal credit targeting low-income homes. Ampion hopes that this credit will incentivize the creation of more solar energy generation to plug into its system, since it will be easier to sell credits.

Utility-scale solar is the cheapest energy source available, making its efficient transmission an important bottleneck. Providing creative means for residents to support solar through credits like Ampion's can not only save people money, but it also helps to displace dirty energy sources on the grid.

Fossil fuels, such as gas and coal, are among the primary drivers of increasingly destructive weather events, including floods and droughts. These disasters have massive housing and agricultural costs.

Tapping into solar power at an individual level can just as easily contribute to avoiding those outcomes while saving yourself a few bucks. EnergySage has a free online tool that can connect homeowners to vetted local installers. These experts can save up to $10,000 on installation costs thanks to rebates and credits.

Ampion was excited about the potential of its new Synthetic Solar Credit program.

""We're grateful to offer a solution that helps developers navigate the complexities of community solar across different state programs while providing additional savings to low-income subscribers. This initiative directly supports our mission of making renewable energy accessible everywhere, for everyone,"" said Ampion CEO Nate Owen.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/EFaLTOmaxKn2m0XlveeqzQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/the_cool_down_737/5d329219f10fccd5e33593a44831dbb9,N,,2025-09-27 19:02:09.117845

Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.
Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.
Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.
""For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,"" the staff wrote.","Private investment firms that are helping finance America's artificial intelligence race and the huge buildout of energy-hungry data centers are getting interested in the local utilities that deliver electricity to regular customers — and the servers that power AI.

Billions of dollars from such firms are now flowing toward electric utilities in places including New Mexico, Texas, Wisconsin and Minnesota that deliver power to more than 150 million customers across millions of miles of power lines.

""The reason is very simple: because there's a lot of money to be made,"" said Greg Brown, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill professor of finance who researches private equity and hedge funds.

Private investment firms that have done well investing in infrastructure over the last 15 years now have strong incentives to add data centers, power plants and the services that support them at a time of rapid expansion and spiking demand ignited by the late 2022 debut of OpenAI's ChatGPT, Brown said.

BlackRock's CEO Larry Fink said as much in a July interview on CNBC, saying infrastructure is ""at the beginning of a golden age.""

""We believe that there's a need for trillions of dollars investing in infrastructure related to our power grids, AI, the whole digitization of the economy"" and energy, Fink said.

In recent weeks, private equity firm Blackstone has sought regulatory approval to buy out a pair of utilities, Albuquerque-based Public Service Company of New Mexico and Lewisville, Texas-based Texas New Mexico Power Co.

Wisconsin earlier this year granted the buyout of the parent of Superior Water, Light and Power and the owner of Northern Indiana Public Service Co. last year sold a 19.9% stake in the utility to Blackstone.

However, a fight has erupted in Minnesota over the buyout of the parent of Duluth-based Minnesota Power and the outcome could determine how such firms expand their holdings in an industry that's a nexus between regular people, gargantuan data centers and the power sources they share.

Under the proposed deal, a BlackRock subsidiary and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board would buy out the publicly traded Allete, parent of Minnesota Power, which provides power to 150,000 customers and owns a variety of power sources, including coal, gas, wind and solar.

Both sides of the fight have attracted influential players ahead of a possible Oct. 3 vote by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission. Raising the stakes is the potential that Google could build a data center there, a lucrative prospect for whoever owns Minnesota Power.

Opponents of the acquisition suspect that BlackRock is only interested in squeezing bigger profits from regular ratepayers. Allete makes the opposite argument, that BlackRock can show more patience because it is free of the short-term burdens of publicly traded companies.

Opponents also worry that a successful Minnesota Power buyout will launch more such deals around the U.S. and drive up electric bills for homes.

""It's no secret that private equity is extremely aggressive in chasing profits, and when it comes to utilities, the profit motive lands squarely on the backs of ratepayers who don't have a choice of who they buy their electricity from,"" said Karlee Weinmann of the Energy and Policy Institute, which pushes utilities to keep rates low and use renewable energy sources.

The buyout proposals come at a time when electricity bills are rising fast across the U.S., and growing evidence suggests that the bills of some regular Americans are rising to subsidize the rapid buildout of power plants and power lines to supply the gargantuan energy needs of Big Tech's data centers.

Mark Ellis, a former utility executive-turned-consumer advocate who gave expert testimony against the Minnesota Power buyout, said he's talked to private equity firms that want to get into the business of electric utilities.

""It's just a matter of what's the price and will the regulator approve it,"" Ellis said. ""The challenge is they're not going to come up for sale very often.""

That's because electric utilities are seen as valuable long-term investments that earn around 10% returns not on the electricity they deliver, but the upcharge that utility regulators allow on capital investments, like upgrading poles, wires and substations.

That gives utility owners the incentive to spend more so they can make more money, critics say.

The fight over Minnesota Power resembles some of the battles erupting around the U.S. where residents don't want a data center campus plunked down next to them.

Building trades unions and the administration of Democratic Gov. Tim Walz, who appointed or reappointed all five utility commissioners, are siding with Allete and BlackRock.

On the other side are the state attorney general's office and the industrial interests that buy two-thirds of Minnesota Power's electricity, including U.S. Steel and other owners of iron ore mines, Enbridge-run oil pipelines and pulp and paper mills.

In its petition, Allete told regulators that, under BlackRock's ownership, Minnesota Power's operations, strategy and values wouldn't change and that it doesn't expect the buyout price — $6.2 billion, including $67 a share for stockholders at a 19% premium — to affect electric rates.

In essence, Allete — which solicited bids for a buyout — argues that BlackRock's ownership will benefit the public because, under it, the utility will have an easier time raising the money it needs to comply with Minnesota's law requiring utilities to get 100% of their electricity from carbon-free sources by 2040.

Allete has projected needing to spend $4.3 billion on transmission and clean energy projects over five years.

However, opponents say Allete's suggestion that it'll struggle to raise money is unfounded, and undercut by its own filings with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in which it says it is ""well positioned"" to meet its financing needs.

It hasn't been smooth sledding for BlackRock.

In July, an administrative law judge, Megan J. McKenzie, recommended that the commission reject the deal, saying that the evidence reveals the buyout group's ""intent to do what private equity is expected to do – pursue profit in excess of public markets through company control.""

In recent days, a utility commission staff analysis echoed McKenzie's concerns.

They suggested that private investors could simply load up Minnesota Power's parent with massive debts, borrow at a relatively low interest rate and turn a fat profit margin from the utility commission granting a generous rate of return.

""For the big investors in private equity, this is a win-win,"" the staff wrote. ""For the ratepayers of the highly leveraged utility, this represents paying huge profits to the owners if the private equity 'wins' and dealing with a bankrupt utility provider if it loses – it is a lose-lose.""

But its long-term plan is to take gas largely out of the electricity system: to reach “grid net zero” (95% carbon-free electricity) by 2030.
Vast amounts will need to be invested – which will come, ultimately, from Britain’s electricity bills.","British electricity prices, which were among the lowest in Europe in the early 2000s, are now very high by global standards.

Only Denmark, Germany and Ireland have more expensive domestic electricity, while industry pays at least 50% more for electricity in the UK than it does in most of the rest of Europe – and over three times more than in the US. Although this is bad for everyone, particularly poorer households, arguably the real crisis is in industry.

Energy-intensive manufacturers have been hit hard, leading to the closure of factories such as the CF Fertilisers plant in Billingham, and the Ineos oil refinery in Grangemouth; the steel industry is on its knees. Lowering energy bills is one of the current Government’s core “missions”, but the short-term outlook isn’t great, with the typical domestic bill set to be 44% higher this winter than four years ago.

Why are British prices so high?

The short-term cause is the Ukraine War. The average household “duel-fuel” bill (of which electricity makes up a bit more than half) went from around £1,200 per year in 2020 to £3,549 in October 2022, then down again, before creeping up to £1,720 now. The underlying causes are complex: they include an ageing national grid; high network operating costs; a lack of storage; and the practicalities of being on an island (in Europe, electricity can be transmitted to where it’s needed more easily). Finally, there are “policy costs”: levies to support green energy and vulnerable customers. Of a typical electricity bill, under Ofgem’s price cap (the highest tariff providers can charge), about 20% consists of network costs; 15% is the energy supplier’s costs; 11% is policy costs; 5% is VAT; and suppliers’ profits are 2.4%. But the biggest chunk, around 45% of a bill, is the wholesale cost of energy, which is largely dictated by the price of natural gas, which is both high and volatile, for reasons beyond government control.

Why is it underpinned by the price of gas?

UK non-fossil fuel sources – wind, solar, hydroelectricity, bioenergy and nuclear – generated around 58% of the UK’s electricity last year, with wind alone providing around a third of the country’s power since 2023. And wind and solar are, in theory, very cheap. However, much electricity for the grid is bought short-term, with an auction for every half-hour period, and the price is determined by the most expensive provider for that moment. Electricity is bought from generators – wind farms, power plants – in “merit order”: cheapest first. But the price for all is set by the last or “marginal” generator needed; and in the UK that’s almost invariably a gas-powered turbine. This is known as “marginal pricing”.

Why on earth use this system?

Electrical grids must be exactly balanced between supply and demand. In the UK, gas-powered plants are the only practical means of topping up the grid during a sudden shortage. Nuclear reactors can’t quickly be switched on and off; wind and solar are intermittent, and we can’t yet store enough of their output. For now, the only way to be sure of keeping the lights on when there’s a surge in demand involves gas. As a matter of economics, many, from Boris Johnson to the energy supplier Octopus, have questioned marginal pricing. But both Labour and Tory governments have concluded that it is the most efficient system; it is used across most of Europe and the US.

So how much do renewables cost?

In theory, the green part of “policy costs” comprises under 10% of our electricity bills. But the true price is much higher. Connecting the grid to wind and solar farms is expensive, as is back-up and grid-balancing. In 2024/25, about £2.7bn was spent balancing the grid – for instance, paying wind farms to “curtail” generation when the system was overloaded. Besides, high gas-derived prices often govern real renewable prices anyway. The UK relies heavily on gas, because it got rid of coal-fired stations. Marginal pricing means gas set the price of electricity 98% of the time in Britain in 2023, compared with the European average of 58% (in France, prices are mostly set by cheaper nuclear, and in Poland, by coal).

What is the Government’s solution?

To help industry, Labour is exempting around 7,000 companies from some levies, with extra support for those in energy-intensive sectors such as chemicals, steel and glass. But its long-term plan is to take gas largely out of the electricity system: to reach “grid net zero” (95% carbon-free electricity) by 2030. The UK will need about twice the generating capacity as it did pre-renewables, and a much more complex, dispersed grid. It is investing several billion pounds in renewables, aiming to double onshore wind capacity, triple solar and quadruple offshore wind by 2030; it is also investing heavily in nuclear, in projects such as Sizewell C in Suffolk. At the same time, it aims to improve network capacity and boost grid storage, with vast batteries and pumped hydropower. The hope is that, in the future, the marginal price will seldom be set by gas – greatly driving down UK energy costs, cutting emissions and creating high-quality green jobs.

Is this realistic?

Many are sceptical. Dieter Helm, the Oxford energy economist, doubts that renewables will reduce bills long-term. Decarbonising the grid by 2030 would be a massive undertaking. Big British infrastructure projects usually run hugely over budget and schedule. Mechanisms for balancing a mostly renewable grid are untested, and will be expensive. Vast amounts will need to be invested – which will come, ultimately, from Britain’s electricity bills. Manufacturing is likely to be lost to nations with cheaper power. Although reducing emissions is a worthy aim, if those emissions only go abroad, it won’t help the climate. Helm thinks it would be better to move more slowly, and to be cautious about phasing out fossil fuels.

Marginal pricing: the alternatives

The present Government has looked into having a “split market” – separate pricing systems for renewables and the rest. A linked idea, which has been pushed and fought against by opposing armies of lobbyists, is “zonal pricing”: replacing a single national price for electricity with different prices for different zones, lower in areas with cheap generation nearby.

Industrial areas such as Teesside and Grangemouth that are near offshore wind farms could, with lower prices, attract energy intensive industries such as steel, fertilisers, or data centres. Wind farms would no longer need to be paid to be turned off. Octopus Energy CEO Greg Jackson thinks the scheme would bring costs down by £5bn a year. The Government rejected zonal pricing in July. It was deemed too politically difficult: it would risk creating a “postcode lottery”, with customers in some regions paying more than others. Ministers also concluded that it would be too difficult to implement. Marginal pricing is a fiendishly complex issue, but it was thought to be the best method of setting prices in a way that incentivises investors and generators, and ensures a reliable supply. Ministers are nervous of anything that might interfere with security of supply.",https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/v8EJn4Xg9jEsWfhUYiLzyV.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 22:00:14.258379

Ever wonder if life is really different in a blue or red state? Recently, u/ftwclem asked, ""If you moved from a red state to a blue state, did it actually get better?"" They admitted to staying in Texas for family reasons but regularly daydreaming about what life might be like somewhere more politically aligned with their values. Is the grass really greener — or does everything feel just as hopeless, no matter where you live? Here's what 19 people who made the move had to say:

1. ""I moved from Texas to California in 2015 as a poor single mother with two elementary-aged children. Life improved so much that it is hard to quantify or describe all the ways. There are so many social safety nets in California, where there were almost none in Texas. Community college is free, and I was able to go all the way through and get my master’s degree thanks to state-funded programs. My children and I now live comfortably without assistance. The quality of life, the people, the beauty, and culture that we're surrounded by in California are priceless. You could not pay me enough to live in a red state again.""

2. ""Though the political makeup of the city I moved from and the city I moved to are roughly the same, Ohio's state-level policies threatened me in a way Illinois's absolutely do not. And since I can handle the increased cost of living, it's worth it to me (though feasibly one could move to an inexpensive part of Illinois, if you're not as concerned about day-to-day interactions).""

Published September 26, 2025 at 10:14 AM CDT

A company cofounded by Bill Gates will explore building a reactor in Kansas. It would generate power without emissions, but environmental groups have concerns.

One of the companies leading the charge to deploy safer, smaller, faster-to-build nuclear reactors is hoping to find a site for one in Kansas.

TerraPower, cofounded by former Microsoft CEO Bill Gates, began construction last month on its first power plant of this kind in southwest Wyoming as a $4 billion demonstration project cofunded by the U.S. Department of Energy.

Now it is interested in building one in Kansas to generate power in utility company Evergy’s service area.

TerraPower, Evergy and state officials announced this week that they have signed a memorandum of understanding to explore the prospects. They issued a news release featuring enthusiastic quotes from Democratic Kansas Gov. Laura Kelly and both of the state’s Republican U.S. senators.

“We need to explore all available sources to power the future of our great state,” Kelly said.

“Nuclear energy is the way of the future,” U.S. Senator Roger Marshall said.

But the reaction from clean energy advocates in Kansas is mixed. The news sparked some interest in emissions-free power generation, but also concern about the price tag and whether the project would attract more data centers to the region with significant needs for electricity and water. Kansas faces water sustainability challenges.

“ We want to make sure that the plans we’re making for the clean energy future are affordable,” said Dorothy Barnett, executive director of the Climate + Energy Project. “ I am increasingly concerned for our friends and neighbors who are struggling to pay their utility bills.”

Kansas regulators signed off on $128 million in rate hikes for Evergy this week.

The Sierra Club said Kansas has financially smarter options for powering its economy.

“We’ve got plenty of roofs here in Kansas,” said Zack Pistora, state director for the Sierra Club in Kansas. “Or backyards that could say, ‘Hey, we’ll be glad to lease our roof or our land for solar, Evergy. You can pay us instead of paying this out-of-state company.’”

Looking for potential sites in Kansas

An official with the Kansas Department of Commerce said regional power demand is projected to more than double over the next decade. That’s according to the regional grid operator, the Southwest Power Pool.

“We need to be ready for this,” said Paul Hughes, the department’s lead on matters involving megaprojects. “And I’m not saying it has to be this (nuclear) project, but we do need to act in ensuring that Kansas isn’t effectively blocked out of future opportunities because of the availability or unavailability of power in the state.”

Asked why TerraPower is specifically considering Kansas, Hughes noted that Evergy already has experience with nuclear energy. It owns Wolf Creek Nuclear Generating Station 60 miles south of Topeka, the state’s only nuclear plant. By contrast, some states don’t have nuclear power and some have restrictions or outright bans.

This fall Kansas State University launched a nuclear engineering program.

It’s not yet clear where in Kansas TerraPower would want to build a nuclear reactor. The company will need to consider proximity to transmission lines and to a workforce. It will also need to find communities interested in the project, and will need to ensure that any potential sites have stable underground geology.

Hughes said the state commerce department will help facilitate the discussions.

“We can help communities articulate their interest in the project or disinterest in the project,” he said.

Communities that aren’t interested will be passed over for consideration, he said.

“These (projects) just don’t go well when you try to force feed them into a community — and all parties to this agreement understand that,” Hughes said.

Advanced nuclear reactors and TerraPower

For decades, logistics and expenses have held nuclear energy back. Conventional nuclear plants not only have high price tags but also a propensity to greatly exceed their budgets and to take longer than expected to build.

Modular advanced nuclear designs are smaller than conventional plants and represent a potential industry turning point that is decades in the making. The companies developing them say they will be safer and faster to build.

However, none of the designs like TerraPower’s are yet in commercial operation in the U.S.

The Trump administration has thrown its weight behind advanced nuclear power, drawing a mix of praise and criticism. This spring it unveiled executive orders and plans to reconsider some regulations, press for approval of projects, and use the controversial Department of Government Efficiency to overhaul the nation’s independent regulator of nuclear energy.

Kansas officials said they’re aware of the development.

“ It is on our radar,” Hughes said. “We want to make sure that (Kansas is) doing this safely and that’s what we’ll do.”

TerraPower expects its Wyoming project to come online this decade. The company says that the project will create 1,600 jobs during peak construction, after which about 250 jobs will remain at the site for day-to-day operations.

The company’s design, the Natrium reactor, uses liquid sodium rather than water to envelop uranium fuel. This liquid has a far higher boiling point – 1,600 degrees Fahrenheit – which the company says adds to the reactor’s safety.

The reactor heats the liquid sodium, which in turn heats pipes full of molten salt. The pipes carry the molten salt to a storage tank that serves as a power battery. The salt heats tubes of water, creating pressurized steam. The steam turns a turbine to generate electricity. The salt then cycles back to the reactor area to be heated up again.

The battery represents a key departure from a conventional plant such as Evergy’s Wolf Creek. The facility would store the heated molten salt in a tank and draw upon it as needed to meet demand.

Wolf Creek can’t adjust its output to the ebb and flow of electricity demand or to account for sunny and windy weather generating more from solar and wind farms.

What do clean energy advocates think?

Barnett, from the Climate + Energy Project, wants to hear more details.

Generating electricity without pumping out greenhouse gases is “one of the most important things as we think about our climate future,” she said.

Additionally, her organization wants power plants to pair well with renewable energy and is interested in the efforts of advanced nuclear designs to do that.

But she’s skeptical because many people already struggle to pay their utility bills and Evergy not only got the greenlight this week from Kansas regulators for $128 million in rate hikes, it also got permission this summer to build and co-own two new natural gas-burning power plants.

“ At what point is it just too expensive for us to just keep having Evergy build and build?” Barnett said.

The Wyoming project suggests that an advanced nuclear facility would cost billions.

Also, she has questions about potential indirect effects. For example, even if the reactor doesn’t require much water because it uses liquid sodium as a coolant, data centers do. This means the reactor’s impact on water use in Kansas could depend on how the power gets used.

Pistora, with the Sierra Club in Kansas, said Evergy and TerraPower will need to answer a slew of pressing questions.

“Does this make economic sense from a cost and benefit standpoint?” he asked. “What about the water use? What about the (nuclear) waste disposal? … Where are we going to get this nuclear material and where’s it going to be mined?”

A few utility-scale battery projects have been proposed in Kansas, Pistora said, which could help store energy from renewable sources or existing fossil fuel plants for when the power is needed.

Like Barnett, he pointed to the recent approval of Evergy’s requests to hike its rates and to build new natural gas power plants.

“ Now we’re hearing about nuclear, which is the most expensive power out there,” he said. “Why are we going for these big-ticket, capital-intensive, expensive energy projects?”

About 27% (3.2 GW) of the solar capacity added so far in 2025 is in Texas.
In 2024, Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility-scale solar capacity.
Which only adds to the importance of the solar sector in the United States.","Despite the best efforts of the Trump administration, solar and storage dominate the United States’ power growth in the first half of 2025. The Energy Information Agency reported the statistics recently and pointed out that the solar and storage sectors in the United States are the dominant force in the American energy landscape, and will continue to be for the foreseeable future. US developers added 12 gigawatts (GW) of new utility-scale solar electric generating capacity to the grid in H1 of 2025.

US developers plan to add another 21 GW to the grid in the second half of the year

Adding to the already impressive 12 gigawatts that energy developers brought to the grid this year, the additional 21 GW planned for the rest of the year would set a record for capacity additions if all 64 GW come online this year.

The Energy Information Agency revealed that wind, solar, and battery storage have become more prevalent options for new capacity in modern-day America. Booyed by the embrace of alternative energy solutions in Texas. About 27% (3.2 GW) of the solar capacity added so far in 2025 is in Texas.

In 2024, Texas surpassed California as the state with the most utility-scale solar capacity. Pointing to the change in the type of energy being developed in the United States over the past two decades.

Coal-fired power plants face an uncertain future in the United States energy sector

While the Trump administration has implemented the new executive orders aimed at keeping the lights on for the coal sector in the United States, it’s hard to argue with facts. And the evidence suggests that the American public is wary of coal power and instead favors the safe and reliable energy creation that solar, wind, and battery storage present.

More than 3.6 GW of coal-powered energy has now been delayed or canceled, including plans to retire the coal-fired Units 1 and 2 of Brandon Shore. Which only adds to the importance of the solar sector in the United States.

The US Energy Information Agency has stated that “If current retirement intentions are realized, coal-fired power plants will account for 71% of the retired capacity this year, followed by natural gas (19%).”

“There is considerable downside risk for the solar industry if the federal permitting environment creates more constraints for solar projects. The solar industry is already navigating dramatic policy changes as a result of HR1. Further uncertainty from federal policy actions is making the business environment for the solar industry incredibly challenging.” – Michelle Davis, head of solar research at Wood Mackenzie

The SEIA wrote to DOI Secretary Doug Burgum last month, raising its concerns

The Solar Energy Industries Association wrote a letter to the Department of the Interior Secretary, Doug Burgum, who is a Trump appointee, regarding their concerns over the current administration’s policies.

“Solar and storage are the backbone of America’s energy future, delivering the majority of new power to the grid at the lowest cost to families and businesses. Instead of unleashing this American economic engine, the Trump administration is deliberately stifling investment, which is raising energy costs for families and businesses, and jeopardizing the reliability of our electric grid. But no matter what policies this administration releases, the solar and storage industry will continue to grow, because the market is demanding what we’re delivering: reliable, affordable, American-made energy.” – SEIA president and CEO Abigail Ross Hopper.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released data indicating that total U.S. CO2 emissions fell by 20% over the period, even as population rose by 14%.
The result is a 30% decrease in per capita CO2 emissions.
The reductions by state range from 49% in Maryland down to 1% in Mississippi.
Transportation is generally the biggest factor on the east and west costs, with electric power the primary source in 18 states.","There is some very good news on the climate front. Every U.S. state reduced per capita carbon dioxide emissions from primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2023. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released data indicating that total U.S. CO2 emissions fell by 20% over the period, even as population rose by 14%. The result is a 30% decrease in per capita CO2 emissions.

The reductions by state range from 49% in Maryland down to 1% in Mississippi. Texas had 24% lower per capita CO2 emissions in 2023 than in 2005, a remarkable amount given that the state experienced 77% growth in real output, a 34% increase in population, and an eight-fold surge in oil and gas production. States at or near the same or smaller levels of reduction include California, Vermont, New York, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and several others. These areas exhibit wide differences in climate policy, geographic size, industrial base, rate of economic development, and virtually every other measure, indicating the diversity of approaches available to address this critical issue.

In Maryland, the key to the decrease was reducing coal from 56% of its input fuel for electric generation in 2005 to only 5% in 2023; natural gas increased from 4% to 41% over the period, and some wind and solar came online. Similar coal retirement and replacement went on in all of the states with the largest reductions.

Transportation is generally the biggest factor on the east and west costs, with electric power the primary source in 18 states. Texas is one of only four states where the industrial sector (which includes manufacturing and agriculture) is the largest source of CO2, another underlying indicator of economic vitality.

While the sheer size and economic strength of the state results in a high level of overall emissions, the reductions indicate genuine and meaningful gains. In fact, Texas has improved dramatically in terms of far lower emissions on both a per capita and a per million dollars in gross product basis than in the past. These reductions take on even greater significance in light of recent scientific research at MIT which reveals that declines in carbon concentrations can be a catalyst to climate regeneration.

A key factor in the improvement in U.S. emissions has been increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half the CO2 per unit of energy as coal, as well as gains in wind and solar. Significant reductions in carbon dioxide released even as business activity has flourished is good news indeed, especially when coupled with credible analysis indicating that such efforts can move the needle on crucial climate issues. Much remains to be done, but the success is notable. Stay safe!",https://www.oaoa.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Ray-Perryman-24.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 15:00:53.148435
,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-27 17:55:58+00:00,News From The States,"Northwest Native Nations could lose hundreds of millions in federal funding, report says",News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/northwest-native-nations-could-lose-hundreds-millions-federal-funding-report-says,"A new report from Portland State University found that budget cuts under President Donald Trump’s new spending bill threaten nearly half of federal funding allocated to federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native nations last year.
Fast Horse says there are serious concerns among Northwest tribes about further cuts to vital programs ranging from health and wellness to early childhood education.
Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.
In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes.
In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.","A new report from Portland State University found that budget cuts under President Donald Trump’s new spending bill threaten nearly half of federal funding allocated to federally recognized Native American and Alaska Native nations last year.

Roughly $530 million of the $1.19 billion allocated to Northwest tribal nations in fiscal year 2024 — used to fulfill the federal government’s trust and treaty obligations to Native American and Alaska Native tribes — is at risk of being cut. The congressionally allocated funds serve myriad functions for tribes in the Northwest, including providing clean drinking water, affordable housing, schools, transit and land management. Funding is decided by Congress on a yearly basis and can be disbursed over a period of time that exceeds the calendar year it is allocated.

“All across the board tribes are worried about the funding cuts that are happening right now,” said Serina Fast Horse, who is Lakota and Blackfeet and serves as the co-director of the Northwest Environmental Justice Center, which provides grant application assistance and advising to Indigenous communities in the Northwest.

Fast Horse says there are serious concerns among Northwest tribes about further cuts to vital programs ranging from health and wellness to early childhood education. The report warns of vulnerabilities to programs and grants that tribes rely on for resilience in the face of climate change, like improving home weatherization, managing forestland and renovating aging homes. Federal dollars to help Northwest tribes bolster their infrastructure against the increasing threats from wildfire, drought and sea-level rise could also be slashed.

The Portland State report found millions in Clean Air Act funding could also go away — the Environmental Protection Agency earmarked nearly $2 million in 2024 for Northwest tribes in a series of grants for monitoring air quality and pollution. Much of the congressionally allocated funding has yet to be distributed to tribes and is now at risk of being cut altogether.

The report demonstrates how proposed major reductions across the federal government, including at the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of the Interior and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association, could reverberate across Indian Country.

Tribal officials shared concerns that drastic cuts could cause the federal government to fall short of trust and treaty obligations that mandate the federal government support tribal services, uphold tribal sovereignty and protect tribal treaty resources — responsibilities that courts, including the U.S. Supreme Court, have repeatedly upheld.

“All the funding reductions addressing clean water, air and dealing with climate change have impacts on the Tribes’ culture and treaty protected resources,” said William E. Ray Jr., chair of the Klamath Tribes.

Researchers declined to disclose specific projects at risk of elimination for fear of retaliation, and a number of tribes and tribal organizations declined to comment to InvestigateWest, citing similar concerns.

“Trump and Congressional Republicans are wreaking havoc on Tribal communities with their ‘Big, Ugly BETRAYAL’ of a law that arbitrarily cuts many programs supporting folks in Indian Country, where chronic underfunding is already impacting services and exacerbating disparities,” said Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley, a Democrat.

He added that the federal government plays an outsized role in funding essential services to tribal communities, including health care, education and public safety, and that the Inflation Reduction Act took important steps in advancing funding for water infrastructure and environmental programs for tribes.

In 2024, Clean Air Act related funds were used to fund 15 projects for 12 Northwest tribes. The Confederated Tribes and Bands of the Yakama Nation, the Confederated Tribes of the Umatilla Indian Reservation, and the Tulalip Tribes are some of the Native American nations set to receive research grants for improving air quality and pollution monitoring. Among 12 tribes selected for funding, several of them focus on minimizing exposure to poor air quality and harmful pollutants to their elderly and medically vulnerable residents. Other tribes intend to study impacts of pollutants on important first foods — culturally significant staple foods consumed before colonization — that officials say are critical to improving health outcomes for their citizens.

Researchers at PSU examined 469 programs impacted by President Trump’s reversal of former President Joe Biden’s Executive Order 14008, which sought to address climate change and created a number of environmental justice initiatives. Sixty of the programs identified by researchers were specifically named in the Republican-led spending bill for cuts, and 17 of those provided funding directly to tribes. The programs accounted for roughly 35% of all federal investments in tribes in 2024. The report says not all of the funding will be cut, but a significant portion of it could be.

The cuts come at a time when Native Americans and Alaska Natives already have limited access to federal services and funds, according to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Government Accountability Office, a nonpartisan congressional watchdog. It found when tribes had to compete with other entities for federal funding, they may receive a small portion of the total amount, and that limited access to federal services and funds contributes to known disparities for Native Americans and Alaska Natives compared to other Americans.

Of the $20.15 billion in federal funding that went to tribes between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the boundaries of Idaho received a total of $304.56 million, Washington tribes $1.81 billion, Oregon tribes $690.76 million, and Alaska Native tribes received $2.35 billion.

Other programs at risk of being cut include the EPA’s embattled Environmental Justice Government-to-Government Program, which funded initiatives by states, tribes and local governments to support activities that lead to measurable environmental or public health impacts.

Under that program, in 2023, the EPA awarded the Tulalip Tribes $977,000 to work in conjunction with the Confederated Tribes and Bands of Yakama Nation to create a tool to detect which homes are at greatest risk from wildfire smoke infiltration and dangerously hot weather, which are growing issues affecting both communities.

While the federal government has repeatedly affirmed its obligations to tribes, actual allocations remain disproportionately small compared to population figures. In 2024, Native American tribes received just 1.7% of federal energy and environment spending, despite Native people making up 2.9% of the U.S. population.

Between 2010 and 2024, tribes within the bounds of Idaho, Washington and Oregon received roughly $2.81 billion in federal investments in energy and environmental infrastructure, which represents roughly 14% of the $20 billion in allocations made to tribes nationwide.

The researchers determined that programs funded under the Inflation Reduction Act, Biden’s 2022 climate, health and tax law, are at particular risk of being eliminated. The funding allocated to tribes under the IRA represented a historic investment in infrastructure in Indian Country, more than doubling energy and infrastructure investment from $1.51 billion nationwide to $3.94 billion in 2024, around .04% of total federal grant spending obligations for 2024.

“When you put them in the context of how much money the federal government actually spends on certain things, it’s pennies on the dollar,” said Sophie Lalande, a co-author of the PSU report.

Soon after taking office and without consulting Congress, the Trump administration suspended some grants that tribal communities used heavily, such as community change grants, distributed by the EPA’s Offices of Environmental Justice and of External Civil Rights Compliance during the Biden administration, to support climate resilience and clean energy. Distributed as a part of the Inflation Reduction Act, the grants were suspended as part of the Trump administration’s anti-diversity, equity and inclusion efforts.

The grants helped tribal communities in the Northwest tremendously, according to Fast Horse.

“They were providing hundreds of thousands of dollars to communities for infrastructure improvements, like access to clean drinking water and climate resilience hubs, just really essential pieces of community development for health and safety of communities,” she said.

The report stresses a multiplier effect from investments made in tribal communities. Infrastructure dollars invested on tribal lands often serve as anchors for broader local development, since tribal lands often share regional infrastructure like power grids, roads or water systems with non-Native communities, with the power of dollars rippling outward into surrounding rural towns and cities.

Bobby Cochran, a researcher with Portland State University and senior project manager at the National Policy Consensus Center, co-authored the report.

“We just haven’t made a major investment in infrastructure since the ’60s or ’70s, so this wasn’t fluffy,” he said. “It’s really important stuff that was just trying to play catch-up.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-95/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/img_2130-1024x6831758978260.jpeg?h=199d8c1f&itok=1VtCohkB,N,,2025-09-27 17:00:49.774909

UK new trade measures with emerging economies

On 10 July, the UK Government announced new measures to simplify imports from emerging economies and make it easier for businesses to trade with the UK. Goods from countries such as Nigeria, Sri Lanka and the Philippines will enter tariff free. Bangladesh and Cambodia will continue to benefit from zero tariffs on clothing and electronics. The measures are facilitated via the ‘Developing Countries Trading Scheme’. They aim to build resilience into supply chains and open up new opportunities. The updated rules are part of the UK’s Trade for Development offer. This is designed to boost partner countries’ economies and provide UK businesses and consumers with access to quality, affordable goods.

Impact: The announcement could help businesses secure existing supply chains, particularly in clothing and electronics. It could also provide new supply routes and opportunities with emerging markets.

UK-France industrial strategy partnership

On 11 July, the UK and France announced a new Industrial Strategy Partnership, the first initiative of its kind in Europe. It is intended to enhance economic cooperation and attract significant investment. Over £1 billion in confirmed investment deals were secured, which are expected to generate thousands of highly skilled jobs within the UK. This initiative aligns with the UK’s Modern Industrial Strategy, the ten-year plan designed to foster a resilient, high-skilled economy.

The partnership will prioritise key growth sectors such as technology, clean energy, and advanced manufacturing. Advancing the green and digital transition and reinforce economic resilience.

Impact: A key component of the partnership is strengthening co-operation to secure supply chains around critical minerals. This is expected to increase methodologies for supply chain analysis and mapping in shared priority sectors of interest. For businesses using critical minerals in their products, this partnership could be a welcome development.

UK-India trade deal signed

On 24 July, the UK and India signed a trade deal, first announced on 6 May. It aims to create trading opportunities between the countries. The deal strives for job creation as a result of Indian investment, export wins, and liberalised tariffs. Commitments have also been made for closer collaboration in the fields of defence, education, climate, technology and innovation. Alongside cooperating on matters of national security and organised crime.

Impact: Indian businesses could benefit from greater access to UK markets, particularly in competitive sectors such as textiles and food processing. The deal could provide new opportunities in global supply chains. The UK Government states that in the long term the deal is expected to increase bilateral trade by £25.5 billion, UK GDP by £4.8 billion and wages by £2.2 billion each year.

EU-US trade deal

On 27 July, the European Commission and US Administration agreed a new EU-US trade deal.

A 15% US tariff ceiling will apply to nearly all EU exports currently subject to reciprocal tariffs. Where the Most Favoured Nation (MFN) tariff exceeds 15%, the MFN rate will apply.

Strategic EU products like aircraft and aircraft parts, certain chemicals, certain drug generics or natural resources will benefit from reduced tariffs to pre-2025 levels. Pharmaceuticals and semiconductors are temporarily subject to MFN tariffs pending the outcome of US Section 232 investigations. Alcohol tariffs remain unresolved.

The EU plans to spend $750 billion over three years on US LNG, oil, and nuclear energy to replace Russian supplies. It also plans to buy €40 billion in US AI chips to safeguard its technological leadership. EU companies have expressed intentions of $600 billion in additional investment in US sectors by 2029, alongside commitments to purchase US military equipment.

Impact: EU carmakers could benefit from a 15% US tariff cap, down from 25%, boosting supply chain stability. In pharmaceuticals, 15% US tariff may potentially raise costs. This is estimated to be between $13 billion and $19 billion. US tariffs on EU steel and aluminium imports will remain at 50%. Steel, aluminium, and copper sectors could be protected through joint tariff rate quotas and fair competition measures. Non-tariff barriers may be reduced via cooperation on mutual recognition of assessments in various industrial sectors. US agricultural producers gain €7.5 billion in improved EU access, while EU farmers retain protections for sensitive products. Enhanced cooperation on LNG and renewables could strengthen EU energy security.

For more insight on what businesses need to know see our EU–US Trade Deal briefing.

EU mutual recognition agreement with Canada

On 1 August, the EU-Canada AEO Mutual Recognition Agreement (MRA) officially entered into force, aiming to enhance trade security.

The agreement enables mutual recognition of the EU’s Authorised Economic Operator (AEO) and Canada’s Partners in Protection (PIP) programmes. With the intention of streamlining customs procedures for compliant businesses.

Impact: Businesses could benefit from faster customs clearance, and simplified compliance.

Automated data exchange improves supply chain transparency and reduces delays. The agreement may also enhance business continuity during disruptions, allowing priority clearance for certified operators in emergencies.

UK-EU deal to reduce border checks

On 18 August, the UK Government announced the suspension of extra border checks on live animal imports from the EU and specific animal and plant products from Ireland / Northern Ireland.

This comes ahead of a new sanitary and phytosanitary (SPS) deal with the EU (first unveiled at the UK-EU summit in May). It will establish a UK-EU SPS zone and aims to make the trading of food both cheaper and easier. This could strengthen food supply chains.

A risk-based approach is being adopted to manage biosecurity and the position will be reviewable.

This suspension follows from the announcement in June that checks on medium risk fruit and vegetables from the EU would not be brought into force in July 2025 but suspended until end of January 2027.

Impact: The precise terms of the SPS agreement are still to be finalised. Businesses involved in food and agricultural supply could ultimately benefit from reduced costs.

US-Japan trade agreement implemented

On 5 September President Trump signed an Executive Order implementing a US-Japan trade framework. It confirms that a 15% tariff rate will apply to most imported Japanese goods. Where higher rate tariffs already apply they will continue to apply, with some sector-specific exceptions including for automotive and aerospace sectors. The order also makes generic pharmaceuticals, including ingredients and chemical precursors eligible for zero rate tariffs. Also detailed in the Executive Order are commitments made by Japan to invest $550 billion in critical industries the United States.

Impact: Exemptions to the new baseline tariffs aim to address supply chain vulnerabilities in key industries. Businesses in the automotive sector will benefit from the new baseline rate, as Japanese automobiles and auto-parts were previously subject to 25% tariffs.

Asia

China: First national standard for hazardous chemicals in electrical products

On 22 August, the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology (MIIT) announced a new mandatory national standard. Requirements for the Restriction of the Use of Hazardous Substances in Electrical and Electronic Products will be effective 1 August 2027. The standard restricts four heavy metals (lead, mercury, cadmium, hexavalent chromium) and six persistent organic pollutants (including polybrominated biphenyls, diphenyl ethers, and four phthalates). Requirements cover labelling, disclosure, and traceability of hazardous substances.

MIIT’s stated aims include promotion of green supply chains, consumer health protection and encouraging digital labelling. The standard will form part of China’s broader Restriction of Hazardous Substances framework and aims to align with international standards.

Impact: Businesses that manufacture, import, or sell electrical and electronic products in China should take advantage of the transition period until August 2027. They may consider reviewing supply chains to ensure compliant materials, substance testing, and maintenance of detailed technical documentation. Failure to comply may result in exclusion from the market.

China: New guidelines for strengthening financial support for industrialization issued

On 5 August 2025, the People’s Bank of China and six other authorities published guidelines to strengthen financial support for new industrialization. The stated aim is to establish a financial system tailored to support the development of the advanced manufacturing sector by 2027. Support measures focus on industry innovation, developing modern industry systems, balanced regional growth, and improving financial institutions. The guidelines call for optimized financial tools to support emerging industries such as connected vehicles, semiconductors and advanced manufacturing. Upgrading of traditional industries, and financing of supply chains is also addressed.

Impact: The guidelines are intended to encourage and accelerate investment. Critical and emerging industries may benefit from strengthened measures to support supply chains. Businesses in traditional industries may be able to access increased financial support to develop their strategies in digitalization and sustainable operations.

China: Battery technology export restrictions amended

On 15 July, the Ministry of Commerce and Ministry of Technology (MOFCOM) updated the Catalogue of Technologies Subject to Export Prohibitions and Restrictions. Now included are key technologies related to:

battery cathode materials, including lithium iron phosphate (LFP)

lithium extraction and processing

non-ferrous metal smelting and rolling technologies, including gallium extraction technologies

These technologies are critical to the clean energy, electric vehicle (EV), and semiconductor industries. LFP cathode materials technology is central to the production of cost-effective and high-performance EV batteries. Gallium extraction technologies are used to produce a critical material used in semiconductors.

MOFCOM’s stated aim is to balance technological development of technologies used in sensitive sectors with national economic security.

Impact: Since 15 July 2025, manufacturers exporting these technologies are required to obtain a government licence. Businesses that engage in joint ventures, licensing, or technical services agreements may also require licences. There are several steps to gaining approval for exporting restricted technologies, with applications potentially subject to multiple reviews.

Europe

EU: Safety of products online – first sweep to check compliance

On 18 July, EU Consumer Safety Network published the results of its first product safety sweep under the General Product Safety Regulation (GPSR). This focussed on childcare articles (such as baby carriers, bottles, soothers and highchairs). It covered online marketplaces’ compliance with obligations under the GPSR. It focussed on the very large online platforms (under the Digital Services Act) in addition to smaller providers and assessed them against the criteria of:

display of minimum product safety information and traceability

enforcement activities of the market surveillance authorities

registration with the Safety Gate Portal

Impact: As these sweeps commence, now could be a good time for businesses to check compliance with the requirements of the GPSR. Any supply chain issues identified with third party suppliers could help avoid potential regulatory action and reputational damage.

EU: Strategies for stockpiling and medical countermeasures

On 9 July 2025, the European Commission unveiled its first-ever EU strategies for stockpiling and medical countermeasures. The plan calls for building and coordinating reserves of essential items for crises like pandemics, natural disasters, or military threats. It includes doubling funding for the Health Emergency Preparedness and Response Authority (HERA) to €200 million by 2027 and creating a Medical Countermeasures Accelerator.

Impact: This strategy could prompt businesses to reassess supply chain resilience and inventory management. Demand for medical and safety supplies may raise. Businesses working in logistics and warehousing could see demand rise for specialist storage and distribution. Collaboration between civil and defence sectors may open new procurement avenues. UK

EU: 18th package of sanctions against Russia adopted

On 18 July, the EU adopted its 18th package of sanctions against Russia. It expands restrictions on finance, energy, and trade in advanced military and industrial goods. New measures aim to prevent circumvention via third countries, introducing a ‘catch-all’ authorisation for certain exports if they might end up in Russia. Bans on “Economically Critical Goods” used in construction and transport are extended, and new designations include third-country entities involved in supplying military goods to Russia. Similar restrictions now apply to Belarus, with additional sanctions designations targeting its military sector. These changes are designed to disrupt Russia’s military-industrial complex and increase the overall effectiveness of EU sanctions.

Impact: It is anticipated that there will be an increasing focus on ensuring the effectiveness of the sanctions imposed against Russia, and therefore greater emphasis on extraterritorial measures. Accordingly, businesses will need to be even more mindful of potential stakeholder risks, and step up compliance measures across all stages of the supply chain. Businesses should also look out for the 19th package of sanctions – its presentation is currently delayed due to negotiations between EU Member States as to how be to respond to the Trump administration’s demand that the EU be more proactive in depriving Russia of energy revenues.

For a more detailed overview of the 18th package, please see our briefing here.

EU: Updates to EU Dual-Use Export Control List

On 8 September, the European Commission announced updates to the EU Dual-Use List (as set out in Annex I of Regulation 2021/821).

The 2025 amendments include a number of new entries to the EU Dual-Use List, including:

quantum technology (including quantum computers, cryogenic components, parametric signal amplifiers, cryogenic cooling systems and cryogenic wafer probes)

semiconductor equipment (including manufacturing, testing equipment and materials)

advanced computing components

high-temperature application coatings

peptide synthesisers (that are automated and capable of generating peptides at a system synthesis scale of 1mmol or greater)

The new controls will enter into force following the usual two-month scrutiny period for the European Council and European Parliament, allowing stakeholders to assess the impact and prepare for compliance.

Impact: Exporters across the EU should review the updated list to determine whether their products now fall under the revised controls. This is particularly relevant for companies operating in quantum computing, semiconductor manufacturing and biotechnology fields. It is important to emphasize that some of the new control entries represent unilateral controls by the EU on items, including certain semiconductor manufacturing equipment, which are not currently subject to UK export controls. This misalignment may reflect a broader shift away from streamlining controls across jurisdictions to unilateral and protectionist measures impacting emerging technologies. For businesses trading globally and impacted by these new entries, it will be important to identify the differences between the relevant control lists and to obtain appropriate licences to continue cross-border trade.

EU: New guidance on “best efforts obligations”

In August, the EU Sanctions Helpdesk published an article, ‘The “Best Efforts” Rule under sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus’, providing new guidance on the obligation that EU parents to undertake ‘best efforts’ to ensure that its non-EU subsidiaries do not undermine EU sanctions targeting Russia and Belarus. This requirement was introduced in June 2024.

Importantly, it encourages EU parents to apply the ‘best efforts’ obligation to all EU sanctions, even if the legal requirement only applies to EU sanctions on Russia and Belarus. It also clarifies:

the act of ‘undermining’ sanctions refers to actions that weaken the effectiveness of sanctions without (in)directly violating them, which is different to a breach or circumvention of sanctions

‘best efforts’ involves a higher standard than ‘reasonable efforts’, and comprises all actions that are necessary and feasible in the context of the particular situation and business.

Impact: Businesses should review this guidance carefully to understand its obligations under EU law. Businesses are encouraged to plan ahead – the ‘best efforts’ obligation may only apply to EU sanctions on Russia and Belarus, but sanctions compliance programmes should prepare for the event that this is extended to all EU sanctions.

EU: New import rules apply from 1st September 2025

As of 1st September 2025, the Import Control System 2 (ICS2) is fully deployed across all transport modes, including road and rail. ICS2 is the EU system for collecting cargo details on all goods entering or passing through its borders.

ICS2 demands detailed cargo data before arrival, replacing the former system to improve risk analysis and border security. Timely and accurate Entry Summary Declarations (ENS) are now mandatory. Some Member States and Northern Ireland requested temporary derogations to ease transition for small businesses.

Impact: All businesses shipping in and through the EU must comply with the new rules. Inaccurate data may trigger shipment holds, investigation and potential fines.

UK

UK: Proposals to address late payment culture

On 30 July, the UK Government announced the Small Business Plan, with a focus on a package of proposals aimed at tackling late payment culture, in particular for SME suppliers.

Key proposals include:

limiting payment terms to 60 days, with the possibility of reducing this to 45 days after 5 years

a 30-day invoice verification period, so that invoices cannot be disputed once this has expired

statutory interest on late payment mandatory, removing the ability for parties to use a lower interest rate and making the interest payment automatic

reporting requirements on statutory interest both owed and paid, in order to aid transparency

financial penalties to businesses that persistently pay their suppliers late

investigations into poor payment practices, including acting as arbitrator in disputes and imposing arbitration awards

enhance scrutiny of large companies’ payment practices at audit committee and board level

A consultation on these proposals closes on 23 October 2025.

Impact: If implemented the proposals would supplement the voluntary Fair Payment Code. They could impact all businesses, but particularly large businesses within scope of the payment practices reporting regime. Businesses should review these proposals and consider the impact that the proposed reforms would have on their payment practices and contract terms.

UK: Report on inquiry into forced labour in international supply chains published

On 24 July, the UK Joint Committee on Human Rights published its report on its inquiry into forced labour in international supply chains.

The purpose of the inquiry was to consider the UK legal and voluntary framework. It aimed to check its effectiveness in managing the risks of exposure to forced labour in the UK market.

Key findings and recommendations include:

goods that are produced or part-produced using forced labour are being sold in the UK

the UK is falling behind international partners in its approach to forced labour in supply chains

the reporting duty in Section 54 of the Modern Slavery Act 2015 should be strengthened

there is a willingness in the UK business sector to implement mandatory human rights due diligence; to do so would create a level playing field without putting responsible businesses at a disadvantage

new legislation is needed to establish

whilst the UK includes provisions on human rights and labour rights in some of its international agreements, there is no official policy on approach to this and no mechanisms to assess the impact of these clauses, and this should be addressed

the green energy transition creates specific risks of forced labour in supply chains because of the reliance on critical minerals and polysilicon

Impact: The inquiry will help inform the Government’s review of measures to tackle forced labour and increase transparency in global supply chains. This was promised in the December 2024 response to the House of Lords Modern Slavery Act 2015 Committee report. The Government now has two months to respond to the report. It is unclear whether it will commit to take legislative action in this area, and if it is likely to see a shift towards mandatory human rights due diligence.

UK: Product Regulation and Metrology Act 2025

On 21 July, the Product Regulation and Metrology Bill received Royal Assent, becoming the Product Regulation and Metrology Act 2025 (PRM Act). It aims to create a framework that gives the Secretary of State powers to make regulations to reduce or mitigate risks posed by products. This includes holding online marketplaces to account for unsafe products sold via their platforms. Certain categories of product are excluded from the scope of the PRM Act, including food, plants, animal by-products and products of animal origin, aircraft and their components, military equipment and medicines and medical devices.

The Government has announced its intention to use the PRM Act to introduce new requirements on online marketplaces to:

prevent unsafe products being made available to consumers

ensure that their sellers comply with product safety laws

provide consumers with relevant product information

cooperate with regulators

Impact: The actions of manufacturers, importers and distributors along a supply chain could come under increased regulatory scrutiny. The UK Government has indicated that they are prepared to enact further legislation as global supply chains get more complex and interconnected.

UK: Tax implications for umbrella companies

On 21 July, the UK Government announced draft legislation forming part of the draft Finance Bill, amending Part 2 of the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 (ITEPA 2003). It aims to make recruitment agencies accountable for Pay As You Earn (PAYE) on payments made on or after 6 April 2026 to workers supplied through umbrella companies (or the end client, where there is no agency).

The legislation aims to make the agency and umbrella company jointly and severally liable. Allowing HMRC to pursue either or both. If there is more than one agency in the supply chain, the rules will apply to the agency that has the direct contract with the end client to supply the worker.

Impact: Businesses should ensure their supply chain documentation and due diligence meet UFLPA compliance. Transparent supply chain documentation, meeting all import requirements, should help mitigate enforcement risks and subsequent reputational damage.

For more insight on the draft legislation, see our briefing.

GB/Northern Ireland: New powers to impose ‘not for EU’ labelling on goods on the GB market

On 1 July, the Marking of Retail Goods Regulations 2025 came into force. The Northern Ireland Retail Movement Scheme (Scheme) makes it easier to move goods from Great Britain (GB) to Northern Ireland (NI). In order to come within scope of the scheme, goods have to be individually labelled as “not for EU”.

These new regulations are intended to stop businesses from pulling out of the NI market because of these labelling requirements. Empowering the Secretary of State for Environment, Food & Rural Affairs to introduce ‘not for EU’ labelling for specified categories of retail goods that are placed on the GB market. In other words, the labelling requirements become the same for those goods in both the NI and GB markets. This can only happen if there is evidence that the supply of a retail good is, or is likely to be, seriously adversely affected by relevant business operators withdrawing from the NI market because of the ‘not for EU’ labelling requirements under the Scheme.

Impact: These regulations will impact all businesses selling retail goods in GB and/or NI. These businesses could see supply chain disruption, but the Secretary of State has stated that the risks will be monitored.

UK: Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation publishes guidance on sanctions circumvention

On 4 August, the Office of Trade Sanctions Implementation (OTSI) published ‘Countering Russian sanctions evasion – guidance for businesses’, which aims to support UK businesses in identifying export control and sanctions circumvention practices. The guidance sets out key circumvention data, including a list of goods that are seen to be at a generally greater risk of being diverted and re-exported to Russia, and a list of third-countries where entities continue to sell sensitive goods to Russia. It also identifies a number of potential red flag indicators of export control and sanctions evasion.

The guidance also shares best practice in relation to due diligence. This is split into four categories: product, customer, transaction, and export destination.

Impact: Businesses are responsible for determining its specific sanctions risk exposure and implementing an appropriate set of safeguards and controls to mitigate such risk. These safeguards and controls, especially relating to due diligence practices, should be informed by the suggestions set out in this guidance to protect against emerging methods of circumvention.

UK: New sanctions targeting Russia’s oil fleet

On 12 September, the UK launched a new round of sanctions that target 70 ships transporting Russian oil, as well as 30 entities and individuals identified to be supplying the Russian military with equipment used in weapon systems. The UK Government states this is in response to Russian air strikes violating NATO airspace in Poland. Impact: Businesses should continue to review the lists of sanctioned entities and individuals and manage dealings accordingly to ensure compliance with all UK sanctions on Russia.

US

US: New tariffs on copper imports announced

On 30 July, the US Administration announced increased tariffs of 50% on imported copper products. The increased rate applies from 1 August 2025. It applies to semi-finished copper products, including copper pipes, wires, rods and sheets. It also applies to copper-intensive derivative goods, such as cables and electrical components. The new rate does not apply to raw forms of copper, anode and cathode material or copper scrap.

The proclamation also directs the Secretary of Commerce to take steps to boost the US domestic copper industry. This includes a requirement that 25% of high-quality copper scrap produced in the US must be sold in the US. Additionally, from 2027 25% of copper input materials produced in the US will be required to be sold domestically. The requirement will rise to 30% in 2028 and 40% in 2029. Copper input materials include products such as copper ores, concentrates, mattes, cathodes, and anodes.

Impact: Businesses importing affected copper products may experience price increases and disruption to their supply chains. Electric vehicle manufacturers, defence, electronics and AI industries could be particularly affected. The housebuilding sector may also be impacted, with potential increased construction costs.

US: Draft Ensuring Safe and Toxic-Free Foods Act of 2025

On 17 July, a Senate bill was introduced which aims to end the Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) self-affirming pathway for food substances. It would require Food and Drug Administration (FDA) review for all GRAS determinations, including food ingredients, packaging and contact materials.

If enacted it would introduce public posting of GRAS notices and a 60-day comment period. It would also expand the FDA’s Food Chemical Reassessment Program. This would introduce reassessment of 10 substances every three years. Substances relying solely on industry self-GRAS determinations would be considered unsafe two years after enactment.

Impact: Businesses involved in food manufacture, packaging and contact materials may want to proactively assess their processes and supply chains. Businesses could expect increased scrutiny and reassessment of ingredients. Several large food and beverage companies have recently announced reformulation of popular products, particularly in relation to synthetic dyes.

US: Export Control Transparency Act becomes law

On 19 August 2025, the Maintaining American Superiority by Improving Export Control Transparency Act was signed into law. The new law aims to increase transparency in the US Department of Commerce export control system. The Department must now provide Congress with annual reports on all export license requests to covered entities.

In addition to aggregated statistics, the report must contain information on all license applications, including:

the name of the entity submitting the application

a brief description of the item (including the Export Control Classification Number (ECCN) and reason for control, if applicable)

the name and location of the end-user

a value estimate

decision with respect to the license application or authorization

the date of submission

the date, location, and result of any end-use checks

Impact: Affected businesses may face increased scrutiny of their due diligence processes, including historic license applications. Significant penalties may apply if businesses are found to be in breach of export control rules. US businesses may consider reviewing their compliance practices, specifically those relating to end-user and end-use verification.

US: 407 product categories added to steel and aluminium tariffs

On August 19, the Department of Commerce announced an additional list of products to be covered by tariffs. The steel and aluminium content of these products will now be subject to a 50% duty rate. Among the 407 additional product categories now included are:

wind turbines and their parts and components

mobile cranes

bulldozers and other heavy equipment

railcars

furniture

compressors and pumps

The affected product list now encompasses industrial and chemical products, as well as consumer and personal care goods. There are three annual periods for public steel and aluminium product inclusion requests. The next opportunity opens in September and will be announced in the Federal Register.

Impact: Businesses should review the full list of affected product categories, and evaluate their sourcing strategies and pricing models if required. Importers will need to comply with new requirements, including verifying the origin and processing of affected products. Businesses may also consider preparing submissions for any products they believe should be excluded in the next inclusions request window.

US: Updated forced labour in China strategy

On August 19, the Forced Labor Enforcement Task Force of the Department of Homeland Security and other agencies, announced a new strategy to strengthen enforcement of the Uyghur Forced Labor Prevention Act (UFLPA). This is aimed at preventing goods made with forced labour in China from entering the domestic market.

The new strategy adds five new high-risk sectors:

caustic soda

jujubes

copper

lithium

steel

The UFLPA Entity List now includes 144 banned entities. The update strengthens Customs and Border Protection’s ability to detect and stop such imports. It also aims to help domestic businesses reduce reputational and regulatory risks in their supply chains.

Impact: Businesses should ensure their supply chain documentation and due diligence meet UFLPA requirements. Transparent supply chain documentation could help prevent enforcement risks and any ensuing reputational damage.

The Bermuda Environmental Sustainability Taskforce strongly urges the Regulatory Authority to chart an ambitious path towards renewable energy — and to firmly reject proposals to introduce liquefied natural gas. Bermuda must move away from fossil fuels, not towards new ones. LNG would bind our island to long-term carbon emissions, price volatility and environmental risks — directly undermining our climate commitments.

Since the last IRP was issued, the cost of renewable energy has plummeted. We see no reason why the RA could justify allowing LNG now after rejecting it seven years ago.

LNG is the wrong choice

LNG is not a bridge to the future; it is a roadblock.

• Climate incompatibility: LNG is still a fossil fuel. Building new LNG infrastructure would lock in decades of carbon emissions just as the world is racing to cut them

• Environmental risk: LNG facilities carry major safety and spill hazards. Methane leaks trap 40 times more heat than carbon dioxide over their 12-year life span

• Physical impracticality: Bermuda’s small size and dense development make it virtually impossible to build LNG terminals with the required safety buffer zones

• Economic liability: LNG prices are volatile, and costly infrastructure will likely become stranded assets as the world rapidly transitions to clean energy

• Lost opportunity: Every dollar spent on LNG delays investment in renewable energy systems that will power Bermuda’s future.

The case for renewables

A clean energy transition is not just environmentally sound; it’s economically smart. The next IRP should commit to:

• High renewable targets: Set clear milestones for solar, wind and battery storage to cut emissions, create local jobs, and strengthen energy independence

• Accelerated floating solar: The RA’s proposed 10mW floating solar system could supply a meaningful share of Bermuda’s daytime power while overcoming land constraints. This should be fast-tracked and paired with battery storage

• Vehicle-to-grid integration: Electric vehicles can serve as mobile batteries, storing surplus solar and feeding it back into the grid during peak demand. This would reduce the need for expensive peaker engines while empowering consumers

• Energy efficiency: Incentivise building retrofits, efficient appliances and stronger codes to lower consumption and household costs

• Equity and inclusion: Ensure a just transition that protects low-income residents and includes broad community participation, so the benefits of clean energy are shared by all

• Grid diversity: When a Category 5 hurricane hits Bermuda, barely a telephone pole will be left standing. The only people with power will be solar-energy producers with stand-alone battery storage or a parked EV car with battery. This is our future

A vision for 2040

Imagine a Bermuda powered by 80 per cent to 100 per cent renewables by 2040. Homes and businesses run on abundant local energy from rooftop and floating solar, supported by offshore wind and advanced storage systems. Our vehicles double as grid assets. Energy bills are stable, our air is cleaner and our economy is more resilient.

This is the future we can choose — if we act now.

No time to lose

United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres has said: “We are on the cusp of a new era. Fossil fuels are running out of road. The sun is rising on a clean energy age… There are no price spikes for sunlight. No embargoes on wind.”

He’s right. Ninety per cent of renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuels. The smart economic choice and the moral imperative are one and the same.

The Regulatory Authority has a rare opportunity to set Bermuda on a path towards clean, resilient, home-grown energy. BEST calls on the RA to reject LNG proposals and embrace a bold renewable vision. Doing so would cut emissions, enhance energy security, protect our fragile environment and build a healthier, more prosperous future for everyone who calls Bermuda home.

It is important for those making decisions about our energy future to have information and guidance from coal producers, users, equipment suppliers, state and local officials, and other stakeholders across the coal value chain.
But if it is necessary to hear from coal stakeholders, in this era of all-of-the-above, responsible energy diversification and expansion, the Department of Energy should seek out other similar councils filled with representatives of other energy industries.
Eyebrow-raising references to Paul Revere in his comments about the bill aside, Rulli is right that our energy future is a matter of national security.
After all, if there’s anything Revere could have gotten behind, it’s an energy revolution.","As the U.S. Senate considers codifying the reestablishment of the National Coal Council, lawmakers have an opportunity.

U.S. Rep. Michael Rulli’s bill drew support from enough Democrats in the House of Representatives that it is now moving to the Senate, which will consider whether it is necessary to back up the executive order that, among other things, called for reinstating the group that provides guidance on the future of coal technologies and markets.

And Rulli, R-Ohio, is right.

It is important for those making decisions about our energy future to have information and guidance from coal producers, users, equipment suppliers, state and local officials, and other stakeholders across the coal value chain.

Lawmakers will do well, however, to address criticisms of such a group by advising its members that — as an accessory to the federal government — it works for us, rather than to serve its own interests.

But if it is necessary to hear from coal stakeholders, in this era of all-of-the-above, responsible energy diversification and expansion, the Department of Energy should seek out other similar councils filled with representatives of other energy industries.

A quick glance at the lists of advisory councils and committees working with the department shows there is a State Energy Advisory Board, which develops recommendations “regarding initiation, design, implementation, and evaluation of federal energy efficiency and renewable energy programs.”

But if there are other groups advising on renewables, they are impossible to find amid the National Petroleum Council, Ultra-Deepwater Advisory Committee (for natural gas and other petroleum resources), even the Unconventional Resources Technology Advisory Committee … meant to “advise on the development and implementation of programs related to onshore unconventional natural gas and other petroleum resources.” The list is quite a long one.

Eyebrow-raising references to Paul Revere in his comments about the bill aside, Rulli is right that our energy future is a matter of national security.

For that very reason, lawmakers MUST remember that just as we need to hear from stakeholders in the coal industry, we also need to hear from those working to provide energy via renewables and other ways that are not simply the way things have always been done.

Any legislative clarity that either affirms or modifies these crucial supports will significantly influence investor confidence and the operational strategies of solar companies.","Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH), a leading global supplier of microinverter-based solar and battery systems, has been battling severe stock turbulence from late 2024 through mid-2025. The company's shares have plummeted by approximately 69.1% from their 52-week high of $124.40 on September 19, 2024, reflecting a significant erosion of investor confidence. This sharp decline has been exacerbated by a confluence of industry-wide challenges and specific operational pressures, painting a challenging picture for the once-high-flying solar innovator.

The immediate fallout includes widespread analyst downgrades, with ratings shifting from ""Moderate Buy"" to ""Hold,"" and even some ""Sell"" recommendations as the year progressed. High short interest and sustained institutional selling have further pressured the stock, which has consistently underperformed the broader Nasdaq Composite, dipping 44% year-to-date as of September 19, 2025. This persistent downward trend signals a critical juncture for Enphase, forcing a reevaluation of its market position and growth trajectory in a rapidly evolving renewable energy landscape.

A Perfect Storm: Unpacking Enphase's Tumultuous Year

The dramatic downturn for Enphase Energy stems from a ""perfect storm"" of sector-wide headwinds, policy uncertainties, and company-specific performance issues that began to intensify in late 2024 and continued through 2025. The global residential solar market, after years of robust expansion, entered a period of contraction, leading to a significant slowdown in installations and a re-rating of valuations across the industry.

A pivotal factor contributing to the decline was the growing uncertainty surrounding crucial clean energy tax credits. In May 2025, a GOP bill passed by the House of Representatives aimed to significantly reduce or eliminate tax benefits, including the 30% federal tax credit for homeowners installing solar rooftop systems (Section 25D). This legislative threat, coupled with critical remarks on the sector from President Trump in August 2025, sent shockwaves through the market, directly impacting investor confidence in companies like Enphase that rely heavily on these incentives.

Compounding these external pressures, Enphase faced internal challenges, particularly margin compression. The company grappled with rising input costs, reciprocal tariffs, and higher component costs. New tariffs were projected to reduce gross margin by approximately 2% in Q2 2025, with a potential 6%-8% total impact in Q3 2025. This erosion of profitability highlighted the company's reliance on Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits, without which underlying gross margins were considerably thinner. Softening U.S. demand, partly due to seasonality and California's net metering reform, and a slowdown in European markets due to unfavorable government policies further weighed on revenue growth.

The timeline of disappointing financial results further fueled the stock's turbulence. In Q4 2024, while revenue saw a slight sequential increase, the Q1 2025 revenue forecast suggested a decline. Q1 2025 results confirmed this trend, with total revenue of $356.1 million representing a decrease from the prior quarter, and U.S. revenue falling approximately 13%. The company missed adjusted earnings estimates and provided Q2 revenue guidance well below analyst expectations, leading to a nearly 9.3% stock drop. Although Q2 2025 results showed some stabilization, the Q3 revenue guidance of $350 million (midpoint) again fell short, triggering another 5.9% decline, underscoring the persistent struggle to meet market expectations.

Shifting Fortunes: Winners and Losers in a Volatile Market

The significant turbulence experienced by Enphase Energy (NASDAQ: ENPH) has created a ripple effect across the solar energy sector, delineating potential winners and losers among its competitors and partners. Companies with diversified revenue streams, stronger balance sheets, or less exposure to the residential solar segment, particularly in the U.S. and Europe, might be better positioned to weather the storm. Conversely, those heavily reliant on residential installations or similar policy-driven incentives could face similar, if not greater, challenges.

One potential beneficiary could be larger, more diversified energy companies or utilities (e.g., NextEra Energy (NYSE: NEE), Duke Energy (NYSE: DUK)) that are involved in renewable energy but are not solely dependent on residential solar equipment sales. Their scale and broader energy portfolios might offer more resilience against market fluctuations and policy shifts. Additionally, companies focusing on commercial or utility-scale solar projects, which often operate under different regulatory and incentive structures, might see relatively stable demand compared to the beleaguered residential segment.

Conversely, direct competitors to Enphase, especially those in the microinverter and solar inverter space, such as SolarEdge Technologies (NASDAQ: SEDG), have also been deeply affected by the same industry headwinds. SolarEdge, which also relies heavily on residential and commercial solar installations, has faced similar pressures from slowing demand, inventory gluts, and policy uncertainties. The entire solar equipment manufacturing segment is under scrutiny, and companies with weaker financial positions or less innovative product pipelines might struggle to survive if the downturn persists.

Installers and distributors of solar equipment (e.g., Sunrun (NASDAQ: RUN), SunPower (NASDAQ: SPWR)) are also caught in the crossfire. A slowdown in equipment sales directly impacts their installation volumes and profitability. While lower equipment costs due to oversupply might offer some margin relief, the overarching issue of reduced end-user demand and uncertain tax credits presents a significant headwind. Companies that can adapt their business models, perhaps by offering more comprehensive energy management solutions or focusing on energy storage, may fare better than those solely focused on panel installations.

Broader Implications: A Shifting Landscape for Renewable Energy

The challenges faced by Enphase Energy are not isolated but symptomatic of broader, systemic shifts within the renewable energy sector, particularly solar. This turbulence underscores a critical juncture where the industry is transitioning from a period of rapid, incentive-driven growth to one demanding greater cost efficiency, technological innovation, and resilience against policy uncertainties. The residential solar market, once a darling of investors, is now confronting the realities of market maturity, regulatory reforms, and increased competition.

This event fits into a wider trend of consolidation and re-evaluation across the clean energy landscape. Many companies that thrived on generous government subsidies are now facing a more competitive environment where profitability and sustainable business models are paramount. The potential reduction or elimination of federal tax credits, as proposed in the House bill in May 2025, highlights the precariousness of policy-dependent growth. This could accelerate the shakeout of weaker players and force a greater emphasis on unsubsidized economic viability for solar installations.

Ripple effects extend to the entire supply chain, from raw material suppliers to financial institutions that fund solar projects. Reduced demand and margin compression at the manufacturing level can lead to decreased orders, oversupply, and price wars, impacting profitability for all stakeholders. Moreover, the decline in investor confidence in a leading company like Enphase could make it harder for smaller, less established renewable energy firms to secure funding, potentially stifling innovation and market entry.

Historically, the renewable energy sector has experienced boom-and-bust cycles, often tied to government incentives and technological breakthroughs. The current downturn shares similarities with past periods of market correction, where overcapacity and policy shifts led to significant industry restructuring. For instance, the challenges in the early 2010s, following the expiration of certain tax credits and increased competition from Chinese manufacturers, led to bankruptcies and consolidations. The current environment suggests a similar period of recalibration, where companies must demonstrate robust fundamentals beyond just growth potential. Regulatory bodies are also under pressure to provide clear, stable policy frameworks to support long-term investment, as inconsistent policies create significant market volatility.

What Comes Next: Navigating Uncertainty and Seeking New Horizons

The path forward for Enphase Energy and the broader solar sector remains fraught with both challenges and opportunities. In the short term, the market will closely watch for any definitive outcomes regarding federal tax credits. Should the proposed GOP bill to reduce or eliminate incentives gain further traction, it would likely trigger another wave of negative sentiment and potentially force significant strategic pivots across the industry. Conversely, any clarity or reaffirmation of existing incentives could provide a much-needed boost to investor confidence and stabilize stock prices.

For Enphase, strategic adaptations will be crucial. This could involve a stronger focus on international markets less affected by U.S. policy shifts, deeper penetration into the energy storage segment, or even exploring new business models such as providing comprehensive energy management solutions rather than just hardware. The company's strong balance sheet and continued product innovation, such as the IQ Battery 10C and IQ8P Microinverters, provide a foundation for these pivots, but execution will be key to regaining market share and investor trust.

Market opportunities may emerge from this downturn for companies that can innovate around cost efficiencies and develop products that offer compelling value propositions even without significant subsidies. The long-term trajectory towards decarbonization and energy independence remains intact, suggesting that the underlying demand for solar and storage will eventually rebound. Companies that can survive this period of volatility and emerge leaner and more efficient will be well-positioned for future growth.

Potential scenarios range from a continued challenging environment if policy uncertainty persists and demand remains soft, to a gradual recovery driven by technological advancements, new market entries, or a more stable regulatory landscape. A critical outcome will be the industry's ability to reduce its reliance on direct subsidies and compete more effectively on a level playing field with traditional energy sources. This could lead to a stronger, more resilient solar sector in the long run, albeit after a period of significant consolidation and transformation.

Wrap-Up: A Resilient Future for Solar Amidst Current Headwinds

Enphase Energy's (NASDAQ: ENPH) stock turbulence from late 2024 through mid-2025 serves as a stark reminder of the complexities and inherent risks within the rapidly evolving renewable energy sector. The confluence of slowing global demand, significant policy uncertainties surrounding federal tax credits, and persistent margin pressures created a challenging environment that saw the company's shares plummet dramatically. While Enphase boasts a strong balance sheet and continues to innovate with new products, these factors alone were insufficient to counteract the prevailing market headwinds and shifting investor sentiment.

Moving forward, the market will be keenly observing several key indicators. The resolution of policy uncertainties surrounding the Investment Tax Credit (ITC) and other clean energy incentives will be paramount. Any legislative clarity that either affirms or modifies these crucial supports will significantly influence investor confidence and the operational strategies of solar companies. Additionally, signs of stabilization or rebound in residential solar demand in key markets like the U.S. and Europe will signal a potential easing of the current downturn.

Investors should watch for Enphase's ability to diversify its revenue streams, enhance cost efficiencies, and strategically expand into new geographies or product segments like energy storage, which may offer more resilient growth avenues. The company's future performance will largely depend on its capacity to navigate this period of intense competition and regulatory flux, adapting its business model to thrive in an environment where sustainable profitability, rather than just rapid growth, becomes the primary metric of success. The long-term vision for a decarbonized energy future remains strong, but the journey there will undoubtedly continue to present both significant hurdles and transformative opportunities for companies like Enphase.

TNC, a US nuclear deployment company, said the companies will assess the use of NQA-1 steel and related infrastructure for gigawatt-scale nuclear reactors as per the American Society of Mechanical Engineers’ certification standards.

The partnership supports executive orders from President Donald Trump targeting 400 gigawatts (GW) of nuclear capacity by 2050, including construction of 10 large-scale reactors in the next five years, TNC said.

The US has launched an effort to speed development of power plants and transmission lines after Trump on his first day back in office in January issued an order declaring an energy emergency as artificial intelligence, data centers, and electric vehicles are boosting power demand for the first time in two decades.

This abrupt termination of incentives, enacted through the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) and significantly shortening the original 2032 timeline, has created a ""gold rush"" at dealerships. The looming deadline is profoundly influencing purchasing decisions, with a notable acceleration in EV and hybrid sales since early summer, as buyers aim to secure substantial savings before they vanish.

This immediate buying spree, however, is juxtaposed with widespread industry predictions of a significant slowdown in EV sales beginning in October. Analysts anticipate a ""speed bump"" for the market, as the absence of federal incentives and a ""payback"" from accelerated summer purchases are expected to temper demand, potentially lasting through the first quarter of next year. The expiration poses a considerable challenge for automakers ramping up EV production and raises concerns about future investment, the stability of green jobs, and the U.S.'s competitive standing in the global EV supply chain.

The Sudden End of an Era: Unpacking the EV Tax Credit's Accelerated Demise

The federal $7,500 EV tax credit, officially known as the New Clean Vehicle Credit, is set to expire on September 30, 2025, a dramatic acceleration from its original 2032 sunset date under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) of 2022. This rapid curtailment is a direct consequence of the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), signed into law by President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025. This act effectively eliminated the federal EV tax credits for new, used, and leased electric vehicles, along with a $1,000 credit for home EV chargers.

Prior to its expiration, the $7,500 credit for new EVs was contingent on several factors, including North American final assembly, strict critical mineral and battery component sourcing requirements (often splitting the credit into two $3,750 halves), MSRP caps ($80,000 for vans/SUVs/pickups, $55,000 for sedans), and modified adjusted gross income (MAGI) limits. A key change implemented in 2024 allowed buyers to transfer the credit to an eligible dealership at the point of sale for an immediate discount. Recent IRS guidance has also clarified that a binding purchase agreement with a deposit made before September 30, 2025, can still qualify for the credit, even if delivery occurs after the deadline, potentially extending eligibility into early 2026 for some consumers.

The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (P.L. 119-21) represents a significant policy reversal, moving away from technology-specific subsidies for clean energy. Proponents of the OBBBA argued that the EV tax credits disproportionately benefited wealthier households and that non-EV-buying taxpayers were subsidizing EV purchasers. In place of the EV credit, the OBBBA introduced a new auto loan interest deduction, allowing buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on qualifying new U.S.-assembled vehicles (electric, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028, subject to income limits. This shift aims to support broader domestic manufacturing rather than specific vehicle types.

Initial market reactions have been a mix of urgency and apprehension. Dealerships are experiencing a ""gold rush,"" actively advertising ""last chance"" opportunities to clear EV inventory. New EV sales reportedly jumped 18-33% and used EV sales soared 59% in recent months compared to the previous year. Automakers are adjusting sales strategies, with some pushing aggressive campaigns to clear current inventory, while others are re-evaluating production volumes and considering offering their own incentives post-expiration. Key stakeholders include the U.S. government (President Trump, Congress, IRS), automakers (e.g., Tesla, GM, Ford), car dealerships, and consumers racing against the clock.

Navigating the New Landscape: Winners and Losers in a Post-Credit EV Market

The abrupt end of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, will fundamentally reshape the competitive landscape for electric vehicle manufacturers, creating distinct winners and losers as the market shifts from a subsidized environment to one driven by intrinsic value.

Companies heavily reliant on the $7,500 tax credit to make their vehicles competitive, particularly those with higher price points or less established brand loyalty, are most vulnerable. Newer EV manufacturers that have yet to achieve economies of scale and depend on incentives to attract buyers may face substantial headwinds. Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN), for instance, saw its R1S models already facing eligibility issues for the federal credit earlier in 2025. The complete expiration will remove a significant incentive for direct purchases, likely leading to reduced sales and increased pressure on profitability, even as the company invests in future, more affordable models like the R2. Similarly, Volkswagen AG (OTCMKTS: VWAGY), whose ID.4 also lost direct purchase eligibility earlier in the year, may see a dip in sales for eligible models, potentially requiring the company to absorb some of the $7,500 cost through internal incentives, impacting per-unit profitability.

Conversely, companies with diversified portfolios, strong brand recognition, established profitability in their EV segments, or those focused on higher-end markets less sensitive to the $7,500 incentive are better positioned. Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ: TSLA), despite a reported dip in overall sales in the first half of 2025, has a strong brand, vertical integration, and existing profitability from EVs that provide a degree of insulation. CEO Elon Musk has historically supported the credit's termination, arguing it harmed Tesla. The company's strategic focus on more affordable models for 2025 and its ability to adjust pricing could position it as a long-term winner. Toyota Motor Corporation (NYSE: TM) and Honda Motor Co., Ltd. (NYSE: HMC) are also well-placed due to their ""hybrid-first"" strategies and diversified product offerings. With slowing pure EV adoption trends, strong hybrid sales could provide stable revenue streams, cushioning the impact of the federal credit's expiration.

Legacy automakers like General Motors Company (NYSE: GM) and Ford Motor Company (NYSE: F) represent a mixed bag. Both have several eligible EV models, such as the Chevrolet Blazer EV and Ford F-150 Lightning, which benefited from the credit. While they are likely to experience a short-term sales dip for these models, their larger scale, existing dealer networks, and long-term commitment to the EV transition may allow them to implement aggressive internal incentives (rebates, favorable lease terms) to sustain demand. However, this could come at the cost of profitability in the short term. Both companies are also actively working on more affordable EV options to compete effectively in a subsidy-free market.

A Seismic Shift: Broader Implications of the EV Tax Credit's Demise

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, represents a seismic shift, signaling the U.S. EV market's transition from a heavily subsidized environment to one increasingly driven by market forces. While a short-term surge in sales is currently underway, analysts widely anticipate a subsequent temporary dip of 20% to 30% in EV sales in the immediate post-deadline period. This is because the credit effectively made EVs more accessible, particularly for budget-conscious consumers, and its absence will widen the cost gap between EVs and comparable gasoline models.

This policy reversal, orchestrated by the ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA), reflects a broader recalibration of U.S. energy priorities. The OBBBA not only terminates EV credits but also repeals other clean energy incentives, including those for solar and wind facilities, green hydrogen production, and home electrification. It also eliminates non-compliance penalties for CAFE standards, further reducing pressure on manufacturers to produce fuel-efficient vehicles. This signifies a move away from technology-specific subsidies towards a focus on broader tax relief and supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types, as evidenced by the new auto loan interest deduction.

The ripple effects will be felt across the entire automotive ecosystem. Smaller EV rivals like Rivian Automotive, Inc. (NASDAQ: RIVN) and Lucid Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: LCID) are particularly vulnerable due to their heavy reliance on incentives. The battery production sector is already experiencing an overcapacity crisis, with BloombergNEF data indicating a 56% plummet in U.S. battery deployment projections since 2022 and $6 billion in manufacturing projects canceled in Q1 2025. This could erode U.S. competitiveness against countries like China, which continues rapid expansion in battery manufacturing. While the expiration of the home charger credit might slow some infrastructure development, the current pre-deadline buying spree could still accelerate broader public charging infrastructure as municipalities respond to heightened EV volumes.

Historically, the removal of government incentives for specific industries has often led to initial market contractions, forcing industries to adapt or consolidate. Comparisons can be drawn to similar events where government support for emerging technologies was withdrawn, often revealing the true market demand and forcing innovation. Studies suggest that eliminating the EV tax credit could lead to a significant decrease in EV sales by 2030, potentially jeopardizing planned U.S. EV assembly plant expansions and making a substantial portion of U.S. battery manufacturing capacity redundant. This underscores the critical role of policy in shaping industrial landscapes and the risk of ceding ground to international competitors who actively support their nascent EV industries.

The Road Ahead: Navigating the Post-Subsidy EV Landscape

The expiration of the federal EV tax credit on September 30, 2025, ushers in a new, challenging phase for the electric vehicle market. In the short term, the immediate aftermath is expected to be a period of significant adjustment. Following the current ""gold rush"" of pre-deadline purchases, analysts widely anticipate a notable dip in EV sales, potentially between 20-30% in the fourth quarter of 2025 and into early 2026, as vehicles effectively become thousands of dollars more expensive for consumers. Automakers and dealerships will likely respond by offering their own aggressive incentives, price cuts, and favorable financing options to stimulate demand and manage inventory. State and local incentives will also gain heightened importance as buyers seek alternative forms of financial relief.

In the long term, the EV market will be compelled to mature beyond government subsidies, focusing instead on intrinsic value and market fundamentals. This means a renewed emphasis on cost reduction through technological advancements in battery chemistry and streamlined production processes, aiming for price parity with gasoline cars by 2027. The industry will need to build greater consumer confidence through improved range, faster charging, and a ubiquitous, reliable charging infrastructure. While overall EV adoption is still expected to grow, it will likely be at a slower, more organic pace than initially projected, with some forecasts suggesting a 25% EV sales mix by 2030, rather than the more ambitious 50%. A strategic pivot towards hybrids and plug-in hybrids is also anticipated, serving as a bridge technology for many consumers.

Automakers will need to implement several strategic adaptations. This includes aggressive cost reduction efforts, rethinking global production and sourcing strategies now that North American assembly incentives are gone, and diversifying product offerings to include more affordable EVs and a wider range of hybrid options. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) not only removed the EV credits but also introduced a new auto loan interest deduction. This allows buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on loans for new, U.S.-assembled vehicles (EV, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028. While not a direct replacement for the upfront EV credit, this deduction offers long-term savings and shifts the policy focus to supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types. This could partially offset the financial impact for some buyers who finance U.S.-assembled EVs, but notably excludes leased vehicles.

The Dawn of a New Era: A Market Redefined

The federal EV tax credit's expiration on September 30, 2025, marks a pivotal moment, fundamentally redefining the U.S. electric vehicle market. The immediate takeaway is the unprecedented ""gold rush"" as consumers rush to secure the $7,500 incentive, leading to record sales in the months preceding the deadline. This short-term boom, however, is a precursor to an anticipated slowdown, challenging the industry to prove its long-term viability without direct government subsidies. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) is the legislative instrument behind this shift, moving federal policy away from technology-specific consumer incentives towards broader support for domestic manufacturing through mechanisms like the new auto loan interest deduction.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by a heightened focus on affordability, technological innovation, and robust infrastructure. Automakers will be compelled to aggressively reduce costs, develop more competitively priced EV models, and enhance the overall value proposition to attract a wider consumer base. The long-term success of EVs will hinge on their ability to compete on par with gasoline vehicles based on price, performance, and convenience, rather than relying on purchase incentives. The new auto loan interest deduction, while not EV-exclusive, will indirectly support U.S.-assembled EVs by making financing more attractive, thereby bolstering domestic production.

The lasting impact of this policy shift will be a more resilient, market-driven EV industry. While the immediate transition may be bumpy, it forces a necessary evolution towards greater self-sufficiency and innovation. Investors should closely monitor several key indicators in the coming months: the severity and duration of the post-expiration sales dip, automakers' strategic responses (including pricing, new models, and proprietary incentives), advancements in battery cost reduction, and the continued build-out of charging infrastructure. Furthermore, tracking the effectiveness of the new auto loan interest deduction and observing how state and local incentives evolve will provide crucial insights into the market's trajectory. The coming months will truly test the EV era's ability to stand on its own.

Washington, D.C. – In July 2025, Trump and congressional Republicans pushed through the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” — better known as the Republican Rate Hike — plunging Americans into a downward spiral of affordability. Donald Trump and Republicans’ agenda is creating a self-inflicted energy crisis. Their law is driving utility costs sky-high, shuttering factories, deepening our dependence on foreign oil, and polluting our air and water, all to fund new tax breaks for billionaires and oil and gas executives. Climate Power today released its inaugural Energy Crisis Snapshot, pulling from a new tracker detailing the rising costs, job losses, power shortages, and abandoned investments caused by Republicans’ nonsensical war on clean energy.

“Trump promised lower bills and more jobs, and Americans are getting the exact opposite,” said Lori Lodes, executive director of Climate Power. “Trump is undercutting American jobs, driving up energy bills, and destabilizing the grid by gutting the cheapest, fastest power sources available. The Republican war on clean energy serves no one but the Big Oil executives whose campaign checks are clearly paying off.”

The report’s findings include:

• Household electric bills are up 10% nationally since Trump took office, and are poised to spike even further. New analysis from the Center for American Progress and Climate Power shows just how widespread the Republican Rate Hike has become. Since Trump took office, gas and electric utilities in 41 states and D.C. have raised—or are seeking to raise—rates by at least $78.9 billion. The hikes hit more than 80 million electric customers and 28 million gas customers, with families in Missouri, New York, and Illinois facing some of the steepest burdens—up to $500 or more in added annual costs.

• More than 80,500 energy jobs have been lost or delayed between Trump’s election and September 8, 2025. Companies have canceled, delayed, or laid off staff at 142 energy projects in 37 states, representing over $42.80 billion in lost investment. 57 percent of listed projects have been canceled altogether since Trump’s election.

• At the very moment we need more electrons on the grid to service a dramatic increase of data centers being built around the country, 25,013 megawatts of planned energy generation have been lost due to energy projects that were canceled or delayed since Trump’s election.

Nearly 13 million homes in the U.S. could be powered by the energy generation projects that have been canceled or delayed since Trump’s election.

Climate Power will track the fallout from the Republican Rate Hike through a monthly Energy Crisis Snapshot, backed by a weekly business impacts tracker that monitors private clean energy projects facing delays, cancellations, and job losses

since Trump’s inauguration.

This includes aggressive cost reduction efforts, rethinking global production and sourcing strategies now that North American assembly incentives are gone, and diversifying product offerings to include more affordable EVs and a wider range of hybrid options. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) not only removed the EV credits but also introduced a new auto loan interest deduction. This allows buyers to deduct up to $10,000 annually in interest on loans for new, U.S.-assembled vehicles (EV, hybrid, or gas-powered) purchased between 2025 and 2028. While not a direct replacement for the upfront EV credit, this deduction offers long-term savings and shifts the policy focus to supporting domestic manufacturing across all vehicle types. This could partially offset the financial impact for some buyers who finance U.S.-assembled EVs, but notably excludes leased vehicles.

The Dawn of a New Era: A Market Redefined

The federal EV tax credit's expiration on September 30, 2025, marks a pivotal moment, fundamentally redefining the U.S. electric vehicle market. The immediate takeaway is the unprecedented ""gold rush"" as consumers rush to secure the $7,500 incentive, leading to record sales in the months preceding the deadline. This short-term boom, however, is a precursor to an anticipated slowdown, challenging the industry to prove its long-term viability without direct government subsidies. The ""One Big Beautiful Bill Act"" (OBBBA) is the legislative instrument behind this shift, moving federal policy away from technology-specific consumer incentives towards broader support for domestic manufacturing through mechanisms like the new auto loan interest deduction.

Moving forward, the market will be characterized by a heightened focus on affordability, technological innovation, and robust infrastructure. Automakers will be compelled to aggressively reduce costs, develop more competitively priced EV models, and enhance the overall value proposition to attract a wider consumer base. The long-term success of EVs will hinge on their ability to compete on par with gasoline vehicles based on price, performance, and convenience, rather than relying on purchase incentives. The new auto loan interest deduction, while not EV-exclusive, will indirectly support U.S.-assembled EVs by making financing more attractive, thereby bolstering domestic production.

The lasting impact of this policy shift will be a more resilient, market-driven EV industry. While the immediate transition may be bumpy, it forces a necessary evolution towards greater self-sufficiency and innovation. Investors should closely monitor several key indicators in the coming months: the severity and duration of the post-expiration sales dip, automakers' strategic responses (including pricing, new models, and proprietary incentives), advancements in battery cost reduction, and the continued build-out of charging infrastructure. Furthermore, tracking the effectiveness of the new auto loan interest deduction and observing how state and local incentives evolve will provide crucial insights into the market's trajectory. The coming months will truly test the EV era's ability to stand on its own.

It's not just climate scientists who are concerned about the financial and environmental cost of keeping coal plants running, as one may have expected.
Experts believe that keeping more ageing coal plants online would inflate consumer costs further.
Most of the coal plants in the U.S. are old and inefficient, with the average age of a coal plant standing at 44 years in 2024.","While much of the world is looking to phase out its coal production, United States President Donald Trump has put coal back on the energy agenda, with big plans to reinvigorate ageing coal facilities. Despite concerns over the impact of ongoing coal use on human health and the environment, Trump views fossil fuels as the most stable energy source to boost U.S. energy security, which could lead to consumers paying more for their energy bills over the coming years.

Upon entering office in January, Trump declared an energy emergency, and he has since worked rapidly to change the landscape of U.S. energy by signing a flurry of executive orders and passing bills aimed at reducing the growth of the renewable energy sector and, instead, returning to a reliance on fossil fuels. In April, Trump signed an order entitled “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and Amending Executive Order 14241”.

In the order, Trump stated, “Coal is abundant and cost-effective, and can be used in any weather condition. Moreover, the industry has historically employed hundreds of thousands of Americans. America’s coal resources are vast, with a current estimated value in the trillions of dollars, and are more than capable of substantially contributing to American energy independence, with excess to export to support allies and our economic competitiveness.”

Despite promises to lower consumer energy bills in the coming years, sectoral experts now believe that doubling down on coal production could actually lead to an increase in consumer energy bills, compared to investing in alternative energy sources, such as wind and solar power. Trump’s executive order tasked the Department of Energy (DoE) with ensuring that coal power plants continue to operate, even those that are destined for closure.

In July, the DoE published a report that states that current power plant retirements and additions will put the U.S. at massive risk of blackouts by the end of the decade. It has used its newly given powers to stop the closure of the J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan, even though the utility operating the plant warned that closing the facility would save consumers over $600 million. The DoE plans to halt the closure of other coal facilities across the country in line with Trump’s energy aims.

However, several energy experts have said that the report relies on worst-case scenarios to reach its conclusions and largely overlooks the new renewable energy capacity being added to the grid. Experts argue that paying to keep ageing coal plants online could result in consumers paying billions of dollars more for some of the least efficient and least reliable power plants on the grid, as well as put their health and the environment at risk.

A report from June, by the think tank Energy Innovation, showed that coal power was 28 percent more expensive in 2024 than in 2021, following several years of movement away from the “dirtiest fossil fuel” to various other less-polluting energy sources. The analysis shows that 95 percent of the 162 U.S. coal-fired power plants that were still operating at the beginning of the year were more expensive than in 2021, with costs increasing at twice the rate of inflation for half of these plants.

It's not just climate scientists who are concerned about the financial and environmental cost of keeping coal plants running, as one may have expected. Several U.S. utilities have found that the operating costs of coal plants are simply too high, particularly compared to gas-fueled facilities and renewables. Several utilities have chosen only to use coal plants for power as a last resort, when they cannot deliver enough solar or wind power to the grid, for example, due to the high cost of production. Experts believe that keeping more ageing coal plants online would inflate consumer costs further.

Most of the coal plants in the U.S. are old and inefficient, with the average age of a coal plant standing at 44 years in 2024. Older plants tend to be more expensive to run because they need more investment in maintenance. The generating power at these plants also falls over time, making them highly inefficient compared to many other energy sources. And consumers are seeing the effects of keeping these facilities online unnecessarily.

In Georgia, Plant Bowen was expected to be retried in 2028. However, Georgia Power has extended its life to 2035, even as costs rose from $46/MWh in 2021 to $72/MWh in 2025. This also follows six electricity bill increases for Georgia Power customers between 2023 and 2025. Meanwhile, in South Carolina, the Williams Station coal plant has had its retirement date delayed from 2028 to at least 2031, as costs have increased by $27/MWh, or more than 50 percent.

So, while President Trump insists that fossil fuels, including coal, will help fix the country’s “energy emergency”, the financial reports at many of these coal plants appear to prove otherwise. Meanwhile, the cost of gas and renewable energy production continues to fall, offering a cleaner alternative for consumers, as well as lower energy bills.

data centers.
But storing energy that way is relatively pricey and may still fall short of providing the nonstop energy that data centers need.
(As part of this week’s deal, OpenAI agreed to use Nvidia chips in at least 10 gigawatts’ worth of data centers.)
Many data centers near cities and towns don’t have that kind of space.","It’s been a big week for A.I. data centers. That means it’s also been a big week for coal and natural gas.

Nvidia this week announced a $100 billion investment to support OpenAI’s enormous build-out of data centers that use its chips. The next day, OpenAI said it had signed deals with SoftBank and Oracle to build five new data centers as part of the Stargate Project, a $500 billion plan for A.I. infrastructure. (The three companies unveiled it at the White House back in January.)

The announcements are the latest in a global push to speed the construction of A.I. data centers. OpenAI, Amazon, Google, Meta and Microsoft are together spending more than $325 billion on them by the end of the year. To stay on the bleeding edge, the companies want the latest processors, cooling systems, facilities — all running 24/7 on mind-bending quanta of electricity.

In the U.S., more than half of that power is coming from fossil fuels.

President Trump, who called green energy a “scam” at the U.N. General Assembly this week, has enthusiastically endorsed natural gas, coal and oil. He has also subsidized them. As part of his official A.I. plan, he pledged to scrap “radical climate dogma and bureaucratic red tape” and fast-track fossil fuel projects instead.

But there are reasons beyond politics that help explain why smog-spewing fossil fuels have become the go-to power source for futuristic data centers. The pairing is almost unavoidable — at least for now.

Renewables

Sprawling solar farms, windmills and hydroelectric dams are the best energy options for the planet, and usually the cheapest. Their economic upside has made them, collectively, the fastest-growing power source for data centers worldwide.

But renewables often can’t shoulder the load alone, despite being a major part of the A.I. power plan. That’s because servers hum and whir around the clock — not just when the sun is up or the wind is blowing. They demand a constant, stable flow of electricity. If power falters, even for a few seconds, companies lose thousands of dollars, sometimes more.

There’s a fix: Companies can pair solar and wind farms with massive batteries that store power and then release it in a steady stream. But storing energy that way is relatively pricey and may still fall short of providing the nonstop energy that data centers need. “Batteries are a great way to shift daytime electricity to evening electricity — but not a great way to shift July electricity to January electricity,” said Matthew Bunn, a professor at Harvard who studies energy policy. So even the greenest facilities rely on fossil fuels or the local grid for backup, he told DealBook.

Another challenge: The biggest data center campuses will consume multiple gigawatts of power. (As part of this week’s deal, OpenAI agreed to use Nvidia chips in at least 10 gigawatts’ worth of data centers.) To continuously produce just a single gigawatt, a renewable-energy plant would need around 12.5 million solar panels — enough to cover nearly 5,000 football fields. Wind turbines would need even more room. Many data centers near cities and towns don’t have that kind of space.

Nuclear

That’s where nuclear plants come in. They have smaller footprints, generate steady power and, like renewables, emit no carbon.

But they’re expensive. That’s why the nuclear industry has been in a decades-long rut. It boomed back in the 1970s, when the global energy crisis quadrupled oil prices. But Americans’ enthusiasm for nuclear energy soured after a series of headline-grabbing accidents, like the 1979 partial meltdown at Three Mile Island.

Around the same time, our electricity needs started to decline — which tends to happen in mature economies. Oil prices came down, so we stopped building nuclear reactors.

The industry has been groping for a good sales pitch ever since. With A.I., it finally has one: Energy demand is soaring, and nuclear companies can help fill the gap.

A slight snag: They’ll need another seven or eight years to do it, best-case scenario, said Jacopo Buongiorno, a nuclear science professor at M.I.T. That’s how long it takes to build new nuclear plants.

So, it’s a gamble: Tech companies investing in nuclear power (Microsoft, Google and Amazon, among others) are betting billions that A.I. demand will continue to rise a decade from now, when those nuclear facilities open for business. But it’s not clear their bets will pan out.

Fossil Fuels

The U.S. has vast natural gas reserves in underground reservoirs and offshore deposits, so it’s cheap and available. And the infrastructure to harness it can be ready fast: “A year or two, and you have a gas plant,” Buongiorno said.

If data centers continue expanding at their going rate, their energy needs will far surpass the current supply by 2030. So tech companies that need to bridge that widening gap are reaching for fossil fuels. Natural gas is already the top power source for U.S. data centers, according to the International Energy Agency, and it’s on track to dominate through at least 2030.

The only other energy source that can be deployed in one to two years — aligning with the construction timeline for most data centers — is solar, which has its own drawbacks.

His plan may work. It may also accelerate climate change by pumping heat-trapping gases into an atmosphere already at its highest-recorded temperature ever. For now, though, tech companies are seeing an opportunity to invest.

IN CASE YOU MISSED IT

Inflation held firm last month, the Fed’s preferred measure showed. Yesterday’s Personal Consumption Expenditures report showed core inflation rose 2.9 percent on an annualized basis, matching Wall Street forecasts, but still well above the central bank’s 2 percent target. That said, traders are still penciling in two more rate cuts even as Fed policymakers debate future moves.

Intel held investment talks with Apple. Intel’s shares soared on Wednesday after news broke that the company had held discussions with Apple about a possible investment. The talks, which took place before and after the Trump administration took a stake in Intel, raised questions about whether companies were considering Intel investments to please the White House.

Nvidia pledged to invest $100 billion in OpenAI. The chipmaker at the center of the artificial intelligence boom agreed to supply the ChatGPT developer with millions of its most advanced processors and said it would take an undisclosed equity stake. The deal — along with a separate announcement that OpenAI will team with SoftBank and Oracle to build five new U.S. data centers — underscores the astonishing costs of the A.I. business, which is raising hard questions about whether these gigantic investments will pay off.

Jimmy Kimmel returned to late-night TV. Kimmel was emotional and defiant in his first episode back after Disney suspended his show over comments he made about the killing of Charlie Kirk. The episode averaged 6.2 million viewers, almost four times its average audience, though Nexstar and Sinclair, which together own about 20 percent of ABC’s affiliates, pre-empted the show. President Trump suggested that he might take further action against ABC.

How the new H1-B fee is hitting in Silicon Valley

The White House’s announcement that it would charge a new $100,000 fee to applicants for the popular H1-B visa set off alarm bells across corporate America.

But they rang particularly loudly in Silicon Valley: About two-thirds of such visas, which are distributed via a lottery, go to workers in computer-related occupations.

“The first thing that happened was panic,” said Deedy Das, a partner at the venture capital firm Menlo Ventures, which has more than 250 start-ups in its portfolio.

DealBook’s Sarah Kessler talked with Das, who is a former H1-B visa holder, about how the change is being received at the smallest and largest companies in tech. The interview has been edited and condensed.

What have you heard from start-ups about the new fee?

When you are an immigrant start-up founder, one route you can take is to sponsor your own H1-B visa through your start-up.

That is probably the group most affected by a $100,000 fee, because you are paying out of your pocket. The company just got incorporated. You don’t have any cash. You don’t have funding.

The second most affected group are smaller start-ups. In computer science, about 60 percent of students who get Ph.D.s and 45 percent who get master’s degrees are international. So chances are, if I say, I want to hire anyone who is good enough, most of them are going to be on an H1-B. For those companies, $100,000 is meaningful.

What about larger start-ups?

Most of the later stage start-ups are at a point where they’re like, OK, we’re just paying the $100,000 fee.

It’s not ideal. But even if you have a thousand employees, you’re probably not hiring more than 100 people on H1-B next year. You’re probably hiring like 10. Maybe I just spend a million dollars in a one-time fee and continue doing what I was doing.

Will they just set up remote offices in other countries?

I don’t think start-ups will overnight decide, hey, we need an office somewhere else. There are tons of issues with offices in Europe, tons of issues with offices in India and China, all of these other places. It takes a lot of work.

I was talking to an start-up founder who liked that there’d be less competition for the lottery.

I think it is a reasonable incentive to say, if you want to hire internationally, pay more. Do I think 100K is the right amount? I mean, no, maybe start with 20K.

The IT consultancies who typically abuse these programs might resort to another kind of visa, but leaving that aside, I think they will struggle because they disproportionately use visas to pay lower wages.

Do you think the $100k fee makes starting a company in the U.S. less appealing?

Absolutely.

It’s hard to describe just how much better America is for entrepreneurship than the rest of the world: Everything from ease of doing business, access to capital and funding, access to talent and the social acceptance of failure. About half of the Fortune 500 has an immigrant founder.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/27/business/27DB-data-center/27DB-data-center-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-27 12:02:55.713074
