$12 Million in Power Authority Funding to Support NYSDOL Efforts to Connect Workers to Opportunities in Clean Energy Economy

DEC Announces $4 Million in Green Jobs for Youth' Program Grants in Environmental Justice Communities

Today (Sept 25), during Climate Week, Governor Kathy Hochul announced $16 Million in state funds to support the development of New York's clean energy workforce. The New York Power Authority (NYPA) approved $12 million in funding to the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to support workforce training and retraining, and to prepare workers for employment in clean energy careers. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) awarded $4 million in grant funding to support skills training for green jobs for young New Yorkers.

""As we transition to a clean energy future, it is essential that we equip New Yorkers with the skills and opportunities necessary to thrive in this evolving industry,""Governor Hochul said.""By investing in education and training programs, we are positioning New York's workforce to lead the way in developing sustainable energy solutions that will spur economic growth and lead us to a cleaner, healthier environment.""

Of the $12 million in funding approved by the NYPA Board of Trustees, $7 million will support the expansion and development of electric vehicle (EV) training programs specializing in maintenance and repair for vehicles and charging stations. The remaining $5 million will be allocated to the NYSDOL Support Services Fund, which strengthens the availability of supportive services for participants enrolled in a clean energy training program, including but not limited to childcare, transportation, student fees and books.

The NYPA funding stems from a commitment in the 2023-24 Enacted State Budget and will largely support the efforts of the New York State Department of Labor through their Office of Just Energy Transition (OJET) to connect workers to opportunities for jobs in the clean energy economy through upskilling and training with a focus on serving those who are traditionally underrepresented, especially within disadvantaged communities.

Last year, the Power Authority allocated $25 million for workforce development funding, demonstrating its strong commitment to building a skilled labor force for New York's clean energy future. NYPA will continue to support workforce training initiatives to support New York's workforce and meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

NYPA actively engages with each community training organization to ensure skills training is matched with needed positions and participant success through supportive wraparound services. NYPA's collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills and providing guidance on training locations to ensure statewide reach of the awards.

An additional $4 million in grants are available from DEC for Green Jobs for Youth workforce funding programs developed or funded by community-based organizations in or serving environmental justice and disadvantaged communities. The initiative helps prepare youth between the ages of 17-24 for jobs in the green economy through workforce development, skills training, and certification. This grant was last offered in 2017, with approximately $1 million helping train and educate more than 370 participants and 59 youth placed into jobs to date. For a complete list of guidelines and more information, contact DEC's Office of Environmental Justice at 518-402-2600,ejgrants@dec.ny.gov, or online atDEC's Environmental Justice webpage. Questions regarding this grant opportunity will be accepted until close of business Dec. 31, 2025. Applications are due by 3 p.m. on Jan. 28, 2026.

Funding for DEC's Green Jobs for Youth Grants is provided by the State's Environmental Protection Fund (EPF) as part of New York State's ongoing commitment to environmental justice. The 2025-26 enacted State Budget increases the EPF to a record $425 million, helping support work directly in disadvantaged communities, as well as other critical environmental programs such as land acquisition, farmland protection, invasive species prevention and eradication, enhanced recreational access, and water quality improvement.

“Canada’s auto industry is facing an existential crisis, with U.S. tariffs threatening current and future product investments, including electric vehicles,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Lifting tariffs on China, will make a bad situation far worse, if Canada becomes a dumping ground for cheap, unfairly subsidized imports.”

Unifor’s submission to the government’s Section 53 China Electric Vehicle Surtax Review states that competition from Chinese automakers poses an immediate threat to Canadian jobs and the country’s automotive supply chain, including the steel and aluminum sectors.

Since 2020, Unifor says that Canada has positioned itself for growth in the automotive sector by securing investments in vehicle assembly programs, battery production, and critical mineral processing. In a statement, Unifor warns that “recent disruptions, from U.S. tariffs on Canadian-built vehicles, to policy rollbacks on EV supports, to rising Chinese import penetration, threaten to reverse these hard-won gains.”

“As of August 2025, one-third of our members at Detroit Three facilities in Canada are on layoff, with three assembly plants sitting idle,” said Payne. “At a time when auto workers are facing layoffs and uncertainty, lifting the surtax would be nothing short of a self-inflicted wound.”

In its submission, Unifor reportedly recommended that the federal government:

Maintain the existing 100% surtax on imported Chinese EVs for an additional 24 months.

Extend surtaxes to strategic EV and battery-related components.

Reinstate and expand federal EV rebate programs, with conditions to prioritize Canadian- and North American-built vehicles.

Strengthen enforcement against goods produced with forced labour.

“Workers have done everything asked of them to build Canada’s auto industry for the future,” added Payne. “Now it’s time for government to stand firm, defend our industry, and ensure our net-zero future is made in Canada with good, union jobs at its core.”",https://www.canadianmanufacturing.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Unifor_Unifor_calls_to_maintain_China_EV_surtax_to_protect_Canad.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 03:58:20.196104

Here's what you need to know about the upcoming refrigerant changes and how they may impact you.

What's Changing?

Beginning January 1, 2025, manufacturers can no longer produce new HVAC systems using R-410A refrigerant, the most common cooling agent in residential air conditioners and heat pumps. This phase-out is part of the American Innovation and Manufacturing (AIM) Act, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by transitioning away from high Global Warming Potential (GWP) refrigerants.

R-410A has a GWP of 2,088, meaning it contributes significantly to climate change when released into the atmosphere. The new regulations require all refrigerants in new systems to have a GWP of 700 or less.

The New Refrigerants

Two environmentally friendly alternatives are replacing R-410A:

R-454B (Opteon XL41 or Puron Advance): Provides up to a 78% reduction in global warming potential while maintaining similar cooling performance to R-410A. Most major manufacturers including Carrier, Trane, and Lennox have chosen this as their primary replacement.

R-32: Offers up to 12% better efficiency than R-410A systems and has a GWP of approximately 675. Daikin and some other manufacturers have selected R-32 for certain applications.

Impact on Homeowners

If you have an existing system: You can continue using your current HVAC system without any immediate changes required. Existing equipment is not subject to EPA regulations and can continue to be used through equipment end-of-life. R-410A will remain available for servicing existing systems, though supplies may become more expensive over time.

If you're buying a new system: Systems manufactured before January 1, 2025, can still be installed through December 31, 2025, giving consumers a one-year transition period. However, new EPA-compliant systems are expected to cost at least 20% more than current models due to advanced technology and manufacturing requirements.

Safety Considerations

The new refrigerants are classified as A2L, meaning they have low toxicity but are mildly flammable—much less so than propane or natural gas. New systems include advanced leak detection sensors that automatically shut off the unit and activate ventilation if a leak is detected.

Benefits of the Transition

Beyond environmental protection, the new refrigerants offer several advantages:

Potential utility bill savings of 5-10% due to improved energy efficiency

EPA estimates this transition will result in emissions reductions equivalent to up to 876 million metric tons of carbon dioxide from 2025 through 2050

Long-term cost savings through reduced energy consumption

Planning Ahead

While there's no immediate need to replace functioning systems, homeowners should consider their options carefully. If your current system is aging or inefficient, upgrading before 2025 might offer cost savings, while waiting allows you to invest in the latest environmentally friendly technology.

HVAC contractors are receiving specialized training to safely handle the new refrigerants, ensuring professional installation and service continue without interruption.

For more information about how these changes might affect your specific situation, consult with a qualified HVAC professional who can assess your current system and discuss your options.",https://lirp.cdn-website.com/9b7d9577/dms3rep/multi/opt/pexels-photo-6471914-1920w.jpeg,N,,2025-09-26 03:58:14.305706

CHILLICOTHE, Ohio, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Centrus Energy (NYSE American: LEU) is joining with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, U.S. Senator Jon Husted, and U.S. Congressman Dave Taylor, JobsOhio, Ohio Southeast Economic Development (OhioSE), and Pike County Economic Development, today to announce plans for a major expansion of Centrus' uranium enrichment plant in Piketon, Ohio. The expansion is expected to create 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operations jobs at the Piketon site, while retaining 127 existing jobs, boosting Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) and High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) production. The size and scope of the expansion depend on federal funding decisions from the U.S. Department of Energy for LEU and HALEU, and a large-scale expansion would represent a multi-billion-dollar private and public investment into Ohio.

""The time has come to restore America's ability to enrich uranium at scale,"" said Centrus CEO Amir Vexler. ""We are planning a historic, multi-billion-dollar investment right here in Ohio – supported by a nationwide supply chain to do just that. When it comes to powering our energy future, it's time to stop relying on foreign, state-owned corporations and start investing in American technology, built by American workers.""

The project is also expected to support hundreds of jobs at Centrus' centrifuge manufacturing plant in Tennessee and throughout its manufacturing supply chain – which is entirely domestic – along with thousands of indirect jobs in Ohio, Tennessee, and across the country.

JobsOhio and OhioSE will be long-term partners to Centrus as the company ramps up recruiting and hiring to fill the 300 operations jobs this project is expected to create. The company will discuss the announcement today at the Ross County Employment Expo in Chillicothe, Ohio, where Centrus is meeting with potential job candidates.

""Centrus' commitment to expand and upgrade its Piketon facility underscores Ohio's importance in supporting our nation's economic and national security,"" said Ohio Governor Mike DeWine. ""Uranium enrichment operations in Piketon have played a critical role in U.S. national defense since the earliest days of the Cold War, and Centrus' facility provides the only technology available today capable of building out domestic enrichment at an industrial scale.""

A Multi-Billion-Dollar Expansion

In anticipation of the expansion, Centrus raised more than $1.2 billion in a pair of convertible note transactions over the last 12 months and has secured more than $2 billion in contingent purchase commitments from utility customers in the United States and around the world. Centrus has also announced its collaboration with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power and POSCO International to potentially invest in the project.

Centrus recently submitted proposals to the U.S. Department of Energy as part of a competitive selection process for potential awards to expand domestic production of LEU for existing reactors and HALEU for advanced reactors. Subject to being selected for funding by the U.S. Department of Energy, Centrus' expansion plans call for a multi-billion-dollar public and private investment to add thousands of additional centrifuges at its American Centrifuge Plant in Piketon, Ohio, delivering large-scale production of both LEU and HALEU.

""Today's announcement is critical, not just for the people of Southeast Ohio, but for our nation. Expanding our ability to enrich uranium here in Ohio will continue America's legacy as the global leader in nuclear development,"" said U.S. Senator Jon Husted. ""This facility will be a key resource in maintaining America's nuclear fleet and bringing power to millions of homes and businesses through modern modular reactors, and it begins with the hardworking and talented people here in Ohio.""

American Technology, Built by American Workers

Almost 100 percent of the world's enrichment capacity belongs to foreign, state-owned enterprises; those companies use centrifuge technologies exclusively manufactured overseas. Centrus is the only active enricher that uses American technology and manufactures centrifuges and supporting equipment exclusively in the United States. If Centrus is selected for federal funding, that funding will be spent in the United States, not on overseas manufacturing.

""In step with President Trump, Centrus is restoring American energy dominance, bringing back energy independence, and creating good American jobs to put our talented workforce to work,"" said U.S. Rep. Dave Taylor. ""No longer shall our Nation lose jobs and risk energy security through reliance on foreign countries. I am confident that the critical work being done right here at Centrus's Piketon plant will keep Ohio a leader in nuclear energy and usher America into a new Golden Age of energy production.""

The company will manufacture its centrifuges in Oak Ridge, Tenn., with the support of a nationwide manufacturing supply chain that currently spans 14 major suppliers in 13 states. The centrifuges and supporting equipment will then be sent to Piketon for final assembly, installation and operation.

""America is becoming more reliant on nuclear energy, and Centrus is the only American-owned uranium enrichment facility that fuels nuclear power,"" said Lt. Governor Jim Tressel. ""This is great news for America and will create jobs and opportunity in Pike County.""

The JobsOhio Talent Acquisition Services team is working in partnership with Centrus to support the company's overall talent strategy. Tactics could include talent attraction campaigns and pipeline development efforts through marketing, recruitment and training initiatives for operators and technicians. There are no state of Ohio or JobsOhio grants, loans, or tax credits planned at this time.

""Centrus' Piketon uranium enrichment facility is one of a kind in the United States, and it has a critical role to play in reclaiming America's global nuclear leadership and in meeting our enduring national security requirements,"" said JobsOhio President and CEO J.P. Nauseef. ""As the technology to provide this essential service and production advances, JobsOhio and OhioSE look forward to partnering with Centrus to ensure its proven workforce continues to thrive and grow.""

Centrus has already begun hiring in anticipation of the expansion and is partnering with JobsOhio to identify and recruit potential job applicants.

""The investment and job creation that Centrus has announced will provide amazing opportunities in the southern portion of the OhioSE region,"" said Matt Abbott, OhioSE President and CEO. ""We are pleased to be a part of this monumental project.""

What They Are Saying:

""Centrus' major investment in Piketon solidifies Ohio's continued leadership in the energy sector – both today, and into the future. In my capacity as Senate Energy Committee Chairman, I am proud to support policies that will ensure Ohio's energy remains reliable and affordable for decades to come. Centrus and their activities in Piketon will play a major role in this effort. I applaud Centrus and their commitment to supporting the economic future of Southeast Ohio!""

– State Senator Brian Chavez, Senate Energy Committee Chairman

""Thank you to Centrus Energy Corp. for the vital and forward-looking endeavor for Ohio's 17th Senate District.

Fermi's Gas Generation Equipment Secured or under LOI to Date Now Totals 2.0 GW of Combined Cycle Power at ISO Conditions, Scheduled for 2026 Delivery

Siemens Energy Displays Strong U.S. Commitment Via Gas Turbine Allocation and Highlights its Broadening Nuclear Capabilities Via AP1000 Steam Turbine Collaboration

AMARILLO, Texas, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America, in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, is announcing two landmark letters of intent with Siemens Energy to secure 1.1 GW (at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode) of Frame F Class Generation Equipment for 2026 delivery and collaborate on Siemens' flagship nuclear steam turbine technologies, in support of Fermi's 11-Gigawatt AI campus.

These agreements mark a major milestone in the fulfillment of President Donald J. Trump's promise to restore U.S. energy dominance and to ensure America wins the global race to power the future of artificial intelligence.

Under the first letter of intent, Siemens Energy will negotiate to deliver three F-class SGT6-5000F gas turbine units, producing up to 1.1 GW at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode. These turbines are proven, efficient, industrial-grade machines capable of highly reliable 24/7 base load applications.

""Winning the AI arms race doesn't just take software developers. It takes more electricity,"" said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. ""This campus proves that we can integrate natural gas, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence into a single, powerful ecosystem. Modern energy infrastructure isn't a luxury, it's the foundation of global leadership. By advancing President Trump's Energy Dominance Agenda, we're not just fueling America — we're powering the future of intelligence.""

Fermi's campus was envisioned as a flagship example of the Trump administration's strategy: pairing advanced, reliable, quickly-deployable natural gas generation with nuclear power and modern infrastructure to ensure the U.S. can safely meet America's growing energy demand—particularly from AI and high-performance computing. With the new agreements, Fermi's gas generation equipment secured or under LOI to date now totals 2.0 GW of combined cycle power at ISO conditions, scheduled for 2026 delivery.

""No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,"" said former U.S Secretary of Energy and Fermi Co-Founder Rick Perry. ""The Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and Department of Defense are all working tirelessly to secure America's position in this AI race and to ensure that our private sector, with the strong support of this pro-energy administration, has what we need to lead the way in abundant, reliable, and innovative energy solutions.""

""I want to thank President Trump for his strong leadership and action in clearing the path for companies like ours to help America win this race,"" added Toby Neugebauer, Fermi America CEO and Co-Founder. ""Fermi America is doing what it takes 24/7 to build exactly what the President has asked for, highly reliable, unshakable, base load energy — through our 11 GW gas-bridged nuclear build. We understand the stakes are high and we are playing to win – because that's how America keeps its AI edge.""

The second letter of intent furthers the two companies' collaboration on integrating Siemens' industry-leading steam turbines, generators, and control systems into Fermi's expanding nuclear power portfolio, which include the deployment of an expected four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors.

Siemens Energy brings deep expertise, demonstrated by several modernizations of turbines and generators at multiple nuclear plants. Fermi and Siemens Energy will work closely to deliver nuclear generation with clean, efficient, robust performance.

This framework aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment, streamline nuclear regulation, and ensure that the U.S. infrastructure needed for AI and data centers has the clean, reliable, always-on power that only nuclear and strategic redundancies can provide, without unnecessarily putting a strain on the public grid.

Not only do these agreements reinforce the administration's goal of U.S. energy dominance by expanding domestic, reliable, low-carbon power, they deliver on President Donald J. Trump's pledge to speed up nuclear licensing and regulation, rebuild the nuclear industrial base, and expand natural gas generation to meet the urgency of demand.

When the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing, countries must rely on costly backup — mostly fossil fuels.
Every 10% increase in the share of wind and solar raises average power costs by over four cents per kilowatt-hour.
Across developing nations, electricity demand rose almost 5% last year — mostly met by fossil fuels.
We should focus on innovation that can genuinely make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels.","At the Sept. 23, 2025, U.N. General Assembly, President Donald Trump drew global headlines by blasting what he called the “extreme cost” of the green transition, arguing that climate alarmism is impoverishing ordinary people while enriching elites. Whatever one thinks of Trump’s rhetoric, he touched on an inconvenient truth: despite endless assurances from campaigners and institutions like the U.N., World Bank, and World Economic Forum, wind and solar are still not delivering cheap energy. In fact, they are making electricity more expensive.

For years, media and green advocates have insisted that solar and wind are now the cheapest forms of electricity. This claim is central to the idea that a green transition is inevitable and beneficial — even under a second Trump administration. But two decades of evidence shows the opposite. The countries that have added the most solar and wind also have the highest power costs.

The claim of “cheap” solar and wind is built on a sleight of hand. These sources are indeed often competitive when the sun is shining or the wind is blowing. But modern societies need power 24/7. When the sun is not shining and the wind not blowing, countries must rely on costly backup — mostly fossil fuels. Factoring in these costs reveals that renewables are far from cheap.

WORLD LEADERS LAUGH, SQUIRM AS TRUMP BLASTS UN ON CLIMATE, UKRAINE, GAZA AT GENERAL ASSEMBLY

A study of China found solar’s real cost was twice that of coal. Research about Germany and Texas showed that once backup costs are included, solar and wind go from appearing slightly cheaper to many times more expensive.

We see this in consumer prices. Germany, Spain, Denmark and the U.K. have some of the world’s highest electricity costs alongside massive investments in renewables. Last year, households and industries in the EU paid more than 26 cents per kilowatt-hour, more than double the U.S. price of 13 cents and triple the price in China. The U.K., with its even greener ambition, paid an eye-watering 36 cents per kilowatt-hour, nearly three times the U.S. price and more than four times the price in China.

Across 70 countries, International Energy Agency data shows a clear pattern: more renewables, higher costs. Every 10% increase in the share of wind and solar raises average power costs by over four cents per kilowatt-hour.

Headlines often tout how Germany and other nations and states generate most of their electricity from renewables. But these stories never mention the dark, windless days when solar and wind provide almost nothing. Last winter, renewables repeatedly delivered less than 4% of Germany’s power for an entire day.

TRUMP’S ENERGY PRICE PROMISE IS COMING DUE. HE HAS THE POWER TO SOLVE THE CRISIS

Advocates say batteries will fix this problem. But all of Germany’s storage would last less than 20 minutes. The reality: fossil fuels remain essential, but because they now run less frequently, costs soar. Last November, when solar and wind provided almost nothing, wholesale German prices spiked to $1 per kilowatt-hour

As conventional plants shut down, the risks rise. A German utility CEO warned the country narrowly avoided blackouts only because the weather wasn’t colder.

If solar and wind were truly cheaper, poor countries would leapfrog to them. Yet the opposite is happening. Across developing nations, electricity demand rose almost 5% last year — mostly met by fossil fuels. China used more additional coal than it used additional solar and wind combined. Bangladesh used 13 times more additional coal than additional renewables.

‘WEB OF DARK MONEY’ TIED TO OBAMA, DEMS FUELS GREEN OPPOSITION TO CRUCIAL TRUMP ENERGY PLAN

India, praised for ambitious solar goals, still added three times more coal than solar and wind. Billionaire Gautam Adani, struggling to find buyers for a $6 billion solar project, allegedly resorted to a $265 million bribery scheme — because most Indian states refuse to rely on unreliable renewables.

Poor nations know reliability matters. Rich nations can indulge the solar-and-wind illusion only because they already have fossil backups and lavish subsidies.

Europe’s high prices at least reflect the true costs of renewables. The U.S. disguises them through subsidies. Federal tax credits for wind and solar alone cost nearly $18 billion in 2024, with states adding billions more. In Texas alone, total subsidies may have reached nearly $20 billion in 2023 — 10 times the federal subsidies.

Across the U.S., hidden subsidies may exceed $60 billion annually, meaning real power costs are about 25% higher than official bills suggest.

GARGANTUAN ‘BIRD CEMETERIES’ IN BURGUM’S CROSSHAIRS AS DOI LOOKS TO CURB GREEN WIND PROJECTS

The myth of cheap renewables is comforting but destructive. It sustains a system of rising bills and endless subsidies, hitting the poorest hardest.

Trump is right to call out the economic damage of today’s climate policies. But the solution is not to ignore climate change — it is to pursue smarter ones. We should focus on innovation that can genuinely make green energy cheaper than fossil fuels. This means dramatically more investment in research and development: from advanced nuclear to more reliable renewables with storage to geothermal breakthroughs.

Such investments would cost far less than today’s climate spending and deliver real benefits. Until then, fossil fuels will remain indispensable. Pretending otherwise only makes energy more costly and less secure.

The world needs honesty: solar and wind are not yet cheap because they need backup, and forcing them onto power grids only raises prices. If rich countries concerned with climate change prioritize innovation over illusion, they could lead a real green revolution — one built not on slogans, but on affordable, reliable energy for all.

If you’ve walked along Brooklyn’s Sunset Park waterfront lately, you may have noticed a new barge near the South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, with a unique set of equipment onboard. This American-flagged vessel is loaded with American-made cable, manufactured in South Carolina and now being installed with help from union workers into the seabed off the coast of New York. That cable will soon connect the Empire Wind offshore wind project directly to New York City’s electric grid.

In today’s tough economic climate, it may feel like New York’s clean energy ambitions have been put on pause. But that’s far from the truth. This barge is one indicator that projects like Empire Wind 1 are moving forward—creating jobs, strengthening local economies and proving that offshore wind is not some distant hope, but a real and rising industry.

On Long Island, we face real economic headwinds: A shrinking youth population due to high housing costs, sluggish job growth and tariff exposure. But we also have valuable assets: over 2,000 manufacturing companies, a resilient defense sector, and world-renowned research institutions like Cold Spring Harbor and Brookhaven labs.

When population trends are shifting, and job growth is slowing, one of the best responses is to encourage emerging industries that create well-paying, future-ready careers. That’s exactly what we’re seeing now as a handful of major, federally approved offshore wind projects begin to deliver real economic momentum across the region.

For the first time since the exit of Grumman Aerospace from Long Island, we are building an industry that could rival the post-World War II defense boom. Offshore wind brings with it advanced manufacturing jobs, supply chain investments and innovation-driven careers. These are not abstract promises—they’re already taking shape. As Long Islanders know, Orsted’s South Fork Wind project is already operational and powering 70,000 homes. The company’s Sunrise Wind development is next in line, and between the two, Orsted has already supported more than 1,400 workers logging over 3 million hours, with a local economic impact estimated at $58 million.

Building on this momentum, Equinor’s Empire Wind project represents the next major leap in New York’s offshore wind ambitions, with $5 billion in capital investment and the capacity to power half a million homes. Work is underway at the 73-acre South Brooklyn Marine Terminal, which will become the project’s control center and maintenance base. So far, Empire Wind has supported more than 2,000 jobs and activated a broad network of American suppliers, from steel fabricators to underground utility crews.

We see the same momentum elsewhere. In Massachusetts, Vineyard Wind has employed 1,700 local workers and is set to come online soon. In Virginia, Dominion Energy’s Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, first leased in 2013 and fully permitted in 2023, is on track to power 660,000 homes by 2026.

And there’s more to come. Developers like Community Offshore Wind are actively engaged in the bidding process for future New York contracts, and others like Attentive Energy could re-enter the market if conditions improve.

These projects don’t happen overnight. They require years of planning, permitting, technical studies and public engagement. What they truly require, above all, is sustained commitment. Success doesn’t come from short-term thinking—it comes from staying the course.

Offshore wind represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to reinvest in domestic manufacturing, modernize our infrastructure, and expand the workforce training programs that prepare people for tomorrow’s jobs. It’s also a matter of national security. Strengthening our energy independence makes us more resilient in a volatile global economy.

This must be part of a broader strategy that includes solar, hydrogen, thermal, existing fossil fuel production and other emerging technologies. The goal is not to replace one energy source with another. It’s to build a balanced, secure and forward-looking system.

We’re not starting from scratch. Long Islanders have powered this country before—designing complex systems, solving big problems, and helping America lead. Offshore wind is our chance to do that again, and this time with cleaner, smarter tools. The foundation is in place, the progress is real, and the potential is enormous. Now is the time to keep building.",https://libn.com/files/2025/05/AP25125499978507-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-26 00:58:43.157735

But clean energy leaders are pushing forward.
Throughout the day, conference attendees heard from panelists representing energy providers, auto manufacturers, tech companies, energy storage innovators and conservation organizations.
As the first slate of speakers took the stage, all of them addressed the elephant in the climate room: today's political landscape.
Octopus Energy CEO Nick Chaset echoed those remarks during the ""Red, White and Blue Growth Areas for Clean Energy"" panel as he pushed for leaders to adopt practical policies over partisan policies.","Solving the climate crisis amid today's political landscape can feel at best sluggish and at worst helpless. But clean energy leaders are pushing forward.

Executives from across the sustainability spectrum gathered at Newsweek's ""Powering Ahead"" event on Thursday to offer practical solutions that can succeed, even in the face of headwinds.

""Some of the topics that we're taking on today, not exactly upbeat at first glance,"" Newsweek's Environmental and Sustainability Editor Jeffery Young said in his opening remarks from One World Trade.

""We've got energy demand that is surging to power homes, manufacturing, the AI boom of course, data centers. EVs are revolutionizing the auto sector, which presents both risks and opportunities. We have an interconnected set of crises with climate change, with plastic waste and plastic pollution, a loss of nature,"" he said. ""But because all of those things are intertwined, there are the opportunities for elegant solutions.""

Throughout the day, conference attendees heard from panelists representing energy providers, auto manufacturers, tech companies, energy storage innovators and conservation organizations.

""Most of the people that we're going to have on the stage today are real change makers, not only in developing solutions, but in scaling up solutions so that they can meet the size of these considerable challenges that we have,"" Young said.

As the first slate of speakers took the stage, all of them addressed the elephant in the climate room: today's political landscape.

""It is broadly infuriating and exhausting for an industry to become a political football that gets spiked by both parties,"" American Clean Power Association CEO Jason Grumet told Young. ""It's impossible for the country. If every four years, the government splits sides and says, 'We now don't like this part of the American economy,' we just can't build anything.""

Octopus Energy CEO Nick Chaset echoed those remarks during the ""Red, White and Blue Growth Areas for Clean Energy"" panel as he pushed for leaders to adopt practical policies over partisan policies.

""Energy consumers from Texas to San Francisco to New York City are really concerned about the ability to pay their bills and the lights being on,"" Chaset said. ""The other things, whether it's clean or not, are important, but those are the day-to-day concerns.""

""In Texas, where we operate as a business, we offer 100 percent renewables,"" he continued. ""But we market it as, 'This is the lowest cost, most reliable, fastest solution,' and that's what customers want, and it's not politicized.""

Mike Richter, the president of Brightcore Energy and a former Stanley Cup champion, chimed in, calling it a shame that these solutions have become politicized. Richter argued that conservatives and liberals are likely to agree that no one wants to drink dirty water or breathe poor quality air.

""We really work in the commercial industrial space, just trying to optimize the buildings, make them more efficient, use less energy,"" he said of Brightcore. ""That's not political, that's just smart.""

""When you can start selling the promise with cheaper electricity, people are raising their hands. You have off the shelf technologies delivering that now. That's all that matters,"" Richter said.

Later in the morning, battery experts and electricity providers talked about how Virtual Power Plants and data centers offer economically-friendly answers to the issue of selling sustainability.

""We set out to solve the economic problem that is renewable energy. We were able to devise a financial model where we are able to monetize the revenue that we obtain,"" Regan George, the CEO of SOLRITE Energy, told the room.

During the ""Powering Data and Tapping Data's Power"" panel, speakers focused on the recent AI boom, which has led the Energy Department to project that as much as 12 percent of the total U.S. electricity production could be used solely for data centers.

""It is top of mind for everybody,"" Steven Carlini, vice president of innovation and data centers at Schneider Electric, said.

Eileen Falkenberg-Hull, Newsweek's senior autos editor, also welcomed major EV players onto the stage Thursday.

In a conversation with Megan Farrell, the senior director of sustainability at Rivian, Falkenberg-Hull inquired about Rivian's leadership not only as an electric vehicle brand but also as an American manufacturer.

""At Rivian, we are very proud to contribute to America's leadership in this very important sector, and we feel that we do that through our innovation, our technology and our vehicles, as well as the jobs that we create,"" Farrell said.

She added that the brand anticipates its forthcoming plant in Georgia to add 7,500 jobs to the economy and to produce 400,000 vehicles a year.

Mercedes-Benz High-Power Charging President and CEO Andrew Cornelia, Electric Era Chief Revenue Officer Kyler Schmitz and Electrify America Director of Energy Services Jigar Shah also spoke to Falkenberg-Hull about the ways they're making EVs more approachable to prospective buyers.

Those efforts include selecting charging sites where people will feel safe going at all hours of the day, streamlining payment options, building a fast network and bringing down prices.

Nick Sandland, the chief business officer of Algenesis Labs, provided a glimpse of how these climate solutions can work in the consumer goods and products sector during the plastics panel. Algenesis, which creates durable and biodegradable products ranging from footwear to phone cases, is aiming to ""demonstrate to people that we can make high-quality, high-performing products that are bio-based.""

Nick Mallos, the vice president of conservation and ocean plastics for the Ocean Conservancy, took a moment during the plastics panel to remark how far the conversation has come.

""To have that quick evolution of public awareness in just a short period of time, compared to the broader climate debate, which some might say the jury is still out, I think it's fascinating,"" Mallos said.

On the final panel of the day, speakers joining the ""A New Asset Class: Nature as Infrastructure"" discussion emphasized how natural resources remain viable solutions to today's problems. The real task is to get stakeholders to understand that the value of these assets goes beyond just carbon and into factors like biodiversity or soil surface.

""That's one area where the exchanges and the commodity markets have gotten this market wrong,"" Jason Libersky, the founder and CEO of Quotient Markets, Inc., argued.

At the end of the day, Young echoed Libersky, emphasizing the importance of improving accounting for nature. It was one of Young's five key takeaways from the day. Before the attendees left to enjoy a networking reception, he urged leaders to find partnership amidst instability.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2728244/jeff-young-powering-ahead.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 22:58:20.572165

FRANKFORT, Ky. (KT) –Kentucky and West Virginia are co-leading a 26-state coalition to repeal some of what they consider the Environmental Protection Agency’s worst policies of the last decades, said Kentucky Attorney General Russell Coleman.

They include the Green New Deal, the EPA’s electric vehicle mandates and the so-called Clean Power Plan. In a comment letter to the Trump Administration’s EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, the attorneys general supported the reversal of the EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding under the Clean Air Act.

In 2009, the Obama Administration relied on bad science and untested legal theories to rule that carbon dioxide was a major contributor to climate change and was a danger to public health. That one decision became the justification for the federal government’s assault on Kentuckians through costly and burdensome regulations.

“Finalizing this proposed action is an important step to freeing American industry from burdensome, unlawful regulations and restoring the Clean Air Act’s proper, congressionally intended structure,” they stated in their letter.

The attorneys general argued that the Obama Administration’s finding was both unlawful and scientifically unproven. The Trump Administration’s EPA has formally begun the regulatory process to repeal the Endangerment Finding that they say has burdened Kentucky’s economy and workers for so long.

“The nonsensical green agenda has gone on long enough. For 15 years, this one unlawful decision from the EPA has been the justification for assaults on Kentucky,” Coleman said.“Along with AGs across the country, we’re partnering with President Trump to preserve affordable and reliable energy in Kentucky and to stop the madness that has hiked prices and killed jobs.”

Last year, Kentucky and West Virginia led a 25-state coalition to block President Biden and his EPA from imposing an EV mandate on passenger cars, light-duty trucks and medium-duty vehicles. That legal challenge was one of several efforts led by Coleman to oppose EV mandates.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers.
New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users.
Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

The average American born in 2024 will likely face up to $500,000 in additional lifetime costs from climate crisis, and those who experience more severe effects will see up to $1m in costs, the Costs of Climate Change: Financial and Economic Impacts on California report states.
“Climate change is raising the cost of living in ways that we may not know,” said F Noel Perry, the Next 10 founder.
Addressing the climate crisis costs money, Alex said, but there are massive costs for failing to take action.
“We cannot solve the affordability crisis in California without also solving the climate crisis,” Perry said.","The climate emergency is significantly increasing costs for California households in the form of rising utility bills, lost wages and growing healthcare expenses, worsening the state’s affordability crisis, according to a sweeping new report.

The average American born in 2024 will likely face up to $500,000 in additional lifetime costs from climate crisis, and those who experience more severe effects will see up to $1m in costs, the Costs of Climate Change: Financial and Economic Impacts on California report states.

The analysis from the Center for Law, Energy & Environment at the University of California, Berkeley, commissioned by the environment and economy non-profit Next 10, examines more than 100 primary sources together for the first time to provide a deeper look at what researchers describe as the “hidden costs” of the climate crisis in California.

“Climate change is raising the cost of living in ways that we may not know,” said F Noel Perry, the Next 10 founder. “From agricultural workers in the Central valley losing work because of drought or heat [to] patients not getting medical care because of extreme weather, to increases in home insurance.”

California has long been one of the most expensive states in the nation with its high cost of living and expensive housing. Meanwhile, a recent report revealed that since the rollback of pandemic era policies, California has developed the highest poverty rate in the US, alongside Louisiana.

The state has also had to grapple with increasingly extreme weather fueled by climate change from devastating and deadly wildfires, year after year, that displace entire communities and spread smoke across the region to grueling heatwaves and intense winter storms. In January, wildfires tore through the LA communities of Altadena and the Pacific Palisades, killing 31 people and destroying more than 18,000 structures.

People often perceive climate change as a set of future costs, but the consequences are already impacting people in unexpected ways, including inflation, food prices and availability, and insurance, said Ken Alex, with UC Berkeley’s Center for Law, Energy and Environment.

“We really wanted to take a deeper look at the costs to individuals [and] to businesses,” Alex said. “These are immediate costs that are affecting people in their current lives.”

“It’s not a future set of abstract numbers. It’s real and it’s immediate,” he added.

The report highlights the far-reaching impacts of the January wildfires, among others, which resulted in $4.6bn in GDP losses and nearly $300m in lost wages for workers and businesses, eliminating generations of family wealth. Between 2017 and 2021, there were about $60bn in income losses across the state due to wildfires, according to a Moore Foundation report cited in the analysis.

Californians are facing skyrocketing power bills at the same time, and wildfire-related costs account for up to 13% of recent increases, the report states. Extreme heat further increases electricity costs each day, as when temperatures reach 95F, electricity costs rise by 1.6%.

Smoke exposure associated with wildfires in southern California costs an estimated $84.42 a person per day, according to a 2012 study cited in the report. The unhealthy air caused by fires is already affecting outdoor workers and by 2050 they are are expected to see future earnings losses of up to $55.4bn because of the climate. In 2018, wildfire smoke led to an estimated $7.8bn in health costs in the San Francisco Bay Area.

Addressing the climate crisis costs money, Alex said, but there are massive costs for failing to take action.

“Taking action on things like climate change through technology reduces costs rather than increases it, and if we continue to fail to take action, that’s actually more impactful from a cost perspective.”

The report authors hope to conduct further research to uncover additional costs, Alex said, and would like to see the issue become a point of discussion in the next governor’s race and beyond.

“We cannot solve the affordability crisis in California without also solving the climate crisis,” Perry said.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9cefe5008027a8df5b30bd63dedc889af3c35e21/286_0_3211_2568/master/3211.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=d26c1abc105896c98311613209c5fa3b",N,,2025-09-25 20:59:53.367157

Bidders may not submit projects that locate the facility on Georgia Power property unless it is a company-owned proposal.","Georgia Power is seeking 500 MW of energy storage with the ability to discharge for at least two hours, either standalone or with associated renewable resources, the utility said Tuesday.

A draft request for proposals specifies the resources should be online in 2028 at the earliest and no later than the end of 2031. Projects online by Nov. 28, 2031, will be given preference. The RFP targets energy storage capacity included in the company’s integrated resource plan approved by the Georgia Public Service Commission in 2022.

The soliciation is part of Georgia Power’s ongoing efforts to add renewables and bolster the reliability of its electric grid. Earlier this month, the PSC approved five new utility-scale solar site power purchase agreements for Georgia Power, consisting of a total of 1,068 MW that will be built by third-party companies. Plans for the renewable generation were also included in Georgia Power’s 2022 IRP.

The storage RFP announced this week will be administered by independent evaluator Ascend Analytics, and a bidders conference will be held Monday for parties seeking more information. The draft RFP schedule anticipates regulator approval of RFP documents in December, proposals due in January 2026 and contracts executed about a year later.

Georgia Power said it will consider standalone energy storage with grid-charging capability, as well as storage with new or existing associated renewable resources and grid-charging capability.

Georgia Power is already operating battery energy storage systems and has plans for more. The utility’s 65-MW Mossy Branch BESS is located in Talbot County and began commercial operation in November 2024. Another 765 MW was authorized by the Georgia PSC and is projected to enter commercial operation in 2026, the utility said.

Battery storage “will continue to play a critical role in the power grid of the future, improving reliability and advancing sustainability,” the utility said in a Sept. 12 statement. “Additionally, the integration of BESS with other technologies like smart grids and electric vehicles creates new opportunities for optimizing energy use and enhancing grid resilience.”

According to the draft RFP, Georgia Power will only accept submissions for facilities that will be interconnected to the Southern Co. transmission system. Southern is Georgia Power’s parent company.

Bidders may not submit projects that locate the facility on Georgia Power property unless it is a company-owned proposal. Any storage paired with a renewable resource submission must interconnect to the same point of interconnection as the renewable resource, according to the draft RFP document.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/YYG0ja45oZ1-oDN_Yh7ECCcb0oa66_QTRNbnQsaOmPg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZW9yZ2lhX1Bvd2VyX01vc3N5X0JyYW5jaF9TdG9yYWdlXy5qcGc=.webp,N,,2025-09-25 22:58:24.165225

ERCOT has seen a surge in large-load interconnection requests this year, mainly driven by hyperscale data center expansions and emerging AI compute clusters.
According to Enerdatics’ August 2025 U.S. Data Center Overview, data center demand in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has surpassed 20 GW of potential load, representing roughly one-third of the interconnection queue’s 60 GW backlog.
“NRG’s selection of this site for potential development of critical power generation supported by a data center project marks an exciting step forward for both LandBridge and the entire Delaware Basin,” said Jason Long, Chief Executive Officer of LandBridge.
NRG pivoted sharply over the past year to package its generation development and merchant expertise around ERCOT’s fast-growing data center load.","LandBridge Co., a Permian-focused land and infrastructure firm with 277,000 surface acres in the Delaware sub-region in Texas, and NRG Energy, one of the U.S.’s largest independent power producers, have inked a strategic agreement for a potential 1,100 MW natural gas–fired generation facility in Reeves County, Texas, to power a hyperscale data center.

The agreement, announced on Sept. 23, identifies a LandBridge-owned site in the Delaware Basin, adjacent to the Waha natural gas hub, where NRG could construct a large-scale, grid-connected power plant tailored to support a hyperscale data center. While no final investment decision has been made, the filing of air permit applications and interconnection requests signals an early step toward development, contingent on securing a long-term power purchase agreement (PPA).

If the project advances, commercial operation could begin by year-end 2029, aligning with the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT)’s growing demand from data centers and other large loads. ERCOT has seen a surge in large-load interconnection requests this year, mainly driven by hyperscale data center expansions and emerging AI compute clusters.

According to Enerdatics’ August 2025 U.S. Data Center Overview, data center demand in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas has surpassed 20 GW of potential load, representing roughly one-third of the interconnection queue’s 60 GW backlog. The analysis notes that concentration around Dallas, Houston, and San Antonio is straining system planning and transmission timelines. Wholesale prices in ERCOT’s West and South zones have averaged $45–$65/MWh year-to-date, with peak spikes topping $200/MWh during summer heat waves, underscoring the value of dispatchable gas generation to firm intermittent renewables.

While Texas’s Public Utility Commission has streamlined generator interconnection under its “connect-and-manage” framework, ERCOT’s queue backlog remains high, with more than 60 GW of projects—including over 20 GW of data center load—awaiting study and upgrade commitments. To address financing hurdles for new dispatchable capacity, the Texas Energy Fund has approved low-interest loans for multiple gas-fired projects since mid-2025, including a $216 million, 20-year loan at 3% for NRG’s 456-MW project at the T.H. Wharton gas plant site in Houston in August. Meanwhile, retail electric providers are innovating offerings for large-load customers—data centers among them—by crafting bespoke rate structures, fixed-price hedges, and bundled services that lock in energy costs, hedge against market volatility, and support credit requirements for lengthy PPAs.

If LandBridge and NRG advance their 1,100-MW project on schedule, commercial operation by 2029 would coincide with projected ERCOT peak demand growth—about 10 GW from data centers and another 5 GW from transport and industrial electrification—helping to alleviate capacity shortages and reduce volatility.

The Delaware Basin spans West Texas and southeastern New Mexico, forming the western sub-region of the prolific Permian Basin and encompassing Reeves, Loving and Pecos counties in Texas alongside Eddy and Lea counties in New Mexico. Its extensive oil-and-gas pipelines, abundant low-cost natural gas at the Waha market hub, and existing high-voltage transmission corridors have attracted hyperscale data center developers seeking sites with ready fuel supply, grid interconnection, and space for large-footprint campuses.

LandBridge, formed by private equity firm Five Point Infrastructure LLC, actively manages its 277,000 acres to support energy and infrastructure development, drawing on its owner’s track record in energy, water management, and sustainable infrastructure in the Permian Basin.

“NRG’s selection of this site for potential development of critical power generation supported by a data center project marks an exciting step forward for both LandBridge and the entire Delaware Basin,” said Jason Long, Chief Executive Officer of LandBridge. He notably added the collaboration further advances LandBridge’s powered land strategy and bolsters the value the company offers to “blue-chip” power generators and digital infrastructure developers.

For NRG, one of the largest competitive power generators and retail suppliers in the U.S., the prospective 1.1-GW plant underscores a broader push to align dispatchable gas capacity with the explosive growth of digital infrastructure in ERCOT. The company brings deep experience balancing merchant generation and long-term contracts, a skillset increasingly vital as hyperscale demand reshapes load patterns and fuels volatility across West Texas.

NRG pivoted sharply over the past year to package its generation development and merchant expertise around ERCOT’s fast-growing data center load. In its Q2 2025 earnings call, management announced long-term retail power agreements totaling 295 MW—expandable to 1 GW over a 10-year initial term, with options to extend to 20 years. Pricing is above the company’s midpoint target and structured with protected margins and hedges designed to secure returns. Beyond that, NRG reports more than 4 GW of joint development agreements and letters of intent with data center customers, supported by 2.4 GW of natural gas turbine capacity reserved for activation once contracts are finalized.

The strategy is reinforced by NRG’s partnership with GE Vernova and Kiewit to deliver 5.4 GW of combined-cycle gas generation across U.S. data center sites—what executives describe as a turnkey proposition that couples advanced turbine technology, balance-sheet strength, and fuel logistics to serve hyperscale and AI compute demand.

NRG has also bolstered its portfolio through acquisitions and state-backed financing designed to expand dispatchable capacity in ERCOT and beyond. In August 2025, the company closed on LS Power’s 13-GW natural gas portfolio and 6-GW Commercial & Industrial Virtual Power Plant platform, extending its reach across both ERCOT and PJM.

“We are pleased to explore bringing reliable energy solutions to West Texas,” said Robert J. Gaudette, executive vice president and president of NRG Business and Wholesale Operations, on Tuesday.“Once anchored by a long-term customer, the site has the potential to foster innovation and support data center growth, economic resilience, and grid stability in the region.”

LandBridge stressed in its release that the agreement remains preliminary. Development is subject to execution of a power purchase agreement, regulatory approvals, financing, and other customary conditions, and the project may not proceed as described.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/datacenternewbuilds-enerdatics-aug2025.png,N,,2025-09-25 20:02:41.227901

EES Coke Battery’s net worth is about $135 million to $155 million, Smith said.
During cross-examination, U.S. attorney Samantha Ricci questioned Smith about whether EES Coke Battery employed New Source Review experts between 2012 and 2014.
Prior to 2014, EES Coke never provided a permit for a major modification of which Switzer is aware, she said.","The vice president of Zug Island’s EES Coke Battery said it would not be economically rational to spend more than the company is worth on desulfurization technology in Thursday federal court testimony.

David Smith, vice president of EES Coke Battery, testified for the defense in the bench trial of the Environmental Protection Agency’s Clean Air Act lawsuit against EES Coke Battery and DTE Energy.

EES Coke Battery’s net worth is about $135 million to $155 million, Smith said. The facility, which produces coke, a raw material in the steelmaking process, is owned by DTE Energy.

Smith said he reviewed a type of technology called a Claus reactor for potential installation at EES Coke Battery, and said it could reduce sulfur dioxide content by 33%.

The coke battery burns low-sulfur coal, Smith said, and spends about $60 more per ton on the product than regular coal, he said.

If the facility made the “capital venture” of installing the technology, EES would have net zero income and 170 jobs would be lost, Smith said.

‘It’s been a challenging year at EES’

The EES Coke Battery executive said he has not considered seeking a permit for Clean Air Act violations found by the court, as he’s been preparing for trial.

“It’s been a challenging year at EES, and we’re not near max production,” Smith said.

At multiple points during his Thursday testimony, Smith appeared to give responses that contradicted his deposition.

During cross-examination, U.S. attorney Samantha Ricci questioned Smith about whether EES Coke Battery employed New Source Review experts between 2012 and 2014. Smith said he lacks the knowledge and involvement to answer the question during testimony Thursday.

Ricci then presented the transcript of Smith’s deposition, in which he said the Zug Island facility employed New Source Review experts during those years, and provided specific names.

Michigan regulator stands behind 2014 permit for Zug Island facility

The Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy stands behind the validity of EES Coke’s 2014 permit and decided not to join the lawsuit, said Annette Switzer, director of the air quality division of the state’s environmental regulator.

Prior to 2014, EES Coke never provided a permit for a major modification of which Switzer is aware, she said.

The State Implementation Plan is Michigan’s plan for controlling air pollution and meeting National Ambient Air Quality Standards.

The Michigan regulator can issue SIP-approved permits, meaning it has final call on permits, said Constantine Blathras, a former EPA environmental engineer who appeared at the trial Thursday via a prerecorded video of his deposition.

Blathras’ LinkedIn page states that his position at the EPA ended in June.

Blathras said that unless EGLE asks the EPA to do so, the federal regulator does not “look back and green-light” permits.

The EPA did not find any inconsistencies with the Clean Air Act and did not put forth comments during the draft period for EES Coke Battery’s 2014 permit, Blathras said.",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ZugIslandRoad-1-1-scaled.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 19:01:29.790800

Are you surprised? Of course not! California is a leader on deploying clean energy, setting new records seemingly every year. Because of that, California’s emissions have been on a steady march downward year after year… Right?

Wrong. I’ve been tracking this carefully, and I’ve been dismayed that, prior to the past few years, California’s electricity sector emissions stayed constant for roughly half a decade.

As California continues to pursue its clean energy and climate goals, it’s important to pause every now and then to take stock of progress. I wanted to understand, why did emissions from California’s electricity sector flatline for so long between 2017 and 2022? And what factors have led to the recent decrease?

I’ll answer those questions and more in this blog.

Emissions ups and downs

First, it’s important to recognize that California has made tremendous strides in reducing electricity sector emissions over the past two decades. California has cut these emissions in half from the peak in 2001. But it’s been a bumpy ride down.

For example, a severe drought in 2007-2009 drastically reduced hydroelectric generation, which led to a spike in emissions when fossil fueled generation filled the gap. Then in 2012, another spike in emissions occurred when the San Onofre Nuclear Generating Station suddenly shut down, which once again led to fossil fueled generation filling the gap.

The emissions trajectory of California’s electricity sector has always been bumpy, but the flatline post 2017 was particularly curious to me. So let’s zoom in on the past decade.

Renewable energy on the rise

The first thing I went to examine was recent trends in California’s clean electricity generation, and indeed, the state has made tremendous strides in adding renewable energy to the grid over the past decade.

Unsurprisingly, the star of California’s clean energy transition has been solar. Solar generation has soared, nearly quintupling since 2014. Wind generation started at much higher levels than solar and still increased by nearly 40% over the same period. Nuclear, geothermal, and biomass generation have all remained essentially constant over the past decade.

And then there’s hydropower, the spiky blue line that bounces all over the graph. After starting out at very low levels due to a multi-year drought, hydro generation spiked in 2017, a year that saw record levels of precipitation (along with the Oroville dam failure!). Hydropower then continued to bounce around depending on how wet the year was. And because California gets so much electricity from hydro, this phenomenon is one of the keys to answering my questions.

Clean and emitting generation flatline

Looking at clean electricity generation is only half the picture. The other half is emitting generation, particularly natural gas and unspecified imports, which contribute significantly to California’s heat-trapping emissions. And when you put all the pieces together, it becomes clear why California’s electricity sector emissions stagnated.

The answer: In total, both emitting and clean generation were essentially constant from 2017-2022.

On the clean side, when you add up all the sources of generation, you end up with a relatively flat line. That’s because hydro generation was much higher earlier in the 2017-2022 period and decreased later on, counteracting the rise in solar generation.

On the emitting side, roughly three quarters of emitting generation comes from gas. While there was a slight uptick in gas generation in recent years, that was offset by a sharp decline in unspecified imports. Coal also continued its steady decline, but since coal is already such a small part of California’s energy mix, it barely registers on the graph. So in total, generation from emitting resources was relatively flat from 2017-2022.

Finally, I should mention that, despite all the talk about rapid load growth due to data centers, manufacturing, electric vehicles, etc., energy demand on most of California’s grid has remained quite stable over the past decade. (Though that’s in part because the growth of rooftop solar has offset small increases in demand.) So load growth isn’t a big factor influencing recent trends in electricity sector emissions. However, electricity demand is projected to increase significantly going forward, and those future increases in demand could change the story around future emissions trends. (But to mitigate those impacts, it’s critical to add electric vehicles and data centers to the grid in a way that helps drive down emissions and supports grid reliability!)

And there you have it. Since emitting generation was relatively constant, electricity sector emissions also held steady.

With that mystery solved, let’s move on to the good news.

Emissions now trending down

As I mentioned at the outset, California’s electricity sector emissions have resumed their downward trend in the past couple of years. The state-wide electricity sector emissions data in the first graph came from the California Air Resources Board (CARB), and at the time of writing, CARB has not yet released data for 2023 and 2024; however, we do have data from the California Independent System Operator (CAISO).

CAISO serves roughly 80% of California, so CAISO emissions track closely with state-wide emissions. And finally, after years of stagnation, CAISO emissions dropped significantly in 2023 and 2024. And by looking at CAISO emissions from the first six months of each year (the dotted line below), it seems likely that emissions will at least hold steady in 2025.

After a long pause, clean generation is once again pushing fossil-fueled generation out of the energy mix and bringing down emissions.

Reaching California’s clean electricity goals

Looking ahead, California has ambitious clean energy goals, and there’s still a long way to go to achieve them. The California Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) establishes goals for the electricity sector in its Integrated Resource Planning (IRP) process, and the Commission’s most recent IRP decision established emissions targets for specific years.

The near-term goal is to reduce state-wide electricity sector emissions down to 30 MMT by 2030. It’s certainly possible, but to get there, utilities will have to maintain the pace of reductions that we’ve seen over the past few years. That means continuing to build solar, wind, and energy storage at a rapid clip. It also means avoiding overreliance on hydro to deliver emissions reductions since hydro generation has been so volatile, and it may become even more volatile with more extreme weather in a changing climate.

Unfortunately, California’s investor-owned utilities have started to cast doubt on the feasibility of these goals. PG&E, SCE, and SDG&E have raised concerns about the loss of federal clean energy tax credits for wind and solar and data center load growth making these goals unrealistic.

But now is not the time for California to dial back its clean energy ambitions. California has been hard at work to pass new policies that will make the clean energy transition more affordable, such as public financing for large transmission projects and expanding western energy markets through independent governance.

With California’s electricity sector emissions finally trending down again, the state should stay the course to reach its current goals, all while continuing to identify and implement solutions that make the grid more reliable and affordable.",https://blog.ucs.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/coal-plant-smoke-stack-pacificorp-utah.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 20:59:36.007749

As of September 9, 2025, President Trump has signed 199 Executive Orders, including those to “reinvigorate” the coal industry, withdraw the United States from the Paris Agreement, and rescind the Council on Environmental Quality’s regulations implementing NEPA—the National Environmental Policy Act. In addition, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has announced dozens of deregulatory actions to “unleash American energy.”

It’s no exaggeration to say that this flurry of deregulatory action is unprecedented.

However, not all these actions constitute federal regulation. In the wake of all this deregulatory talk and activity, it’s worth examining what exactly a federal regulation is (and what it is not) and how the public can fight back against environmental deregulation.

What is a federal regulation?

In short, a federal regulation is a rule issued by a federal government agency that has the force and effect of law. While there are different types of rules, this blog post focuses on what affects the rights of the public and are legally enforceable (assuming the agency has the authority to adopt them and that it follows the proper procedure for doing so).

How are federal regulations different than Executive Orders?

In comparison to federal regulations, an Executive Order is a written directive to the government (including agencies), signed by the President. These Executive Orders often direct federal agencies on how they should implement statutes or set priorities, but they cannot override federal laws and statutes. Additionally, unlike federal regulations, they are not subject to the notice-and-comment process and do not bind the public.

How do federal agencies make regulations?

The authority of agencies to adopt a regulation typically comes from a statute, which is passed by Congress. The process that the agency must follow is mandated by the Administrative Procedures Act, which requires agencies to hold a public comment period on a proposed rule before it becomes final; This process is referred to as “notice-and-comment rulemaking”—more on this further below.

How does a proposed rule become a federal regulation?

To start, agencies must publish proposed rules in the Federal Register. When they do, they also generally must allow the public to submit comments to the agency on this proposed rule. This public comment period usually lasts between 30 and 60 days (though the agency may use shorter or longer periods).

During this time, anybody can submit information or arguments to the agency, and the agency must consider these comments. After reviewing public comments, the agency will issue a final rule, which is published in the Federal Register and incorporated into the Code of Federal Regulations.

What impact does public comment have?

Critically, agencies must base final rules on the rulemaking record, which includes public comments. If they don’t—say, if the agency arbitrarily publishes a final rule in blatant disregard of public comments—then that rule could be subject to judicial review. This all means that the public has a vital role to play in the notice and comment rulemaking process. By commenting on a proposed rule, everyone can meaningfully influence or change federal regulations.

Oracle and OpenAI’s newly operational flagship site, Stargate I, in Abilene is expected to generate more than five gigawatts of capacity, which will run more than two million chips.

“This significantly advances our progress toward the commitment we announced at the White House in January to invest $500 billion into 10 gigawatts of AI infrastructure in the U.S. over the next four years. We now expect to exceed our initial commitment thanks to strong momentum with partners including Oracle and SoftBank,” Open AI said.

Its cloud infrastructure is already enabling OpenAI to train models like ChatGPT. One building on the Stargate I site is fully operational; another is nearly complete.

The site has already created thousands of jobs, Open AI says. More are expected as operations expand, including specialized jobs for electricians, equipment operators, and technicians. Stargate I is projected to contribute more than $1 billion in direct and indirect economic benefit to Abilene over 20 years, it says.

U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, toured Stargate I in Abilene Wednesday, saying, “Texas is leading the way to make sure the United States beats China in the AI race. This is the beginning of a long-term effort to invest in American jobs, supply the additional power needed for AI, and deliver products and services that will benefit all Americans.”

Cruz recently released a policy framework outlining how Congress and the Trump administration can lead in AI, including streamlining federal permitting for AI infrastructure.

OpenAI, Oracle and SoftBank also announced this week that they were building five more Stargate sites nationwide, including in Shackleford County, Texas. Others are slated to be built in New Mexico and the Midwest.

Farther north in Amarillo, Fermi America in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, is developing next-generation electric grids to support AI technology and build “the world’s largest energy-driven Artificial Intelligence complex.”

Fermi was cofounded by former Texas Gov. Rick Perry and his son, Griffin Perry, who is co-founder of a private investment firm, Grey Rock Energy Partners. Grey Rock claims it’s developing next-generation electric grids to deliver highly redundant power at gigawatt scale necessary to sustain next-generation AI.

The Amarillo campus is the “first-of-its-kind behind-the-meter HyperGrid™ campus” that will “integrate the largest nuclear power complex in America, the nation’s biggest combined-cycle natural gas project, utility grid power, solar power, and battery energy storage to deliver next-generation artificial intelligence,” Fermi says.

Spanning 5,769 acres, it’s projected to deliver up to 11 gigawatts of power and 18 million square feet of AI capacity, it says. It’s being built in the center of a natural gas powerhouse in Texas at the confluence of several of the largest natural gas pipelines and located on top of one of the largest known natural gas fields.

The site “offers a prolific, firm, clean-burning and redundant gas supply,” Fermi says. It’s also being built near Pantex, a primary nuclear facility, underscoring “Fermi’s strategic position to build clean, safe, new nuclear power for America’s next-generation AI,” it says. The HyperGrid “is expected to deliver clean, highly reliable base-load power at unprecedented scale.”

“The Chinese are building 22 nuclear reactors today to power the future of AI,” Perry Sr. said. “America has none. We’re behind, and it’s all hands-on-deck.” Earlier this year, President Donald Trump issued executive orders to expand energy dominance which “demands that American innovators rise to the occasion,” he said. “No one does energy better than Texas, and Fermi America and the Texas Tech University System are answering the call.”

On Thursday, Fermi and Texas Tech announced a new partnership with Siemens Energy to fulfil Trump’s “promise to restore U.S. energy dominance and to ensure America wins the global race to power the future of artificial intelligence.”

“Winning the AI arms race doesn’t just take software developers. It takes more electricity,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said. The Fermi campus “proves that we can integrate natural gas, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence into a single, powerful ecosystem. Modern energy infrastructure isn’t a luxury, it’s the foundation of global leadership. By advancing President Trump’s Energy Dominance Agenda, we’re not just fueling America – we’re powering the future of intelligence.”

“No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,” Perry added.

The announcement came as jury selection was set to begin Thursday in a two-month trial combining lawsuits brought by hundreds of homeowners, insurers and others over the fire in the heavily populated suburbs between Denver and Boulder. Court documents confirmed a settlement has been reached and the trial canceled.

Minneapolis-based Xcel has maintained that its equipment did not cause or contribute to the fire. It said it does not admit any fault under the settlement.

Lawyer James Avery said the settlement provides hope to the hundreds of fire victims he represents. Most of them plan to accept confidential payouts already determined by mediators based on their circumstances.

“There is a sense of relief and hope for an ending to this tragic disaster that they continue to struggle with as they rebuild their homes and lives,” he said.

As global warming makes wildfires worse in the western U.S., utilities in the region have spent billions of dollars in recent years on insurance costs and trying to upgrade old equipment to reduce the chances of accidentally igniting a blaze. They have also faced lawsuits after major fires from people who contended they did not do enough.

In Colorado, investigators found that a sparking power line owned by Xcel was one of the causes of the fire that was fanned by high winds. Embers from a smoldering scrap-wood fire set days before on a nearby property used by a Christian religious communal group were also found to have been another cause.

The smoldering fire at the Twelve Tribes property had been buried by residents a few days before in a way that was approved by firefighters who stopped by to investigate, authorities said.

The two fires combined into an inferno following months of drought amid a winter nearly devoid of snow. It spread rapidly in winds that gusted up to 100 mph in places, causing $2 billion in damage.

Killed in the fire were a 69-year-old man who lived near where the fire started and a 91-year-old woman last seen trying to rescue her dogs from her home in Superior.

Authorities spent 18 months investigating the cause of the Marshall Fire and determined criminal charges were not warranted for either Xcel or the Christian group.

Xcel said in a statement Wednesday that it, Qwest Corp., which leased space on Xcel’s power poles for fiber optic cable, and Teleport Communications America LLC reached agreements in principle to settle all claims involved. But the company said homeowners and others who filed lawsuits against it still had to decide whether to opt into the agreement.

“We recognize that the fire and its aftermath have been difficult and painful for many, and we hope that our and the telecom defendants’ contributions in today’s settlement can bring some closure for the community,” Xcel CEO Bob Frenzel said.

A transcript of a hearing held Wednesday to discuss the deal has been sealed until the end of the day. Lawyers must update the court on the status of the settlement within the next month, Judge Christopher Zenisek said in an order.

Xcel said about $350 million of its settlement payment would be funded by its insurance coverage and that its customers would not pay any of it.

The lawsuits brought by about 4,000 homeowners, insurance companies and local governments like fire districts were set to be tried together. They suffered a variety of losses, from smoke damage to losing their homes and income.

A construction company Avery represents estimates it lost millions of dollars in business and equipment and likely won’t participate in the settlement, opting to pursue its own lawsuit instead, he said.

“The intention is to resolve the case with just a couple of exceptions,” he said.",https://finance-commerce.com/files/2025/09/Xcel.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 20:03:06.946546

With Planned Parenthood’s future hanging in the balance, this case will not stay under the radar for much longer.","In an era of unprecedented partisan divide, where seemingly every policy and protest deepens America’s political fault lines, all eyes are on the judiciary as the ultimate battleground. At the same time, the issue of abortion continues to routinely command national headlines.

And so, it is very peculiar that a pivotal case that could serve as the final nail in the coffin for Planned Parenthood in its year of disaster has so far slipped beneath the radar.

U.S. ex rel. Doe v. Planned Parenthood is currently before the full U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans, with en banc oral arguments scheduled for today. This False Claims Act lawsuit represents the latest entry on a quickly accumulating list of regulatory violations, legal gambles and gross medical negligence by Planned Parenthood — missteps that could very soon precipitate the downfall of the nation’s largest abortion provider.

The case stems from a decade-old scandal that exposed Planned Parenthood’s practice of profiting from the sale of organs and tissue from aborted babies. Shortly after the release of the undercover videos at the center of that story, Texas and Louisiana moved to terminate the organization from their Medicaid programs, barring it from billing taxpayers for services.

Planned Parenthood fought back in court, securing a series of temporary injunctions, but all the while continuing to submit Medicaid reimbursement claims. This was a big gamble — the group pocketed millions in Medicaid funds during litigation, despite knowing its eligibility was in question. And that big gamble may soon result in a big loss.

In the meantime, this year has seen even more self-induced damage at Planned Parenthood. The New York Times revealed a disturbing pattern of medical negligence, incompetence and unsanitary conditions at Planned Parenthood facilities — issues that put women’s lives at risk. (This is in addition to the hundreds of thousands of lives ended by abortion at Planned Parenthood facilities each year.) From administering incorrect medications to preparing patients for the wrong procedures, Planned Parenthood repeatedly failed to meet even the most basic standards of care that women deserve.

Shortly after the Times expose, Planned Parenthood of Greater New York shuttered its flagship Manhattan location, citing financial strains. Such closures have now spread to cities across the country — over 40 closures, at last count — as numerous state laws have limited Planned Parenthood’s abortion business, in addition to federal legislation passed in July barring abortion providers from accessing Medicaid funds. Planned Parenthood, which has long relied on taxpayer dollars to fill its coffers, is now suing over Congress’s exercise of its Spending Clause discretion to stop taxpayer funds from going to abortion providers. That litigation is ongoing.

Planned Parenthood’s access to tax dollars has also been limited by the Supreme Court ruling in Medina v. Planned Parenthood South Atlantic, which upheld states’ authority to decide whether abortion providers qualify for Medicaid reimbursements.

Against this backdrop, the under-the-radar case of U.S. ex rel. Doe v. Planned Parenthood represents an existential threat to Planned Parenthood.

The Fifth Circuit has ruled that Texas and Louisiana were within their rights to drop Planned Parenthood from Medicaid, making clear that the organization was ineligible for these taxpayer funds all along. Under the False Claims Act, money obtained from the government while ineligible — even if collected under a court order that is later overturned — must be repaid in full. Planned Parenthood has not yet returned the money to American taxpayers.

Now, Planned Parenthood could be on the hook for treble damages, civil penalties, interest and legal fees, pushing its total potential liability in the pending case past $1.8 billion — a financial catastrophe for the abortion giant that could hasten its end.

Given its potential impact, U.S. ex rel. Doe v. Planned Parenthood is likely the most important case you’ve never heard of. With Planned Parenthood’s future hanging in the balance, this case will not stay under the radar for much longer.

Second in a series about rising electricity prices in Pennsylvania. Read the first story here.

PHILADELPHIA—In the steep hills above the Schuylkill River, across the street from a famous cheesesteak place and at the end of a quiet block, sits a typical Philadelphia rowhouse: narrow brick, front porch, fig trees growing in the yard. From the sidewalk, there’s nothing to distinguish this house from its neighbors. But there’s a tiny clue that something is a little different: a sticker on the electric meter with a Solarize Philly logo.

The owner, Liz Robinson, is the current executive director at the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association, a volunteer-based nonprofit that works to increase solar adoption in Pennsylvania. She’s been involved in renewable energy policy in the city and on the state level for decades. Almost 10 years ago, Robinson had solar panels installed on the roof of this house, which she bought as a rental property.

Wearing an “electrify your future” T-shirt, Robinson pointed at the digital readout on the meter. “This is telling me how much electricity is being produced, and even on a cloudy day like today, I’m getting a fair amount of electricity,” she said. Her small system covers the electricity bills for this property and 60 percent of the bill at her house down the street.

“I thought it would pay for itself in 10 years, but because electricity prices have been rising, it paid for itself in less than nine years,” she said. “It’s the best defense against a rising electric bill.”

Robinson remembers a time when the dream of widespread renewable energy for Pennsylvania, and not just for scattered individual households, felt within reach. In the early 2000s, the state was a renewable-energy pioneer, passing a law that required a certain percentage of the state’s electricity generation to come from alternative energy sources.

In 2010, then-Gov. Ed Rendell boasted about this Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, calling it “one of the most ambitious of its kind in America” and praising Pennsylvania as “a national leader in the field of alternative energy.” Since 2006, Rendell said, the state had made “remarkable progress,” citing growth in wind and solar generation.

“The Rendell administration did a lot of work to bring manufacturing into the state,” said Laurie Mazer, co-founder of Formation Energy, a Philadelphia-based solar developer. “There really was this moment where Pennsylvania was well ahead of the curve.”

But even as Rendell touted the state’s investment in renewable energy, the landscape was changing. In 2004, the same year the state enacted the AEPS law, drilling began on the first gas well in Pennsylvania to use hydraulic fracturing.

The fracking boom birthed a new way of thinking about energy. By 2013, in a speech about climate change, President Barack Obama was hailing natural gas as a “transition fuel that can power our economy with less carbon pollution,” phrasing that was popular in messaging on natural gas at the time. It was a “bridge” from dirty coal to cleaner renewables, a temporary solution that would lower emissions and secure energy independence.

Fifteen years later, that bridge extends endlessly into Pennsylvania’s future, with no glimpse of the other side in sight.

Natural gas production is still rising in the United States, and 60 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity generation now comes from natural gas. It’s so tied to electricity in some Pennsylvanians’ minds that they can’t imagine how the state could run without it. State Sen. Camera Bartolotta, a Republican who represents a heavily fracked district in the southwest, appears on a billboard on the turnpike with this message: “No fossil fuels, no electricity. Wake up America!”

Only 4 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity comes from renewable energy. Since 2015, that number has only increased by one percentage point, even as states such as Texas, Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota and Maine saw significant gains in renewables.

Pennsylvania now ranks second to last in the country when it comes to the percentage of its electricity generated by renewables, and in 2024, the state ranked 49th for renewable energy growth in the U.S. For utility-level solar, Pennsylvania ranked 41st, supplying just over 1 percent of the state’s electricity. For residential solar systems like Robinson’s, a separate metric from utility-level power generation, Pennsylvania is a middling 26th.

Pennsylvania’s reliance on gas is one of the problems at the root of the state’s soaring electric bills, experts say, because it means local consumers pay more whenever global gas prices go up.

In Texas, the only state that produces more gas than Pennsylvania, renewable energy’s share of the electric market has grown from 12 percent in 2015 to 34 percent in 2024. And residential electricity rates in Texas are about 20 percent lower than Pennsylvania’s, according to June federal figures.

Electricity prices in Pennsylvania continued to rise in 2025, following a sharp increase over the last few years that has hit Pennsylvania households hard. One reason for the most recent surge: data centers and the stress they are likely to put on the grid. New data centers are expected to drive soaring increases in electricity demand over the next five years, according to forecasts from Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commission. To power them, investors want to build even more natural gas power plants.

“We have become over-reliant on gas as a transitional fuel, and we continue to argue that it’s a transition, yet we are not transitioning,” said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project. “We continue to build out our delivery system for gas, and we are locking ratepayers in to pay for that system for 30 more years.”

“Clean Energy Now”

Robinson traces the origins of Pennsylvania’s failed promise as a leader in renewables to one big shift over the past 15 years.

“The change in the Republican Party is really the story here,” she said.

When she first started working in the field, moderate Republicans in Philadelphia’s collar counties were passionate advocates for conservation initiatives and open-minded about ideas like green energy. As Tea Party candidates and increasing polarization pushed this older generation of Republicans out of office, the legislature became more partisan, more contentious and less willing to compromise.

“It surprises me, in this day and age, how many climate deniers you have in the legislature. There’s this almost visceral disdain for solar and wind.”— Rep. Greg Vitali, D-Delaware County

At the same time, fracking gained ground in Pennsylvania, and natural gas companies poured money into Harrisburg, both through campaign contributions and lobbying. One example: the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, spent more on lobbying in Pennsylvania than in any other state in 2022, according to a Public Accountability Initiative analysis. “There’s a tremendous ownership of politicians that goes on in Pennsylvania by the gas industry,” Robinson said.

The resulting gridlock is particularly acute when it comes to energy issues. Anything that seems to threaten the dominance of natural gas is politically doomed. From the state’s contested membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to updating the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard to legalizing community solar, efforts to make real policy changes at the state level have met with resistance.

“It surprises me, in this day and age, how many climate deniers you have in the legislature. There’s this almost visceral disdain for solar and wind,” said Rep. Greg Vitali, a Democrat from suburban Delaware County who has served in the state legislature for more than 30 years and is considered an environmental leader at the capitol. “It goes beyond an intellectual disagreement.”

Vitali, the chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, said there was effective negotiation and “give and take” when the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard passed in 2004. That isn’t happening now.

One component of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Lightning Plan for energy reform is a bill to allow community solar, where customers can buy shares in a solar project even if they can’t host panels on their own roofs. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House in May, but it’s now stuck in the Senate, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority. Republicans have controlled the Pennsylvania Senate since 1994.

That could pose problems if all of the gas power plants that PJM thinks it will need to meet growing demand over the next decade are built. Trump’s massive tariffs on steel are likely to further inflate costs, said Christopher Doleman, an LNG and gas specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

Elowyn Corby, the mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, an affordable-solar advocacy group, said this state of affairs on renewables doesn’t reflect the feelings of the public. “It’s less about what Pennsylvanians want, because we’ve seen time and time again that when asked, Pennsylvanians like renewable energy. Pennsylvanians love solar,” she said.

The state legislature’s paralysis has effectively ceded leadership of energy policy to other forces, said Mazer, the solar developer. “We haven’t played as much of a role as we could have in deciding what our energy future looks like,” she said.

There’s another kind of energy gridlock at PJM Interconnection, the company that manages the electricity grid in all or parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. When it comes to Pennsylvania’s emphasis on natural gas generation, PJM is a significant part of the problem, said David Masur, the executive director at PennEnvironment, an environmental organization in Pennsylvania that has closely tracked the state’s lagging investment in renewable energy.

“There’s just hundreds of projects in the queue, and something like 98 percent of them are renewables,” he said.

PennEnvironment estimated that PJM’s backlog of unapproved electricity projects could cost Pennsylvanians $12.5 billion in just one year. In January, after filing a complaint against PJM, Shapiro settled with the operator to stop a rate hike that could have tripled energy prices for Pennsylvanians.

If the system were working the way it’s supposed to, more solar and wind projects would have been coming online as their costs drop compared to gas. Instead, PJM’s delays have created a bottleneck.

“New competition is being blocked by this outmoded, vastly delayed interconnection system,” Corby said. “New energy is not able to come online quickly enough to keep our bills down. PJM needs to move a lot more things through the queue a lot more quickly.”

In a statement to Inside Climate News, a spokesperson for PJM, Jeffrey Shields, said the company has reformed its interconnection process, processing 140 gigawatts of capacity since 2023, with 63 more due to be processed in 2025 and 2026. PJM blames the slowdown on permitting and supply chain backlogs, “none of which are related to PJM,” and nationwide trends that are beyond the company’s control.

“Electricity supply is decreasing while demand is increasing, primarily from data centers, not only in PJM but across the country,” Shields said.

On a rainy day in May, protestors stood in front of PJM’s headquarters outside Philadelphia. Dressed in rain slickers and clutching umbrellas, the protestors held hand-painted signs reading, “Clean Energy Now” and “PJM, lower our electric bills. Connect clean energy.”

As cars zoomed behind him, state Rep. Chris Rabb spoke to the protesters and members of the press about his bill to increase transparency in PJM’s decision-making. Rabb, a Democrat, said he believed his bill could attract bipartisan support, a rare feat in Pennsylvania’s split legislature.

“The reason I think this might have some legs is because so many of our constituents—rural, urban, suburban—are struggling to pay their utility bills. And it’s only going to get worse if PJM continues to operate in this fashion,” he said. “I think it can garner some Republican votes, because they have ratepayers, too, who are not happy about the coming hikes. People are going to be mad as hell, right? They’re going to wonder who to blame.”

Powering the Future

Data centers built to power electricity-hungry artificial intelligence technology are projected to consume enormous quantities of power, and in Pennsylvania, gas producers see an opportunity to keep extending the “bridge.”

At Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh in July, $90 billion in data center deals between tech companies and natural gas and pipeline companies were announced. These investments could lock in gas as the state’s primary electricity generator for another generation.

“There’s a slowing of production growth happening here in the United States, and the so-called shale revolution is in the later innings.”— Trey Cowan, Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis

EQT, a natural gas company headquartered in Pittsburgh, said it would become a partner in a plan to convert the old coal-fired Homer City Generating Station into a 3,200-acre artificial intelligence campus with the country’s largest gas-fired power plant.

“This agreement ensures long-term energy security for the data center campus, while demonstrating our commitment to powering the future with Pennsylvania gas,” Corey Hessen, one of the leaders of the Homer City project, said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the costs of drilling for gas are going up. “There’s a slowing of production growth happening here in the United States, and the so-called shale revolution is in the later innings,” said Trey Cowan, an oil and gas energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s getting more and more expensive to drill.”

It’s also getting more expensive to build natural gas power plants, said Sean O’Leary, senior researcher in energy and petrochemicals at the Ohio River Valley Institute: “The cost of building a gas-fired power plant has gone up by about two-and-a-half times.”

That could pose problems if all of the gas power plants that PJM thinks it will need to meet growing demand over the next decade are built.Trump’s massive tariffs on steel are likely to further inflate costs, said Christopher Doleman, an LNG and gas specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

And the premise that the bridge was originally built on—that natural gas made sense as a transition to renewables because it emitted fewer greenhouse gases than other fossil fuels—turns out to be far more complicated than the politicians of the 2010s claimed.

Although it’s true that burning natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases than coal, evidence is growing that its production and transport damages the earth’s atmosphere more than previously thought. Methane is a far more potent driver of global warming than carbon dioxide.

Despite all that, both Corby and Robinson see reasons for hope. One of them is residential solar systems like Robinson’s, which are small enough to bypass the clogged PJM queue.

“It can come online incredibly quickly. It also takes much less time to build,” Corby said. “That’s a really intuitive and easy place to look, where we would see the results quickly.”

“It’s important that we remember Pennsylvania’s ability to do good things on energy has not been exclusively on the side of fossil fuels.”— Elowyn Corby, Vote Solar

More Pennsylvanians are clamoring to install solar panels of their own, especially as electricity prices go up. Residential solar installations increased in Pennsylvania in 2022 and 2023, according to the most recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. George Otto, a retiree in State College, said he decided to do so after years of watching Pennsylvania politicians fail to make progress on environmental or climate issues.

“It’s like pushing a rope to get those guys to move on any of this stuff. And so I figured, if we’re not going to be able to do it through them, then each of us can do what we can within our sphere of influence,” he said. “Now I’m happy to provide an example for others to look at and say, ‘Hey, this can work here.’” In addition to reducing his carbon footprint, Otto now pays nothing for electricity.

Pennsylvania has the potential to catch up on renewables, but it needs the political will. Even incremental shifts in power could do that, Robinson said. “Having the House be led by Democrats, even a one-seat majority, has made a world of difference,” she said. “If we can win the Senate, I think that changes everything.”

Corby is heartened by the state’s not-so-distant successes with renewable energy. “It’s important that we remember Pennsylvania’s ability to do good things on energy has not been exclusively on the side of fossil fuels,” she said.

“The question now is, as energy affordability and supply issues become increasingly pressing, will we let ourselves be bogged down by that history or enabled by it to lead again?”

For his part, Vitali has continued to introduce bills that could change the state’s trajectory, even if they have little chance of becoming law.

“There’s a quote I used to have [on] my desk. It said, ‘A leader should be a dealer in hope.’ I don’t feel very hopeful now,” he said. “But we try every day.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250903_robinson_529-2048x1354-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 18:02:45.648663

Discussions centred on the need to accelerate the deployment of offshore wind while continuing to support the UK’s homegrown oil and gas sector. Today, renewables represent just 1% of the port’s revenue - despite handling around 700 vessels annually – with more than 50% generated from oil and gas.

Port of Aberdeen outlined ambitious plans to become an international hub for offshore wind, including:

Deepening South Harbour for offshore wind assembly, integration, and marshalling

Installing a dedicated ring-crane for tow-in tow-out major component exchange

Redeveloping the Regent Centre and investing in warehousing for offshore wind operation and maintenance

These developments build on the port’s £420 million investment in Aberdeen South Harbour, which is already generating significant new business for the port and North East supply chain.

The visit followed the publication of Energy Secretary Ed Miliband’s Statement of Strategic Priorities for GBE. This includes investing in the supply chain projects needed to unlock clean energy deployment and support delivery of the Industrial Strategy, which recognises ports as a ‘foundational industry’.

Bob Sanguinetti DL, chief executive officer, Port of Aberdeen, said: “We welcomed the opportunity to engage with GBE’s Board and stressed the importance of ramping up renewables while continuing to support our homegrown oil and gas industry. This must be a conversation of and, not or.

“Offshore wind is the big opportunity on the horizon and we’re advancing projects that will position Aberdeen to capitalise on this. However, a concerted effort is needed to accelerate deployment if we’re to realise our full potential.”

Juergen Maier, chair, Great British Energy, said: “With the right policy and the right financial backing, we’re seeing how renewable energy jobs can be created. According to the CBI there are now 273,000 jobs directly in the green economy, with 100,000 of these in Scotland. The skills we need to accelerate the rollout of offshore wind all currently sit within O&G. This isn’t about clean and dirty energy, this is about highly skilled workers being deployed onto secure projects, with ports like Aberdeen primed and ready to deliver that growth.”",https://agcc.fra1.cdn.digitaloceanspaces.com/images/news/membernews/_1200x630_crop_center-center_none/PoA-GBE-2.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 19:01:15.711239

Since July, when President Donald Trump signed the federal tax and spending bill that terminated the credit on Sept. 30, EV sales have been breaking records.

Here’s what you need to know.

As part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, consumers who buy a new plug-in electric or hydrogen fuel cell vehicle can claim up to $7,500 as a federal tax credit for the purchase. Consumers who buy a used clean vehicle for $25,000 or less from a licensed dealership are entitled to as much as $4,000 back on their purchase. The credit was intended to spur EV adoption by offsetting the vehicles’ higher price compared with gas-powered models.

Under the One Big Beautiful Bill Act that Trump signed in early July, the Clean Vehicle Tax Credit will end Tuesday. To receive the credit, the Internal Revenue Service says drivers who lease an EV must order and take delivery of their cars by the end of the month, while buyers who intend to finance or pay cash for their cars can order an EV by signing a contract or putting money down and taking delivery of the vehicle later.

EV sales began exploding shortly after the bill’s signing, increasing 26.4% in July compared with June — their second highest month on record — according to Cox Automotive. In August, EV sales hit a record high 9.9% of the market, and they are expected to be 10% of the market in September as buyer urgency continues to lift sales, Cox said. In preliminary estimates released Thursday, Cox said it expects 410,000 EVs will be sold in September — 21% more than a year ago.

How much do EVs cost compared with gas-powered vehicles?

The current average transaction price for an electric vehicle is $57,245 — well above the $48,179 average transaction price for a car powered with fossil fuels, according to Cox. The $9,000 price gap is slightly higher than the $7,500 Clean Vehicle Tax Credit.

The companies that make electric vehicles have some of the lowest supplies of cars, including Audi and Toyota, which saw the largest drops in EV inventory last month, Cox analysts said Thursday. While the supply of cars powered with fossil fuels is 78 days, it is 62 days for EVs, according to Cox. Toyota has a 34-day supply of vehicles and Honda has 53 days’ worth.

EV sales are expected to fall to about 300,000 units in the fourth quarter, leading to a total year-over-year EV sales increase of 1.3% in 2025 compared with 2024, according to Cox. Without the federal incentive, the so-called affordability gap between EVs and traditional vehicles poses a challenge for sustained EV adoption, though EVs are still expected to achieve 25% market share by 2030, analysts say.

“Our polling shows that once people start to drive electric, they don’t actually shift back,” said Katherine Garcia, director of the Sierra Club's ""Clean Transportation for All"" campaign. “They’re better, faster cars, so we don’t anticipate people going back to buying a new gas car.”

In the short term, fewer types of electric vehicles will be available, as manufacturers pull their plans to bring new EVs to market. Last week, Stellantis canceled the electric version of its Jeep Gladiator pickup truck. Ford has also canceled plans for a three-row electric SUV, while Nissan, Porsche and Toyota have postponed new EV plans. Other companies are likely to add fewer bells and whistles to their vehicles to hold prices steady and to eliminate trim levels, analysts say.

Prices are also expected to increase. The tariffs Trump enacted this year haven’t yet had a significant impact on vehicle prices, but they are expected to. Cox predicts tariffs will increase prices on all new and used vehicles by 4% to 8% in the coming year, including electrics. According to Cox Automotive Senior Economist Jonathan Smoke, tariffs will increase prices for all cars by an average of $5,500 for imported vehicles, $4,900 for vehicles imported from Canada and Mexico, and $1,000 for vehicles assembled in the United States by September 2026.

Increased EV pricing could create a window of opportunity for Chinese EV makers, who aren’t currently allowed to sell in the United States but have made significant inroads in China, Brazil and Europe with high-tech models at lower prices than mainstream brands.

“It’s inevitable we will have one or more Chinese-based companies, but those vehicles will be produced or at least assembled in the United States,” Smoke said.

Within two years, buyers of used EVs will have more options, as the current spate of EV leases ends. Since 2023, when the Inflation Reduction Act allowed EV lessees to claim the $7,500 federal tax credit, 1.1 million EVs have been leased, according to Cox data. Through the first half of the year, the EV leasing rate was 59.3% — up from 22.5% in 2023 before the IRA change, Cox said.

All those used EVs will eventually enter the used market, expanding access to EVs at more affordable price points. By 2027, EVs will make up 16% of lease returns, while plug-in hybrids will account for 5% and traditional hybrids will be 6%, according to Cox.

What other incentives are available for EVs after the federal tax credit expires?

Several states offer their own incentives to help residents buy EVs, including California, which provides $2,500 off the price of a new EV at the point of sale, and Colorado, which offers a tax credit of $3,500. A full list of state EV incentives can be found at the U.S. Department of Energy Alternative Fuels Data Center.

How will the environment be affected by the end of the EV tax credit?

The exact effects are unknown. According to the Environmental Protection Agency, electric vehicles have no tailpipe emissions and have a smaller carbon footprint than gas-powered cars, even when taking their electricity usage into consideration. Transportation is the biggest source of greenhouse gas emissions in the United States, according to the EPA.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/EV_tax_credit,N,,2025-09-25 18:01:52.633151

Tesla Inc. urged U.S. environmental regulators to maintain ambitious tailpipe emissions standards that were put in place to push the industry to sell electric vehicles in larger numbers.

Regulations finalized under President Joe Biden that assumed more than 50% of the U.S. auto market would be composed of fully electric models by 2032 “are a lawful exercise of authority Congress provided to EPA to regulate greenhouse gases from new motor vehicles,” Tesla said in a regulatory filing posted online by the Environmental Protection Agency on Sept. 24.

Tesla said it “respectfully encourages EPA not to rescind the endangerment finding, as that finding is lawful, based on a robust factual and scientific record, and has been an established part of federal law for more than 15 years.”

The National Federalism Commission analysis confirmed that 34 or more active state applications existed in 1979 and continued for 25 years.
In addition, it discovered that at least 34 active state applications existed in 2016 and 2017 as well.
The National Federalism Commission has this model legislation.
W. Bruce Lee is executive director of the National Federalism Commission.","This past Constitution Day, a historic announcement was made regarding the failure of Congress to discharge its express, ministerial, and non-discretionary responsibilities under Article V of the Constitution. All of us participated in this historic event.

The National Federalism Commission — an official inter-state and nonpartisan governmental body — released a comprehensive report for the House Judiciary Committee that confirmed the Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation’s multi-year claim that Congress should have called a Convention for Proposing Amendments focused on fiscal responsibility 46 years ago. But Congress failed to act.

Article V of the Constitution states, “The Congress, whenever two thirds of both houses shall deem it necessary, shall propose amendments to this Constitution, or, on the application of the legislatures of two thirds of the several states, shall call a convention for proposing amendments, which, in either case, shall be valid to all intents and purposes, as part of this Constitution, when ratified by the legislatures of three fourths of the several states, or by conventions in three fourths thereof, as the one or the other mode of ratification may be proposed by the Congress…”

The Federal Fiscal Sustainability Foundation discovered over three years ago that there were enough active state applications pending in Congress in 1979 for a Convention of the States for proposing amendments to be called. Specifically, there were 39 active applications, of which 30 were for fiscal responsibility and nine were plenary or “any subject,” applications. Importantly, constitutional scholars across the political spectrum have said that plenary applications should be combined with like single subject applications in determining whether the 34-state application requirement has been met.

The number of active applications in 1979 clearly exceeded the 34-state requirement and should have resulted in an immediate call for a convention by the Congress. However, since the Congress had yet to establish a process for receiving, storing and counting applications, evidently no one realized that the trigger for calling a convention had been met.

In 2015, the Judiciary Committee began collecting and storing state applications. However, its records were incomplete. Therefore, in 2025 the Judiciary Committee entered into an agreement with the National Federalism Commission to bring its records up to date. The National Federalism Commission started with fiscal responsibility related applications given the magnitude of the issue and since it is the only subject where independent parties had asserted that the trigger to call a convention had already been met. The National Federalism Commission’s work is now continuing in connection with other subject applications.

The National Federalism Commission analysis confirmed that 34 or more active state applications existed in 1979 and continued for 25 years. In addition, it discovered that at least 34 active state applications existed in 2016 and 2017 as well.

Shockingly, since 1979, total federal debt has risen from less than $1 trillion to more than $37 trillion and rising rapidly. In addition, the dollar has lost almost 80 percent of its value since 1979. These terrible outcomes are a result of the failure of Congress to act in a timely manner.

The sad but simple truth is that Congress has been addicted to spending, deficits and debt for far too long. This has been and remains a bipartisan problem that must be corrected if we want our future generations to be better off than our past. Only a constitutional amendment can force Congress to quit placing unreasonable debt burdens on current and future generations of Americans.

Should Congress fail to act in a reasonably timely manner, states will be forced to take legal action to have their constitutional right upheld. Our nation’s founders recognized that the states needed to have the ability to propose amendments when the Congress fails to act.

Hand-wringers who worry about a “runaway” convention should rest easy. Since a majority of past and present state applications relate to the issue of fiscal responsibility, the convention will be focused solely on that topic. In addition, 16 states and growing have state delegate loyalty legislation that gives the state the right to recall any delegates that try to act beyond the topic outlined in the state’s application. The National Federalism Commission has this model legislation.

Finally, it takes 38 states to ratify the amendment. Given these safeguards, we should be far more concerned with a runaway federal government than with a runaway convention.

Congress should now call a convention — indeed, given the language of Article V, it should be automatic. In addition, Congress should consider requiring that any proposed amendment be ratified by state conventions of pledged delegates which is the closest thing to a referendum under our Constitution. This was the method that was used to ratify the 21st Amendment, which repealed prohibition.

Finally, the Congress should pass the resolution calling for an Article V Convention to ensure that this wrong is not repeated in the future. In addition, the Senate should recognize the committee’s process for recording applications for economy and efficiency purposes.

Gavin Newsom recently posted that electricity prices have risen 10% since January, squarely placing the blame on President Donald Trump and Republicans in Congress. But for the millions of families and small businesses in my home state paying these higher energy prices, this is no laughing matter.

The data are in, and California now ranks 49th out of 50 in the nation for energy affordability. That means nearly every other U.S. state offers its residents lower-cost electricity. The only state with more expensive electricity is Hawaii, which as a chain of islands has unique geographical challenges to energy production that are simply not factors in the lower forty-eight.

California’s residential electricity price was a shocking 35.03 cents per kilowatt hour back in May of this year. Compare that to Idaho (11.88 cents), Louisiana (13.15 cents), or Ohio (17.11 cents). An average home will consume about 10,500 kilowatt hours of electricity per year, so that disparity adds up quickly. For middle-class families already grappling with higher housing, food, and fuel prices, the pain is real.

As a California native, it is tragic to see how Sacramento has so utterly mismanaged our state’s world-renowned natural resources. California is blessed with abundant sun, wind, water, and natural gas reserves in spades, yet our residents and businesses are paying almost triple what consumers in other states are charged.

This is no accident; it is a policy choice decades in the making.

""The inventories are getting a little low, so you might not get the exact color you want, but there are a few left here and there, and there are some at other dealers that we will gladly go out and get,"" said Cascade Auto Group Partner Pat Primm.

He said typically EVs account for around nine or 10% of car sales, but in the last few months. ""It's jumped to 25-to-30% in the Midwest region, which is where we are.""

The jump is attributable to the elimination of the $7,500 electric vehicle tax credit as part of June's Republican tax bill. It will be gone for good on Sept. 30.

""If you're watching this and you want to buy an electric vehicle you better do it before September 30th because on October 1st it's going to be a lot more expensive,"" said Senator Bernie Moreno (R-OH), a former car dealer who campaigned on and pushed for the credits elimination in part because of what he said he was seeing at his former luxury car dealerships.

""At some of my former dealerships, if you went and got a Rolls-Royce, a Porsche or a Mercedes and leased an electric version of these cars, the government was giving you $7,500; think about how insane that is,"" he said. ""So that millionaire who is leasing that Rolls-Royce, $7,500 is not something that we should be giving them.""

Despite the uptick in EV sales, it's been at a steady pace, said Lou Vitantonio, president of the Greater Cleveland Auto Dealers Association, which represents 250 new vehicle dealerships in the 21-county region of Northeast Ohio.

""We're not seeing a massive rush because the inventories have kind of fallen off a little bit,"" he said.

The EV tax credit was established more than 15 years ago and helped drive Americans into the electric vehicle market, a trend that ends in just a few days.

But while the credit does expire on Tuesday, and you're local car dealer may not have the car you want in stock, there is still a way for you to get that car and the $7,500.

""Under the guidelines that have been put out by the IRS, you can still order a vehicle, put it under contract and then still get that incentive after it's delivered past the deadline,"" said Viantonio. But you must have the paperwork signed before Tuesday.

At Valley Motor City in Cuyahoga Falls, there are still some EVs in stock, and the dealership has seen that last-minute rush.

As for the future demand?

""With the tax credit going away, I fear that's going to change. I don't think many people will be as inclined to purchase them anymore,"" said Account Manager Mikayla Martin.

The expiration of the tax credit and concern over tariffs led to a spike in car sales in the early part of the year. Up 16% in Northeast Ohio in June, but that jump might come at the expense of future sales.

""I think this last quarter, October, November, December, we won't be at a pace we saw in the beginning of the year,"" said Vitantonio. ""I think it will still be positive, but it will be around that 4-to-5% increase over the previous year.""

The energy storage can be standalone, or with a new or existing renewable resource. Ascend Analytics is administering the request for proposal (RFP) on behalf of Georgia Power.

Georgia Power said it prefers the procured resources to be online by no later than the end of 2031.

This builds upon Georgia Power’s current plans to add more than 1,500 MW of BESS in the coming years, according to Georgia Power. The Georgia Public Service Commission (PSC) approved the RFP as a part of the company’s 2022 integrated resource plan (IRP).

IRPs are long-term planning reports that are considered and approved by state regulators in many states, with some notable exceptions, such as in Texas and its unique grid.

In July Georgia Power requested certification from the PSC for 9.9 GW of new generation resources, 3 GW of which were for energy storage.

Over the next five to six years, the utility projects approximately 8.2 GW of electrical load growth, up more than 2.2 GW overall when compared to projections in its 2023 IRP Update.

Also notable is that Georgia Power is looking at longer duration energy storage, with 3,000 MW per year of 4-hour energy storage is projected to be added starting in 2028, while 3,000 MW per year of 12-hour energy storage is planned from 2033​.

In its IRP, Georgia Power detailed adding storage to solar projects, saying that its adoption of solar+storage versus solar-only generation at sites is currently at 17%.

Georgia Power first examined energy storage in its 2019 IRP, with approval to build, own and operate 80 MW of BESS at the time. Georgia Power had 65,000 kW of battery capacity as of Dec. 31, 2024.

According to Georgia Power, 8% of its energy mix was renewables as of 2024, and more than half is gas/oil (40%) and coal (16%). Georgia Power reports only the null energy output from some renewable generating facilities. Ownership of the associated renewable energy credits (RECs) is specified in each respective power purchase agreement or program tariff. The party that owns the RECs retains the right to use and report them.

Georgia Power has about 2.8 million customers in all but four of Georgia’s 159 counties. The average price residential customers paid during 2024 was 15.48 cents per kWh, and the average annual use per residential customer was 11,871 kWh. The utility’s total gross investment in facilities at the end of 2024 was $59.3 billion.

Set to reach 91% by 2030, the future of the European EV market future is defined by a plateau.
Elsewhere in APAC, Indian oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have also invested heavily in EV charging infrastructure.
Reports for the 2023–24 period detailed 15,797 EV charging stations installed across the three.
European oil companies are reducing investment in EV charging infrastructure but retain that Western markets are central to their strategies around electrification preparedness.","Electric vehicles (EVs) are an established cornerstone of the energy transition, with their increasing global adoption chipping away at a significant share of oil demand.

Fuel demand from cars and vans accounted for more than 25% of the world’s oil use in 2023, according to a report by the International Energy Agency (IEA), which also predicts that EVs will displace more than five million barrels of road fuel per day by 2030. This is good news for the climate and for international carbon emissions targets, but for oil and gas companies, there is a serious call for diversification.

Several major players are already working to stay ahead of the curve and remain relevant in a clean energy future. As the transport sector becomes a diminishing custom base, companies including bp, Indian Oil, PetroChina, Shell, Sinopec and TotalEnergies are among those investing in EV charging infrastructure to meet a new gap in the market.

Not all markets are equal, however, and investors are prioritising the regions supporting the most economic potential. The Asia-Pacific (APAC) region is a particularly attractive investment opportunity, offering investors the benefits of growing populations, developing economies, and the need for affordable and reliable energy sources. Elsewhere, Europe is seeing a slowdown in investment as regulatory uncertainty and a recent period of slow sales have knocked investor confidence.

Oil demand will peak, forcing companies to diversify

Cross-sector, global analysis indicates that while demand for oil and gas will eventually begin to fall, it hasn’t reached its peak yet, and portfolio diversification is still in the early stages. According to the IEA’s Stated Policies Scenario – which calculates the impact of already-enacted policies – oil and gas demand will peak in the next four years, before facing a steady decline. However, this decline could become more drastic if all currently announced government pledges are successfully enacted.

Ravindra Puranik, oil and gas analyst at GlobalData, explains that oil companies know they must adapt to electrification. “The oil and gas industry is undergoing notable transformation in response to the electrification of the transport sector… One of the most notable strategies is the investment in EV charging stations. This aligns well with existing assets, namely fuel stations, allowing companies to leverage their established infrastructure to support the transition to electric mobility,” he explains.

GlobalData is the parent company of Offshore Technology.

A spokesperson from Shell tells Offshore Technology: “As the EV charging industry is still nascent, we are continuously learning and adapting our EV growth strategy to market conditions. For example, we are focusing on our own retail sites in Europe where we can also leverage our convenience retail strengths.”

EV charging infrastructure appears a logical electrification strategy for oil companies, not only because of leverageable infrastructure but because the market is ripe too. GlobalData forecasts that EVs will account for nearly 50% of all global light vehicle sales by 2035 and that hybrid and electric vehicle sales will experience a compound annual growth rate of 6.7% between 2025 and 2037. With EVs comes a need for EV charging infrastructure and the market was already estimated to be worth $32.26bn in 2024, with this figure projected to grow to $125.39bn by 2030.

Noting that EV demand is already shaping the strategies of oil producers, Puranik says: “Several oil marketing companies have ventured into this market through acquisitions and collaborations with EV mobility providers. Oil majors Shell and TotalEnergies presently have the most diverse networks with more than 70,000 charge points installed around the world.”

The diverging global picture: Why APAC is more appealing than the West

Speaking to Offshore Technology, Frankie Mayo, senior UK analyst at global energy think tank Ember, explains that the needs of each region are different.

“The electrification of the global economy is just around the corner but requires abundant clean power and electricity networks ready for the challenge,” he says. “The transition is place-specific; for example, it will look different in developing countries, which can avoid decades of fossil fuel infrastructure and instead jump ahead to electrified alternatives.”

GlobalData figures identify diverging regional trends in EV sales figures, forecasting that the disparity will increase between APAC and the West. EVs currently make up 42% of auto sales in APAC, but this figure will reach 77% by 2037, with continued growth expected. Meanwhile, in Europe, EVs currently make up around 58% of auto sales, and this will jump to 99% by 2037. Set to reach 91% by 2030, the future of the European EV market future is defined by a plateau.

Of the expected development of the APAC market, GlobalData energy transition analyst Clarice Brambilla explains: “I expect to see continued growth in EV production volume, especially in China, India, South East Asia and possibly Oceania. I also expect to see increasing affordability, including smaller, lower-cost EV models targeting mass market consumers, rather than just premium segments.”

She says of the Western market: “There is evidence of a modest rollback or at least slowing of EV investment in parts of the Western market such as Europe and the US, although it is less a reversal than a cooling from peak expectations. In Europe in particular, battery giga-factory plans have been delayed or scaled back, in part because of high costs, competition (often from lower-cost Asian producers), supply chain constraints and weaker-than-expected consumer uptake in some segments. However, battery-electric vehicle sales are still projected to grow strongly across the EU, driven by ambitious targets and strong policy support.

“On the other hand, in the US, regulatory uncertainty under the Trump administration and changing incentive regimes are dampening investment momentum.”

While the US looks a less reliable investment destination for diversifying oil companies, the APAC market needs EV charging infrastructure and, as a region, offers investors a series of advantages including emerging economies and governments looking to secure affordable and reliable energy sources for growing populations.

Significantly, populations in the APAC region are experiencing some of the most rapidly increasing disposable incomes in the world, with cities in India and South East Asia leading growth in household incomes. Brian Peers, global head of sustainable transport and fuels at HSBC, previously commented on the opportunity this presents, noting that “as incomes rise across Asia-Pacific over the coming decades, car ownership is set to increase, with Asia forecasted to account for over 60% of the 115 million EVs sold worldwide over the next five years”.

“The increased sale and production of EVs may present many opportunities across the value chain, including battery manufacturing, the roll-out of charging infrastructure and financing solutions for consumers.”

Oil companies’ EV infrastructure investments are not linear

APAC-based oil companies are investing in EV infrastructure, with Chinese companies leading the charge. Beijing-based Sinopec reported it had built 3,874 charging stations in 2023 and Chinese media outlet CNR reported that the country had 16.7 million EV charging units at the end of July.

Figures from December 2024 showed that Sinopec, Indian Oil and Shell owned the largest number of EV charging stations globally, with 9,051, 7,863 and 3,063 each, respectively, (based on the number of retail forecourts, rather than charge points). Elsewhere in APAC, Indian oil marketing companies Indian Oil Corporation, Bharat Petroleum and Hindustan Petroleum have also invested heavily in EV charging infrastructure. Reports for the 2023–24 period detailed 15,797 EV charging stations installed across the three.

Oil companies undoubtedly have a strong APAC presence, but the story is not so linear among European players.

European oil companies are reducing investment in EV charging infrastructure but retain that Western markets are central to their strategies around electrification preparedness. For example, London-based Shell transferred its Shell Recharge Solutions’ home and workplace chargers to 50five in December 2024 and discontinued its Shell Sky software a month later. The company also lowered its emissions reduction target for 2030 from 20% to 15–20% and dropped its 2035 emissions goal.

Yet a spokesperson explains: “The majority of Shell’s investment in EV charging is currently prioritised towards seven leading markets for EV adoption – China, Germany, the Netherlands, Singapore, Switzerland, the UK and the US. This is because these seven markets represent the most material opportunities from the context of advanced pace of electrification, existing competitive advantages and mobility value pool.”

Ultimately, Brambilla concludes that, while the picture is complex, EV investment is leaning in favour of APAC. “APAC continues to show strong momentum,” she says. “In many APAC markets subsidies, regulatory backing, and cost advantages make investment more attractive, so there remains a relative shift in attention toward the region.”

Elsewhere, bp has increased its oil and gas investment, while reducing its annual investment in its EV charging arm BP Pulse, cutting 10% of jobs and withdrawing from eight of the 12 countries it was operating in. What survives still retains a Western focus and bp says: “Our aim is to provide high-powered on-the-go charging in markets with the strongest growth in EVs: China, the UK, Germany and the US.”",https://www.power-technology.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/09/GettyImages-1334493178.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 20:01:49.726334

Dive Brief:

Investments in residential heat pumps, batteries and solar arrays could meet 100% of projected electricity demand growth from AI data centers through 2029, according to a report from the pro-electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.

The large tech and infrastructure companies behind the U.S. artificial intelligence boom could unlock more than 93 gigawatts of grid capacity at costs comparable to building a new fleet of gas power plants by paying 50% of the cost of heat pump upgrades and 30% of the cost of onsite solar and storage, Rewiring America said Sept. 18.

“Hyperscalers are already thinking creatively about how to meet their growing power needs, and this report presents a solution that brings households into the conversation,” Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak said in an email to ESG Dive sister publication Utility Dive.

Dive Insight:

U.S. utilities requested about $29 billion in rate increases in the first half of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for pro-consumer regulatory reform.

The sharp rise in rate hike requests and in already-approved rate increases show that “the status quo isn’t working for households,” Matusiak said. “There’s a way to rebalance the equation and ensure there’s something in it for Americans.”

Matusiak’s group said rising electricity prices compound the consumer burden of broad-based inflation and the pending expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient appliances and distributed energy resources, which experts say could push utility rates higher still.

Right now, hyperscalers and the utilities that support them are looking to “centralized, utility-scale solutions, like building fossil fuel or nuclear power plants” to meet near-term load growth projections, Rewiring America said. Instead, it said, targeted residential energy investments could effectively offset the loss of federal energy tax credits, free more than 100 GW of grid capacity over five years and lay the foundation for a more efficient, resilient power system over the longer term.

Those investments could also help hyperscalers and utilities sidestep five-to-six-year lead times and escalating construction costs for combined-cycle gas turbines while reducing exposure to volatile natural gas prices, Matusiak said.

Reported capital costs of combined-cycle power plants to be deployed around 2030 now exceed $2,000 per kilowatt up nearly 50% from plants with expected 2026 deployments, the clean energy group GridLab said in a report this month.

Hyperscalers’ heat pump investments should focus on households using inefficient electric space heating, water heating and air conditioning, Rewiring America said in last week’s report.

For example, the report said fully transitioning Georgia homes from electric resistance heat to heat pumps could free up about 1.5 GW of capacity, or 22% of the state’s projected data center load growth through 2029. Swapping out traditional air conditioners for heat pumps in Texas could unlock 3.9 GW of capacity, or 23% of expected data center load over the next five years.

Heat pumps are two-way climate control devices that can heat or cool homes, depending on the season. By covering 50% of the upgrade cost, the report said hyperscalers could knock the upfront expense down to about $9,000 for a typical home — less than the combined cost of a new furnace and air conditioner.

To unlock 109 GW of additional grid capacity through distributed solar and storage, Rewiring America said hyperscalers would only need to cover 30% of installation costs — the same subsidy provided by the expiring federal home energy tax credit — to reach cost parity with new gas generation.

But that would require every “single-family household in the U.S. [to install] a home battery, and those with a suitable roof [to install] a 5-kW solar system,” the report said. Rewiring America also based its gas-parity projection on a reduction of at least 40% in installed solar and storage costs, driven by economies of scale, streamlined permitting and lower customer acquisition costs.

Though ambitious, the Department of Energy’s January report on virtual power plants and more recent research by the Smart Electric Power Alliance and Sparkfund suggest Rewiring America’s 109-GW target is plausible.

DOE estimated U.S. VPPs — which aggregate customer-sited batteries, thermostats and other latent energy sources — could reach 80 GW to 160 GW by 2030, offsetting 10% to 20% of peak grid demand. SEPA and Sparkfund said distributed capacity procurement, an emerging utility-led approach to VPP deployment, could supply a significant amount of the necessary capacity.

Distributed capacity procurement is just one of several strategies hyperscalers and utilities could pursue to offset expected AI load growth, Matusiak said.

Other promising strategies include clean transition tariffs supporting distributed capacity rather than new generation and scaled-up, performance-based contracts with third-party VPP aggregators, he said.

And in some hot data center markets, traditional utilities might not need to be directly involved at all.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/5qxBqGsn2320LkAY4wNn3fhaYEXEynW7XMUxMpebl8w/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzUwODY0NzEzLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-25 19:01:37.567486

1. Who Controls the Federal Purse?

Topline: President Donald Trump recently attempted to cancel $4.9 billion in spending on foreign aid, but not everyone believes the action was legal, writes AEI’s Kevin R. Kosar. The administration’s proposal would cancel $3.2 billion in international development program spending, $900 million in contributions to the United Nations, $326 million in international peacekeeping funds, and hundreds of millions more in grants to foreign nations.

Rescissions Rules: Legislation from 1974 allows the executive to ask Congress not to spend previously appropriated funds. The president must notify Congress, setting the Senate and House up for a 45-day countdown to pass a bill to approve the request. Trump gamed this process by submitting a request less than 45 days before the appropriation would expire—flipping control from the legislature to the executive.

Shutdown Risk: If Congress fails to pass the 12 annual appropriations bills by October 1, the government will shut down. The Senate requires 60 votes to pass these funding bills, and Republicans only hold 53. Kosar warns that Democrats’ frustration with Trump’s use of pocket rescissions may prevent them from joining their colleagues across the aisle to fund the government.

“The price for Democrats to vote for any spending bills or a continuing resolution might be iron-clad provisions forbidding the rescission of the $4.9 billion in foreign aid funds and GOP agreement not to pursue additional rescissions.”—Kevin R. Kosar

2. Defense Budget Diversions

Topline: The Trump administration touts a $1 trillion budget for the Department of Defense in 2026, but AEI’s Elaine McCusker explains that only about 42 percent of this top-line number goes toward building and modernizing the American military.

Additional Spending: $17 billion of the 2026 budget request funds programs and activities that deviate from the Pentagon’s core function. In many cases, these programs are the responsibility of other federal agencies, such as medical research and education programs. McCusker highlights that these programs should be administered by other agencies with the authority and responsibility to execute them rather than being grouped in with defense spending.

Military Readiness: With the United States facing an array of global threats more potent than at any time since 1945, McCusker concludes that more of the Pentagon’s budget should be focused on core military missions. Nondefense spending in the defense budget misleads Americans as to how much is being spent on the military, she warns, and the diversion of resources has real-world consequences that range from deadly accidents to battlefield shortcomings.

“These nondefense programs and activities, combined with must-pay bills, create the illusion of a defense budget that is larger and more flexible than it is and contribute to the lack of transparency and accountability to the taxpayer.”—Elaine McCusker

3. Solutions for SNAP

Topline: In 2022, 5.6 million Americans received SNAP benefits through broad-based categorical eligibility (BBCE), AEI’s Angela Rachidi and Erik Randolph find. BBCE allows states to expand SNAP to those making more than 130 percent of the federal poverty level, the statutory income limit set by Congress for eligibility. The number of Americans receiving SNAP benefits through BBCE was 1.2 percent in 2008, but had risen to 13.6 percent by 2022.

BBCE Explained: Congress originally established BBCE as a way to lower administrative burden and increase benefit program efficiency. Forty-one states and the District of Columbia have used it in recent decades to expand SNAP eligibility, some adopting the maximum 200 percent of the federal poverty level.

Advantages of Eliminating BBCE: Rachidi and Randolph contend that eliminating BBCE has several benefits, including increasing SNAP’s integrity, preventing states from inflating caseloads to access federally funded benefits, and reducing government costs. However, eliminating BBCE without other changes risks worsening the benefits cliff and discouraging SNAP recipients from working more hours or for higher pay. To mitigate this, the authors propose ending BBCE while realigning the program’s structure to uniformly reduce benefit cliffs.

“The solution is to eliminate BBCE while adjusting SNAP benefits to align the maximum benefit level, tapering point, benefit reduction rate, and income exit point so the SNAP benefit tapers gradually to zero instead of dropping off a cliff. Getting this right will eliminate the need for BBCE while addressing benefit cliffs and the associated work disincentives.”—Angela Rachidi and Erik Randolph

LIT is the first new container terminal in the country and the first project in Louisiana to register with Envision, underscoring Port NOLA’s commitment to building infrastructure that prioritizes environmental stewardship, social responsibility, and long-term economic resilience.

Developed by the Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure (ISI), Envision is a comprehensive, globally-recognized framework that provides a standardized way to evaluate and improve the sustainability of infrastructure projects across their full lifecycle. Projects are assessed against a broad set of credits that measure environmental, social, and economic impacts, with performance recognized through verification levels ranging from verified to platinum.

“Registering with Envision is another example of how Port NOLA is setting the standard for future-focused, responsible growth,” said Beth Branch, President and CEO of Port NOLA. “The Louisiana International Terminal will be transformative for our region, and this milestone ensures that we are building it in a way that reflects the best practices in sustainability, accountability, and community engagement.”

By aligning with Envision, Port NOLA and its partners are committing to a rigorous, third-party verification process that enhances transparency, fosters collaboration, and builds confidence among stakeholders and the public. Benefits of using Envision include:

Standardized sustainability assessment and accountability

Motivation for higher sustainability performance

Recognition of sustainability commitment in procurement

Positive public engagement and visibility

Enhanced collaboration across agencies and teams

Demonstrated responsible governance

“Becoming the first new container terminal in the U.S. to register with Envision sends a powerful message about Port NOLA’s values,” said Port NOLA Director of Sustainable Development, Emily Federer. “We are expanding our capacity to serve global trade and doing so in a way that meets our industry’s needs while safeguarding the needs of future generations, our environment, strengthening community trust, setting a precedent for sustainable infrastructure development in the maritime sector.”

The Institute for Sustainable Infrastructure welcomed Port NOLA’s commitment to sustainability. “Port NOLA’s leadership in registering the Louisiana International Terminal with Envision demonstrates its dedication to embedding sustainability at the heart of one of the nation’s most important infrastructure projects,” said ISI President and CEO, Anthony Kane. “This project will serve as an example to ports and terminal operators everywhere of how to use Envision as a pathway toward measurable, responsible, and lasting impact.”

Economic Imperative

The Louisiana International Terminal is one of the most significant infrastructure investments in the Gulf region and for the economy of the United States and will serve as the premier gateway for international trade in the Gulf.

A comprehensive study conducted by economist Dek Terrell with Lewis Terrell and Associates has revealed that the LIT facility will generate 18,500 new direct and indirect well-paying jobs in Louisiana and produce more than $1 billion dollars in new state and local tax revenue by 2050. That study is posted on the Louisiana International Terminal website here.

Registering with Envision ensures that its design and construction will be guided by the highest standards of sustainability, strengthening Port NOLA’s role as a critical connection between global markets and America’s heartland.

Associated Press/Report for America

HOLLY RIDGE, La. (AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users.

Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”",https://dailyreporter.com/files/2025/09/dump-truck-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 16:02:17.414027

Each of these is a threat to future climate action and erodes the new climate common sense.","Climate action in the US has lately suffered a series of disorientating reversals and is under vertiginous assault. Across the 2010s and into the 2020s, climate advocates successfully connected beliefs about the future with coalition building that made climate action an unavoidable priority for the US government. A new common sense had been built around a single premise: that the future is carbon constrained. This premise cohered a vast but fragile ecosystem of sometimes competing interests around the imperative of responding with economy-wide decarbonization.

But since 2023, skepticism has grown about the timeline on which carbon constraints will bind, and doubt has seeped in regarding the ability of climate action to deliver for its constituencies. In all its forms, the Trump assault on climate policy aims to convince Americans that climate action will make them worse off, and, in doing so, to blow up the painstakingly assembled coalitions that made US climate action possible. The undermining of both American confidence in climate action and its coalitional foundations risks locking in self-propelling negative feedback loops.

The following poses the challenges we face starkly, in the hope of sparking grounded debates about the path forward. Finding that path requires clear strategies, which in turn depend on an accurate analysis of the terrain on which advocates now have to fight.

Creating the new climate common sense

Since the 2015 Paris Agreement and the 2018 Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report that predicted disastrous consequences if global warming reached above 1.5 degrees Celcius, advocates of climate action shaped an understanding of the future that would rearrange the self-interest of actors in the present. Among the parameters of that imagined future: Global warming is real, and anthropogenic; as emissions accumulate and temperatures rise, ecological and economic systems will be destabilized, presaging a future that is considerably worse for human civilization; the prospect of that future, and the increasing signs of it in the present, will ultimately force governments to act to restrict carbon emissions, one way or another. In other words, the future is carbon constrained. We can call this the New Climate Common Sense (NCCS).

The strategy and solution that flows from the NCCS is rapid decarbonization. Transitioning to a low-carbon economy is in nearly everyone’s interest because the costs of mitigation and adaptation grow with delay, asset stranding threatens both public and private balance sheets, first-actors in a post-carbon system will have an advantage in a carbon constrained world, and the life prospects of ordinary people would be dramatically improved by a more stable climate system. Whereas prior consensus in the climate community understood the problem primarily as one of collective action, the new common sense advanced a theory of competition among policy makers, companies, and countries to be first to solve for the post-carbon future.

The establishment of this view in elite power centers spread rapidly in the middle of the last decade. At the highest levels of coordination—corporate boards, multilateral organizations, national and subnational governments—the new common sense turned into novel forms of commitment, and in some cases action. Net zero commitments proliferated in the corporate and financial sector, following the Nationally Determined Contributions under the Paris Agreement. Ideas for shifting financial power toward low-carbon activity emerged, like ESG and the Glasgow Financial Alliance for Net Zero. Governments undertook policies to propel the energy transition, including subsidies for renewables, carbon markets, and so on. These policies functioned as proof that the future was carbon constrained, as an accelerant on further corporate and government action, and as a wager that leadership would produce followers.

Translating NCCS into concrete climate action required prevailing in a political struggle with all of the interests opposed to decarbonization—whose nucleus is powerful business models organized around carbon intensive energy and production. A new flourishing of strategies emerged to chart a path forward, predicated on the goal of building a coalition powerful enough to overcome the political power of this carbon bloc. Among a range of actors, the emergent strategy was that of “co-benefits”—the production of alignment among many constituencies who could pursue multiple goals through decarbonization. Social movements, corporate leaders, and policy makers acting in the national interest could all find their alignment.

Youth social movements, most prominently Fridays For Future and the Sunrise Movement, garnered enormous media attention by focusing squarely on the question of their own futures. New formations like the BlueGreen Alliance (where I work) pursued policies and organizing that could win union members to the cause of climate change, by protecting workers affected by decarbonizing industry—the just transition—and to attach labor standards to public investment in the new green industries. Green New Deal activism oriented discursive and movement demands toward a vision of social renewal, in which the generational fights against income inequality and racial stratification could merge with the existential battle against climate collapse.

Corporate interest was forged by policy makers and corporate activism. Those with some carbon assets, which could plausibly become green, like electric utilities and the automakers, could be offered “decarbonization bargains” in the form of subsidies, guaranteed markets, and so on. Acting in line with the new common sense, which described an inevitable future of technological development, growing consumer demand, and government regulation, they could take the deal. And the multinational giants of the oil and gas industry began—however dubiously—placing bets on shifting off of fossil fuels and onto transition technologies like carbon capture, hydrogen, and so on. Meanwhile, the falling costs of renewables—the levelized cost of solar fell by half from 2010–2015, and again by half from 2015–2020—encouraged deployment and bolstered the common sense argument that the transition was less about trade-offs than who would reap the benefits of the inevitable era of abundant and affordable energy. Climate action was increasingly seen to mean an impending investment boom.

Meanwhile, Democratic Party foreign policy elites—absorbing the electoral rejection of the liberal establishment with Trump’s victory in 2016—increasingly alighted upon climate as a key part of a strategy of liberal renewal. The world’s technological leader, largest historical emitter, and most powerful country could spur other countries to action and supply the technology and financing needed to make the transition. Arriving at the view that climate change represented the world’s biggest challenge, but also an opportunity for the US to demonstrate constructive leadership on the global stage, and to position the US economy at the forefront of a coming technological revolution, members of this community increasingly linked public investment to fight climate action with an attack on domestic economic inequality designed to undo the economic and political damage of deindustrialization. Notably, in their February 2020 programmatic essay on this subject, Jake Sullivan and Jennifer Harris argued that a transformation in domestic economic policymaking was central to US foreign policy success—with climate action as a key factor linking the two.

The coalitional theory was one of positive feedback loops. By lowering the cost of transitioning from carbon to noncarbon business and economic models, by delivering social benefits that make climate action electorally popular, and by persuading actors that the future will in fact be carbon constrained, all would be further incentivized to get ahead of it. Each step taken in response solidified the belief that the future is low-carbon, and increased the perceived costs of inaction. This theory of change contributed to the unprecedented centrality of climate to the 2020 election. By the start of primary season in 2019, this common sense was hegemonic within the Democratic Party, such that one of the major factors the presidential candidates debated was just how aggressive they would be in combating climate change.

Common sense and consensus

The new common sense asserted the decarbonization imperative, and advanced a theory of transformation that involved co-benefits. But on a more fundamental level, the consent and action of power brokers was based on the recognition of three macro trends: the rise of China as an economic and technological power, the economic and political disturbances in advanced economies since the Great Financial Crisis, and the unavoidability of climate change itself. All of these developments—China, the crises of democratic capitalism, and climate—interacted with and shaped each other. For example, the “China shock” was blamed for deindustrialization and the rise of populism among blue collar workers. And climate action was framed either as a space in which the US and China could cooperate, or, increasingly, the need to compete with China became a reason to prioritize climate policy.

These trends had set the foundations for breaking policy orthodoxy among leading Democrats. The idea that fiscal rectitude had harmed their political prospects—in particular, that the limited fiscal response to 2008 had contributed to Trump’s election—was widespread. Helped along by (of all people) Larry Summers’s resurrection of the liberal Keynesian idea of “secular stagnation” in 2013, and the absence of any inflation in response to the loose fiscal policy of Trump’s first term, Democrats began to wonder if they had overlearned the lessons of the 1970s. The radicalization of the Republican Party—and the rise of Bernie Sanders and a “populist” wing among the Democrats—suggested that tepid bipartisanship and the median voter theorem were no longer politically winning. And China’s extraordinary economic development ignited a competitive panic, and an interest in industrial policy—which, in light of the earlier failure of cap-and-trade, came to be seen as a central vector for climate action.

The Covid-19 crisis generated a new sense of urgency and possibility. Supply chain snarls and the sudden visibility of global production networks affirmed arguments about industrial policy and domestic economic resilience. The reaction to the Covid-19 economic depression made calls for enormous fiscal stimulus commonplace—and enlivened the political possibility of public spending on all manner of social needs. Then, on January 6, 2021, the Capitol riot managed to temporarily convince national Democrats that they could and should act on a partisan basis to address the present crises—Covid, climate, inequality, and racial justice, per Biden’s inaugural.

By the beginning days of the Biden Administration, Democratic Party leaders were persuaded that something like “green industrial policy”—with pro-labor and environmental justice provisions, alongside a set of long-deferred welfare state expansions—would be the skeleton key to addressing a set of crises that went far beyond climate change. Reflecting the desires of the coalition’s constituent parts, it was thought that “big green fiscal” could reinvigorate the American economy, reduce inequality, advance racial equity, and buttress American democracy.

The trajectory from the American Jobs Plan to Build Back Better to the IRA is, by now, well-known. But it bears repeating that the sheer magnitude and number of crises that Democrats believed climate action could address—carried by the dramatic alignment around the new climate common sense—led them to prioritize climate over practically every other priority when their initial ambitions were curtailed by Manchin and Sinema in late 2021.

Governing with the common sense

The policy design of the IRA reflected the theory of the new climate common sense. Interventions were developed to align with Paris goals—most significantly the technology neutral clean electricity tax credits, which were set to last until emissions fell 75 percent from 2022 levels. The federal government was assigned a major role in guiding and financing investments in infrastructure and technologies—through uncapped investment and production tax credits, a wide assortment of grant programs, and the massive expansion of the loan authority given to the Department of Energy—with the aim of steering the transformation of the entire US energy system. Prevailing wage and apprenticeship bonuses were attached to IRA tax credits, for the first time embedding labor standards in the tax code and connecting them to low-carbon investment. Decarbonization bargains were offered to autos and the power sector, but also industry and agriculture—heading off some amount of opposition from those sectors. Domestic manufacturing was promoted, as was the notion of long-term business certainty provided by the assurance that long-term investments were being made to tackle the climate problem.

And these policies were aimed to lock in to a political economy hostile to climate action. The heartlands of the carbon coalition received the majority of new investment flows, on the conviction that future Republican congresses and administrations would be unlikely to reverse policies that were directly supporting investment and jobs in their districts. The initial impacts were considerable: capital did appear to be “crowding in” to clean energy sectors, and subsidy uptake exceeded Congressional Budget Office estimates, suggesting that, despite Manchin’s efforts, “big green fiscal” was indeed getting into gear. Together with state and federal regulatory actions that signalled a further push towards decarbonization on the heels of IRA subsidies, NCCS was being affirmed and strengthened, and positive feedback loops looked poised to kick in.

The Green New Scam

The political right and the hard-core of the carbon bloc took aim at the new common sense. Powerful and purely ideological campaigns proliferated. The push was especially strong in Republican-controlled states, which saw preemption of local climate laws and boycotts of private sector actors, representing the specter of “woke capital,” who they claimed were discriminating against their states, and grassroots misinformation campaigns to discredit the entire agenda. Finding their footing on culture war terrain, the right increasingly framed climate action as an exercise in coercive social engineering by “radical left lunatics” who hate America.

Among Democrats, developments beginning already in 2022 raised questions about whether decarbonization was quite the economic, political, and geopolitical slam dunk it appeared to be in 2021. Awkwardness first emerged in response to Russia’s invasion of Ukraine, when lowering energy prices became a domestic political imperative and US LNG looked to many like a source of both power and plenty on the world stage. Full employment, forty-year-high inflation, and the end of the Fed’s Zero Interest Rate Policy cut against some of the economic and political-economic justifications for big green fiscal, especially in the rank ordering of job creation vs. affordability among top concerns in the electorate, while also making the economics of many decarbonization investments more difficult. The eruption onto the scene of generative AI in late 2023 exploded everyone’s sense of what it would take to decarbonize the power grid. In conjunction with heightened anxieties about competition with China, AI increasingly presented a cause for “realism” with respect to the pace of decarbonization. BYD’s success underscored a growing gap with China in clean tech and raised fears of a “second China shock,” this time directly associated with decarbonization.

All the while, doubts grew as to whether the promised co-benefits of climate action were materializing. The administration consistently spoke of “good, union jobs,” but relatively few manufacturing jobs in particular were on course to be union. Commentators and advocates wondered whether procedural issues and efforts to tie direct local benefits to projects were slowing the pace of investment, and therefore slowing the timeline along which a broader set of people would experience the co-benefits (“everything bagel”) of climate action. Had Harris defeated Trump, these questions would have formed the terrain of climate politics during her administration. With Trump’s victory, they became the fissures that the new administration would exploit in its attempt to unravel what climate advocates, the Biden administration, and congressional Democrats had accomplished.

Trump’s 2024 presidential campaign made the “Green New Scam” a central theme. When Trump and the GOP won the White House and the Congress, it was clear there would be fights and reversals. But there were countervailing factors locked in by the IRA: hundreds of billions of dollars in investments and hundreds of thousands of jobs, overwhelmingly located in Republican districts and downstream of IRA tax credits. The AI boom was exploding electricity demand—cutting off clean energy tax credits would raise the price of energy precisely at the time when powerful firms and regular people wanted it abundant and cheap. And the bipartisan commitment to competition with China would demand government support of potential competitor firms in the US.

None of this has so far stopped the Trump administration from unilaterally cancelling hundreds of grant contracts tied to IRA programs, in line with the President’s early executive orders targeting “DEI.” The IRA tax credits—by far the biggest source of big green fiscal firepower—were caught up in the fight over renewing Trump’s 2017 tax cuts and the rest of the President’s domestic legislative agenda that played out over the first half of this year. Upwards of two dozen Republican members of Congress publicly articulated their desire to keep most or all of the tax credits in place. Their opposition to cutting the credits was backed by major business lobbies, unions, local elected officials, and more. But the combination of hard-line fiscal hawkery from the likes of the House Freedom Caucus, Trump’s own personal animus, the inclusion of many other things those same Republicans liked (not least, even bigger tax giveaways to the wealthiest Americans than the 2017 bill contained), and Trump’s iron hold over the entire GOP meant that all of those Republicans who would have liked to keep the IRA tax credits in place simply caved and voted for a bill that largely gutted them, even with the knowledge that the loss of the credits would inflict real economic pain on workers and businesses in their districts.

The decimation of the common sense

Starting in the closing weeks of the OBBB Act fight, when hardliners like Chip Roy teamed up with charlatans like Alex Epstein to mount an all-out attack on renewables, the erstwhile “all of the above” GOP energy consensus has been replaced with an all-out assault on everything related to climate, including a policy of active discrimination against solar and wind energy in particular. Backed by DOE Secretary Chris Wright, the Trump administration’s spurious yet official position is now that solar and wind power actively harm the power grid by requiring costly investment in transmission and backup power. Further, deploying clean energy is now argued to play to China’s sectoral dominance, thereby weakening the US position. In a move resembling a black mirror version of anti-pipeline activism, the Trump administration has revoked permits from offshore wind projects that are 80 percent complete.

Few meaningful counterpressures presently exist. The broad coalition of civil society, important sectors of capital, and the Democratic Party that came together to enact a large-scale program of public support for decarbonization has been, to date, unable to mount an effective response to this assault. Part of that failure to mobilize reflects the acute fear that Trump has instilled in all sorts of powerful actors, perhaps especially—and, most shockingly, seeing as this is still the United States of America we’re talking about—the leaders of major US and multinational corporations. Part of it reflects a shift in priorities among some actors that were formerly stalwarts of the coalition. Big tech, to take an important example, would still surely prefer federal support for cheaper clean energy. But Silicon Valley firms’ Net Zero commitments were already creating challenges for them as the AI boom sent their electricity demand into the stratosphere. As these firms face intensifying competition with Chinese companies, they are anxious to remain in the White House’s favor, and see no alternative to increasing their consumption of carbon-based electricity as their total electricity demand rises by a staggering 25 percent every single year. The NCCS is inevitably weakened when even those sections of capital seemingly most amenable to a post-carbon economy demonstrate through their investment and procurement decisions that the pace of decarbonization is unlikely to match their former goals.

At a deeper level, however, the actions taken by Trump and the GOP seem precisely calibrated to obliterate the new climate common sense itself. The US government now states confidently and proudly that the US will not decarbonize. US companies, states and localities, and foreign governments alike face open and economically injurious discrimination if their attitude towards carbon diverges from the White House’s view. How could this fail to convince many actors in the US and beyond that, at the very least, the pace of US decarbonization is going to be much, much slower than many had believed just a few short years ago? Confronted with those transformed views about how soon carbon is likely to be constrained, it is only to be expected that many actors will hedge. In those hedges lie a severe weakening of the climate coalition. Of course, the weaker the coalition, the more the NCCS will erode, as the negative feedback loops kick in.

Climate action whipsaw

In the present situation, we will see slower rates of decarbonization across sectors than we would have in a world where the 2024 policy status quo remained in place. We are already seeing projects cancelled—like Australian company Fortescue’s battery and hydrogen factory that, poignantly, was to be housed in the hulking Detroit ruin of the Fisher Body plant—and there are surely more to come. There will be fewer clean energy jobs, and, most likely, higher electricity prices.

The rollback of IRA tax credits means that everyone has to factor in the likelihood of continued whipsaw, undermining the feedback loops that solidified the new consensus. Shrunken domestic markets for low-carbon technology will make it harder for companies to lead in key sectors. And companies that were pursuing hedged decarbonization bargains will hedge further, especially amid a policy environment of hyperactive discrimination against clean energy. Further, firms in decarbonizable sectors may decide to make an outright bet on a carbon unconstrained future—particularly those not seeking sales outside the US market.

And in the states? The 2010s saw state-level climate action contribute to positive policy feedback loops. But the mid-2020s pullback of federal support for decarbonization will exacerbate existing pressures to retrench on climate goals. Withdrawn tax credits will lead utilities to push for less ambitious integrated resource plans, which will add yet more pressure on states to relax mandates. Catastrophic cuts to Medicaid and SNAP in the OBBB are likely to take precedence over filling in gaps from federal clean energy finance for Democratic state legislators. Just as ambitious state policy helped build the new climate common sense, a retreat, if it happens, will weaken it.

Further negative spirals may wait in the wings. For example, climate policy makers have increasingly looked to use carbon intensity in trade as a way to provide incentives for decarbonization. Europe’s Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM)—which is set to impose a fee on the carbon intensity of imports to match the costs European producers must pay for emissions certificates under their Emissions Trading System—is frequently cited as a reason why it is in the interest of US firms to decarbonize. In the recent US-EU trade “negotiations,” the US side pushed for exemptions from the CBAM for US producers, and appears to have won at least a rhetorical concession. Rather than utilizing trade as a vector for advancing decarbonization, the Trump administration is weaponizing trade against decarbonization. Already, the fortunes of US fossil fuel producers are being enlarged by Trump forcing energy purchases in trade agreements with Japan and the EU.

The IRA was enacted just past the peak of Democrats’ break from fiscal policy orthodoxy. The idea of using the fiscal firepower of the federal government for aggressive climate action was a point of remarkable consensus. Even prior to the enactment of OBBB, higher interest rates were making the fiscal cost of 6 percent of GDP annual budget deficits impossible to ignore. OBBB is almost certain to worsen that fiscal picture, ensuring higher interest rates into the future, and enormous pressure for fiscal consolidation on any future Democratic administration and Congress. Deploying fiscal firepower for decarbonization is likely to be a tougher sell in 2029 than it was in 2021. Those who need to place bets now on the future direction of policy will factor that in.

Even before the OBBB’s passage, parts of the Democratic foreign policy establishment called into question whether US power was actually served by decarbonization. Varun Sivaram, who worked under climate envoy John Kerry and was most recently in government affairs at Danish offshore wind giant Ørsted, authored a striking piece in Foreign Affairs called “Climate Realism,” and was quoted in the NY Times saying “The energy transition is actually very bad for the United States, because we cede geopolitical and economic ground to a rival in China.” The loss of the foreign policy establishment as part of the climate advocacy coalition may mean a weaker commitment to decarbonization in a future Democratic governing moment, and could further erode NCCS.

All of this is taking place as the Trump administration incinerates the credibility of the United States as a counterparty with which firms, countries, or even the US Congress can strike reliable agreements. The damage from the Trump administration’s governing-by-extortion is likely to be lasting, because, having elected Trump not once but twice, there are no actors in America who can credibly promise any counterparties that a future administration won’t do exactly the same thing all over again.

Decarbonizable sectors want the government to pay for as much of their decarbonization as possible. But it’s never cost-free for the firms. Firms want to partner with the US government because the terms are attractive and because of the NCCS—they see it as in their long-term, enlightened self-interest to decarbonize. But what happens when the US government starts not just whipsawing on policy but outright canceling cost-share agreements? Would these companies want to partner with the US government in the future? What level of subsidy and extent of guarantee would they demand for their participation, since, again, America as a whole cannot promise that we won’t elect Trump-like presidents in the future? Would our political system support the terms they might demand? Even if somehow NCCS wasn’t being eroded in all these other ways, Trump’s evisceration of US credibility vis-à-vis our own capitalists will increase the price of future decarbonization bargains, already more expensive due to fiscal constraints, smaller markets, and lost time. More expensive decarbonization bargains mean fewer decarbonization bargains, achieving less decarbonization. This is yet an additional way that NCCS erodes.

Broken terrain

The three years since 2022 have served to weaken beliefs about how carbon constrained the future will be, and thus how quickly decarbonization will proceed. For some firms and policy makers, the risk of being left behind in a carbon constrained world is now weighed against the risks of losing out in a world that decarbonizes much more slowly. The slower they move, the more they retain carbon assets, the less they stand to gain from further decarbonization policy, and the less supportive of climate action they become. These developments will constitute significant headwinds to a renewal of ambitious climate policy even if the present anti-climate common sense breaks in a few years. All of us who wish to see such a renewal need to devise strategies that are resilient to these headwinds.

There are, at the same time, some factors that may constitute tailwinds for a renewal of climate action. A brief stock-stake of these mitigating factors might suggest some paths forward.

First is cost: Clean energy is cheap. Gas is getting more expensive, especially as the US redoubles its commitment to liquified natural gas and turbine makers are reluctant to increase capacity. More expensive gas means wind and especially solar are more attractive to meet marginal energy demand, especially when paired with storage, for which tech neutral tax credits survived. Designing and selling climate policy with a strong focus on how it can address the high cost of living could retain or increase support for climate action. The cost of energy is also likely to be a pain point for the Trump administration, and may create openings for persuading the Trump administration to at least temper their policy of wanton discrimination.

Second is markets. Even as US policy kneecaps the growth of domestic markets for clean technologies, many American firms believe their long-term success depends on their ability to compete in the markets where the vast majority of future growth is expected to come from. In those markets, policy is not turning against clean energy, and Chinese firms look well positioned to run the tables. This reality is likely to limit the extent to which US automakers, for example, retreat from EVs.

Third is supply chains, whose vulnerability was a powerful impetus behind the IRA. To the extent that US actors believe that clean technologies have some role to play in the future energy mix, there is likely to continue to be an an interest in onshoring those supply chains. Any association of clean energy with manufacturing jobs will blunt efforts to penalize clean energy, and will limit the extent to which NCCS erodes. The fact that the 45X advanced manufacturing tax credit (which provides a per unit subsidy for domestically produced solar, wind, and battery components as well as critical minerals) mostly survived the IRA repeal effort is strong evidence for this assertion, and 45X’s survival will provide some succor to clean technology manufacturing for the foreseeable future.

Fourth is “clean firm.” The “tech neutral” clean energy tax credits mostly survived for everything besides solar and wind. If strong power demand and a weakening of solar’s cost advantage helps spur demand for “clean firm”—geothermal, nuclear, gas with CCS—then perhaps we will see emissions decline and some positive feedback loops for further climate action, especially if the US does manage to keep a technological edge in at least some of these power sources. There appears to be continued startup activity and venture backing for new energy technologies. If there is any potential for enlisting the current US government as a partner in carbon-free energy, it lies here.

Fifth is climate change itself, which does not care what common sense guides policy makers. Extreme weather events will happen more frequently and cause more damage. The reality and future likelihood of extreme weather events will only further reverberate through insurance markets, and through them into home prices, property taxes, local government services, and state budgets. (Of course, we can’t ever straightforwardly assume that experiencing the adverse effects of climate change will make people into stronger supporters of climate action. Whether it does or doesn’t is a political assumption—which the political right is fully prepared to contest.)

Sixth is industrial policy, whose return does not appear to be going away, even if the goals toward which it is being put are changing. The MP Materials deal, which made the Department of Defense (War?) the largest shareholder of the rare earths firm, is a strong indication that the US government will continue to utilize industrial policy tools in new and creative ways, some of which, perhaps, could be built on in the future.

Finally there is Trump himself. He is always smashing shibboleths. With his flamboyant jawboning around tariffs and prices, he may well have contributed to some price restraint and margin trimming by US companies. As in the MP Materials deal, and even more strikingly with Intel, he has broken norms surrounding public ownership. The “golden share” shoe will some day be on the other foot, and advocates for aggressive climate action may have tools they did not believe they had before for directing investment towards desired ends.

But these factors will be up against powerful centrifugal forces that threaten to cleave the coalition further. In particular, those of us looking for ways to slow and ultimately reverse the Trump era assault on climate action are likely to encounter trade-offs that big green fiscal mostly allowed us to defer in 2021–2022.

Cleavages in the NCCS

The loss of subsidies is going to significantly increase cost pressures on solar and wind developers and on clean tech manufacturers (since they will all be competing for smaller markets, and they’ll have lost provisions like the assembly and critical minerals requirements in the clean vehicles tax credits and the domestic content bonus in the clean electricity credits, which were designed to level the playing field for US producers). The final shape of a new tariff regime is still completely unknown, as are its effects on domestic prices. Tariffs may provide cushion from cost pressure for some manufacturers of clean technologies, but are likely to squeeze others.

In the face of cost pressures, companies can be expected to look for ways to cut back on job standards and limit unionization, push more aggressively for deregulation, and pull back from commitments to “community benefits.” A more cutthroat green capital sector delivering fewer co-benefits alongside decarbonization investments will heighten the anxiety many workers have that the transition will be bad for job quality, and the concern many communities have that economic development takes place at their expense. It will be a harder bargain to find unity between such a sector and the social and electoral coalition that won its subsidies.

Strains on the grid from data centers and other new sources of energy demand were already creating pressure to relax statutory clean energy goals at the state level. The loss of federal subsidies and federal regulations is likely to exacerbate those tensions, as utilities look to pass on the cost of more expensive solar and wind to ratepayers, and as industries seek relief from state-level cap-and-trade requirements. The previously discussed tightened state budgets will therefore increase the likelihood of “economy vs. environment”-type conflicts even in bastions of climate action, with ratepayers, blue collar workers, Medicaid recipients, and others pitted against climate spending in a struggle for scarce resources.

What is to be done?

Climate action is on track to be slower, less well equipped to deliver co-benefits, and more fraught with trade-offs and distributional conflicts. Each of these is a threat to future climate action and erodes the new climate common sense. It may be impossible for the climate community to prevent any of these developments from transpiring over the next several years; it is almost certainly impossible for the climate community to prevent all of them from transpiring.

We are going to be dealing with scarcity politics. In such an environment, minimizing cleavages within the coalition that forged the NCCS and broadening the base of political support for climate action is imperative. But doing so may mean acquiescing to a slower pace of climate action in some circumstances—which raises the task of ensuring that a slower pace of progress in the short term doesn’t translate into the sorts of hedging behavior that will make more ambitious action harder in the medium term. This may mean searching for focus and efficiency in our policy interventions. What policies deliver the biggest impact for the lowest cost? Are there certain climate-related investments that are especially popular or politically significant, around which rearguard action can be prioritized? Are there opportunities not just to entice capital, but to compel it to invest in certain ways? Can we get more creative about financing? Can we get better at embedding climate action in other areas of policy that are more salient for ordinary people (e.g. housing)? What opportunities exist for leveraging scale, through coordinated actions across climate aligned states? What sorts of transnational coordination can help to avert negative feedback loops from setting in (since many other countries are facing similar pressures)?

It is unlikely that the climate community will align around a single answer to all of these questions. But hopefully a shared analysis of the challenges we face can help to forge greater unity of purpose. Beyond policy design, it seems urgent to recommit to movement building as a precondition for climate action. What corporations and policy elites believe their interests to be is not given, but is rather shaped by movements and politics. The world has changed in many ways, but the need for people in the US and across the world to stand up for a future in which all people can thrive has never been greater.

As of July, the average household price of electricity in the United States has risen by 9.5 percent this year, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Trump’s policies are likely to contribute to inflation, including pushing up electricity costs.","Rising electricity rates are hitting consumers just about everywhere as utilities struggle to build enough power plants to meet rising demand from data centers.

But the effects on prices vary a lot by state.

Federal electricity data released on Tuesday helps to identify where the increases in bills have been the most drastic. I found several surprises.

As of July, the average household price of electricity in the United States has risen by 9.5 percent this year, according to the Energy Information Administration. You might guess that the largest increases were in states known for high electricity costs, such as California, or those that are part of the PJM Interconnection, a multistate grid region embroiled in controversy over rising prices.

But the largest percentage increase this year was in Missouri, which rose 38.3 percent. Several of the state’s utilities raised rates, including Ameren, which had a 12 percent rate increase that took effect this summer.

The rest of the top five are North Dakota, with 33.6 percent; New Jersey, with 28.6 percent; Iowa, with 27.5 percent; and Montana, with 25.3 percent.

Of those five, only New Jersey is in PJM, which covers parts of the Mid-Atlantic, South and Midwest.

California, with a 7.8 percent increase, trails the national average.

I’m looking at the changes in prices since January because that’s when President Donald Trump took office vowing to cut energy costs. Democrats are now seeking to tie him to rising bills.

But I should note that seven months of data is not enough to draw firm conclusions. Trump hasn’t had much time for his policy changes to affect what consumers pay for power.

And a 9.5 percent increase is high but has recent precedent. During the COVID-fueled inflation panic of Joe Biden’s administration, households faced some punishing electricity bills, including a 10.1 percent hike in the annual average for 2022 compared to 2021. Biden paid a heavy political price for inflation, so this example should not be a comfort to the Trump administration.

The bigger concern for consumers, in my view, is that the worst may be yet to come. Trump’s policies are likely to contribute to inflation, including pushing up electricity costs. For example, the Trump administration’s attempt to slow the development of renewable energy will likely reduce the supply of electricity at a time when solar is the country’s fastest-growing power source. And tariffs on imported metals are likely to increase the costs for electricity infrastructure.

To better understand the price trend, let’s take a step back and look at how July 2025 costs compare to those five years ago.

The largest increase in that time was in Washington, D.C., up 93.2 percent. The rest of the top five were Maine, up 66.1 percent; California, up 62.7 percent; Maryland, up 54.3 percent; and New Jersey, up 52.7 percent.

Pennsylvania, a state whose affordability crisis was the subject of a recent story by me and my colleague Kiley Bense, ranked sixth, with 46.5 percent. A key point in that story is that price increases in Pennsylvania vary by utility, and many households are paying much more than the state average.

And, while Iowa experienced a high percentage increase since January, it has the lowest percentage increase in the country since five years ago, with 7.6 percent. This helps to demonstrate how short-term changes can be misleading. North Dakota has a similar dynamic, with a high increase this year and a low increase—11.8 percent—over five years.

Why Are Prices Rising?

Prices are increasing mainly because the spike in electricity demand—a significant portion of it from AI data centers and other superusers—is not being met with an adequate amount of new power.

Regulators and lawmakers need to act quickly to respond to the situation, said Rob Kelter, a senior attorney for the Environmental Law & Policy Center, a Chicago-based environmental advocacy group.

“You’re talking about data centers that need as much electricity as a small city, and we’re just not ready to handle that,” he said.

The solution, he said, is to deploy a combination of energy storage systems, wind farms and solar arrays that work in conjunction with policies to help reduce electricity demand at times when it’s highest. The Trump administration and many utility companies are trying to meet demand in large part by delaying the shutdown of old coal-fired power plants and rapidly building new gas-fired power plants.

“I believe we can [meet demand] and still meet our carbon goals, but it certainly is going to be a challenge, and legislatures and regulatory commissions aren’t used to being in a situation where they’ve got to make so many big, important decisions so quickly,” he said.

Some states, such as Indiana and Ohio, have adopted policies designed to protect consumers from being left on the hook for data center projects that fail to materialize. But that’s just the beginning of what consumer advocates would like to see done.

Indiana ranks near the national average in its percentage increase in electricity rates, both for this year and the last five years. The experience there helps to show that an average increase in this inflationary period is still painful.

“We’re hearing, first and foremost, a combination of anxiety, fear and some anger,” said Kerwin Olson, executive director of the Citizens Action Coalition, an Indianapolis-based consumer advocacy group. “The affordability crisis is very prevalent, very real.”

His organization launched an advertising campaign this week, called “Stop Mike’s Hikes,” to put pressure on Gov. Mike Braun, a Republican, to take action to help people struggling to pay electricity bills.

Olson said Indiana’s leaders have exacerbated the problem by trying to attract data centers to the state and by supporting the use of fossil fuels to produce electricity. He is concerned that Braun and others aren’t fully aware of how difficult it is for low- and middle-income consumers to pay their utility bills.

Braun has expressed concerns about energy costs. On Tuesday, he announced three new appointees to the panel that helps choose new members of the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission. He said at a news conference that addressing energy affordability is a high priority when deciding who will fill open seats on the regulatory commission.

One reason I reached out to Kelter and Olson for their perspectives on electricity rates is that they’ve worked as consumer and environmental advocates for decades, and I wanted to get a sense of how this moment compares to other times of high anxiety about power costs.

Each said the current situation ranks near the top, but it’s distinct from other events—such as the natural gas price spike of the late 2000s—because of the complexity of the problem.

“People are leery of what the future holds,” Olson said.

A Baffling Coincidence

According to the new data, the country’s average residential price of electricity remained the same, down to a hundredth of a penny for three straight months. That’s a remarkable coincidence.

That price, in May, June and July, was 17.47 cents per kilowatt-hour, according to the Energy Information Administration. Looking back at decades of data, I can find examples of the average price remaining the same for two months in a row, but this is the first time I’ve seen it stay the same for three months.

How is this possible, especially when rates in some states went up a lot during that time?

I asked an EIA spokesman, who said the process for calculating the price hasn’t changed and that the result is indeed a coincidence.

I also looked at some of the underlying data that the office uses to determine this average, which includes the amount of electricity produced and the total dollars customers paid for it. No matter how I sliced it, the numbers came out the same: 17.47 cents.

One factor is that California and Texas both had rate decreases since May, which helped to offset the increases in other places.

Some people reading this may wonder if EIA is fiddling with the numbers to avoid negative headlines about rising prices. It isn’t an outlandish thing to suggest, given that the Trump administration fired the head of the Bureau of Labor Statistics following a monthly jobs report that the president didn’t like.

But the people at EIA who produce this data are career staff, not political appointees, and I’ve seen no evidence of anything hinky with the numbers. Still, this result is unusual enough that I had to mention it.

Other stories about the energy transition to take note of this week:

A Federal Judge Allows Revolution Wind to Resume Construction: Revolution Wind, an offshore wind project that would serve Rhode Island and Connecticut, can resume construction following a federal judge’s ruling this week. The project was nearly complete when the Trump administration ordered it to pause on Aug. 22 for what it said were national security concerns, as Jennifer McDermott and Matthew Daly report for The Associated Press. At a hearing on Monday, a U.S. District Court judge said the delay was causing irreparable damage, and the developer could continue work while the federal government conducts its investigation of the potential harm the project may cause. The Trump administration has taken various actions to slow offshore wind development. Clare Fieseler wrote for Canary Media about the ruling and the larger picture of legal challenges facing offshore wind.

Pennsylvania Was Once a Clean Energy Leader. What Happened? Pennsylvania now ranks near the bottom of the country in the share of electricity generated from renewable energy. But in the 2000s, the state had policies that promoted wind and solar. My colleague Kiley Bense and I report for ICN about how the state failed to build on those early efforts.

Trump Brings His Talk of a ‘Green Energy Scam’ to the United Nations: President Donald Trump gave a rambling speech to the U.N. General Assembly in which he praised his administration’s support for fossil fuels and its opposition to renewable energy, and he said that other countries were foolish to want to choose a different course, as I wrote for ICN. The specifics were alarming, including a dismissal of the threat of climate change. Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation, said in a statement that Trump’s speech was “a denial of reality.” But the most striking aspect of the speech for me was its meandering delivery and its length, which took much more time than that of any other speaker.

EVs Are Now Cheaper Than Gasoline Vehicles, But Not for Long: The average price of an electric vehicle in the United States fell below that of a new gasoline-powered vehicle in July and August, according to data from J.D. Power. This shift is notable, but it’s not going to last long because a tax credit of up to $7,500 for qualifying new EVs expires at the end of this month. Dealers had added additional incentives this summer as they try to clear out inventory before the tax credit ends, as Tim Levin reports for InsideEVs.

To fund construction, the project secured a $2.26 billion conditional loan from the U.S. Department of Energy and a $250 million strategic investment from Orion Resource Partners. As of mid-2025, major construction is underway, including initial concrete placements.

Thacker Pass has a projected mine life of over 85 years, and the company holds more than 14 million tonnes of proven and probable lithium reserves. The project is central to U.S. efforts to build a domestic EV battery supply chain.

The move would be the latest in a string of negotiations that have given the U.S. government stakes in Intel and MP Materials.

Lithium is a critical mineral essential for manufacturing lithium-ion batteries, which power electric vehicles (EVs), portable electronics, and energy storage systems. Global demand for lithium continues to rise sharply due to the accelerating transition to clean energy and electrification of transportation.

Morrisey, speaking at the West Virginia Energy Educational Forum in Wheeling and acknowledging the increase sets an ambitious goal for the state. “When it comes to energy, West Virginia needs to be out in front. We need sound policy to guide our development and use of our abundant natural resources.”

In his address, the governor detailed the future energy demands of the state and the country in the coming years, noting that PJM, a regional transmission organization (RTO) that coordinates the movement of wholesale electricity in all or parts of 13 states and the District of Columbia, will likely need 110 GW of new generation capacity to keep pace with demand growth and aging retirements.

“Currently, very few states within PJM can produce enough power to meet their own needs, much less export power to other states,” said Governor Morrisey. “West Virginia is one of those states. However, while we are a national leader in per-capita electricity exports, we lack the existing generation capacity to meet future needs.”

Gov. Morrisey explained the four components of the energy policy, which includes the “50 by 50” Generation Policy, a Transmission Policy, an Energy Security Policy, and 25-Year Strategic Development policy for each source of energy in West Virginia.

“The foundation of this policy is Power Generation,” he said. “This plan focuses primarily on baseload generation from coal, natural gas and nuclear. It is critical to our way of life and provides a stable backbone to the grid, ensuring there is always a dependable supply of electricity.”

The governor will work with the West Virginia Legislature, state agencies, and federal partners, as well as members of industry, education, and the public, to achieve these goals. His administration has already engaged the U.S. Department of Energy and partnered with the Oak Ridge National Laboratory to assist with crafting different components of the overall policies.

(AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option, or if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

LENEXA, KAN. (SEPT. 25, 2025) – Today, at a brownfields site in Topeka, Kansas, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Region 7 Administrator Jim Macy presented a $2 million award to the Kansas Department of Health and Environment (KDHE) and a $500,000 award to the city of Topeka in Brownfields Assessment Grants. Macy was joined by Topeka Planning Division Director Dan Warner and KDHE Secretary Janet Stanek.

“We are honored to present funds for Brownfields Assessment Grants to Kansas Department of Health and Environment and the city of Topeka, highlighting their commitment to transforming communities across the Heartland,” Macy said. “This investment underscores the resilience and innovative spirit of the region, where brownfield sites are being revitalized into thriving centers of economic and social activity.”

“I am excited to utilize grant dollars to revitalize areas in Topeka,” said Topeka Mayor Mike Padilla. “It is great to be able to work with different organizations to reinvest in Topeka to create clean new areas for growth.”

“These Community-Wide Grant funds from EPA put Kansas communities in the position to leverage additional funds that will aid in redevelopment, revitalization, and cleanup plans across the state,” Stanek said. “We will be able to support the redevelopment of several Kansas brownfield sites through technical assistance, environmental assessments, and cleanup planning assistance. This not only benefits those individual communities, but it benefits the entire state.”

EPA has selected the City of Topeka for a Brownfields Assessment Grant. In Topeka, Community-Wide Grant funds will be used to conduct eight Phase I and three Phase II environmental site assessments. Grant funds also will be used to inventory brownfields sites and support reuse planning and community engagement activities. The target area for this grant is the City of Topeka, where priority sites include the 36-acre former White Lakes Mall and two former schools.EPA selected KDHE for a Brownfields Community-Wide Assessment Grant for States and Tribes. Grant funds will be used to conduct 116 Phase I and Phase II environmental site assessments, and also will support the development of at least three cleanup plans and at least one community meeting annually with each community to provide general updates on the grant. The Kansas target areas for this grant include the Oak Grove neighborhood in Kansas City and the cities of Eureka and El Dorado. Priority sites include Land Bank properties in Oak Grove; a former horse racetrack, former nursing home, Memorial Hall, former Masonic Lodge, and sites adjacent to the existing fire department to accommodate its expansion in Eureka; and the Grizzly Development in El Dorado.

Background

These grants are part of FY 2025 Brownfields Assessment, Revolving Loan Fund (RLF), Cleanup Grants, and RLF Supplemental Funding announced in May 2025. View the list of selected applicants.

EPA’s Brownfields program began in 1995 and has provided nearly $2.9 billion in Brownfields Grants to assess and cleanup contaminated properties and return blighted properties to productive reuse. To date, brownfields investments have leveraged over $42 billion in cleanup and redevelopment. Over the years, the relatively small investment of federal funding was able to leverage over 220,500 jobs from both public and private sources.

(EAM) has forged a strategic partnership with Phillips 66. The agreement in principle, announced on September 24, secures the supply of critical raw materials for EAM's upcoming 30,000-ton graphite active anode material facility in North Carolina.

The core of the partnership involves Phillips 66 supplying Green and Calcined Needle Coke from its Lake Charles, Louisiana, refinery to EAM. As one of the world's leading producers of specialty cokes, Phillips 66 provides a crucial feedstock for manufacturing synthetic graphite anodes, which are a core component of lithium-ion batteries. This consistent and reliable access to high-quality materials will enable EAM to ramp up production at its new facility, which is poised to become a key player in the U.S. battery materials landscape.

""This collaboration is a major step in building a secure and sustainable battery materials supply chain for the US,"" stated Vikram Handa, Managing Director of Epsilon Advanced Materials. ""Phillips 66’s expertise in energy and materials, combined with EAM’s capacity and global presence, will ensure reliable, scalable, and sustainable graphite anode production to power the EV and ESS industries worldwide."" The agreement reinforces efforts to build a competitive and resilient supply chain for clean energy technologies across multiple regions.

The North Carolina facility, located in Brunswick County, has completed all permitting milestones and is on track to begin operations in 2027. It will initially produce 30,000 tons of graphite active anode material annually, with plans to expand to 60,000 tons by 2030. At full operational capacity, the plant is projected to supply enough material for approximately one million electric vehicles each year, directly supporting U.S. battery manufacturers and automotive original equipment manufacturers (OEMs).

This partnership arrives at a crucial time as the U.S. government and industry leaders prioritize building a robust domestic supply chain to meet the rapidly accelerating demand for EVs and energy storage. By bringing together Phillips 66's operational expertise and EAM's advanced manufacturing capabilities, the agreement not only addresses supply chain vulnerabilities but also promotes economic growth and job creation in the United States.

Which of these American chipmaker’s shares have performed the best this year: A) Nvidia B) Broadcom C) Intel? The answer is C, and it’s not even close despite concerns about its business outlook.

Much of Intel’s appeal with investors appears to be its sale of a stake to the U.S. government, which preceded billions more in announced strategic investments, potentially including from Apple. We break it all down below.

Will Apple get inside Intel?

Intel’s extraordinary agreement last month to sell a stake to the U.S. government set off all kinds of questions about the future of the embattled chipmaker and American-style capitalism in the Trump era.

It’s not clear whether the plan will bolster the Silicon Valley pioneer’s turnaround efforts. But it may prod more investment in Intel by fellow American tech companies, including those trying to stay in President Trump’s good graces.

The latest: Intel’s shares soared on Wednesday (and were up again in premarket trading on Thursday) on reports by Bloomberg and others that the company had held discussions with Apple about a possible investment. The companies have talked multiple times, according to The Times, including before the government agreed to invest $8.9 billion in Intel.

Since then, Nvidia has said it would invest $5 billion in the chipmaker and SoftBank about $2 billion. Other companies are said to be in talks with Intel, too, according to Bloomberg.

The Trump administration has taken a special interest in Intel. In January, months before the deal for a government stake was struck, Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick sounded out TSMC, Intel’s rival, about potentially taking over the American company’s foundry business (which makes chips for other customers) after it was spun off, The Times reports.

Another scenario to help its manufacturing business was to have Apple, Nvidia and other tech companies take stakes in that division.

How would Apple and Intel work together if there’s a deal? The tech giant was once a major Intel customer before it switched MacBooks over to its own line of chips — reportedly over frustration with Intel semiconductor performance — and more broadly has sought to use its own silicon in iPhones, AirPods and more.

Could the two find new ways to collaborate again? One potential way is for Intel to make some of the Apple-designed chips, giving the foundry business a potentially crucial customer. Or Intel could make chips for Apple’s data centers.

Some on Wall Street and in Silicon Valley are wondering about the political angle. Are companies willing to invest in Intel because they’ve bought into the vision of the chipmaker’s C.E.O., Lip-Bu Tan — or is it because they’re seeking favor with the Trump administration?

Recall that Tim Cook of Apple promised last month at a White House event to spend $600 billion domestically to bolster American manufacturing. How would an Intel deal factor into that?

In other Apple news: The tech giant on Thursday asked E.U. antitrust watchdogs to scrap sweeping digital privacy rules, arguing that they could stymie innovation.

HERE’S WHAT’S HAPPENING

Jimmy Kimmel’s return scores big ratings. “Jimmy Kimmel Live!” averaged 6.2 million viewers for its Tuesday episode, according to Nielsen, nearly four times as much as its usual audience. (These are preliminary figures, and do not count streaming numbers.) But Kimmel’s show remains off the air on the roughly 70 ABC affiliates owned by Nexstar and Sinclair, which haven’t said when they would resume airing the program; the question is how long their standoff with Disney will last.

The U.S. prepares to offer Argentina significant financial aid. Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent said that the Trump administration could take steps including offering the Argentine central bank a $20 billion swap line and buying Argentina’s U.S. dollar-denominated bonds. Such moves would help bolster Argentina’s embattled economy, though President Trump said this week that he didn’t think it needed “a bailout.”

The White House warns of mass firings if the government shuts down. The Trump administration told federal agencies to prepare for more layoffs if lawmakers don’t approve a funding deal by next week’s deadline. An impasse remains between the parties, with Trump refusing to meet with Democrats. Some analysts are worried that a shutdown could result in consequences for the economy.

Starbucks plans to close stores and lay off hundreds. The coffee giant’s C.E.O., Brian Niccol, told workers that the company would shut about 1 percent of its North American stores and cut about 900 nonretail jobs. The effort, which Starbucks said would cost about $1 billion, is part of its latest effort to turn around its fortunes.

Exclusive: Using A.I. to catch A.I. song copyright abuse

Music labels have an increasingly complicated relationship with artificial intelligence. The technology can help promote their artists and inspire new kinds of creativity — but, executives and musicians fear, also rip off their work.

The start-up SoundPatrol, whose founders include Michael Ovitz, the former Hollywood superagent and former Disney president, says it has a tool to guard against copyright infringement. And the company has signed up two of the three biggest record labels, Universal Music Group and Sony Music, as partners, Michael de la Merced is first to report.

The backdrop: Artists and labels have argued that A.I.-generated music robs from existing artists, creatively and financially. Universal Music, Sony Music and Warner Records have joined lawsuits against two popular A.I. music generators, Suno and Udio.

“We have to protect our I.P. and our copyrights,” Lucian Grainge, Universal Music’s C.E.O., told DealBook. He added that for his business, music and intellectual property and copyrights are “the blood that runs through its veins.”

The rise of A.I. comes as the music industry recovers from a time of widespread piracy in the early 2000s, with global revenues last year topping the CD-era level of 1999.

How SoundPatrol works: The company uses what it calls “neural fingerprinting,” A.I. technology that can identify distinctive elements of a song — voice, lyrics, melody, chords, timbre and other factors, according to Walter De Brouwer, SoundPatrol’s other founder — and catalogs them. That will help SoundPatrol create a dashboard where customers can see where potential infringement is happening and where it’s coming from, he added.

“For the first time, there will be a trackable, reportable system of I.P. breaches, even if they’re minor,” Ovitz told DealBook. “We can pick up bits and pieces of every song.”

Universal Music and Sony Music will help train SoundPatrol’s systems, giving the start-up access to their libraries. “It’s my job and my duty to do everything I can from my vantage point to make sure that music is protected and monetized and respected,” Grainge told DealBook.

“Our collaboration with SoundPatrol is about respecting artists’ rights to build a sustainable and equitable ecosystem for everyone,” Dennis Kooker, the president of Sony Music’s global digital business, added.

A.I.-generated music is growing in popularity. Just look at the summertime phenomenon that was the Velvet Sundown, a band that amassed more than one million streams on Spotify but was eventually revealed to be an A.I. creation.

Deezer, the French streaming service, recently reported that fully A.I.-generated music now accounted for more than 30,000 of the tracks it receives daily (about 28 percent of total daily song volume). The streaming platform identified up to 70 percent of them as fraudulent, meant just to rack up streams and royalties.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/09/25/multimedia/25db-apple-bfjk/25db-apple-bfjk-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 15:00:58.508266

The report explains that the Maine Department of Environmental Protection gets nearly $11 million in grants from the EPA, which is 22% of its budget and supports about 100 jobs.
The NRCM report outlines “deep cuts” to programs that help pay for wastewater treatment facilities, drinking water infrastructure, air pollution inspection and enforcement and redeveloping polluted industrial sites.","AUGUSTA — Proposed cuts to the Environmental Protection Agency would strip funds from clean water and air programs, limit clean-up of contaminated sites and eliminate climate research, according to a report released Thursday by the Natural Resources Council of Maine.

NRCM and other environmental groups are speaking out against cuts proposed in the House budget bill released in July. The proposal seeks to reduce spending at EPA by about $2 billion, which is a 23% reduction from current levels.

“The proposed cuts represent the most extreme rollback of environmental funding in decades,” Anya Fetcher, NRCM’s federal policy advocate, said during a Thursday press conference at the State House.

The budget also calls for cutting more than 1,200 jobs, according to NRCM.

The report explains that the Maine Department of Environmental Protection gets nearly $11 million in grants from the EPA, which is 22% of its budget and supports about 100 jobs.

“Without question, these cuts would create widespread damage, undermining DEP’s ability to ensure that our water is clean, our air is healthy, and our communities and Maine people are protected from toxic hazards,” according to the report.

Fetcher said the Trump administration originally proposed a 54% cut to EPA, followed by the House proposal at 23% and a Senate budget proposal with a 5% cut.

She said although NRCM would advocate for no reduction in spending, they are encouraged that the draft budget from the Senate Appropriations Committee, which is chaired by Republican Sen. Susan Collins, “largely retains the EPA’s role of protecting health and the environment.”

In response to the report, an EPA spokesperson sent a statement to Spectrum News saying they “are confident” EPA will have enough money to meet its core mission.

“The Trump EPA is committed to being an exceptional steward of taxpayer dollars as we protect human health and the environment, unleash energy dominance, implement permitting reform, make America the AI capital of the world, and bring back the American auto industry,” read the statement from the EPA press office.

In March, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced that the agency would be reconsidering 31 environmental regulations, including those on power plants, the oil and gas industry, emission standards for air pollution and electric vehicle regulations.

“Today, the green new scam ends as the EPA does its part to usher in the golden age of American success,” Zeldin said in a video announcement.

The NRCM report outlines “deep cuts” to programs that help pay for wastewater treatment facilities, drinking water infrastructure, air pollution inspection and enforcement and redeveloping polluted industrial sites.

It says funds would be eliminated for climate change programs that set standards for greenhouse gas pollution and those that work to understand and reduce the risks of climate change.

“Everyone in Maine — and worldwide — will suffer the impacts of this administration’s flagrant disengagement from activities aimed at addressing the threat of climate change,” the report states.

Dr. Sydney Sewall, an Augusta area pediatrician, said during the news conference that he worries about what a reduction in air quality will mean for children.

“Air pollution effects are comparable to the outcomes resulting from maternal smoking where both low birth weight and prematurity become more common,” he said.",https://s7d2.scene7.com/is/image/TWCNews/NRCM_sign_horizontal_ME_0925,N,,2025-09-25 15:01:41.148710

While most folks may be aware of these facts, Donald Trump does not seem to be, or at least chose to ignore them, in his UN rant on Tuesday.
He warned the countries of the world away from wind and solar power and told them to use more oil and natural gas.
The cost of these clean energy sources is already low and getting lower, as is the cost of battery storage.
The point here is that if we want cheap energy, we want clean energy.","The media are often slow to catch up with reality. In decades past we could talk about addressing global warming as a trade-off where we would spend more on energy and cars, in order to avoid destroying the planet. This meant that people who didn’t care about the planet we leave to future generations could argue that it was not worth paying the costs associated with slowing global warming.

But that was in the past. The cost of solar and wing energy has plummeted, as has the cost of electric cars. The cheapest and quickest way to get new energy online is now solar and wind, not building new coal or gas fired power plants. Also, contrary to what our energy secretary seems to believe, there is something called a “battery,” that allows wind and solar energy to be stored for use at times when the wind isn’t blowing and the sun isn’t shining. And new electric cars can be purchased for less than $10,000.

While most folks may be aware of these facts, Donald Trump does not seem to be, or at least chose to ignore them, in his UN rant on Tuesday. He warned the countries of the world away from wind and solar power and told them to use more oil and natural gas.

Trump has never cared much for reality. He may just be looking to pay back his campaign contributors from the fossil fuel industry. But for those interested in the real world, here’s the relative cost of electricity in the United States and China.

We are currently paying more than twice as much for our electricity as China and the gap is likely to increase in the years ahead. Our electricity costs seem almost certain to go higher as Donald Trump’s campaign contributors use massive amounts of electricity for AI and crypto.

The increased demand for these purposes would pose a problem in any case, but with Trump working hard to shut down wind and solar power, the gap between growing demand and stagnating supply is likely to worsen. Meanwhile, China is building up its wind and solar generating capacity at an incredible pace. They already account for more than a quarter of the country’s electricity production. The cost of these clean energy sources is already low and getting lower, as is the cost of battery storage.

The point here is that if we want cheap energy, we want clean energy. This may all be over Donald Trump’s head, but it should not be over the heads of the ostensibly serious people who tell us that people care about “affordability,” not climate change.

Clean energy is affordability and anyone who doesn’t acknowledge that fact should be assumed to be on the payroll of the fossil fuel industry or looking for a job in the Trump administration.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/BTP_Climate_Clean_Energy.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 18:01:26.452062

(AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Louisiana residents, meanwhile, face higher bills and foregone public revenues to support the data centers.
Some states are trying to lure corporations that own data centers by offering massive tax breaks—what experts call “a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to shareholders,” according to MediaJustice.
“Our fight here in New Orleans against dangerous facial recognition tech is the same fight against data centers,” the spokesperson said.","A new report warns that Big Tech’s rapid buildout of data centers across the South could usher in a new wave of environmental and economic harms for Black and working-class communities, drawing parallels to Louisiana’s infamous Cancer Alley, the infamous span of petrochemical plants belching toxic smoke.

“Today, Big Tech is following in the footsteps of Big Oil, as they deliberately build data centers in the South, banking on disempowered cities and towns with large Black populations to not have the local power to fight back,” writes grassroots coalition MediaJustice.

There are more than $200 billion planned or ongoing data center projects across Louisiana, Mississippi, Georgia, the Carolinas, Tennessee, Virginia, and the rest of the South, according to the MediaJustice’s new report, “The People Say No: Resisting Data Centers in the South.”

The buildout of high-tech data centers, framed as “progress” by companies like Meta, Amazon, Google, and Microsoft, will leave residents with higher utility bills, water scarcity, and increased pollution in the long haul, advocates warn.

Louisiana at the Epicenter

Louisiana is emerging as a new flashpoint in the South.

Entergy will use three new methane-gas plants to power Meta’s biggest data center yet, the $10 billion Hyperion project in Richland Parish, in northeastern Louisiana, according to the report. State regulators have already approved new Entergy infrastructure to support the facility, which is now under construction.

Still, grave environmental concerns remain.

“This is not just about building warehouses full of computers,” said Davante Lewis, a member of the Louisiana Public Service Commission who cast the sole vote against Entergy’s plans to power the Richland Parish data center. “The real health risks come from the utilities rushing to build more gas plants and delaying renewable energy commitments,” he said. “That locks our communities into decades of pollution and higher bills.”

Currently, there are 10 operation data centers in Louisiana, with 4 more under construction and about eight more scheduled for the future, according to Arterio, a data analytics company. It’s estimated that the data center load will increase Entergy’s electrical needs by 30%.

The expansion deepens environmental injustice, critics say, especially in majority-Black and working-class communities already burdened by petrochemical plants. Along Cancer Alley, for instance, cancer risks soar to 50 times the national average in some parishes.

Hidden Costs: Energy, Water, and Transparency

Data centers demand staggering energy and water resources, as described within the report:

In 2023, data centers consumed about 4.4% of U.S. electricity. They are projected to reach 7–12% by 2028, according to a December 2024 report from the U.S. Department of Energy. About 56% of that will be powered by fossil fuels.

In South Carolina, regulators approved a discounted rate for the Google corporation, which pays less than half the rate of residential customers while accounting for the bulk of new energy demand.

These deals are frequently negotiated under nondisclosure agreements. In Bessemer, Alabama, $14.5 billion in farmland was rezoned without public notice. “These companies are undermining democracy by negotiating in secret and keeping our communities in the dark,” the report contends.

To cool data-center servers, facilities also may require millions of gallons each day. A proposed center in Georgia could consume nine million gallons a day—a third of one county’s entire water supply. Once used, much of the cooling water used in data centers is lost to evaporation with limited volumes returned to the water supply, WABE TV reported.

Few Jobs, Big Subsidies

Despite billion-dollar price tags, most data-center sites employ fewer than 150 workers.. Because of the massive size of the data center currently being built at Hyperion in Richland Parish, Louisiana is projecting roughly 500 new workers will be hired. That creates high hopes.

The data center, said Public Service Commissioner Foster Campbell, “will be as important to North Louisiana as the Superdome is to New Orleans.”

The reality is that data-center specialists are typically recruited from out of the state, researchers have found. Louisiana residents, meanwhile, face higher bills and foregone public revenues to support the data centers. Some states are trying to lure corporations that own data centers by offering massive tax breaks—what experts call “a transfer of wealth from taxpayers to shareholders,” according to MediaJustice.

“We have to be honest,” said Lewis, the commissioner. “Most of these jobs are not going to local people. And we’re sacrificing long-term community needs for short-term promises that rarely materialize.”

Grassroots Resistance Increasing

Communities across the South are beginning to push back. Between May 2024 and March 2025, activists delayed or blocked $64 billion worth of data center projects in Virginia, Georgia, North Carolina, and Alabama, according to the report.

In Louisiana, environmental advocates warn that without strong resistance, new projects could cement the state as a digital “sacrifice zone,” a familiar term to the poor communities in the South that often shoulder pollution and other industry burdens.

“Not all economic development is good economic development,” Lewis said. “We need community benefit agreements.”

The state’s residents could end up paying “hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars” in costs associated with powering the Richland Parish data center, an analysis by Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis (IEEFA) concluded.

A Legacy Repeating

From cotton plantations to petrochemicals, Louisiana has long been treated as a resource colony. say critics who characterize data centers as a form of digital colonialism—extracting land, water, and power for Big Tech’s global ambitions while leaving locals behind.

A spokesperson with Eyes on Surveillance, a New Orleans-based advocacy group, made the following statement to MediaJustice in the report:

“We have to realize that at the core of the expansion of data centers and AI facial recognition, we find Big Tech profiting from the suffering and destruction of the livelihoods of people of color.”

The group also sees a connection between the technological buildup and excessive police surveillance.

“Our fight here in New Orleans against dangerous facial recognition tech is the same fight against data centers,” the spokesperson said. “Facial recognition requires data centers to exist, so we have a system of racist technology that destroys our lives through criminalization and over-policing, through the polluting of our water and air, through the depletion of our resources, and ultimately, through the dehumanization of our lives.”

The South knows this story well. The question is whether the region will allow another chapter of exploitation—or whether resistance can turn the page toward something different, data-center critics say.

Though Lewis at the moment stands as the sole critic on this issue on the public-service commission, he still believes that a broader pushback could materialize — if people begin to see it as a way to safeguard the area’s future, in case the AI bubble bursts, as some predict it will.

If that happens, opponents say, it would be easy for Meta to take a $10 million loss and walk away, leaving the data-center project as a burden on local taxpayers.

“We can’t just be blinded by the shiny moment,” Lewis said. “These industries promise tax revenue and jobs, but 15 or 20 years from now, what will the real cost be to our communities? A $10 billion loss might sound huge to us, but to (Meta CEO) Mark Zuckerberg, it’s like buying a round of drinks at the bar.”

The announcement, made by Centrus Energy, along with Ohio Governor Mike DeWine, Ohio Senator Jon Husted and Congressperson Dave Taylor, JobsOhio, and Ohio Southeast Economic Development, said the expansion is expected to create 1,000 construction jobs and 300 new operations jobs at the Piketon site, while retaining 127 existing jobs, boosting Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) and High-Assay, Low-Enriched Uranium (HALEU) production.

Funding for the project, however, has not yet been determined, which will go a long way in determining the size and scope of the expansion.

Centrus has raised more than $1.2 billion in a pair of convertible note transactions over the last 12 months, JobsOhio said, and has secured more than $2 billion in contingent purchase commitments from utility customers in the United States and around the world.

“We are planning a historic, multi-billion-dollar investment right here in Ohio – supported by a nationwide supply chain to do just that,” Centrus CEO Amir Vexler said in the statement.

The project is also expected to support hundreds of jobs at Centrus’ centrifuge manufacturing plant in Tennessee and throughout its manufacturing supply chain – which is entirely domestic – along with thousands of indirect jobs in Ohio, Tennessee, and across the country.

By Laila Kearney and Timothy Gardner

NEW YORK (Reuters) -The administration of U.S. President Donald Trump expects most of the nation's coal-fired power plants to delay retirement to help deliver the vast amount of electricity needed to fuel artificial intelligence, Energy Secretary Chris Wright told Reuters on Thursday.

Keeping those often half-century-old coal plants running is part of a broader strategy to increase the country's power output that will also include boosting nuclear energy and allowing backup power plants to operate around the clock.

The administration has made expanding energy production a top priority while rejecting concerns about climate change, which Trump told the United Nations this week amounted to a global ""con job.""

""Energy sobriety has returned to Washington, D.C. Our focus is on Americans and the price of utility and avoiding blackouts,"" Wright said at a Reuters Newsmaker event. ""We've got to stop existing firm capacity from retirement.""

The government had been in discussions with many utilities nationwide and expects the majority of the several dozen U.S. coal plants nearing retirement to delay closure, he said.

""I would say the majority of that coal capacity will stay online,"" he added.

The administration is also prepared to use its emergency powers to extend the life of coal-fired plants, he said.

Last month, Wright extended his emergency order to keep a Michigan coal plant running, even though the plant's operator had been planning to shut permanently for economic reasons.

The Energy Department also ordered a gas and oil-fired power plant, slated for retirement in Pennsylvania, to continue operating.

Wright said more plants should expect similar orders, which fall under grid stability provisions in the Federal Power Act.

""Absolutely, absolutely. Yeah, that's not the only one,"" Wright said.

Wright said the U.S. would also aim to get more out of the existing grid by running backup generators and standby power plants continuously, rather than just when electricity demand surges.

The White House is also seeking to boost nuclear energy, including through regulatory reforms to speed permitting and by hosting new nuclear technologies through the Department of Energy.

""We need that industry as another source of energy, and so we're going to give temporary nudges to get it started,"" Wright said.

Currently, two shut U.S. nuclear power plants - including one on Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania - are in the unprecedented process of being restarted. Three Mile Island, dubbed the Crane Clean Energy Center, would deliver electricity for Microsoft data centers.

Total U.S. electricity demand is projected to hit record highs this year and next, according to the Energy Information Administration. Growth in the country's power consumption will also continue to accelerate through the end of the decade as massive AI data center campuses power up.

The global race by countries, primarily the U.S. and China, to dominate AI will depend largely on connecting new electricity supplies, the Trump administration has said.

China built 100 gigawatts of coal-fired power last year and another 100 gigawatts are under construction, Wright said.

""Right now, it doesn't matter what China says about climate policy,"" Wright said. ""They're growing their electricity, they're building their industrial might, and they're saying: please keep sending us your industry.""

The Department of Energy, this year, also opened federal land for the development of power plants and data centers.

So far, the department has received some 300 inquiries, Wright said.

Why it matters: The newly available comments show how the Trump administration's pullback of climate policies threatens the electric vehicle maker.

The company's sharp divide with the administration also follows the collapse of CEO Elon Musk and President Trump's alliance.

Driving the news: Tesla is among the many respondents to the Environmental Protection Agency's proposal to repeal the 2009 ""endangerment finding"" that greenhouse gases from vehicles threaten human health and welfare.

The formal finding provides the legal basis for regulating CO2 emissions from cars and trucks, and — by extension — some other big sources.

Tesla's comments also oppose EPA's related plan to do away with any emissions rules for cars and trucks.

Threat level: ""The Endangerment Finding — and the vehicle emissions standards which flow from it — have provided a stable regulatory platform for Tesla's extensive investments in product development and production,"" Tesla states.

The 2009 finding is legal and ""based on a robust factual and scientific record,"" Tesla's Monday comments now available in EPA's regulatory docket state.

The other side: EPA in August issued the proposal that Administrator Lee Zeldin called ""basically driving a dagger into the heart of the climate change religion.""

The plan makes a suite of legal and scientific arguments on the finding and tailpipe rules (many that are sharply contested), alleging that EPA ""unreasonably analyzed the scientific record"" in the 2009 decision.

They include claims that Supreme Court decisions in 2022 and 2024, which limited what executive agencies can do without explicit congressional blessing, warrant reconsideration of the policies.

The bottom line: ""While Tesla believes that the current regulation establishing the standards is overly complex and could be streamlined to make it less burdensome, we do, nonetheless, recognize EPA's authority and obligation to establish greenhouse gas standards for motor vehicles,"" Tesla's comments state.",https://images.axios.com/_dp6fKy7h8BdzVMqmcrVbA1sQzo=/0x0:5300x2981/1366x768/2025/09/25/1758819178378.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:32.420995
,American Energy,2025-09-25 17:32:02+00:00,The Journal Record,U.S. faces electricity challenge as AI energy demand soars - The Journal Record,Chip Minty,,,,,https://journalrecord.com/2025/09/25/ai-energy-demand-us-power-challenges/,"Wind and solar energy can play a role, but inconsistent production limits their ability to meet spikes in power demand.
So, it is no surprise that Hamm Institute Executive Director Bluntzer Pullin is leading a national call to action through its American Energy + AI Initiative.
She hopes to underscore emerging priorities and highlight the speed and scale that will be required to keep U.S. power production capacity on pace with the rapid advance of AI energy demands.
But he’s not so sure the nation can build enough nuclear reactors to meet the government’s target.
Through our American Energy + AI Initiative, we’re pulling industry, government, and technology leaders to the same table to cut through red tape and move projects forward,” she said.","They say that artificial intelligence (AI) will be the most transformative technological development ever. Pick any revolutionary advancement you can think of — the Internet, smartphones, air travel, automobiles, the conveyor belt. You can go back as far as fire itself, and experts say AI has a chance to outshine them all.

As a consequence, there’s an international winner-take-all race to supremacy underway that involves the United States, China and Europe, and the victor stands to emerge at the top of the world’s economic pecking order.

Much is at stake as industry and institutions are ramping up microchip production, data center construction and educational programs customized to a new AI economy. But behind the billions of dollars in technology infrastructure investment, policymakers and industry visionaries still don’t know if the United States will have enough electricity available to feed the AI behemoth once it reaches maturity.

No one is quite sure how much more electricity the United States will need, but estimates suggest the nation’s emerging AI machine could demand 60 gigawatts or more within the next couple of years. That volume far exceeds the needs of major U.S. cities, such as New York.

Adding that much power to the grid will be no small undertaking, experts say, especially for a nation that has focused the last quarter century on a clean energy transition that still is looking for traction. Wind and solar energy can play a role, but inconsistent production limits their ability to meet spikes in power demand.

So, what’s left? No one is talking about coal. That leaves natural gas to carry the burden. And then there’s nuclear, an emerging darling of the power industry, winning bipartisan support from policymakers who are now willing to set aside the 1979 Three Mile Island disaster, which practically paralyzed the industry for decades.

The Oklahoma City-based Hamm Institute for American Energy has made the issue one of its core concerns, bringing leaders together from across the United States and from key international trading partners, such as Japan and South Korea.

“The United States has the resources it needs. What it lacks is speed, certainty and alignment,” said Ann Bluntzer Pullin, executive director of the Hamm Institute. “This initiative is about turning urgency into action so that America and its allies can lead in both energy and AI.”

“I feel like you’ve got these two giants, the tech industry and the energy industry at this unbelievable moment in time where they can both rise to the occasion and literally move society forward in a way where everyone’s quality of life goes up,” she told leaders at a recent roundtable event.

There’s a growing number of AI systems housed in an expanding network of data centers, which store, process and manage critical data and their applications. The giant facilities’ large assemblies of servers, storage drives and other hardware are known for their enormous appetite for electricity.

Skyrocketing power needs

More than 50 new data center construction projects are currently being planned across the U.S., said Mark Mills, executive director of the Washington-based National Center for Energy Analytics. And construction permit applications show they will require an additional 60 gigawatts of power generation capacity between now and 2030, with that number expected to double.

To put that into perspective, New York City requires about 40 gigawatts of power, according to the city’s long-term energy plan.

In a recent article in City Journal, Mills cited an IEA study that suggests a single large data center can use as much electricity as two million households.

“Lighting up digital infrastructure soon will entail demand equivalent to reliably powering hundreds of millions of new households,” Mills wrote in June.

So, it is no surprise that Hamm Institute Executive Director Bluntzer Pullin is leading a national call to action through its American Energy + AI Initiative. She hopes to underscore emerging priorities and highlight the speed and scale that will be required to keep U.S. power production capacity on pace with the rapid advance of AI energy demands.

While it may be encouraging to know conversations are underway in the Oil Patch and in Washington, the only certainty experts at the Hamm Institute and elsewhere seem to land on is that a solution to a potential energy shortage is fraught with barriers. Skilled labor shortages, regulatory obstacles, and technological limitations are just a few of the problems.

For example, natural gas seems to be the obvious solution. It is plentiful and easily accessible in the U.S. So, why not just crank up gas production and build more power plants?

It’s not that simple, according to Takajiro Ishikawa, the chief executive officer of Mitsubishi Heavy Industries in Japan, one of the few companies that manufacture the giant turbans used in natural gas-fired power plants.

While the U.S. may have the fuel, Ishikawa says a major U.S. buildout of gas power plants could stretch his industry beyond its current capacity. And manufacturers are not likely to invest in additional capacity to meet a demand surge that may not last. Besides, Ishikawa does not believe the U.S. has a large enough skilled labor force to build the number of plants necessary to bridge the gap.

The nuclear option

Policymakers are also looking to nuclear power as a solution, and long-time nuclear scientist Christo Liebenberg is seizing the moment he’s been waiting for his entire career. He is president of LIS Technologies, based near Oak Ridge National Laboratories in Tennessee, and his company is a candidate to win hundreds of millions in research funding to bring his company’s uranium enrichment technology to industrial scale.

Despite projections that global demand for enriched uranium will rise by 500% by 2030, the U.S. still lacks commercial-scale enrichment capabilities, Liebenberg said from his office in Oak Ridge. As a result, the U.S. continues to import around 20% of its nuclear fuel from Russia – even in the midst of Russia’s war in Ukraine.

To address the vulnerability, the U.S. Department of Energy has committed $3.4 billion to rebuild the country’s domestic uranium supply chain by selected six companies for its program, including LIS Technologies.

Liebenberg says he’s confident his company can scale its patented laser-based uranium enrichment technology, and he knows it will help restore America’s nuclear fuel independence. But he’s not so sure the nation can build enough nuclear reactors to meet the government’s target.

The Trump administration wants to quadruple the nation’s nuclear power generation capacity from 100 gigawatts to 400 gigawatts within 25 years, Liebenberg said.

“That’s a big goal,” he says. “There’s a mixture of technologies that have to come together. That’s the only way to quadruple nuclear power. You’re going to have to dramatically increase the number of light water reactors in this country. There are 94 of them.”

It takes about seven years just to build one, so under the current process, it could take 1,800 years to build 400 light water reactors in the U.S., Liebenberg said.

“We don’t have that much time,” he said. “We only have 25 years, so the only solution is to ramp up production rapidly but also bring online the next generation of reactors to supplement the light water big reactors.”

“We’ll need a mixture of big light water reactors plus all the small modular reactors and then bring online thousands of modular micro reactors. That’s the only way we’re going to be able to quadruple nuclear power by 2050.”

Some people say that’s impossible, Liebenberg said.

“But my mindset is ‘Let’s make it happen.’ It’s been my slogan all my life. We just have to do our humble part in producing as much nuclear fuel as we can so we can fuel all those reactors.”

The Hamm Institute’s Bluntzer Pullin said AI is on a scale that the world has never seen before, and it will require all viable sources of energy.

“This is critical to the future of our nation, and we have to move quickly. Through our American Energy + AI Initiative, we’re pulling industry, government, and technology leaders to the same table to cut through red tape and move projects forward,” she said.

“America isn’t short on energy, pioneers or innovators. We will have the energy, we just need the systems to deliver it,” she said. “If America doubles down on firm energy and builds the infrastructure to match, we can power this wave of innovation and lead the race for AI without sacrificing energy security.”",https://journalrecord.com/files/2025/09/09-26-AIracePage-2-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 15:01:28.372863

In the absence of federal cleanup standards for per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (“PFAS”) in groundwater, several states have started the process of regulating PFAS in groundwater themselves. As a result, states have adopted a patchwork of regulations and guidance standards that present significant compliance challenges to impacted industries. This client alert explores the current landscape of state regulations regarding the advisory, notification, and cleanup levels for PFAS – typically perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (“PFOS”) and perfluorooctanoic acid (”PFOA”) – in groundwater.

FEDERAL REGULATIONS

In 2019, the United States Environmental Protection Agency (“EPA”) issued interim recommendations to address groundwater contaminated with PFOA and PFOS, but that guidance was subsequently rescinded. Although EPA concluded that the interim recommendation “no longer reflects the best, currently available science,” the fact sheet discussing the 2019 interim recommendations is still a helpful resource to understand how EPA was evaluating the issue at that time.

With respect to PFAS substances in drinking water, in May 2025, EPA affirmed Maximum Contaminant Levels (“MCLs”) of 4 parts per trillion (“ppt”) for two PFAS substances, PFOA and PFOS. For additional information regarding the drinking water standards, refer to BCLP’s recent insight. As of the date of publication, it is unclear how the PFAS drinking water standards will influence any federal PFAS groundwater standards.

STATE REGULATIONS

The snapshot provided below is current as of September 12, 2025, but it is important to note that this is a developing regulatory space. Some states, such as Florida, have indicated that they will revise groundwater regulations for various PFAS substances that may take effect soon. Other states, such as Arizona, have proposed bills addressing groundwater remediation; other states, such as Illinois, have enacted bills requiring the creation of MCLs in the future.

Businesses should consider whether they currently use or discharge any PFAS compounds that may reach groundwater and evaluate if any state regulations apply, particularly if they operate in any of the jurisdictions listed below. In addition, owners of property with legacy PFAS use, and prospective purchasers of commercial and industrial properties, should review the most current groundwater quality standards as part of the due diligence process for real property transactions.

The information provided below is solely focused on groundwater regulations and does not discuss drinking water regulations, sampling protocols, or the testing requirements for Public Water Systems in various states.

NOTIFICATION

A corporate representative must inform the appropriate state official that the groundwater is above the stated limit.

ADVISORY

These levels are not binding limits, but they can serve as the basis for regulatory action, and are a useful tool for due diligence and risk assessment.

CLEAN UP

Investigation and remediation is usually required when concentration levels exceed the clean up threshold. This is usually expressed by groundwater quality standards that identify specific clean up criteria.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

One of the most striking features of the regulatory landscape for PFAS in groundwater is the wide range of regulatory concentration levels. For example, for PFAS substances in groundwater, one of the most stringent concentration limits is 0.000014 ppt (Iowa; PFDA only), and one of the most lenient concentration limits is 870,000 ppt (California; PFHpA only). The following chart demonstrates that even for PFOA and PFOS, which have been more extensively studied and regulated than other PFAS compounds, there is still a wide discrepancy in the values that different states have adopted.

CONCLUSION

Businesses operating in the states where groundwater regulations have already been enacted should consider whether they currently use or discharge any of the regulated PFAS compounds. In addition, owners of property with legacy PFAS use, and prospective purchasers of commercial and industrial properties in these jurisdictions will increasingly need to incorporate the groundwater quality standards into their due diligence processes.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.15569_1953.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 15:02:17.258041
,American Energy,2025-09-25 17:09:46+00:00,Forbes,"Without Subsidies, U.S. Solar Energy Must Shine On Its Own Merits - Forbes",Ariel Cohen,,,,,https://www.forbes.com/sites/arielcohen/2025/09/25/without-subsidies-us-solar-energy-must-shine-on-its-own-merits/,"The Energy Information Administration reports that about 33 of the roughly 64 gigawatts of new U.S. electric generating capacity planned for 2025 will be solar.
The Solar Industry’s Continued Growth in the U.S. Current statistics show the solar industry weathering changes fairly well.
Sun, open land, expedited permitting, and rapidly rising load demand from industrial growth and data centers create the combined conditions to push solar projects forward even without relying on government subsidies.
Investment in battery storage production and technology is one of the main reasons solar has continued to grow.
If the solar industry was mostly propped up by federal subsidies, a rapid federal pullback would show up quickly in shrinking annual additions and numerous cancelled projects.","President Trump has repeatedly criticized solar and wind, most recently in at the U.N. General Assembly, calling them “a joke” and the “scam of the century.” Congressional Republicans passed the One Big, Beautiful Bill, which put the brakes on federal clean energy subsidies by terminating investment and production tax credits for wind and solar projects not in service by the end of 2027, with a “beginning of construction” deadline of July 4, 2026.

A lack of federal support, and in some cases, politically motivated hostility, has caused many to declare that renewables as a source of energy in the United States are on the decline, and China’s rise as the driving force in the green energy space.

However, the U.S. situation is not as bleak as some might suggest. One might expect a decline in an industry that has recently lost significant federal support, but so far, the opposite has been happening. The Energy Information Administration reports that about 33 of the roughly 64 gigawatts of new U.S. electric generating capacity planned for 2025 will be solar. Also of interest are U.S.-based firms working on potentially higher-efficiency, lower-cost technologies. While “picking winners” among these could prove disappointing, one or two successful technological disruptions could transform the U.S. position in this competitive arena. Far from a sector on life support, the solar industry is growing, but it will need to adapt to the new political and economic environment if it is to continue making progress. Without extensive subsidization, only the strongest will survive.

The Solar Industry’s Continued Growth in the U.S.

Current statistics show the solar industry weathering changes fairly well. In 2024, developers added about 30 gigawatts of utility-scale solar, making up roughly 61% of total capacity additions. In 2025, that share is expected to drop to around 50 percent, but the total amount will increase to approximately 33 gigawatts.

A recent report from the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory indicates that the majority of proposed electric power plants in the U.S. in the queue to undergo impact studies prior to construction are solar (1,086 GW out of the 1,480 GW of combined renewable, nuclear, and hydropower generating capacity seeking transmission access). Though it may be out of favor in Washington, this makes solar a primary candidate to address rising electricity demand in the near term.

The Texas energy market explains much of this resilience. Sunny Texas has become the country’s solar leader, having already surpassed California in large-scale capacity in 2024. The Lone Star State is now expected to add about 9.7 gigawatts more in the second half of 2025 alone. Sun, open land, expedited permitting, and rapidly rising load demand from industrial growth and data centers create the combined conditions to push solar projects forward even without relying on government subsidies. That mix makes projects less risky to finance and build, which is part of the reason Texas continues to lead the nation in new solar capacity.

The Solar Industry Must Be Prepared to Meet Challenges

The actual test of solar’s resilience will come in the next year, as OBBB provisions heavily impact the qualifications for solar and wind tax credits, requiring projects to start construction by July 5th, 2026, or be placed in service by the end of 2027. These changes reflect a significant tightening of timelines that may not be able to accommodate all comers. An FTI Consulting report notes that 11% of solar and wind projects expected to go online between 2026 and 2029 will be impacted by these measures, increasing to 43% of projects between 2030 and 2034. Leaders in the industry like Enphase and NextEra are already weathering impacts from these measures but are looking to adapt.

Corporate demand and private investment in solar are also quietly driving its continued growth. Data centers and large commercial buyers are locking in long-duration power purchase agreements that value predictable delivery. The Clean Investment Monitor reported that U.S. clean energy investment reached $67.3 billion in Q1 2025, a nearly 7% increase over the same period in 2024, but also a 3.8% decrease from the previous quarter. It is too early to judge the full impact of reduced federal support. However, one reason momentum is holding is simple: utility-scale solar remains among the cheapest new sources of electricity in the United States.

Investment in battery storage production and technology is one of the main reasons solar has continued to grow. Battery storage is a force multiplier for the industry, enabling solar to make daytime generation more valuable by allowing output to continue into the evening. Developers are increasingly pairing storage with new solar projects so that they can deliver firm blocks of power that fit buyer schedules. That flexibility converts more solar output into higher-value electricity and provides financiers with clearer revenue streams. Although battery storage is expected to increase under the OBBB, this may not be enough to offset reduced investor confidence in solar energy, especially since energy sources like nuclear energy and natural gas can reliably generate power throughout the entire day. While it is impossible to predict the relative per-MW costs of solar plus battery storage projects versus nuclear and gas with 100% accuracy in this rapidly changing landscape, Lazard’s 2025 Levelized Cost of Energy+ report, notes, “Renewables Remain Competitive: on an unsubsidized $/MWh basis, renewable energy remains the most cost-competitive form of generation. As such, renewable energy will continue to play a key role in the buildout of new power generation in the U.S. This is particularly true in the current high power demand environment, where renewables stand out as both the lowest-cost and quickest-to-deploy generation resource.”

The U.S. Energy Information Administration’s April 2025 report, Levelized Costs of New Generation Resources in the Annual Energy Outlook 2025, draws similar conclusions, “Solar PV LCOE is lower than natural gas combined-cycle LCOE on average and, in most regions, even without the tax recredit.”

Caveat – at this stage, it is not possible to completely factor in what may prove to be the chilling effect of withdrawing government subsidization through tax breaks will have to access to capital for solar projects, especially in certain regions of the country that lack the advantage of near-daily extensive solar exposure.

Potential Technological Disruptors in the Works?

All of the above projections are based on the current technologies dominating the renewables. While an exhaustive survey of what tomorrow could potentially bring would be beyond the scope of this brief report, it is worth noting that there are U.S.-based firms working to bring potentially disruptive technologies to the field. A few of these include Form Energy (working on longer-term battery storage with next-gen iron-air battery systems); Ambri (a Massachusetts Institute of Technology spinout that recently emerged from Chapter 11 and is driving forward its long-duration next-gen Liquid Metal™ Battery Cells, for which it just achieved UL 1973 safety certification); Swift Solar (developing perovskite tandem solar tech – perovskite is still only a tiny slice of the solar energy market, but that may change as the field continues to develop and alternatives to the current dominance of silicon-based technology come on line).

If the solar industry was mostly propped up by federal subsidies, a rapid federal pullback would show up quickly in shrinking annual additions and numerous cancelled projects. Instead, the near-term data point to a potential maturing of the industry, where weak links shake out but more efficient and flexible enterprises and projects that can offer what the market really needs at competitive prices, survive and even thrive.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/68d569c95012726d8fbbafdf/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:15.196133

Tesla’s Cost-Per-Mile Dominance Emerges The impending removal of U.S. EV tax credits, anticipated under shifting policy priorities, could exacerbate this divide.
Without subsidies, legacy automakers’ EVs become even less competitive on price, while Tesla’s vertically integrated model allows profitability at lower margins.
A 2025 article in The Autopian even dubbed Tesla the new “legacy” automaker for its established EV dominance, inverting the traditional narrative.
As Mesbahi puts it, “the train is off the tracks”—but for legacy auto, not the EV revolution.","As the automotive industry grapples with a pivotal transition, legacy carmakers are increasingly retreating from ambitious electric vehicle (EV) plans, a move that underscores deep-seated challenges in adapting to a battery-powered future. Recent announcements from companies like Porsche and Bentley, part of the Volkswagen Group, highlight this pullback, with reports indicating a shift toward maintaining internal combustion engine (ICE) lineups amid softening EV demand. According to a post on X by Tesla enthusiast Farzad Mesbahi, known as @farzyness, this retreat is not a sign of EVs’ failure but rather legacy auto’s inability to profitably compete in the space.

This narrative shift comes as no surprise to industry observers. For years, the promise of fierce competition against Tesla Inc. dominated headlines, yet many traditional manufacturers have struggled with high production costs, supply chain disruptions, and consumer hesitancy. A 2023 article in CleanTechnica detailed how legacy automakers face “angst over EVs” due to factors like outdated manufacturing processes and reluctance to fully commit to electrification, leading to delays in model launches and scaled-back investments.

The Mirage of Competition and Its Unraveling

Far from validating skeptics who claim EVs are a bust, this withdrawal hands Tesla a significant edge, particularly in autonomy and operational efficiency. Mesbahi’s analysis points out that by clinging to ICE vehicles, legacy players are effectively forfeiting the race in self-driving technology. Electric drivetrains offer inherent advantages for autonomous systems, such as instant torque for precise maneuvers, lower idling costs, and reduced maintenance—qualities that ICE engines simply can’t match without complex adaptations.

Supporting this view, a Reuters report from June 2025 warns that Chinese EV giants like BYD are surging ahead in self-driving capabilities, threatening Tesla’s lead globally, but in the U.S., Tesla’s focus on software like Full Self-Driving (FSD) remains unmatched. Business Insider echoed this in a 2020 piece, noting Tesla’s software prowess gives it “years ahead” of competitors, a gap that widens as others deprioritize EVs.

Tesla’s Cost-Per-Mile Dominance Emerges

The impending removal of U.S. EV tax credits, anticipated under shifting policy priorities, could exacerbate this divide. Without subsidies, legacy automakers’ EVs become even less competitive on price, while Tesla’s vertically integrated model allows profitability at lower margins. Mesbahi argues that Tesla now boasts the “lowest cost per mile of operation” with superior safety and autonomy, even post-credit era—a claim bolstered by Tesla’s own manufacturing innovations outlined in a 2023 The Driven article, which described plans to halve EV production costs through paradigm-shifting techniques.

Industry data from MDPI’s 2025 study on Tesla’s U.S. market share decline—ironically due to rising competition—still affirms Tesla’s first-mover advantages in battery tech and autonomy. As legacy firms like General Motors pivot to higher-end EVs or delay mass-market models, as noted in a 2024 Autoevolution piece, they leave a vacuum that Tesla and nimble players like Rivian or Hyundai are poised to fill.

Autonomy as the Ultimate Differentiator

At the heart of this dynamic is autonomy’s role in reshaping mobility economics. ICE vehicles, with their mechanical complexities, are ill-suited for the always-on demands of robotaxis or fleet operations. Tesla’s Optimus and Cybercab initiatives, teased in recent earnings calls, leverage EV efficiencies for what could be transformative cost savings. A Teslarati article from 2020 highlighted how Tesla’s battery lead embarrasses legacy auto, a disparity that’s only grown.

Critics may spin this as EVs’ downfall, but insiders see it as legacy auto’s capitulation. Posts on X from users like Mesbahi, including one from July 2024 lamenting legacy’s unwillingness to invest in affordable EVs, reflect a sentiment that Tesla’s path to dominance is clearing. As a 2021 GLG Insights piece pondered whether legacy companies could catch Tesla, the answer increasingly seems no—especially with autonomy tilting the scales.

Implications for the Broader Industry Shift

This retreat risks stranding billions in ICE-related assets, as warned in a 2021 Teslarati analysis of Tesla’s manufacturing edge over “stranded assets” in legacy production. Meanwhile, Tesla’s software updates and data collection from millions of miles driven provide an unassailable moat. A 2025 article in The Autopian even dubbed Tesla the new “legacy” automaker for its established EV dominance, inverting the traditional narrative.

Ultimately, while media may decry EVs’ viability, the reality is a strategic surrender by incumbents unable to innovate profitably. Tesla, unburdened by ICE legacies, stands to capitalize on autonomy’s promise, potentially revolutionizing transportation with unbeatable efficiency and safety. As Mesbahi puts it, “the train is off the tracks”—but for legacy auto, not the EV revolution.",https://www.webpronews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/xai-tmp-imgen-1a62d60d-5aa8-4f95-8755-edd2a0b49e3d.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 15:01:14.509277

Last year, the Power Authority allocated $25 million for workforce development funding, demonstrating its strong commitment to building a skilled labor force for New York's clean energy future.
NYPA will continue to support workforce training initiatives to support New York’s workforce and meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.
This is about more than clean energy it’s about dignity, equity, and making sure every New Yorker has a fair shot at the future we are building together.”","Today, during Climate Week, Governor Kathy Hochul announced $16 million in state funds to support the development of New York’s clean energy workforce. The New York Power Authority (NYPA) approved $12 million in funding to the New York State Department of Labor (NYSDOL) to support workforce training and retraining, and to prepare workers for employment in clean energy careers. Additionally, the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) awarded $4 million in grant funding to support skills training for green jobs for young New Yorkers.

“As we transition to a clean energy future, it is essential that we equip New Yorkers with the skills and opportunities necessary to thrive in this evolving industry,” Governor Hochul said. “By investing in education and training programs, we are positioning New York’s workforce to lead the way in developing sustainable energy solutions that will spur economic growth and lead us to a cleaner, healthier environment.”

Of the $12 million in funding approved by the NYPA Board of Trustees, $7 million will support the expansion and development of electric vehicle (EV) training programs specializing in maintenance and repair for vehicles and charging stations. The remaining $5 million will be allocated to the NYSDOL Support Services Fund, which strengthens the availability of supportive services for participants enrolled in a clean energy training program, including but not limited to childcare, transportation, student fees and books.

The NYPA funding stems from a commitment in the 2023-24 Enacted State Budget and will largely support the efforts of the New York State Department of Labor through their Office of Just Energy Transition (OJET) to connect workers to opportunities for jobs in the clean energy economy through upskilling and training with a focus on serving those who are traditionally underrepresented, especially within disadvantaged communities.

Last year, the Power Authority allocated $25 million for workforce development funding, demonstrating its strong commitment to building a skilled labor force for New York's clean energy future. NYPA will continue to support workforce training initiatives to support New York’s workforce and meet the evolving needs of the renewable energy sector.

NYPA actively engages with each community training organization to ensure skills training is matched with needed positions and participant success through supportive wraparound services. NYPA’s collaboration with the skills-training organizations include input on the classroom and hands-on technology experiences of the enrollees for promoting the requisite clean energy skills and providing guidance on training locations to ensure statewide reach of the awards.

An additional $4 million in grants are available from DEC for Green Jobs for Youth workforce funding programs developed or funded by community-based organizations in or serving environmental justice and disadvantaged communities. The initiative helps prepare youth between the ages of 17-24 for jobs in the green economy through workforce development, skills training, and certification. This grant was last offered in 2017, with approximately $1 million helping train and educate more than 370 participants and 59 youth placed into jobs to date.

Electric vehicle maker Rivian has announced the appointment of Chip Newcom, a multiple IR Impact Award-winner and former head of IR at Equinix, as its new investor relations lead.

The move comes six months after Rivian’s former head of IR Timothy Bei left the company to join battery recycling company Redwood Materials.

Newcom, who served at Equinix for more than 10 years, oversaw an IR team that picked up several IR Impact awards, including the gong for best crisis management at this year’s IR Impact Awards – US and the trophy for best in sector – real estate for four consecutive years.

Announcing his new role on LinkedIn, he writes: ‘After 10 incredible years at Equinix, today is my last day as I leave the company to pursue a new opportunity.

‘As I reflect on the last decade, which included 30+ earnings calls, hundreds of investor meetings, thousands of conversations and 10s of billions of capital raised, there are numerous people to thank. It has been both a privilege and an honor to represent the company’s 13,000+ employees to the capital markets. I am deeply thankful for the personal and professional opportunity to have worked, learned and grown at the company. Now on to the next adventure!’

Rivian’s CFO, Claire McDonough, adds in a post on the same social network: ‘Chip has extensive experience driving IR strategy and communications, building relationships with investors and sell-side analysts and raising significant capital through equity and debt offerings. We are excited to welcome him to Rivian!’

Elsewhere in the US, Todd Friedman has joined NYSE-listed healthcare technology company Claritev as its new head of investor relations.

He joins the company following nearly five years as senior vice president, investor relations at Accolade. Prior to that, Friedman worked in various capacities at Concur Technologies and, following its acquisition by SAP, as chief customer officer for various SAP businesses.

Announcing the move on LinkedIn, Friedman writes: ‘As I enjoyed my summer and considered my next role, two things kept bringing me back to the opportunity I see ahead.

‘First, an engaged and motivated management team. From my first meeting, Travis Dalton, Doug Garis and Jason Wong showed a dedication and palpable energy that motivated me to learn more about what they are building.

‘Second, and most important to my personal mission, is that while our direct buyers are healthcare payors, providers, employers and governments, the ultimate customer and beneficiary remains the healthcare consumer.’

In Durham, North Carolina, organic waste technology and services company 374Water revealed that Jim Siccardi would become its new senior vice president of investor relations.

Prior to joining 374Water, Siccardi was vice president of IR at Nasdaq-listed Energy Recovery and served as director of IR at Occidental Petroleum.

Boston (September 25, 2025) - Senator Edward J. Markey (D-Mass.), member of the Environment and Public Works Committee and Co-Chair of the Senate Environmental Justice Caucus, today wrote to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator (EPA) Lee Zeldin in opposition to Zeldin’s decision to allow major polluting facilities—including data centers and associated power generation infrastructure—to start pre-construction activities without securing the air quality permits required under federal law.

The New Source Review (NSR) program was established by Congress as part of the Clean Air Act in 1977, which requires that polluting facilities obtain permits before they are built or expanded. This allows EPA to assess and minimize the harm that these facilities will pose to the health and well-being of the environment and surrounding communities. According to reports, Administrator Zeldin is now deciding whether to follow the permitting requirements on a “case-by-case basis,” despite the lack of public guidance or a notice and comment period, in order to allow more data centers and similar facilities to be built in Americans’ neighborhoods.

Senator Markey writes, “Your decision to undermine key Clean Air Act protections not only flouts the law but openly does so at the expense of public health, especially as communities choke on pollution from the expansion of power generation meant solely to power data centers for AI.”

Senator Markey continues, “Your continued decimation of our environmental laws is a terrible deal for Americans, enabling more pollution and more data centers in our back yards, all so Big Tech can reap bigger profits. Allowing companies to begin construction on facilities that will eventually increase pollution without requiring any permitting intentionally undermines the NSR program and signals to industry that public health and environmental protections are now negotiable in the name of their profits. Facilitating high-emissions infrastructure under the banner of AI development neither relieves the EPA of its legal obligations to enforce environmental safeguards nor justifies the sidelining of public participation, cumulative impact analysis, and pollution control requirements.”

Senator Markey requests answers to the following questions by October 6, 2025:

With respect to the NSR permitting program, what has changed, who approved it, and where is it written? Please produce the guidance and the approval record.

What law or rule lets construction start before air permits are issued? Please produce any legal analysis on which you are relying.

What counts as “pre-construction” under your approach? Please identify what EPA is allowing (and not allowing) before permits are issued.

Which projects have proceeded under this new approach so far? Please identify any projects, including their location, expected emissions, controls, and permit status.

How will the public find out and be heard before ground breaks? Will you post each decision and modeling files and allow a comment period? How does EPA’s adoption of its new approach comply with the Administrative Procedure Act?

If pollution ends up higher than expected—or a project later triggers NSR—what happens? Will you stop operations, require retrofits, and assess penalties?

Senator Markey is an outspoken critic of the Trump administration’s “race to the bottom” regulatory approach for AI data centers and a leader in advocating for stronger monitoring and mitigation of environmental and health impacts associated with irresponsible data center buildout.

In July, Senator Markey hosted a roundtable discussion titled The Data Center Next Door: Hidden Costs and Harms of Artificial Intelligence and Cryptomining to highlight the adverse environmental, health, climate, and energy cost impacts of data center proliferation in communities across the United States, and to condemn the deregulatory actions set forth in President Trump’s AI Action Plan.

On the day of his roundtable in July, Senator Markey also released a storybook to spotlight the experiences of American families living with data centers in their backyard.

In February 2024, Senator Markey introduced his Artificial Intelligence (AI) Environmental Impacts Act, legislation that would create standards to measure and report the full range of artificial intelligence’s (AI) environmental impacts.

Griffiths was a featured speaker at the Permian Basin Petroleum Association’s (PBPA) 63rd Annual Meeting in Midland, Texas, held September 17-18.

Meghan joined former Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUC) Commissioner Lori Cobos (Cobos Strategies, LLC) on a panel titled “Electrifying the Permian Basin.” The discussion focused on the critical transmission and distribution needs shaping the region’s energy future, diving into the challenges—and opportunities—facing the Permian Basin as power demand accelerates alongside continued oil and gas growth.

A central topic was the Permian Basin Reliability Plan, a Texas government‑mandated initiative signed into law by Governor Greg Abbott in 2023 to address surging electricity demand and insufficient transmission infrastructure in the energy‑producing region. Approved by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT), the plan directs ERCOT to develop and implement new and upgraded local transmission lines, as well as extra‑high voltage (EHV) import paths, to support economic growth and ensure reliable power for decades to come.

PBPA’s advocacy played an important role in securing approval of a $15 billion transmission buildout that includes the first 765 kV lines in the state of Texas—among the first in the United States. Former PUC Commissioner Cobos led development of the plan.

The plan’s purpose is clear: meet growing demand, ensure reliability, and support economic growth. As a long‑term roadmap, it is designed to facilitate critical transmission infrastructure investment, ensure the continued success of Texas’ oil and gas industry, support local communities, and strengthen the state’s economy.

Since 1961, the Permian Basin Petroleum Association has served the oil and gas industry of West Texas and Southeastern New Mexico. Growing from fewer than twenty members to more than 1,000 member companies at its peak, PBPA advocates for safe and responsible oil and gas development and provides education on safety, legislation, regulation, and support services for the industry.

“The Clean Water Act is the most important piece of legislation to protect our lakes.","September 25, 2025 (Augusta, ME) – A new report issued today details how the U.S. House Appropriations Committee’s FY26 budget proposal would put Maine’s clean air and water at risk, limit clean-up of old industrial sites, and halt important scientific research that is essential for safeguarding public health.

The dramatic cuts being proposed to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) would also severely scale back funding for the Maine Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), which relies heavily on federal funding for nearly every aspect of its work, including compliance with the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and hazardous waste laws. In 2024, DEP received $10.69 million in dedicated grants from EPA, amounting to more than 21.5% of its budget and 102 personnel.

The report, entitled “Damaging Maine: The Impacts of Proposed Cuts in the EPA Budget” was released by the Natural Resources Council of Maine (NRCM), Maine’s leading nonprofit, nonpartisan environmental advocacy organization.

“These proposed cuts represent the most extreme rollback of environmental funding in decades. If enacted, the House’s FY26 budget risks undoing decades of progress and could leave a legacy of environmental harm that would negatively impact Maine’s environment and communities for generations to come,” said Anya Fetcher, NRCM’s Federal Policy Advocate. “The draconian budget proposals have made it abundantly clear that the Trump Administration and its allies in Congress care more about protecting polluters than protecting public health.”

On July 14, 2025, the U.S. House of Representatives Appropriations Committee released its proposed FY26 budget, targeting the EPA for some of the deepest cuts of any domestic agency, cutting its budget by $2.1 billion (23%) from the current levels, and its workforce by 1,274 (23%). In contrast, the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, chaired by Senator Susan Collins, released a draft budget that largely retains the EPA’s role of protecting health and the environment.

“Maine’s lakes – which provide more than $14.3 billion in annual economic value to the state – are at a tipping point,” said Susan Gallo, Executive Director of Maine Lakes. “Invasive species, warming waters, erosion, and algal blooms are all increasingly threatening the quality of our waters and the abundance of wildlife habitat. State spending for lake protection in Maine is already stretched, making EPA funding essential to supporting the work of state agencies and lake associations to keep our waters clean, clear, and blue.”

The Damaging Maine report analyzed the House’s proposed cuts and found that they would put Maine’s clean water at risk, increase air pollution and threaten public health for vulnerable populations, limit the clean-up of contaminated brownfield and superfund sites, stop the EPA’s efforts to protect communities from climate change, and halt important scientific research.

“As a pediatrician, I am most concerned about the long-term consequences of air pollutants on children, who are uniquely vulnerable to their effects,” said Dr. Sydney Sewall, a Board-Certified Pediatrician with a Masters in Public Health. “It takes money to collect and analyze environmental data so that good science can help the agency meet the challenge of balancing public health with industry needs. The proposed cuts, as described in the report being released today, will destroy the EPA’s ability to do its job.”

Among the cuts being proposed:

59% cuts to the EPA’s Superfund program that helps clean up hazardous industrial sites in local communities. Of the 16 hazardous waste sites in Maine, only 6 have been cleaned up.

43% cuts to Clean Air programs that help reduce air pollution, including compliance monitoring and enforcement.

26% cuts to funding for the Clean Water State Revolving Fund that provides local communities with funds to upgrade wastewater treatment plants and stormwater infrastructure improvements.

Eliminates most of the EPA’s climate programs, including research and monitoring that are widely used by local and state governments.

Deep cuts across EPA’s scientific research on air, water, and chemical risks, including PFAS.

“The Clean Water Act is the most important piece of legislation to protect our lakes. Not only does it provide regulations and guidance, but it provides the means to undo the damage already done to our lakes,” said Lynn Geiger, the Erosion Control Policy Manager at 7 Lakes Alliance. “At 7 Lakes, we use Congressionally directed funding to help real Mainers address erosion or upgrade dying infrastructure to handle the changing climate. This funding has an enormous impact on our community, and we need to protect it.”

If the House’s proposed cuts are adopted, Maine DEP would be forced to scale back work across many key program areas. But the effects will be felt far beyond government agencies. Maine’s lakes and other surface waters will be more polluted; communities with brownfield and Superfund sites may never see them cleaned up; and communities could see higher rates of illness linked to poor air and water quality. Businesses that rely on a clean environment and the latest research – including fisheries, tourism, forestry, and outdoor recreation – would face growing uncertainty and economic risk.

“As the budget debate progresses, we encourage Senator Collins to continue protecting the essential role that the EPA plays in protecting the health and safety of Maine’s people, communities, and environment,” said Fetcher.",https://www.nrcm.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Jordan-Pond-Bubbles-Gerard-Monteux.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:02:09.843448

“Our organization’s goal is to accelerate new business growth in the community,” Executive Director Diane Walter said. “We help shorten the time between having a great business idea to actually hanging the ‘We’re Open’ sign on your front door. Navigating that entire process can be daunting and we’re here to help.”

Facade grants are available to qualifying businesses for up to $5,000.

“We have several more facade improvements in the works for various businesses, and it’s exciting to see how each one elevates the overall look and feel of the entire business district,” Walter said.

Homestead native Gregory Harris and his girlfriend, Hannah Kemp, both avid coffee drinkers, opened Arabica Robusta Coffee House last week in the former Steel Valley Roaster’s space located at 207 E. Eighth Ave.

The Homestead Blend is the star there, featuring a curated Arabica custom blend.

“We worked with a local roaster, Commonplace Coffee, to perfect our blend and create something that represented us. This blend provides a smoothness with fruity and citrus undertones and is truly one of a kind. We’re very proud of it,” Kemp said.

The full-service coffee cafe serves desserts, breakfast and lunch sandwiches, pastries, croissants, wraps and all the usual specialty coffee favorites.

Other evolving or new businesses along Eighth Avenue include the Bank on 8th, which houses an axe-throwing experience; Co-Sign Speakeasy; The Brooke (event space and bar); and Secretos de mis Abuelos, which serves authentic Puerto Rican fare.

Other establishments include Los Gallitos Taqueria, Rogue BBQ, Golden Age Beer, Mexican grocer La Veracruzana, Hops Brews & Sunshine and The Glitterbox Theater, housed in an old automotive repair space.

“No other community in the area boasts our unique combination of access, amenities and affordability,” Walter said.

Creative uses of space in the Steel Valley include Bowtie High luxury apartments inside a former high school and transforming the historic Schwab Industrial building into high-end apartments.

“Like the buildings themselves, Eighth Avenue and the Steel Valley are being reimagined into vibrant, creative spaces. There’s an entrepreneurial spirit and a very strong sense of community and history. Things are happening here,” Walter said.

Co-working space offers parenting work perks

Busy mom, professional wedding planner and entrepreneur Jade Granda of Overbrook is used to working with her toddler in tow.

“For the first two years of my son’s life, I was a stay-at-home working mom and he was my sidekick. I had very minimal help and it was hard,” Granda said.

Granda, formerly of Freeport, opened Joyful Commons on Sept. 2.

It’s a family-friendly co-working space for parents looking to work alongside their children.

Memberships include access to the supervised play space, a co-working area during the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. Mondays through Fridays.

Work perks include Wi-Fi, a kitchenette, free coffee, a private nursing area, bassinets and private restrooms.

Monthly membership prices for infants under 1 year old range from a day pass ($30), monthly partial passes ($149) or an unlimited monthly passes ($299).

Rates are a bit higher for parents of children over the age of 12 months.

Joyful Commons isn’t a day care as parents must remain on-site.

“We’re here to support your workday, not replace you,” Granda said. “So you can focus knowing your little one is close and cared for.”

Youngsters are able to play nearby in the same area under the watchful eye of a licensed staff member on-site.

The parents are responsible for tending to any of the children’s personal needs such as trips to the bathroom, eating or diaper changes.

“It’s classified as supervised play because the parents are co-working in the same room,” Granda said. “I knew there were more people like me so it’s what I can do to help and I felt called to do.”

The maximum number of children permitted is eight.

Granda chose an Eighth Avenue location for several reasons.

“I think the building is just beautiful. It was an old hotel, and Joyful Commons is located in what was once the lobby,” said Granda, who signed a two-year lease.

She compared the uptick in new businesses coming to Homestead to how Lawrenceville went from a once floundering area to thriving.

“I think it has a lot of potential and charm,” said Granda of Eighth Avenue. “The locals talk about how there’s hope that this street will turn into the next Lawrenceville.”

Joyful Commons serves another business purpose: It converts to a venue space during the weekends, offering sit-down event space for 40 guests or ceremony-only options for up to 55 people.",https://assets-varnish.triblive.com/2025/09/8887647_web1_ptr-homestead-092425-5.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:51.352693

Launched in 1994, National Public Lands Day takes place every year on the fourth Saturday of September. It’s an opportunity for Americans to explore new places, learn about our national treasures and give back by volunteering.

Have plans on Sept. 27 that don’t involve public lands? That’s fine, as it’s entirely possible to celebrate our national parks and still-wild places 365 days per year. Here’s how:

Five ways to celebrate Public Lands Day throughout the year

1. Explore, enjoy and have fun

At its core, National Public Lands Day is centered around enjoying our unspoiled outdoor spaces.

Public lands are vast playgrounds for countless recreational activities. Whereas adventurers may prefer to hike, rock climb or mountain bike along winding trails, water enthusiasts will likely find their fun by kayaking or fishing on serene lakes and rivers. Those who prefer a more relaxed pace can capture the beauty of America’s diverse ecosystems by bird watching, wildlife viewing or engaging in nature photography.

Public lands are meant to be enjoyed, so enjoy them all year long! Whether it’s a quiet walk in a local park or a multi-day backpacking trip in a national forest, public lands uniquely cater to every interest.

2. Volunteer

National Public Lands Day connects volunteers to service projects that restore and protect our parks. In the last decade, one million volunteers have contributed five million volunteer-hours and performed $133 million worth of work on this annual day of service.

If you’re unable to volunteer on Sept. 27, know that volunteer opportunities at our parks abound all year long. From cleaning up beaches to planting pollinator-friendly gardens, the ways to get involved are limitless. Just head to volunteer.gov for a list of volunteer opportunities at parks and public lands near you.

3. Learn

On National Public Lands Day, planned events teach participants about the plants, animals, ecosystems and history that make our public lands special.

But the learning doesn’t start and end on Sept. 27, as our parks are great classrooms year-round. Join a bird walk at Big South Fork National River & Recreation Area in Tennessee or take part in a guided hike around Taggert Lake in the Grand Tetons.

Wherever your interests lie, the National Parks Service has educational programs for everyone … for now. While staffing cuts and potential funding changes may put future programs in jeopardy, you can find already-scheduled events near you via the National Parks Service website.

4. Be a good steward.

Whenever you go, remember to be a good steward.

The National Parks Service recommends that you familiarize yourself with the seven principles of the “Leave No Trace” philosophy, which aims to protect the natural world from human interference. Remember to dispose of your waste properly and refrain from taking home any feathers, rocks, or other treasures you find. Always respect any wildlife you encounter and, if you’re making a campfire, do so with proper safety precautions.

It’s just as important to minimize our impacts on local neighborhood trails as it is on our favorite national parks. When we leave nature as unchanged as possible, we do our part to preserve our outdoor spaces for future generations.

5. Add your voice to protect our public lands.

America’s public lands are places where people are free to hunt, climb and hike. They are also places where animals can flourish. But our public lands are facing challenges.

We have seen proposals to sell off millions of acres of public lands and to open up protected areas for logging, mining and drilling. Thousands of federal public lands staff have left or been fired; worse, there isn’t adequate funding to maintain our lands for the future.",https://environmentamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/national-public-lands-day-2013-9473639412-b1a82d-1024.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:02:14.258081
,EPA,2025-09-25 16:02:26+00:00,Chemical & Engineering News,EPA aims to loosen chemical regulations via controversial standards - C&EN,Leigh Krietsch Boerner,,,,,https://cen.acs.org/policy/chemical-regulation/EPA-aims-to-loosen-chemical-regulations-via-controversial-standards-/103/web/2025/09,"The changes outlined in the EPA’s proposal would apply to future chemical evaluations as well as those that are in progress.
Recent EPA actions might signal how the agency plans to apply the Trump administration’s guidelines for scientific evidence.
Under the new proposal, the EPA would revert to the 2017 approach of making separate risk evaluations for each use of a chemical.
This method allows the “EPA to exercise reasonable discretion in scoping a risk evaluation to ensure timely and efficient completion of risk evaluations,” the proposal says.
Industry and environmental advocates alike have criticized the agency for years for taking too long to do chemical risk evaluations.","The US Environmental Protection Agency released a proposal Monday to undo three major changes to the country’s primary chemical law, the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA), that were made under the Joe Biden administration. The EPA wants to define what the “weight of scientific evidence” means, shift to a faster but less thorough review of new chemicals, and assume that workers handling chemicals will use personal protective equipment.

EPA head Lee Zeldin announced in March that the agency will revisit how it conducts risk evaluations under TSCA, a set of regulations that authorizes the EPA to screen and govern the use of chemicals produced in or imported into the US.

The act was passed by the US Congress in 1976 to identify and mitigate chemical risks to human health and the environment before substances enter commerce. It applies to a range of manufacturers and importers of chemical substances, including petroleum refiners, chemical manufacturers, plastic pipe and pipe-fitting producers, and tire manufacturers.

The changes outlined in the EPA’s proposal would apply to future chemical evaluations as well as those that are in progress. The agency finalized rules last year for 5 of the first 10 high-priority commercial chemicals subject to risk evaluation under amendments made to TSCA in 2016. All five rules are now tied up in various federal appeals courts.

As has often been the case with changes to TSCA, reactions to the EPA’s proposal have been mixed.

The chemical industry should be pleased, says Lynn Bergeson, managing partner at the law firm Bergeson and Campbell. “There are no big surprises,” she says. “Many of us expected the new administration to revise the three big issues that many took umbrage with under the [Biden-era] 2024 rules.”

But environmental advocacy groups are raising objections. “This proposal is part of a broader effort to strip away the safeguards that keep cancer-causing and brain-harming chemicals out of our homes, schools, and workplaces,” Betsy Southerland, former director of the Office of Science and Technology in the EPA’s Office of Water, says in a statement for the Environmental Protection Network, an advocacy group. “Families deserve an EPA that protects their health—not one that bends to industry pressure and leaves communities unprotected.”

One Biden-era change to TSCA was to remove the definitions of “best available science” and “weight of scientific evidence.” In the 2023 proposal for those changes (PDF), the EPA says that specifically defining these concepts is unnecessary and “inhibits the Agency’s flexibility to quickly adapt to and implement changing science.” The EPA incorporated what “best available science” meant into other parts of the regulations, and added that the “EPA intends to ensure that its risk evaluations are consistent with Agency guidance and methodologies in applying these terms.”

The current EPA proposal seeks to reinstate the definition of “weight of scientific evidence,” but with language from President Donald J. Trump’s executive order on “Restoring Gold Standard Science.” When it was released, the order was widely criticized by scientists, who said that it gives the administration a way to discount scientific evidence it doesn’t like or agree with.

According to the order, “the weight of scientific evidence” means “an approach to scientific evaluation in which each piece of relevant information is considered based on its quality and relevance, and then transparently integrated with other relevant information to inform the scientific evaluation prior to making a judgment about the scientific evaluation.” The order also put political appointees in charge of upholding scientific-research standards that critics called theoretically ideal but impossible to meet in practice.

Recent EPA actions might signal how the agency plans to apply the Trump administration’s guidelines for scientific evidence. As justification for its proposal to rescind the endangerment finding, the legal and scientific basis for regulating greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, the EPA heavily leaned on a US Department of Energy (DOE) report written by known climate change denialists. Largely panned by the scientific community, the DOE report said evidence that GHG emissions cause harm to human health and the environment was weak. Yet the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine looked at the same data and found that evidence to support the endangerment finding was irrefutable.

Whether the EPA would seek to use a similar approach to undercut TSCA is unclear, Bergeson says. If under this new definition of “weight of scientific evidence,” the agency were to rely on data or evidence that most scientists disagree with, that would be subject to legal challenge, she says. “It might ultimately be an issue the courts would have to sort out.”

One of the most contentious Biden-era changes to TSCA is the implementation of what’s known as whole chemical evaluation, a way of looking at all the possible ways a chemical could cause harm, rather than just harm during its intended use. Under the new proposal, the EPA would revert to the 2017 approach of making separate risk evaluations for each use of a chemical. This method allows the “EPA to exercise reasonable discretion in scoping a risk evaluation to ensure timely and efficient completion of risk evaluations,” the proposal says. Industry and environmental advocates alike have criticized the agency for years for taking too long to do chemical risk evaluations.

Reverting to the 2017 approach would be a significant change, Bergeson says. Under Biden-era rules, one discrete unsafe use condemned a chemical in all its applications, she says. “It was hard to rationalize and explain to stakeholders why they couldn’t use a chemical for a different use” from the one the EPA had deemed unsafe.

But the whole chemical approach has its advocates. “Rather than looking at the full picture of a chemical’s toxic risk, EPA wants to downplay the links these chemicals have to cancer and chronic disease and give the chemical industry a handout at the expense of our health and safety,” Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy at the Environmental Defense Fund, says in a statement.

The EPA also aims to undo a Biden administration amendment about personal protective equipment. Older versions of TSCA assumed that workers handling chemicals were using correct protective equipment, and the EPA took this into consideration when evaluating risk. The 2024 amendments removed this assumption, and the current proposal adds it back. Bergeson says the reversal reflects a fair interpretation of Congress’s intent when it wrote the law.

The proposal is open for public comments, which must be submitted by Nov. 7.","https://s7d1.scene7.com/is/image/CENODS/EPA-proposes-chemical-risk-evaluation-changes---182891:Widescreen?$responsive$&qlt=90,0&resMode=sharp2&fmt=webp",N,,2025-09-25 13:02:24.085856

It requires collaboration across borders, supply chains and industries.

At a time when the world feels fractured and divided, Fortescue is advancing cross- border partnerships to accelerate industrial decarbonisation and build the lowest-cost 24/7 energy system – one that outcompetes and outprices fossil fuels.

Fortescue is building global alliances – linking the Pilbara’s world-leading operational expertise, America’s and Australia’s research and development strength, the UK’s and Europe’s innovation and engineering excellence and anchoring it all with scale and cost-efficient manufacturing capability in China and the US. Together, this creates a powerful multilateral network of commercial cooperation to accelerate decarbonisation and defeat mankind's greatest threat – global warming.

These partnerships – announced in New York during the United Nations General Assembly – will not only enable Fortescue to electrify its Pilbara operations and deliver on its target of Real Zero by 2030, but also catalyse decarbonisation globally.

As part of this partnership-led plan, Fortescue has signed agreements with some of the world’s most advanced green energy innovators: global leader in electric vehicles and in battery manufacturing and development, BYD; solar technology and manufacturing giant, LONGi; construction and mining equipment manufacturer, XCMG; and wind and energy storage leader, Envision Energy.

Fortescue has also finalised the acquisition of Spanish renewable technology company Nabrawind.

These agreements build on Fortescue’s global innovation ecosystem – where European powerhouse Liebherr already plays a pivotal role in decarbonising Fortescue’s mining fleet with the production of T 264 trucks in Virginia in the United States.

They are underpinned by world-leading research and development through Fortescue Zero, which utilises the Colorado Technology Hub in the United States, advanced technology collaborations with CSIRO in Australia, and its R&D centre at Oxford in the United Kingdom, to drive the innovations behind Fortescue’s decarbonisation and future green technologies.

Together, these partnerships and hubs of innovation ensure Fortescue integrates the world’s best technology into its operations and delivers its green energy operations at unmatched scale and cost.

The urgency of Fortescue’s action has been sharpened by new research in Nature which quantifies, for the first time, the contributions of individual companies to increases in the intensity and probability of hundreds of heatwaves across the world between 2000 and 2023.

These findings highlight the growing legal, regulatory, financial and reputational risks that fossil fuel reliant companies face. They reinforce the importance of industry taking action and progressing practical decarbonisation solutions at speed.

“The world once benefited from open trade and cooperation – now it is divided. Fortescue is showing that industry can help glue back that multilateral spirit, not through rhetoric but through practical alliances that prove heavy industry can follow a new path – one where profits rise as emissions fall,” Fortescue Executive Chairman and Founder, Dr Andrew Forrest AO, said.

“China is scaling and manufacturing green technologies at unprecedented speed and our partnerships give Fortescue access to that capability.

“Meanwhile, through Nabrawind in Spain, Liebherr in Germany and the United States, Fortescue Zero in the United Kingdom, and Fortescue operations in the Pilbara in Western Australia, we are building a global R&D and production network.

“This is a truly multilateral collaboration that draws on the best ideas and manufacturing capacity to deliver the lowest cost energy and tackle climate change.

“By joining forces across continents, we are seizing the full extent of the decarbonisation opportunity and rebuilding the cooperation the world needs to address the climate crisis.”

Additional information Fortescue Zero

Fortescue Zero is Fortescue’s engine room of innovation, delivering technology solutions that have underpinned the Company’s progress towards Real Zero.

As Fortescue enters the next phase of decarbonising its operations, Fortescue Zero will develop and integrate new technologies and inventions from around the world, as well as drive smart partnerships.

Green energy solutions

Fortescue is partnering with global leaders to deliver the world’s most efficient and cost-effective solutions for decarbonising energy grids. Individual Heads of Agreements have been signed with three global renewable energy leaders:

BYD – the world’s largest manufacturer of electric vehicles, batteries and energy storage systems, with almost one million employees and having sold more than 4 million new energy vehicles in 2024 – will supply its leading energy storage solutions.

LONGi – one of the world’s largest solar technology companies and a global leader in high-efficiency photovoltaic products – will supply its photovoltaic modules and solar technology, itself the lowest cost form of green energy generation.

Envision – a global leader in wind power and smart energy solutions – will supply its advanced wind turbine and integrated energy solution technologies that combine diverse renewable sources and optimise power availability.

Battery electric trucks

Fortescue will leverage a dual supplier approach to accelerate the decarbonisation of its mining fleet, adding a new partnership with XCMG and building on its existing agreement with Liebherr to deliver the world’s first large-scale deployment of battery electric haul trucks.

XCMG

Fortescue and XCMG have signed an agreement in which XCMG is expected to supply up to half of Fortescue’s future fleet of 300 to 400 zero-emissions 240-tonne haul trucks, with phased deliveries planned from 2028 to 2030.

The deal will strengthen and diversify Fortescue’s supply chain for battery electric trucks. It expands on the contract signed in November 2024 for battery electric ancillary mining equipment – then XCMG’s largest green mining equipment order outside China.

Liebherr

Liebherr, with its manufacturing facilities in the US, is expected to provide at a minimum the other half of the haul truck fleet and electric excavators under an amendment to the partnership announced in September 2024.

While XCMG and Liebherr will make Fortescue’s battery electric trucks and other heavy mining equipment, Fortescue Zero will continue to focus on developing and integrating advanced power systems for Fortescue’s fleet – including optimisation of battery electric truck performance in Pilbara conditions.

“Technology is driving Fortescue to a more profitable Real Zero future,” Dr Forrest said. “We will prove that profits go up when emissions go down.”

Acquisition unlocks next-generation wind technology

Fortescue is accelerating the deployment of renewable energy across its operations by combining full ownership of Spanish wind technology company Nabrawind with the purchase of wind turbines from Envision Energy.

Together, these advances will underpin the first stage of Fortescue’s inaugural wind project, unlocking greater generation capacity and efficiency to help deliver Real Zero by 2030.

Nabrawind

Fortescue has acquired 100 per cent of Nabrawind, consolidating its previous minority stake to take full ownership.

The acquisition positions Fortescue to deliver large-scale wind projects in the Pilbara, leveraging Nabrawind’s innovative self-lifting tower design that allows turbines to be installed at greater heights, capturing stronger winds and generating more power.

Envision

Envision Energy will supply its state-of-the-art EN182-7.8MW turbines for the first stage of Fortescue’s Pilbara wind project.

These turbines are engineered to perform in low-wind conditions and withstand extreme weather, including cyclones. They will be integrated with Nabrawind’s 188- metre tower technology and provide improved generation and cost efficiency.",https://vault.fortescue.com/api/public/content/da653f72745e4a86aa70bb52705b9779?v=9c7e7a57,N,,2025-09-25 17:02:25.395358

This article is part of a series highlighting the impact of CDFIs and how the sector is adapting to the current environment.

Walk down any main street in Michigan and you’ll find businesses — like Terri’s Cakes in Detroit or Four Leaf Brewing in Clare — that might not exist without the support of community development financial institutions (CDFIs). Created through bipartisan legislation 30 years ago, CDFIs were designed to serve communities overlooked by traditional banks. Today, more than 1,400 CDFIs nationwide — and 55 here in Michigan — provide affordable financing to small businesses, first-time homebuyers and community projects that keep neighborhoods vibrant.

CDFIs have long relied on federal partners such as the U.S. Treasury’s CDFI Fund, the Small Business Administration (SBA), and Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD), alongside philanthropic, bank and corporate investors. These federal investments remain critical, but with federal funding facing uncertainty, we can’t depend on Washington alone to meet the growing needs of the communities we serve. The survival and success of CDFIs depends on expanding support at the state and local levels.

Michigan’s model shows what’s possible

In Michigan, we’ve begun to chart this path. Two CDFI coalitions — the Michigan CDFI Coalition and the Detroit CDFI Coalition — have worked with legislators to establish the Michigan CDFI Fund, which has already awarded $89 million in grants to strengthen lending capacity, operations and technical assistance. That fund is just the beginning. Together with state and local partners, we are exploring creative ways to close capital gaps and respond to urgent needs, such as:

A statewide CDFI loan fund combining public, philanthropic and private capital.

A Community Redevelopment Tax Credit to revitalize business corridors.

A small business interest buydown and collateral fund to expand entrepreneurship.

Detroit offers additional proof that local collaboration works. Partnerships between the city, philanthropy and CDFIs have fueled programs like the Strategic Neighborhood Fund, Motor City Contractor Fund and the 0% Interest Home Repair Program — initiatives that blend resources and expertise help stabilize housing and support small contractor businesses.

As CDFIs continue to play an important role in our communities and their economic success, it’s vital that we work together to not only sustain our organizations but grow our capacity. Michigan’s experience shows what’s possible when CDFIs work hand-in-hand with state and local leaders, and partners in our sector can adapt similar approaches by:

Partnering with local and state governments to seed new capital programs

Adjusting policy so existing programs are accessible to CDFIs

Engaging non-traditional partners — such as hospitals and anchor institutions — whose missions align with community development

Leveraging limited public and foundation dollars to unlock larger, blended finance programs

National networks of state coalitions have begun forming to share strategies, provide advocacy training and exchange policy insights. Our partners in Michigan are already learning from peers in Pennsylvania, Virginia, California, New York and beyond. Together, we hope to scale local innovations into a more resilient national CDFI system.

Building resilience for the future

In this moment of dramatically shifting policy landscapes and volatile financial markets, CDFIs must diversify funding sources and innovate beyond “business as usual.” By building stronger partnerships at every level and cultivating a broader set of funding streams — from municipal programs to statewide coalitions — we can reduce our vulnerability to federal funding uncertainty and build more durable institutions.

Small businesses are the engine of our economy, and CDFIs help keep that engine running. By acting locally and creatively, we can ensure these institutions remain strong for our neighborhoods and cities to thrive.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/SipNRead-800.png,N,,2025-09-25 13:02:32.242774

Several utilities are exploring partnerships with nuclear fusion startups that promise to deploy the cutting edge technology at commercial scale – a feat that has eluded scientists for decades.

Recent technical breakthroughs at government labs around the world have moved this milestone closer, but industry and experts are divided over how close.

“We’re seeing these companies get a little more serious about their siting and deployment plans, no longer just making vague promises about getting fusion onto the grid ‘in a few years,’” said Patrick White, group lead for fusion safety and regulation with Clean Air Task Force.

Inside a nuclear fusion reactor, lightweight atoms smash together under incredible heat. The energy they release drives a power conversion system similar to those found in existing thermal power plants’ generator rooms. Electricity comes out the other side. The process is energy-dense: A ton of the hydrogen isotope deuterium, one possible fusion fuel, contains the energy equivalent of 29 billion tons of coal.

Commercial fusion power still exists only in theory because sustaining an earthbound atom-smashing reaction at temperatures hotter than the sun’s core is a formidable technical challenge. For years, scientists warnedthat commercial fusion power was always 50 years off.

Utilities strike fusion partnerships following breakthroughs

Now, they’re not so sure.

In late 2022, the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory said it had achieved a vital breakthrough. For the first time, scientists there had created and briefly sustained a fusion reaction that generated more energy than it consumed – a threshold called “net energy gain” or “Q>1.”

The lasers that sparked the reaction consumed about 90 kW of electricity over a span measured in nanoseconds, said Patrick Poole, an LLNL research physicist involved in the breakthrough.

Earlier this year, fusion facilities in China and France sustained reactions for longer than 15 minutes, far longer than the LLNL experiment. CEA, the French fusion facility, said in February that durations of several hours were within its reach.

But it also said that fusion technology is “unlikely” to make a significant contribution to achieving net-zero carbon emissions by 2050, citing massive infrastructure requirements and “several technological sticking points [that] need to be overcome.”

The 500-MW International Thermonuclear Experimental Reactor, the Western Hemisphere’s flagship government-led fusion project under construction in the south of France, is nearly a decade behind schedule and billions of euros over budget.

Most U.S. utilities and private fusion companies agree that significant technical challenges remain to be solved for commercial fusion power to become reality. But they believe that could happen within 10 to 15 years — and maybe sooner.

With backing from OpenAI CEO Sam Altman, fusion startup Helion began work in July on a 50-MW Washington State fusion plant it says will power up in 2028.

“Our confidence lies in the fact that we have built seven prototypes that have done fusion,” said Anthony Pancotti, Helion’s co-founder and head of R&D, in an email. “With construction having begun on the site of our first fusion power plant in Malaga [Washington], we’re on track to meet our commitment to Microsoft to put electrons from fusion on the grid by 2028.”

Another startup, Commonwealth Fusion Systems, aims to activate its Massachusetts test reactor a year earlier, in 2027, then partner with Dominion Energy to deploy a 400-MW commercial plant in Virginia in the early 2030s, it says. The company is building a donut-shaped tokamak reactor, similar to the design under development at ITER.

“It is easy to overpromise in that space ... We kind of worry that laypeople or the venture capital world will get kind of disheartened if things don’t come up perfect after five years.”

Patrick Poole

research physicist at the U.S. Department of Energy’s Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory

The 400-MW power plant would likely be “a standard building block that’ll allow for even more modular manufacturing and economies of scale,” Commonwealth Fusion Systems’ Chief Commercial Officer Rick Needham said in an email.

Though smaller than most of the conventional fission reactors operating in the U.S. nuclear fleet today, a 400-MW power plant would be on par with individual units at modern coal or combined-cycle gas power plants. Future utility customers or direct end-users could host multiple plants at a single site as needed, Needham said.

“With respect to eventual prices for power, we feel confident that our future ARC plants can be the lowest cost form of clean, firm power that can be deployed essentially anywhere,” Needham said.

A spokesperson for Dominion Energy declined to elaborate “beyond what we’ve said publicly” on plans for the Virginia plant. It is unclear what if any direct investment the utility has made in the project so far.

Further south, the Tennessee Valley Authority is beefing up its partnership with Type One Energy with the aim of bringing a 350-MW fusion facility online “as early as the mid-2030s.”

A cooperative agreement announced in February builds on an earlier partnership focused on deploying a fusion prototype at TVA’s retired Bull Run coal plant.

The project now “encompasses a deeper, broader engagement toward commercialization of fusion energy,” Type One said in a statement. It includes access to TVA’s Power Service Shops in Muscle Shoals, Alabama, which the companies say will enable supply chain development and modular component manufacturing, as well as “talent and resources” for workforce development from the states of Tennessee and Alabama.

“We are strategically partnering with innovative companies like Type One Energy to advance the development of nuclear technologies,” TVA CEO Bob Moul said in a statement. “I am excited about the possibility of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion power plant being built in the Tennessee Valley,”

Progress may not be fast enough for investors

White, of the Clean Air Task Force, cautioned that lots of technical work remains to be done before the first commercial fusion plants can come online.

As in the advanced fission industry, every fusion startup puts its own spin on the technology and balances key factors like reactor capacity, efficiency and output flexibility. The divergent approaches suggest successful fusion companies will try to carve out niches for themselves.

“Some technologies are going to scale down easier at lower power outputs, while others will have an economic optimum at a higher output,” White said. “There’s no ‘one size fits all’ fusion machine.”

LLNL’s Poole said in an interview that a viable fusion power plant could still be 15 to 30 years away, depending on manpower, funding and luck. That might not be fast enough for venture capital firms seeking faster returns.

“It is easy to overpromise in that space,” Poole said. “We kind of worry that laypeople or the venture capital world will get kind of disheartened if things don’t come up perfect after five years.”

Even some private-sector fusion leaders think a 10-year timeline is optimistic, let alone Helion’s three-year sprint. They also say competitively priced fusion power will prove elusive even after Q>1 is in the rearview.

“This happens periodically in fusion [power], where there’s a lot of excitement, a feeling like we’re close,” said Greg Piefer, CEO of SHINE Technologies, which uses fusion to produce medical radioisotopes.

“My view is not only do we not know how to handicap success, but we also don’t know how much capital needs to be invested for this to be cost-effective,” Piefer said.

Trouble is already brewing in some corners of the industry.

In May, the CEO of Vancouver-based General Fusion put out an unusual public appeal for fresh funding, hinting that the company might not survive without it. Investors responded to the tune of $22 million, the company said this month — without indicating how much time the infusion would buy.

A new nuclear race

For now, however, the money is still flowing.

Though still a small slice of the $1.2 trillion the wider clean energy industry attracted between 2020 and 2023, the Fusion Industry Association says fusion investment is up fivefold since 2021. Cumulative funding for the 53 fusion startups the FIA tracks neared $10 billion earlier this year.

Commonwealth Fusion Systems is among the best-funded of the bunch, according to publicly available announcements and fundraising data. It has raised more than $2 billion since spinning out of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 2018, giving it capital to finance construction of its SPARC test reactor near its headquarters in Devens, Massachusetts. It expects SPARC to achieve Q>1 in 2027.

That would be a first for commercial fusion power technology, Needham said. It’s a critical milestone as CFS develops the full-size commercial reactor design it calls ARC, he added.

“SPARC is … designed to prove out most of the subsystems necessary for our ARC power plants, develop operational expertise and fine-tune ARC’s design,” Needham said.

When SPARC powers up, it will produce a superheated plasma that fuses hydrogen isotopes into helium and releases energy-rich neutrons. It’s the same basic process that occurs in the sun’s core, albeit at far lower pressure, and a mirror image of the atom-splitting fission reaction powering commercial nuclear reactors today.

Like stars, fusion reactors produce little long-lived radioactive waste, a key advantage over fission and the basis for lighter-touch federal regulation. However, unlike celestial fusion machines, earthbound tokamaks and stellarators can’t rely on gravity to sustain their reactions. Without powerful magnets to contain it, the plasma rapidly dissipates.

This “containment” problem vexed fusion scientists for decades. Now, it appears surmountable thanks to superconducting magnet technology that Needham said will make commercial fusion plants more compact, bankable and cost-effective.

SPARC will validate that magnet technology as CFS continues work on other key subsystems. Those include the molten-salt “blanket” that captures energy from the tokamak and “newer materials and designs to further improve aspects of our power plants like output and capacity factor,” Needham said.

If all goes well, those subsystems will make their commercial debut in ARC, the 400-MW Virginia plant CFS and Dominion plan to codevelop after 2030. Two early investors in CFS, Google and the Italian oil company Eni, will purchase the majority of its output.

Needham characterized the first ARC plant as a blueprint for future fusion facilities. He said it will ramp up operations over time and help CFS validate its operations in a grid-connected environment, paving the way for future 400-MW units to run at capacity factors on par with other firm power sources. The molten salt heat transfer system could eventually support cogeneration or energy storage applications, adding further value, he added.

CFS isn’t the only company that believes it has a clear path to grid-connected fusion power.

Washington-based Helion hopes to beat its East Coast competitor by several years. It’s banking on a novel design, a smaller reactor, an offtake agreement with Microsoft and surplus interconnection capacity at a hydroelectric dam to get its first commercial plant’s power on the grid by 2028.

Helion’s “pulsed, non-ignition fusion system” combines elements of the relatively well-studied tokamak design and other approaches to fusion in a way that “helps us overcome the hardest physics challenges [and] build highly energy-efficient devices,” the company says. Like CFS, Helion’s machine uses magnets to confine plasma.

Pancotti said Helion will generate electricity from the fusion reaction itself, avoiding the need for the steam cycle infrastructure found in traditional nuclear power plants and “[lowering] our overall capital cost requirements.”

The company plans to manufacture much of its equipment and systems at its facility in Everett, Washington, he added.

“We’re at a turning point where we’re going from burning chemical energy as a society to being a nuclear-powered society.”

Greg Piefer

CEO of SHINE Technologies

“Our strategy is to essentially build an assembly line that will allow us to achieve economies of scale for future plants and manufacture critical components in house,” he said.

Helion also plans to operate a closed-loop system that produces the fuel the plant needs, he said. Pool said that’s a fairly common goal of fusion startups.

But Pancotti admitted that Helion “continues to refine our plasma-facing materials … and our magnetic coils, with the goal to extend the lifetime for commercial power output.”

Regardless of their technology or design, hardening reactor materials to withstand intense temperatures and radiation for years on end is a problem that every commercial fusion company will have to address sooner or later, Poole said.

SHINE Technologies stands out among fusion startups for what it calls a “revenue-first approach.” It’s producing and selling commercial radioisotopes in a Wisconsin particle accelerator it opened in 2023. Because it’s concerned only with producing neutrons and not net energy, Piefer said SHINE’s machine is much simpler than power-producing machines designed to confine plasma for long periods of time.

SHINE’s radioisotope business line earns significant revenue, Piefer said, though he declined to say exactly how much. The cash flow could eventually fund a push into nuclear waste recycling and then fusion power, according to a timeline on SHINE’s website.

“We won’t be first to Q>1, but we will be first to economics greater than one,” Piefer quipped — meaning SHINE expects to be profitable long before its competitors. “The worst-case outcome is we’ll be the most experienced builders of fusion facilities in the world and let others commercialize fusion power.”

Piefer, who has a PhD in nuclear engineering, agreed with LLNL’s Poole that it could take up to 30 years for that to happen. But despite his skepticism toward the current batch of startups and their aggressive timelines, even he believes commercial fusion-powered electricity generation is inevitable.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/IV08l7pwGQYMDSGSNhS9XMPyKdDoMhbfVnf4WTLJYNI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9Db21tb253ZWFsdGhfRnVzaW9uX1N5c3RlbXMuSlBH.webp,N,,2025-09-25 16:01:48.564200

The organization also developed Cleantech Innovation Pathways, a program for entrepreneurs that includes workshops, training, networking, and coaching.
“Our measure of success is how much innovation we can draw to Minnesota and how much we can support a homegrown innovation ecosystem,” says Axelson.
“That science foundation has been so critical not just for Grid Catalyst, but for all the jobs I’ve held since my time at the University.
“That’s going to continue through the type of work done by our partners, our cohorts, and research institutions like the University of Minnesota.”","Although Nina Axelson ’04 hasn’t been in a University of Minnesota Twin Cities classroom for a couple of decades, she’s still doing her homework, using what she learned as an environmental science major to support clean energy efforts that will have a ripple effect across the state and beyond.

Axelson launched clean energy accelerator Grid Catalyst in 2021. The company works with startups and innovators to clear a path to commercialization for their ideas. The organization also developed Cleantech Innovation Pathways, a program for entrepreneurs that includes workshops, training, networking, and coaching.

“Because of the science background I gained in my degree program, I have the type of systems-based thinking needed for these major projects,” says Axelson. “It’s not just the basics of the scientific method, it’s having the language and understanding about how that science can be applied that’s crucial. And that’s what I build on for supporting startups as they move through different stages of development.”

A bright future for clean energy

Earlier this year, Grid Catalyst announced its fifth cohort, a group of nine energy startups that pitched pilot projects to key partners like the University of Minnesota, CenterPoint Energy, 3M, Xcel Energy, Great River Energy, Mortenson, and others.

Three of the startups are based in Minnesota, and include technology that optimizes energy usage, provides environmentally responsible heating and cooling technologies, and develops liquid-immersion cooling systems for high-performance IT equipment. In the 2024 cohort, two of the startups were spinouts from the University of Minnesota.

“Our measure of success is how much innovation we can draw to Minnesota and how much we can support a homegrown innovation ecosystem,” says Axelson. “That means making sure Minnesota-based startups have strong opportunities that draw on the strength of higher education and corporations in the state.”

As she grows Grid Catalyst, Axelson relies on the University of Minnesota as a partner, as well as a source of potential startups: For example, a new summer program will work with about 25 students to train the next generation of STEM innovators, supported by the Carlson School of Management and the Institute on the Environment.

Nature as inspiration

For Axelson, interest in these efforts actually didn’t begin in a classroom. It started with wolves.

After initially studying business and communications at St. Cloud State, she left school to help her father recover from a stroke, then moved to Colorado. While there, she became aware of a conflict over the use of public land, particularly in regards to wolf management issues and ecosystem stability.

“That was when I realized I could take my love for the wilderness and apply it in a more formal degree program,” she says. As a transfer student to the University of Minnesota’s College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences, she appreciated being able to blend her interest in environmental science with her interest in policy and advocacy.

“I wanted to know how the science worked before I started to figure out how that could apply to working with people and advancing environmental action,” says Axelson. “The [degree] program was so interesting. It covered a wide variety of science-based fields, and then added insight into politics and business, with a look at how all of that intersected.”

The main advantage of her degree program, though, was the foundational knowledge she still uses daily. “Even 20 years later, I’m referencing quotes from my advisor and utilizing lessons from classes like forest ecology and botany,” Axelson says. “That science foundation has been so critical not just for Grid Catalyst, but for all the jobs I’ve held since my time at the University.

Axelson sees a bright future for a state that has a long history of people coming together to solve big problems, especially science-based challenges.

“That’s going to continue through the type of work done by our partners, our cohorts, and research institutions like the University of Minnesota.”",https://twin-cities.umn.edu/sites/twin-cities.umn.edu/files/nina-axelson.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 18:01:30.712352

“Until this happens, it will be difficult to build a fully vertically integrated sodium-ion manufacturing base in Europe,” he says.
Scrap rates in battery production can be high and they can quickly destroy your business.” Despite these challenges, Phenogy is committed to becoming a fully integrated manufacturer.
In the short term, sodium-ion systems remain more expensive than LFP, but Phenogy sees strategic buyers emerging.","Coming out of stealth, Switzerland’s Phenogy unveiled its first commercial-scale deployment on Wednesday – marking the largest sodium-ion battery installation in Europe to date.

The single-container system, installed at a commercial site near Bremen Airport in northern Germany, delivers 400 kW of power and offers nearly 1 MWh of storage capacity. It is paired with an existing 50 kW solar array and is currently operating in island mode, optimizing on-site energy consumption while powering electric vehicle chargers.

One of the primary challenges in deploying sodium-ion batteries at scale has been inverter compatibility, due to the broader voltage range compared to conventional lithium-ion systems. This made the choice of inverter technology critically important.

Phenogy integrated eight Sunny Island X 50 inverters from SMA into the 20-foot container. These inverters were designed to support applications beyond the widely used lithium iron phosphate (LFP) chemistry. They have an integrated DC-DC converter, allowing greater flexibility in voltage matching. SMA provided pre-production units of the Sunny Island X 50 to the Bremen site, marking one of the first installations of this new product.

Phenogy says its PHENOGY 1.0 system is designed for a broad range of applications – including industrial, commercial, grid, critical infrastructure, and EV charging – though detailed technical specifications have not been released.

Strategic alternative

In recent years, sodium-ion batteries have emerged as a strong contender to lithium-ion technology. While often described as a cheaper and more sustainable alternative, thanks to the abundance of sodium and relatively low extraction costs, the technology still faces several hurdles before reaching mass-market viability.

China is currently leading the way — both in technology development, driven by companies like CATL, BYD, and Huawei, and in deployment, with 100 MW-scale projects and multiple hybrid systems combining sodium-ion with lithium-ion and even grid-forming inverters.

“It would be a strategic mistake to invest in large-scale LFP production in Europe today and still remain dependent on China due to the import of precursors,” says Max Kory, CTO of Phenogy, in an interview with ESS News. “Lithium prices will rise again – with mine closures in China, the market is nearing a breaking point. As prices climb, alternative chemistries become more attractive, and sodium-ion is the prime candidate for building a localized supply chains in Europe and North America.”

While sodium and other key materials are widely available, Kory emphasizes that the critical step is establishing local production of cathode and anode materials, particularly hard carbon – which can be synthesized from agricultural waste like nut shells, cellulose, and banana peels.

“Until this happens, it will be difficult to build a fully vertically integrated sodium-ion manufacturing base in Europe,” he says. “The experiences of Northvolt in Europe and Natron Energy in the US show that it’s hard to do this alone. Scrap rates in battery production can be high and they can quickly destroy your business.”

Despite these challenges, Phenogy is committed to becoming a fully integrated manufacturer.

“For real strategic impact, we need vertical integration,” Kory says. “In the US, we see a much stronger push for supply chain independence. They also experience more frequent blackouts and face growing electricity demand from expanding data center fleets. That’s why we’ve also established operations in South Carolina.”

While mass-market demand for sodium-ion may not there yet, Phenogy is betting on the technology’s intrinsic advantages to gain traction. These include: broader temperature tolerance and decent energy density – “currently still slightly below LFP”, according to Kory.

In the short term, sodium-ion systems remain more expensive than LFP, but Phenogy sees strategic buyers emerging.

“For a growing number of customers, technology choices are strategic decisions, not purely economic,” says Kory. “The product doesn’t need to be cheaper. In a world of volatile raw material prices and rising geopolitical risks, supply chain independence is critical.”

Founded in 2019, Phenogy employs approximately 60 people across Europe and the US. Its partner network include the University of South Carolina in Columbia, the Exentis Group AG, a specialist in industrial additive manufacturing, and several Fraunhofer Institutes.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/PHENOGY-BESS-1Punkt0.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 12:08:15.038000

However, there is some debate surrounding the overall environmental footprint of electric vehicles, from the mining of various metallic inputs to end-of-life recycling. In addition, the heavier weight of EVs has raised concerns regarding particle emissions from tires outweighing or partially cancelling out the benefits of zero tailpipe emissions. Finally, market watchers and drivers alike are right to question the environmental credentials of EVs on the road in countries such as India and China, which continue to construct dozens of coal-fired power plants annually.

Materialistically speaking

Rather than debate the merits and demerits of EVs versus their internal combustion engine (ICE) powered brethren, in this article we take a look at how plastics are reducing the environmental burden of road-going vehicles.

One recent announcement highlighted how corn might be a key contributor in the onroad sustainability drive beyond its role as a key input for environmentally friendly bio-ethanol fuel. The boost is coming from US-based polypropylene (PP) newcomer Citroniq, with its biogenic PP facility in Nebraska scheduled to become operational in 2029, bringing onstream 600,000 tonnes/year of low-carbon-footprint capacity and capturing three million metric tons of CO₂ annually and permanently storing it as solid pellets in the process. Two additional plants of similar scale are planned at Falls City, NE.

Durable biopolymers

While bio-based polymers are commonly associated with disposable applications such as packaging and serviceware, the European Commission has expressed a preference for these plastics to function as a means of carbon capture, hence the linking of durable uses such as construction materials and, indeed, automotive. A recent study by consultant IDTechEx forecast 25.4% compound annual growth for bio-based polymers overall, reaching more than 500,000 tonnes in automotive applications by 2035.

Further, Singapore-based consultancy MLT Analytics predicted even before the mega-announcement of Citroniq that bio-based polypropylene would become the dominant bio-based polyolefin, in part, because of its use in durable applications such as automotive. MLT Analytics predicted in 2024 that this application would grow to 360,000 tonnes by 2032.

Sustainability challenges

Besides PP, bio-based polyamides and even biodegradable polylactic acid (PLA) compounds are expected to find use in automotive applications. James Kennedy, technology analyst at IDTechEx, cautions that key challenges in adoption include material availability and cost in the case of bio-based polymers and compounds incorporating recycled content and, in some cases, variable material properties for recycled content grades. “The situation varies significantly by polymer and application. For certain components, such as mono-material polypropylene interior components, the challenges of introducing recycled content are more straightforward to overcome,” notes Kennedy. “These are currently the major target for automotive manufacturers and will remain so for the short and medium term.

“However, more specialized components from less widely utilized polymers present greater challenges,” adds Kennedy. “Sustainable alternatives to virgin specialized polymers are harder to source and, in the case of composite materials, present further challenges to end-of-life. These highlight just some of the key challenges the automotive industry faces to integrate sustainable materials.”

Fibers in the scope

Another sustainable option is natural fiber reinforcement. A pioneer in this nascent market is Swiss company BComp, whose natural flax-reinforced ampliTex and powerRibs composites offer a sustainable alternative to carbon-fiber-reinforced components and other composite alternatives. Proven on the racetrack and in concept cars, Bcomp composites have more recently found their way into production vehicles such as the seatbacks of the e Cupra Born VZ electric vehicle and trim for the dashboard and doors of the Volvo EX30. Back in 2018, Volvo was one of the first OEMs to announce a sustainable plastics target for its vehicles.

Sustainability on two wheels

Back on the track, Bcomp’s latest initiaitive is a joint project with leading Japanese composite specialist Tras to bring natural fiber composite solutions to the world of motorcycle racing. Tras has been making the bodywork of Suzuki’s MotoGP bikes for over 20 years, including manufacturing the full body of Suzuki’s winning GSX-RR. Its latest demo machine featured a natural fiber cowl made using Bcomp’s cutting-edge materials.

Now, why limit adoption of sustainable materials to those making their way around on two or four wheels? While largely absent from Western roads, three wheelers are a major mode of transportation in Asia, headed by India. Perhaps this market, which is already starting to transition to electric propulsion, might be the next to get the sustainable plastics treatment.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt08823f5db61ded5d/bltb593141ce6072501/68d412b494c047108c86c218/Sustainable-resins.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-25 12:08:28.968884

Then, way back in 2019, CATL introduced a cell-to-pack architecture, which, by dispensing with modules, allowed a battery pack to be made lighter and smaller.
Now, EV battery manufacturer 24M Technologies has taken the next logical step, apparently dispensing with cells.
Or, designers could replace NMC chemistry with less expensive LFP technology, resulting in a less costly pack with the same range.
“It truly is the closest version of an ideal battery—it is essentially all active material in a sophisticated wrapper.”","We EV veterans remember the old days, when a battery pack was designed according to a strict hierarchy: cell, module, pack. Then, way back in 2019, CATL introduced a cell-to-pack architecture, which, by dispensing with modules, allowed a battery pack to be made lighter and smaller. This technology has since reached its third generation, and we don’t hear much about modules anymore.

Now, EV battery manufacturer 24M Technologies has taken the next logical step, apparently dispensing with cells. 24M’s Electrode-to-Pack (ETOP) technology “seals electrodes in thin polymer films that are then integrated directly into the pack to vastly improve packaging efficiencies.”

“Lithium-ion batteries feature a large proportion of inactive, non-energy-carrying materials—such as supporting metals and plastics—within a cell’s casing, adding cost and wasting space,” 24M explains. “The ETOP architecture replaces this approach by creating a sealed cathode/anode pair that eliminates the cell and module and unnecessary materials. This allows manufacturers to achieve the highest energy density for any chemistry (NMC, LFP, NCA, sodium-ion, LTO, LiS, etc) at the pack level, because a higher percentage of the battery is electrodes, the energy-storing components.”

24M claims that its ETOP tech makes it possible for electrodes to comprise 80% of a pack’s volume, compared to the 30% to 60% of traditional battery packs. EV designers can choose to take advantage of the additional energy density either to increase range by packing more energy into the same size pack, or to reduce vehicle costs by using less expensive chemistries to deliver the same range with a smaller pack.

For example, according to 24M, a 75 kWh NMC battery pack could be increased in capacity to over 100 kWh, increasing range by 33% with no increase in size. Or, designers could replace NMC chemistry with less expensive LFP technology, resulting in a less costly pack with the same range.

24M also describes manufacturing benefits: “Because electrodes are sealed individually, electrode safety tolerances do not have to be as tight as in a traditional battery, improving yield and safety while reducing investment costs by eliminating the need for traditional high-tolerance and precision equipment. Because the sealed electrodes can be flipped, they can be connected in series and parallel arrangements, enabling anything from a compact 48 V battery all the way up to a mixed series/parallel 400-800 V pack, giving battery designers further freedom.”

“24M ETOP makes it easier to build compact, flexible and safe high-voltage batteries, presenting a revolutionary opportunity for EV manufacturers—longer ranges with the same chemistry or the same range with lower cost, safer chemistries, both in the same space,” said Naoki Ota, President and CEO at 24M Technologies. “It truly is the closest version of an ideal battery—it is essentially all active material in a sophisticated wrapper.”",https://chargedevs.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETOP-Still_micedSeriesParallel_3840x2160-002.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:01:38.893387

By 2035, New Jersey’s green workforce is expected to grow by over 14,000 net jobs. As the State continues expanding clean energy resources and navigates a dramatically changed federal policy environment, the report assesses the State’s green economy workforce and explores what the future may look like for New Jersey workers.

The report identifies 12 priority occupations necessary to meet New Jersey’s green economy goals, all of which have higher wages than the national average. Electricians are projected to see the largest growth in new jobs, followed by Plumbers, HVAC Mechanics and Installers and Solar Installers.

“As the growth of our green economy adds thousands of family-sustaining jobs in New Jersey, this report will help guide our continued commitment to meeting the demand for workforce development and coordination across our educational institutions, unions, and training providers,” said Governor Phil Murphy.

Training providers and programs exist for all top green occupations in New Jersey, specifically those that require more specialized skill sets. Most priority occupations are also accessible, with 10 out of 12 only requiring a high school diploma or equivalent. The report finds stronger coordination and connections to be beneficial between employers in green industries and the many entities in the New Jersey workforce ecosystem, such as educators, unions, training providers, and community groups.

State agencies have more of a leadership role in this capacity than is seen in other states, particularly the Department of Labor and Workforce Development (DOL) and the Economic Development Authority (EDA). According to the report, New Jersey has the opportunity improve access to training opportunities in southern parts of the State. Appendices in the Green Jobs Report provide a comprehensive list of training opportunities, wrapround services, and an inventory of related policies and programs in New Jersey.

“Cultivating a skilled workforce has long been a cornerstone of New Jersey's vision for sustainability, and the Department of Labor is proud of our ongoing success in developing clear pathways to employment in this area through strategic investments in education, training, and apprenticeship programs,” said Robert Asaro-Angelo, Commissioner of the Department of Labor and Workforce Development and Co-Chair on the New Jersey Council on the Green Economy. “Our goal is to continue ensuring every New Jerseyan has the opportunity to thrive in this emerging industry, transforming not just careers but entire communities as we transition to a more environmentally responsible future.”

EDA’s Apprenticeship Training Centers Construction Grant Program makes $9.7 million available to support the development of training centers for Registered Apprenticeship programs in the building and construction trades, with a particular focus on overburdened communities. The program is accepting applications until Monday, September 29th.

“The NJEDA’s Apprenticeship Training Centers Construction Grant Program will help expand workforce development programs across the state, particularly in Overburdened Communities, helping prepare residents for good-paying careers in the building and construction trades,” said NJEDA Chief Executive Officer Tim Sullivan. “Under Governor Murphy’s leadership, New Jersey has continued to invest in innovative apprenticeship programs aimed to promote equitable economic opportunities and strengthen communities.”

In addition, in April 2025, EDA announced over $4.3 million awarded in four Green Workforce Training Grants, which will develop training programs to prepare New Jersey residents for green economy careers.

Many stakeholders highlighted the groundbreaking work implemented in New Jersey’s public schools to reach kindergarten through 12th grade (K-12) student populations with a curriculum focused on sustainability, as well as an expansion of summer and pre-college programs and workshops focused on clean energy.

“In New Jersey, we have made empowering our children to lead the jobs of the future green economy our priority. Through our first-in-the-nation K-12 climate change education standards, we are preparing students for exciting, new opportunities in the State’s growing green workforce,"" said First Lady Tammy Murphy. “Equipping our students with the tools necessary to build a stronger and cleaner New Jersey is one of the most powerful and important things we can do for the future.”

This summer marked the fifth year of the Department of Environmental Protection (DEP)’s highly successful Youth Inclusion Initiative, an innovative summer workforce development program. Partnerships between DEP and community-based organizations provide young people, particularly from communities with limited access to natural lands, with opportunities to learn about a wide variety of environmental careers. From 2021 to 2025, NJDEP invested nearly $2.5 million, hosting around 275 youth from across New Jersey.

“Cultivating the next generation of New Jersey’s environmental stewards is a gift that not only protects our lands and natural resources for others but grows and sustains a robust green economy benefiting our state and nation,” said Department of Environmental Protection Commissioner Shawn M. LaTourette. “We are proud of the Youth Inclusion Initiative’s success in providing young people from diverse communities with invaluable exposure to environmental careers.”

Our Higher Education institutions also play an important role. For ten years, Montclair State University’s PSEG Institute for Sustainability Studies annual Green Teams program has empowered students to create real-world sustainability solutions in communities across New Jersey and beyond. This year’s cohort reflects the program’s growing impact, with 50 interns from 16 states.

Workforce considerations in New Jersey’s green economy include green infrastructure technologies such as water, waste, and wastewater treatment and management, as well as stormwater and resiliency infrastructure. Clean energy technologies include grid infrastructure and storage, renewable energy generation and fuels, energy efficiency and alternative vehicles.

“New Jersey's clean energy transition is powering more than just our grid – it’s powering thousands of career opportunities. As we accelerate our transformation through grid modernization, renewable energy deployment, and energy efficiency programs, we’re not just building a cleaner future, we're building high-wage careers that will sustain New Jersey families for generations,” said NJBPU President Christine Guhl-Sadovy. “The NJBPU is committed to ensuring our clean energy investments translate into real opportunities for New Jersey workers at every skill level.”

Modeling for the report calculated the employment impacts associated with in-state capital and operational expenditures on clean electricity and fuel resources, building efficiency and electrification measures, alternative transportation adoption, and green infrastructure development.

As DEP, EDA, and BPU work to release the 2026-2028 Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI) Strategic Funding Plan, the Scoping Document provides an optimistic outlook for the green workforce in New Jersey, noting that “with a continued commitment to addressing climate change and expanding clean energy, New Jersey will add tens of thousands of jobs to its green economy.”

To drive this growth, EDA has proposed dedicating a portion of 26-28 RGGI Auction proceeds for incentives and other funding investments in clean energy supply chain related manufacturing development; clean energy technology development, innovation hubs, and accelerators; and complementary workforce development, training, and education.

Public stakeholder meetings were held in August and September on the 2026-2028 RGGI Strategic Funding Plan, which will be published in Fall of 2025.

The New Jersey 2025 Green Jobs Report was developed through State agency collaboration by the Economic Development Authority, the Board of Public Utilities, the Department of Labor, the Governor’s Office, and BW Research Partnership (BW). In addition to extensive research, BW conducted executive interviews with over three dozen stakeholders involved in New Jersey’s workforce and energy ecosystem to uncover existing challenges, needs, and opportunities in the state’s green industries.

From 2022 to 2024, funding and programming for workforce development expanded dramatically at both state and federal levels. The Biden White House reported funding 130 projects in New Jersey through the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).",https://nj.gov/governor/library/facebook_card.png,N,,2025-09-25 13:01:50.545247

A final investment decision on the first phase of the project is expected by November, a few months behind the original schedule, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the financing talks are private. The terminal is expected to cost about $4.3 billion, the people said. Citigroup Inc. and Moelis & Co. are working with the closely held US company on the financing, which is expected to come from a mix of debt and equity, Bloomberg News previously reported.

LNG project developers in the US are racing to tie up financing before global supplies exceed demand, creating a glut that BloombergNEF expects to emerge by 2027. While the heating and power-plant fuel has been touted by President Donald Trump as key to achieving US energy dominance, Qatar is progressing with its own years-long LNG build-out and a massive pipeline expansion by Gazprom PJSC could begin funneling more Russian gas to China by 2031.

United States.

Winning a climate case on constitutional grounds will likely be challenging, Gerrard said.
He could grant the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, or allow the executive orders to stand while letting the case proceed to trial.","MISSOULA, Mont.—During a short recess in their first hearing, the young plaintiffs in the Lighthiser v. Trump lawsuit gathered outside the courtroom to dance along to a TikTok video.

They’d been listening to nearly two days’ worth of testimony and legal arguments that began Sept. 16, sitting attentively in their button-down shirts, khakis and one thrift-store purple suit. Five of them had taken the stand themselves, describing how climate change was threatening their futures, then facing cross-examination from U.S. Department of Justice lawyers. It was time to just be kids for a moment.

The 22 youth plaintiffs had their first day in court at a hearing before the U.S. District Court of Montana in Missoula, where they, supported by a slate of expert witnesses, asked Judge Dana L. Christensen to issue a preliminary injunction against three of President Trump’s executive orders designed to “unleash” fossil fuels. The Department of Justice, along with “intervenors” from 18 state governments and Guam, all asked for the case to be dismissed.

The three executive orders—“Unleashing American Energy,” “Declaring a National Energy Emergency” and “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry”—direct the executive branch to remove burdens to domestic energy production, especially coal, but exclude wind and solar power from those actions. The plaintiffs argued that this acceleration of fossil fuel development harms their physical, mental and economic health. And they spent a good deal of time emphatically asserting that their case was not the same as Juliana v. United States.

Their success hinges on whether or not the courts agree on that last point.

The two cases have undeniable similarities. Both feature young plaintiffs—Lighthiser’s range from 7 to 25—who allege the federal government is violating their Constitutional rights by promoting fossil fuels. (Some of the Juliana plaintiffs are now part of the Lighthiser case.) Both were filed by Our Children’s Trust, a nonprofit law firm dedicated to climate work. But where Juliana wound its way through the legal system for 10 years before finally being dismissed for lack of standing (the right to bring a case to court) last March, the Lighthiser team hopes this case will hit the mark.

“Outlining the differences between Juliana and Lighthiser is super-important,” said Miko Vergun, 24, of Oregon, a plaintiff in both cases. “In Juliana, we were trying to ask for a climate recovery plan. And we were also arguing that we had the constitutional right to a stable climate that the federal government was continuously infringing upon. In this case, we’re arguing that the three executive orders that Trump had implemented are infringing on those constitutional rights to life and liberty.”

The hopes of climate activists following the Lighthiser proceedings have been buoyed by the success of another climate suit brought to a Montana courtroom by Our Children’s Trust, Held v. Montana in 2023, which included 15 of the current plaintiffs. But that case was against the state of Montana, whose constitution guarantees the right to “a clean and healthful environment,” which the U.S. Constitution does not do.

The plaintiffs this time around crafted their request to the court to sidestep the questions about standing that sunk Juliana. To have the legal standing to bring a case in federal court, plaintiffs must prove three things: that they have been harmed; that their harm was caused by the action they’re challenging, which is known as “traceability”; and that the court has the power to address that harm—“redressability.” In Juliana, the courts ultimately ruled that the judicial branch doesn’t have the power to compel the federal government to adopt a specific energy policy. Lighthiser asks the court for a narrower ruling: a declaration that the three executive orders are unconstitutional.

The plaintiffs who testified at the hearing spoke about how climate change personally affected them. Joseph Lee, 19, of California, described being hospitalized for heatstroke. Avery McRae, 20, who attends college in Florida, testified that hurricanes forced her to evacuate from her campus three times in two years. Californian Jeffrey K. (lawyers withheld his last name because he’s a minor), 11, told the court that worsening wildfire smoke poses a significant risk to him and his younger brother, both of whom have lung conditions. “Unleashing fossil fuels will definitely make the entire environment, heat-wise, air quality-wise, worse,” he said. All five mentioned mental health impacts like fear, anxiety, sadness and uncertainty about their futures.

“[The defendants] really aren’t questioning that the young people are being injured in this case,” said Andrea Rodgers, deputy director of U.S. Strategy for Our Children’s Trust.

But the traceability and redressability standards pose a larger hurdle for the plaintiffs, dragging in thorny questions about the separation of powers between branches of the U.S. government.

The plaintiffs allege that a slew of recent government actions can be linked to the three executive orders, including the canceling of wind power permits, the extension of the length of time that some coal plants will operate, the dismissing of federal climate scientists and proposals to shut down climate research satellites and rescind the Environmental Protection Agency’s critical endangerment finding that is the basis of its regulation of greenhouse gases. Many of those decisions didn’t explicitly mention the three executive orders, but the plaintiffs argue that the orders could be reasonably inferred to have caused those actions.

John Podesta, a former climate advisor to Presidents Biden and Obama, testified at the hearing, “These decisions predictably and directly flow from these orders…These kids are being harmed by this action, and this court can do something about that.”

The hearing broached the question of exactly what a preliminary injunction would change about the Trump administration’s actions.

“I’m troubled by the practical effects of what you’re asking me to do,” Christensen told Julia Olson, the plaintiffs’ chief legal counsel, last week. He wondered aloud if issuing the preliminary injunction meant he’d be required to review every fossil fuel-related action the government took in the future. For example, he asked, if the administration issued a permit for a coal mine expansion in Montana, would that be a violation of his order? And how could the order also make the administration give out more permits for wind and solar projects?

The defense has seized on that concern. Michael Sawyer, the lead Department of Justice lawyer, argued that the plaintiffs would claim the injunction they’re asking Christensen to issue was violated “every time the agencies did something they don’t like.”

“We have hundreds, maybe thousands, of lawsuits packed into one,” he added

Another core issue—and the one that most bedeviled the Juliana case—is who bears responsibility for the country’s energy decisions.

“The question is, is it the role of the courts to be making major decisions about national energy policy, or does that need to be left to Congress and the president?” said Michael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School. “[The Lighthiser plaintiffs] are asking for less than the plaintiffs requested in Juliana, but they’re still asking a lot.”

The Department of Justice argues that decisions about energy permits and regulations belong squarely to the executive branch, not the courts. In the hearing, Sawyer went so far as to call the case “at its core, an undemocratic lawsuit,” because voters had elected Trump knowing his preference for fossil fuels.

Plaintiffs counter that the courts have a right to challenge energy policy if it affects their fundamental rights.

“If policymakers could decide to threaten children’s lives, then the Bill of Rights would mean nothing,” Olson told Christensen.

Both sides agree that the court stepping in on a climate matter like this would be unprecedented. But the plaintiffs expressly ask for a groundbreaking ruling. Olson even compared a ruling in their favor to Brown v. Board of Education, the 1954 Supreme Court decision that declared racial segregation in schools unconstitutional.

Winning a climate case on constitutional grounds will likely be challenging, Gerrard said.

The success of Our Children’s Trust in Held v. Montana in 2023 meant the state would have to consider greenhouse gas emissions in its permitting processes. But Montana’s guarantee of a healthy and clean environment in its state constitution “made an enormous difference,” Gerrard said.

Without any environmental rights spelled out in the U.S. Constitution, plaintiffs now rely on a court interpreting the right to a stable climate as falling under the rights to life and liberty.

Department of Justice lawyers put forth a number of other arguments: that the executive orders don’t pose an imminent threat to the youth plaintiffs; that the additional carbon emissions associated with the orders are negligible on a global scale; that many of the challenged government actions—like the rescinding of the endangerment finding—are still only proposals that might not actually be enacted; and that a clean-energy grid would be unreliable, more expensive and damaging to U.S. trade relations.

The defendants didn’t call any witnesses for their case. And they struck the loudest note by repeatedly comparing Lighthiser to Juliana. “This is the same case,” Sawyer argued in court.

Both sides now await Christensen’s ruling. He could grant the plaintiffs’ request for a preliminary injunction, or allow the executive orders to stand while letting the case proceed to trial. Or he could dismiss it. If that happens, Our Children’s Trust can appeal to the Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit.

After the Sept. 17 hearing wrapped, the plaintiffs posed for photos outside the courthouse, fists raised. “Getting to hear my co-plaintiffs testify was incredibly inspiring,” said Eva Lighthiser, 19, of Montana, the lead plaintiff and part of the Held case two years ago. “It’s so incredible to not only have the opportunities we did during Held, but also have our voices heard just now.”

But one expert leaving the courtroom expressed uncertainty about the case’s prospects, even though he believes the scientific underpinnings of the case are irrefutable. Steven Running, a Nobel Peace Prize-winning climate scientist who testified for the plaintiffs, unlocked his bike from a rack in front of the courthouse and clicked on his helmet. He said he appreciated the chance to present climate science to the court, but that the legal wrangling to come was “way beyond my pay grade.”

The first phase of the Salcos Green Steel Project is well underway, and once operational, the site will reduce CO₂ emissions from steelmaking by around 30%, or approximately 2 million tonnes of steel.
However, the planned delay of the Salcos Green Steel Project has cast a shadow over the hydrogen sector in Germany.","Germany’s second-largest steel producer has announced a three-year delay to a substantial project that is already in the first stage. The planned project will halt as it enters the second phase due to worsening economic conditions and regulatory uncertainty. Hydrogen plays a crucial role in the production of green steel; however, worsening markets and regulatory problems have led the company in question to halt its final phase for the flagship Salcos Green Steel Project in Salzgitter, Germany.

The billion-dollar project aims to reduce carbon emissions in the steel industry

Salzgitter AG plays an integral role in the German steel sector. The company is Germany’s second largest steel producer and, as such, has developed several key measures to reduce the amount of carbon produced by the steel industry in Germany. The Salcos Green Steel Project is already far along in the first phase, but the company stated it would implement a three-year delay for the final stages.

The project is reportedly going to cost roughly €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion), approximately €1 billion of that amount comes in the form of invaluable government grants. The project aims to make use of hydrogen to produce green steel, which has a much lower carbon emission level than that of traditional steel production methods.

“The economic environment is not ready. Hydrogen markets are developing more slowly than expected, and promised regulatory changes are still missing,” – Gunnar Groebler, CEO of Salzgitter AG

The delay raises concerns over Germany’s ability to meet its ambitious climate goals

Germany, along with the rest of the world, is hard at work implementing measures across several sectors that aim to alleviate the pressure on the climate. Several countries have made significant carbon reduction commitments in recent years. The first phase of the Salcos Green Steel Project is well underway, and once operational, the site will reduce CO₂ emissions from steelmaking by around 30%, or approximately 2 million tonnes of steel.

The company has now stated that it plans to revisit investment decisions for the second expansion stage in 2028 or 2029, instead of the initial 2026 timeline. The challenges encapsulate the problems that the German steel industry is facing at the moment. Earlier this year, another major steel producer in Germany rolled back plans to convert two German plants to carbon-neutral production.

Germany is doing everything in its power to accelerate the transition to green energy, thanks to government subsidies and renewable energy expansion. However, the planned delay of the Salcos Green Steel Project has cast a shadow over the hydrogen sector in Germany. The European nation has made significant moves to ensure hydrogen is a part of the future, despite the planned delay of the new site.

Steel production in Germany has seen significant drops in production numbers in recent years

The company reported that in the first half of 2025, it reduced steel production by 12.1% compared to the same period in 2024, which amounts to roughly 2.93 million tons. It also reported that total external sales fell by 11% year-on-year to €4.66 billion. The steel sector in Germany is facing an uphill battle to remain relevant in the modern-day energy sector.

Focusing narrowly on NEPA, we should resist efforts to eliminate public participation, something that the Trump Administration is now doing.
NEPA aimed to push agencies into better planning, but that hasn’t worked very well, partly due to adverse court decisions.
NEPA has made the environment part of every agency’s agenda, but courts don’t always seem to understand that.","What do we really want NEPA to do? And what’s the best way to do it?

NEPA has been weakened by Congress, the White House, and the Supreme Court. It’s attacked by both the oil renewables industry. Imagining reform legislation from Congress is difficult, but it’s worth imagining, if only as a thought experiment, how we could do better. I would suggest we start by asking what we can expect NEPA to accomplish after fifty years of judicial decisions and agency practice – and whether there are better ways of accomplishing those things.

Basically, my recommendations come down to doing more in the way of larger-scale planning, with more data collection, public participation, and environmental analysis before specific proposals are on the table. We should also push monitoring and mitigation commitments if problems arise during or after construction. The payoff in efficiency terms would be a quicker project for approving individual projects with less less litigation at that stage.

Goal #1: Better informed decisions. Environmental impact statements (and often their shorter siblings, environmental assessments) do give agencies a lot of information. But often this is after the agency has basically made up its mind. What we really need is to have much better information before proposals are even made. Here are two ways of accomplishing this: First, create a National Ecological Survey to provide detailed information about ecosystems across the nation. Among other things, this would allow project planners to pick sites with lower environmental impacts. Programmatic environmental impact statements could be used for these zoning decisions.

Second, require project proponents to conduct environmental surveys of sites before applying so that the agency and the public would have specific information about the site, and provide early opportunities for outsiders to provide additional site-specific information.

Goal #2. Public participation. This should be an independent requirement for permitting. That should include posting of project materials online; the opportunity for public comment; and the public hearings for significant projects. There should be enough lead-time to allow communities time to become informed. Focusing narrowly on NEPA, we should resist efforts to eliminate public participation, something that the Trump Administration is now doing. However, we should structure input in a way that will provide useful information rather than encouraging NIMBYism.

Goal #3: Better planning. NEPA aimed to push agencies into better planning, but that hasn’t worked very well, partly due to adverse court decisions. If we want better plans, we need to be more explicit in imposing planning mandates. I’d suggest that Congress require regional planning efforts by public lands agencies on a regular timetable, building in opportunities for public comment and peer review. Agencies should be required to consider the interconnected nature of environmental issues and the long-term consequences of their programs. Again, programmatic impact statements would offer a good mechanism for this planning projetct.

Goal #4: Project mitigation. We want to give project proponents an incentive to find ways to mitigate impacts. We should just make this a legal requirement for projects and require posting a bond to cover the costs for mitigating any remaining impacts after a project is in operation. Short of that, when project sponsors voluntarily take this step, courts should cut them more slack in reviewing the impact statement.

Goal #5: Making agencies consider the environment. NEPA has made the environment part of every agency’s agenda, but courts don’t always seem to understand that. We need a clearer mandate for all agencies to provide a reasoned explanation of how environmental factored into their decisions, just as they do for non-environmental policy goals set by Congress. For major projects, we should encourage peer review by independent experts rather than relying entirely on after-the-fact judicial review to improve decisions.

Donors to Texas Gov's PAC Have Received Nearly $1 Billion in No-Bid State Contracts,"julia-conley, www.facebook.com",,,,,https://www.commondreams.org/news/texans-for-greg-abbott-pac-name,"A new report on no-bid contracts awarded in Texas to corporations after they donated to Republican Gov.
The organization released a report, Awarding Influence, on no-bid contracts that were awarded by Abbott from 2020-24 after he declared state emergencies over border security, Hurricane Beryl, and the coronavirus pandemic.
Donors to Abbott's political action committee, Texans for Greg Abbott PAC, received approximately $950 million in at least 89 state contracts during those emergencies.
“The groups were awarded the contracts after they made large contributions to the governor or his [super PAC].
One of Doggett's companies, Doggett Freightliners of South Texas, received two noncompetitive contracts—identified only as ""fees"" on paperwork—worth $1.6 million in 2022 and 2023.","A new report on no-bid contracts awarded in Texas to corporations after they donated to Republican Gov. Greg Abbott's political action committee exemplifies why many people ""lose faith in their government,"" said one advocate at the watchdog group Public Citizen on Wednesday.

The organization released a report, Awarding Influence, on no-bid contracts that were awarded by Abbott from 2020-24 after he declared state emergencies over border security, Hurricane Beryl, and the coronavirus pandemic.

Donors to Abbott's political action committee, Texans for Greg Abbott PAC, received approximately $950 million in at least 89 state contracts during those emergencies. The companies—including through their subsidiaries, PACs, executives, and executives' spouses—donated a collective $2.9 million to Abbott in 96 contributions between 2014-25.

""The timing of the contributions is suspect,” said Andrew Cates, an attorney and government ethics expert. “The groups were awarded the contracts after they made large contributions to the governor or his [super PAC]. If it were the other way around, it could be viewed as a thank-you contribution, but this way feels much more pay-to-play when procurement money flows quickly after large contributions.""

Cates said one particular donor, Doggett Equipment Services Group, drew the scrutiny of Public Citizen due to $1.6 million it was awarded in no-bid state contracts that were simply labeled ""fees.""

The company provides services to the heavy equipment industry across Texas and it CEO, William ""Leslie"" Doggett, has contributed more than $1.7 million to Texans for Greg Abbott since 2014, either personally or through his corporation.

One of Doggett's companies, Doggett Freightliners of South Texas, received two noncompetitive contracts—identified only as ""fees"" on paperwork—worth $1.6 million in 2022 and 2023. One of the contracts was finalized eight days after Doggett donated $500,000 to the PAC.

Cates said the Doggett contracts were ""especially egregious.""

Doggett's apparent transaction with Abbott's PAC did not make his company the largest recipient of no-bid contracts detailed in the report; that distinction goes to Gothams LLC, an emergency management company that received nearly $640 million in contracts in 2021 and 2022.

After pandemic contracts began to slow in 2022, Gothams received just one contract worth $43 million—but after its founder, Matthew Michelsen, started sending donations to Texans for Greg Abbott that totaled $600,000, the firm received 10 contracts worth $66 million.

""People lose faith in their government when they see a system that appears to benefit those who can buy access to elected officials,” said Adrian Shelley, the Texas director of Public Citizen. “Even when no laws are broken, insider dealing undermines confidence in state government. People conclude that the government works for wealthy people first and everyday Texans second.""

In another example from the report, infrastructure development firm HNTB Holdings received an emergency contract worth $2.6 million in 2021 to provide software updates. Since 2015, the company, its PAC, and its senior officials have contributed $193,750 to Texans for Greg Abbott

“All of the companies identified in this report, either through corporate PACs or individuals affiliated with the company, contributed significant amounts to Texans for Greg Abbott,"" said Cassidy Levin, a research fellow at Public Citizen. ""Lawmakers should adopt stronger restrictions on pay-to-play practices in government contracting and implement reporting requirements for the governor’s office in the aftermath of an emergency.”

The group called on Texas officials to make changes to the state's contract procurement rules, including by:

Banning no-bid contract awards to companies whose PACs, officers, or families of officers have made political donations above a given threshold within the last election cycle;

Barring recipients of no-bid contracts from making contributions above a given threshold for a given period of time;

Establishing a more thorough and transparent reporting process of the awarding of no-bid contracts after disaster and emergency declarations; and

Imposing penalties for noncompliance, including contract forfeiture.

The report acknowledges that ""disaster response includes the rapid deployment of resources to areas of need"" and that ""the speed involved may make normal contract bid and award procedures impossible.""

However, reads the conclusion, ""ethics laws should be sufficient to eliminate conflict and the appearance of conflict in government decision-making.""

Shelley added that ""there are simple safeguards that lawmakers could implement to avoid apparent conflicts of interest while still allowing the state to respond quickly to emergencies.”",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=61189983&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C85%2C0%2C86,N,,2025-09-25 12:07:54.994971

“Through this campaign, we want to show that collective action on lithium-ion battery recycling directly supports American energy independence,” says Morgan Crapps, director of public affairs and government relations for Redwood. “Each battery and device we recycle keeps our nation’s valuable, finite natural resources in circulation and creates jobs right here in our community.”

As part of the campaign, ESFI and Redwood say they also will partner with the South Carolina Department of Environmental Services (SCDES) as part of its “Be Battery Smart” campaign to expand battery collection and education.

“Collaborating on public education campaigns is critical to addressing the lack of consumer awareness about the proper disposal and recycling of lithium-ion batteries,” says SCDES Director Myra Reece says. “With these types of batteries becoming so commonplace in our daily lives, it’s important for everyone to understand how safe recycling of these batteries protects both people and the environment.”

ESFI says one of its key priorities in recent years has been LIB safety, where it has filled in gaps for safety messaging about all parts of the battery life cycle, from responsible shopping to safe use to proper repurposing. Through conducting consumer surveys and working with manufacturers, distributors, regulators and product safety testing laboratories, ESFI says it has “become a leading voice in the space, reaching millions of people nationwide.”

“This partnership comes at the perfect time, as ESFI begins preparing for the National Fire Protection Association’s Fire Prevention Week campaign,” says Jennifer LeFevre, executive director of Arlington, Virginia-based ESFI. “This year’s theme, ‘Charge into Fire Safety: Lithium-ion Batteries in Your Home,’ aligns perfectly with the messaging that ESFI has been using for years to educate the public about how to safely charge, use and repurpose their rechargeable devices.”",https://www.recyclingtoday.com/fileuploads/image/2025/09/25/adobestock_110768217-web.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 14:02:41.170522

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation represents almost all major automakers and suppliers operating in America—From the manufacturers producing vehicles, to autonomous vehicle innovators, equipment suppliers, battery producers, and semiconductor makers.

The rules require automakers to cut fleetwide emissions nearly 50 percent by 2032, a target that, byt the EPA's own estimates, would require between 35 and 56 percent of new vehicle sales to be fully electric.

Automakers argue that, with consumer demand cooling, charging infrastructure still limited, and supply chains strained, the standards are “divorced from current market realities.”

On September 30, the federal $7,500 consumer EV tax credit will go away. At the same time, automakers could lose a separate production credit worth roughly $3,000 per vehicle if the batteries are domestically built — subsidies the automakers had counted on when committing billions to new U.S. battery plants.

The Alliance said the loss would “harm not only the automotive manufacturers that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars investing in electric vehicle technology, but also the entire supply chain that has supported these initiatives.”

Democrats and environmental groups want the EPA to keep Biden’s framework intact, arguing that walking back now will jeopardize climate targets.

Last month, the EPA formally proposed to scrap the 2009 Endangerment Finding that declared greenhouse gases a threat to public health—a landmark decision that provided the legal foundation for every vehicle-related greenhouse gas regulation in the last 15 years. If finalized, the proposal would effectively eliminate all requirements for automakers to measure and comply with greenhouse gas emission standards in new cars, trucks, SUVs, and commercial vehicles.

Manufacturers would still be required to limit pollutants like carbon monoxide, oxides of nitrogen, and particulates, but carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons would no longer be regulated under the Clean Air Act.

The play is in line with President Donald Trump’s January executive order directing all government agencies to “unleash American energy” by cutting emissions-related regulations.

The company has a massive recycling program, but it also launched a division focused on repurposing, rather than immediately recycling, rechargeable batteries.
There are several other large buildings used for processing and recycling batteries.
If you live elsewhere, Google “battery recycling” to find local recycling facilities.","As you may know from my past columns, I’m a big fan of electric vehicles, but I also recognize that many people have concerns. These include the environmental impact of making the batteries and dealing with them at the end of their service life. There are also geopolitical and humanitarian concerns about where the raw materials come from (usually not the U.S.), the sometimes-dangerous conditions under which they’re mined, and the challenges of recycling them responsibly. EV batteries typically contain toxic substances such as lithium, nickel and cobalt, which must be handled carefully throughout their life cycle.

And it’s not just EVs. Rechargeable batteries are in many household devices ranging from watches and hearing aids to home battery storage systems. My toothbrush, my smart ring, my TV remote control and some of my flashlights are among my many devices with rechargeable batteries.

And, thanks to the global growth of EVs, phones, energy storage systems and rechargeable gadgets, the demand for batteries is growing rapidly.

Repurposing and recycling

One business addressing these issues is Redwood Materials, a Nevada-based privately held company that repurposes and recycles rechargeable batteries from things as small as hearing aids and cell phones to heavy equipment like Caterpillar’s 108,000-pound electric underground mining loader.

The company has a massive recycling program, but it also launched a division focused on repurposing, rather than immediately recycling, rechargeable batteries. For example, an old EV battery can be combined with others to create an array powerful enough to run a data center. On its website, Redwood notes that many batteries still retain more than 50% of their usable capacity when they reach a recycling facility, enough to be put back to work before recycling. With this strategy, a single battery can have three lives: its initial use, a second life in repurposed applications, and finally, having its valuable materials recovered to make new batteries. Redwood calls this a “circular supply chain.”

Redwood says that its process uses about 80% less energy, 70% fewer CO₂ emissions, 80% less water than traditional ore refining and at least 40% fewer emissions than other recyclers. In mining, extraction and transport make up over 30% of the footprint; Redwood cuts that to under 5%, highlighting the efficiency of its circular supply chain.

My visit

I visited their 900-acre facility, roughly the size of 680 football fields, in Sparks, Nevada, about 29 miles from Reno. It’s also about four miles from the even larger Tesla Gigafactory, which, in partnership with Panasonic, produces batteries used in Tesla EVs and Powerwall home energy storage systems.

Tesla’s battery factory and Redwood Materials aren’t just neighbors, they also share a founder. J.B. Straubel, who started Redwood in 2017, was a Tesla co-founder and its longtime chief technology officer before leaving in 2019 to focus on his new venture.

Driving to Redwood Materials is an adventure in itself. After leaving Reno, you head into Nevada’s high desert, where the landscape is mostly tumbleweeds, sagebrush and rocky hillsides until you reach the Tahoe-Reno Industrial Center. That complex has expanded dramatically since I last visited in 2019. Back then, the Tesla Gigafactory was the lone giant. Now, companies such as Google, Microsoft and Apple operate massive data centers there.

As you approach Redwood’s facility, the first thing you notice is a vast field filled with thousands of old batteries draped in white cloth. Just beyond that is an enormous low-rise building that houses the company’s offices and part of its processing operations. There are several other large buildings used for processing and recycling batteries.

“Turning pancakes into batter”

After I arrived and parked my Tesla in one of their many EV spots, a colleague and I boarded an electric Ford van for a tour of the facility. We saw large machines being used to crunch batteries of all sizes followed by other machines that separated and extracted the raw materials. The process, explained our guide, was “like turning pancakes into pancake batter,” to produce end products that battery makers use to create new batteries. He said that these extracted and recycled raw materials are as good or slightly better than new materials. At one point, I saw a worker unpack boxes of old electric bicycle batteries and insert each into a machine to start breaking them down into reusable compounds that would be used to help make new batteries.

The van also took us up a hill to a data center with a lot of solar panels and a large array of repurposed batteries that provide power when the sun isn’t shining or when additional energy is needed. The Nevada sun makes solar a great source of energy, but these repurposed batteries can also be connected to the grid to reduce peaks and charge at lower rate hours. Eventually, even these batteries will be recycled, but not until they’ve reached the end of their useful life. Squeezing more life out of old batteries is both an economic and environmental win.

Redwood Materials, which has 1,300 employees, also operates a battery processing facility in Charleston, South Carolina, and a research & development center in San Francisco,

Doing your part

As I was leaving the facility, I noticed a recycling receptacle in the lobby. The company invites visitors to drop off their phones and other devices with rechargeable batteries and, on its website, says that “less than 5% of lithium-ion containing devices are recycled” and that Americans throw out over 150 million phones every year. They also point out that “Recycling batteries and rechargeable devices keeps critical minerals in circulation and reduces the environmental impact of our products.” You don’t have to drive to Nevada to recycle your devices. The California Department of Toxic Substance Control has resources to find recycling programs on its website. If you live elsewhere, Google “battery recycling” to find local recycling facilities.

Reincarnation

I’m not all that spiritual, but I do understand the Buddhist concept of karma and reincarnation The battery in my toothbrush has served me well. With a little help from companies such as Redwood Materials, maybe someday it will come back to help power a vehicle or maybe even a spaceship to Mars.

Dive Brief:

A coalition of mayors groups, attorneys general and seven cities and counties submitted extensive letters regarding the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to rescind the 2009 “endangerment finding,” which concluded that emissions of six greenhouse gases endanger human health and is the underpinning for greenhouse gas regulation under the Clean Air Act.

The EPA “fails to seriously consider the impacts of these regulatory actions in cities,” stated a 14-page letter signed by the National League of Cities, the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Climate Mayors, C40 Cities and the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia Law School.

Attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia, meanwhile, are co-leading a 26-state coalition that submitted an 82-page letter in support of repealing the endangerment finding, stating it “was built on shaky ground — legally and scientifically.”

Dive Insight:

The EPA on July 29 proposed rescinding federal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, kicking off a formal rulemaking process with a period for stakeholders to comment before the agency finalizes and publishes the proposed rule. Virtual public hearings were held Aug. 19-22, and written comments were due Monday. More than 300,000 comments were filed.

The EPA said rescinding the finding would “save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards” and “give power back to the states to make their own decisions” about greenhouse gas regulations.

In its 225-page letter opposing the repeal, the coalition of attorneys general and cities and counties “describes the harms that the States and Local Governments are daily experiencing and that will be exacerbated if EPA finalizes the Proposal.”The letter argues that rescinding the endangerment finding would violate Supreme Court precedent and “disproportionately affect certain vulnerable groups and communities with environmental justice concerns.”

“We will continue to take action against dangerous federal actions that disregard scientific evidence,” said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, one of the letter’s signatories, in an emailed statement. “The importance of upholding this long-held commitment is underscored by the plain truth that the effects of climate change are felt most acutely by working people and Black and Brown communities.”

“New York City is no stranger to the devastating effects of natural disasters,” New York Mayor Eric Adams, who also signed the letter, said in a statement. “With more extreme weather events hitting the five boroughs more often, for our safety and to protect our economy, we must be prepared for the effects of climate change, including by putting in place stronger federal regulations of greenhouse gases.”

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement Aug. 1 that the endangerment finding “represents quintessential federal overreach and was never borne out by the law.” President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin are “reining in this overreach so states such as West Virginia can unleash American energy and compete successfully against China,” Morrisey said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/YBKwsv9prlTkZB2t9UEkiizKRBxvZ5W0CPcSiE1BifI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI5OTgyODkyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-25 13:03:06.352354

(AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world’s largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

The survey, conducted among representative samples of 1,200 likely 2026 voters from across Alabama, Kansas and North Carolina, asked participants about a hypothetical proposal to cut all federal funding for weather and climate research. The study looks to shed light on public opinion related to the Trump administration’s continued efforts to gut critical agencies including the National Weather Service, NWS; the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, NOAA; and the Federal Emergency Management Agency, FEMA.

In general, respondents from all three states indicated support for scientific research into weather and climate, noting its importance for maintaining America’s global leadership, national security and economic prosperity. Eighty-one percent of Alabama’s respondents indicated that they believe it is important for the government to fund scientific research that helps better predict extreme weather, while 85 percent agreed that America’s position as a global leader depends on continued scientific research and innovation.

Respondents also indicated overwhelming disapproval of any proposal to cut all federal funding for scientific research into the earth’s weather and climate, with 63 percent of Alabama’s respondents opposing the proposal compared to only 29 percent who said they would support such a policy. After being primed with arguments both for and against the proposal, Alabamians remained in net opposition to any such cuts.

Additionally, 48 percent of Alabamian respondents indicated that they would view their U.S. senators–Tommy Tuberville and Katie Britt–less favorably if they voted for such a proposal. Thirty-four percent said their favorability of Tuberville and Britt would not change in such a scenario, while only 17 percent stated that their opinions of the senators would improve if they voted for such cuts.

This would still put the EU behind other regions, particularly the US, India and Southeast Asia for modules.

Since scaling up manufacturing facilities typically takes two to three years, there is only a narrow window left to create the necessary conditions for investors to commit to manufacturing in the EU until 2030”.

Walburga Hemetsberger, SPE CEO, said: “This new report underlines that, with the right policies, Europe can competitively deliver 30GW of solar manufacturing by 2030, creating thousands of local jobs, and building a resilient, innovative solar supply chain that keeps economic value here at home. To meet 2030 goal, the EU and member states must act swiftly. Without interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar.”

The study mentions that currently, European annual manufacturing capacity is below 10GW across wafers, cells and modules, while China supplies between 81-93% of the PV components across the value chain to Europe.

However, the number would be much higher when factoring in the announced or planned capacity by 2030, as shown in the chart below. This would still put the EU behind other regions, particularly the US, India and Southeast Asia for modules.

Moreover, the analysis conducted in the study was based on three scenarios that are each compliant with the EU’s NZIA – which came into force last year and aims to boost domestic renewables manufacturing – resilience criterion.

The first one would be a fully vertically integrated supply chain (polysilicon to modules, including solar glass and inverters) made in the EU; the second would procure the more upstream elements – polysilicon, ingots and wafers – from China, while the rest be produced in the EU; and the last scenario is similar to the previous one but production would be centred in Southeast Asia, rather than the EU.

SPE estimates that production costs for the fully EU-based system, compared to the one that is a mix between China and Southeast Asia, would be around €0.128/Wp higher; the cost for a European system for a utility-scale solar installation would result in nearly €0.608/Wp versus €0.5/Wp for a Chinese system. This results in a levelised cost of electricity 14.5% higher for a European-made module, compared to a Chinese one.

The gap is due to several factors, of which labour has the highest difference (+240%), followed by building and facility (+110%), material costs (+50%) and equipment (+40%).

“This gives a hopeful indication that already, EU-made products fall within the 15% limit of additional costs under Net-Zero Industry Act auction rules,” said SPE.

Moreover, the report highlights that the cost gap could be further reduced to less than 10% with a mix of policies that combine capital expenditure (capex) and operational expenditure (opex) schemes. This would be both for solar manufacturers and project developers, with an output-based support. This outcome would be based on an annual nameplate capacity of 5GW.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EU-solar-manufacturing-supply-chain-outlook-by-2030.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 13:01:54.677336

Eager to keep their government handouts, insurance lobbyists have resorted to a dishonest campaign of fearmongering in an attempt to strong-arm Congress into extending these enhanced subsidies.

President Biden’s enhanced COVID subsidies were sold as temporary relief but have morphed into regressive, fraud-ridden handouts for the well-off.","In the land of Reagan, California families already face some of the steepest health care costs in the nation, with premiums and deductibles eating up bigger chunks of household budgets every year. The state’s Obamacare insurance marketplace has warned of more price hikes ahead, putting even greater pressure on working families. Instead of confronting the underlying reasons why health care is so expensive, lawmakers often prefer the political expediency of masking rising costs with more handouts.

In Washington D.C., nothing is more permanent than a temporary government program. Case in point: President Biden’s short-term COVID-era enhanced subsidies for Obamacare that Congress now wants to extend permanently. For the sake of taxpayers, fiscal responsibility, and sound health care policy, Congress should let these expensive and wasteful COVID-era tax credits expire at the end of this year.

First enacted in the American Rescue Plan Act and then extended by the Inflation Reduction Act, these enhanced premium tax credits funnel taxpayer dollars directly to health insurance companies. While Obamacare’s original subsidies were tightly targeted to help lower-income families afford coverage, President Biden’s enhanced premium tax credits flipped that logic on its head and extended government largesse to upper-income households who need it least.

Biden’s COVID subsidies effectively scrapped the income cap, so now even high-earning families making six figures—or more than half a million dollars in some cases—can get taxpayer help with their health insurance. Even individuals pulling in over $250,000 qualify. Obamacare was meant to help the poor afford coverage, not hand out benefits to the wealthy.

Instead of allowing these credits to expire as intended, Democrats are demanding its extension be included in a deal to keep the government from shutting down at the end of this month. The COVID public health emergency has ended, and so should these COVID-era credits.

Continuing these credits comes at a huge cost to taxpayers. Extending them permanently would cost nearly $40 billion per year, more than the Department of Justice’s total budget, according to the Congressional Budget Office. With deficits near $2 trillion and interest payments rising fast, the government cannot continue to spend as if the debt doesn’t matter.

Beyond the cost, these expanded subsidies are rife with fraud and abuse. By sending billions to households with little financial need, the program encourages misreporting income and gaming the system. The IRS Inspector General reports a 26% improper payment rate—the highest of any federal health program.

To make matters worse, government data show millions of exchange enrollees never filed a single claim in 2024. Among fully subsidized enrollees, 40% had zero claims. In addition to wasting taxpayer funds, this gargantuan amount of fraud and improper enrollment erodes public trust in government.

Eager to keep their government handouts, insurance lobbyists have resorted to a dishonest campaign of fearmongering in an attempt to strong-arm Congress into extending these enhanced subsidies.

The end of Biden’s COVID sweeteners won’t leave people stranded since Obamacare’s original subsidies still pick up most of the tab for lower-income families.

To be clear, the entire Obamacare subsidy is not on the chopping block—only what was expanded in 2021. For almost all enrollees under 250% of the federal poverty line, taxpayers will continue to cover the vast majority of premiums after the enhanced subsidies expire.

Notwithstanding the spin, nearly three-quarters of all current Obamacare enrollees fall under this category. If lawmakers truly cared about patients, they’d fight the underlying causes of runaway health care costs instead of clinging to taxpayer handouts.

These bigger subsidies don’t control costs—they just mask them. By shielding people from the true price of insurance, the government lets insurers keep raising premiums. After falling from 2019 to 2022, benchmark premiums jumped 3.4% in 2023, showing that subsidies don’t stop costs from rising. Rather than sticking taxpayers with the bill, Washington should pursue real fixes: more competition, less red tape, and accountability for insurers and providers.

President Biden’s enhanced COVID subsidies were sold as temporary relief but have morphed into regressive, fraud-ridden handouts for the well-off. Letting them expire isn’t radical—it’s common sense. Congress should end this costly experiment and return Obamacare to its original purpose: helping the poor afford coverage, not padding the profits of insurance companies or subsidizing the upper-middle class.

A steel-framing pioneer in the 9th Ward Belanger's team isn't the first to build steel-framed houses in the region.
Builders here and there have opted for metal framing for decades, and many high-end houses include steel framing for special features, like long uninterrupted spans in spacious rooms.
“There’s no human error in these homes,” Neville said.","American homebuilders love lumber. Can they learn to love steel?

Last year, 94% of all single-family homes built in the United States were ""stick built,"" according to industry data. Most of the remainder were constructed using concrete. Less than half a percent — about 4,000 homes total nationwide — were made with steel framing, a stronger but more expensive alternative.

Notably, nearly all of these ""metal houses"" were in the South, where building codes have gotten stricter as worsening extreme weather events cause billions of dollars in damage, drive up insurance premiums and force builders to look for new solutions.

In Louisiana, one unlikely new home builder has plans to push the numbers higher.

The South Central Planning and Development Commission, a sprawling quasi-governmental nonprofit headquartered in Houma and serving seven parishes, is best known, if known at all, for providing building code inspections, coordinating regional roadway improvements, giving small business loans and assisting local governments.

With a staff of 185 people, it is the largest of eight regional planning commissions statewide.

Now, a new $4.5 million steel-frame construction program represents an entirely new direction for the commission, which aims to fill vacant lots with hardy homes throughout the parishes it serves.

The initiative, first conceived seven years ago, took on urgency after Hurricane Ida ripped through south Louisiana in 2021.

In 2023, the commission bought an industrial warehouse, which it converted into a manufacturing facility that can bend, fold and cut rolls of steel into the studs, joists, beams and rafters needed to construct homes.

And it has since assembled and trained a 16-person team of designers, fabricators and builders, who are using the new custom steel materials to create what the commission's longtime CEO Kevin Belanger hopes are the first of many houses: a three-bedroom, two-and-a-half-bathroom French traditional-style home elevated on a 10-foot concrete foundation.

As it moves forward, the commission is joining a handful of Louisiana developers and builders betting on steel-framed houses in the hopes of creating stronger structures that are more resistant to extreme weather, fire, termites and the state's humid climate.

Advancements in the capabilities and accessibility of the machines that shape the steel may entice more people to join the cause.

“We went out and studied different building methods and procedures used around country to see what fit our need — to withstand salt water, salty air, high winds, fire and termites,"" said Belanger. ""We decided to invest in our own device to turn cold rolled steel into 2x4s.”

Building high and strong

Steel is stronger than lumber and impervious to insects and rot, but wood is less expensive and more flexible, and there's a large workforce with the tools and knowledge to build with it.

Dan Mills, head of the Home Builders Association of Greater New Orleans, said that ""wood is far and away the most accessible and best product available,"" and current building processes protect against ""the vast majority of storms.""

But Belanger said that the potential benefits of steel were enough to convince him to successfully lobby his commission's board to fund a different approach.

Construction of the South Central Planning and Development Commission's first house — at 600 West View Drive in Houma's Lisa Park subdivision — began in January and is now about 70% complete.

""This one took longer and cost more to build than the next one and the one after that will,"" Belanger said, because of the training required to use the unfamiliar material.

The home is designed to be more resistant to wind and fire than its wood-framed counterparts, which should make it less expensive to insure.

“Where we live, the typical home costs $225,000 to $250,000 and you can expect to pay $8,500 to $10,000 annually on insurance,” Belanger said. “The first estimate we got for this new house is about $1,200 a year.”

The commission's construction team is getting ready to lay the foundation for its second house on an adjacent lot. Soon, it hopes to produce more than 10 houses a year using its steel ""extrusion"" machine and the software that controls it.

""Once you load in all the engineered drawings and hit the button, it’ll print out the whole house for you,” Belanger said.

A steel-framing pioneer in the 9th Ward

Belanger's team isn't the first to build steel-framed houses in the region.

Builders here and there have opted for metal framing for decades, and many high-end houses include steel framing for special features, like long uninterrupted spans in spacious rooms.

Real estate developer Jamie Neville may have been the first in New Orleans to develop multiple steel-frame homes at once when he opted to use the material for his 45-unit Blueberry Hill project in the Lower 9th Ward, completed in late 2019. He's waiting to find out if he qualifies for federal tax credits that would help finance a second phase.

Neville was persuaded by a contractor to try the more-expensive framing as a way to keep his construction timetable on schedule.

“I remembered worrying about so many projects when rain and bad weather were holding everything up,"" Neville said. ""Meanwhile, the clock was still running and the interest on my loan was still accumulating.”

Neville was swayed by a contractor’s promise that walls would be built under the shelter of a warehouse, rain or shine. Another factor in his favor: his plan used multiple versions of a half-dozen home designs, which kept costs down. He estimates he ultimately spent 20% more than he would have on traditional framing, but he said there was less waste of materials, and the steel framing, designed by software and shaped by machines, is straighter and more precise than wood lumber.

“There’s no human error in these homes,” Neville said. “They are all built with 90-degree angles, so the cabinets, door and windows all fit perfectly.”

Neville said he hasn’t received any major discounts for the steel framing to date but he’s hopeful that will change. If it goes forward, phase two of Blueberry Hill, another 47 units, would likely be built the same way.

“Obviously, the concrete foundations have to be poured like a traditional home, but then one day an 18-wheeler shows up and the house goes up like an Erector Set,"" Neville said. ""They have wall panels A, B, C and D and the house is framed by the end of the day.”

Offsite construction could save time, money

Steel has been a staple of commercial construction for a century and a half. So, like most commercial construction companies, Jefferson Parish-based RNGD is more than familiar with the material.

“If we’re trying to solve the housing affordability crisis one house at a time, we’re going to get to the end of the world before we fix it,"" Dupre said. ""The key is to do this at scale.”

For Belanger in Houma, that affordability is inextricably linked to durability.

His team plans to build its new steel-framed homes for about $225,000 and sell them for about the same amount, putting any profits back into the program.

""For years, we have not seen any investment in residential developments in impacted areas,"" Belanger said. ""The risk of building in flood-prone areas along with high insurance rates has been a killer, so challenging times require bold efforts.""",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/3/77/3777dcdc-a3a0-4c27-95b8-f361e0dd328d/68d4318f23b15.image.jpg?crop=640%2C336%2C0%2C45,N,,2025-09-25 13:03:18.633510

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy’s current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana’s economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he’s still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,” the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Whatever Gary's future holds, city and county officials agree U.S. Steel should pay its fair share.","Steel mills in northern Indiana might not be paying their fair share of property taxes. That means the communities near these plants get less revenue for things like schools and fire departments.

Residents in Gary are already paying to host U.S. Steel with their health — some local officials say they shouldn't have to pay twice.

The cost of sharing Gary with U.S. Steel

Wanda Royal Torres brushes her hand across the roof of her husband's car to show the fine, black soot that settles on her neighborhood from U.S. Steel Gary Works across the street.

""We wash these cars, we rinse them off almost every day — especially this one cause this is like his little sports car — but it gets right back on it,"" she said.

When she grew up in Gary, the steel industry was the glue that held the community together.

Torres's dad worked at a mill. She remembers going to picnics and Christmas programs with other steelworkers and their families.

When thousands of workers got laid off, everything changed. Families moved, businesses closed — the benefits of living near a steel mill went away.

But the heart and lung problems, the cancer risks from the plant's pollution are still there. Torres said her daughter has asthma, but she only needs her inhaler when she comes to visit.

""Every time she hits Gary — she stays a whole day, she has to use that pump,"" Torres said.

Dirtier air isn't the only cost of hosting U.S. Steel. An investigation by Lake County Assessor LaTonya Spearman shows the company might not be paying its fair share of taxes. She said the steel mill's property value has stayed about the same for the past two decades. Generally speaking, the higher your property value is, the more you pay in taxes.

""It hasn't changed where we've seen appreciation for residential properties and for homeowners around 30 percent over the last few years,"" Spearman said.

Four years ago, steelmaker Cleveland-Cliffs sold some of its Indiana Harbor property for more than $200,000 per acre. Based on those numbers, Spearman estimates the real land value of Gary Works should be about seven times higher.

""Well I feel kind of angry,"" said Wanda Royal Torres. ""I mean, they tell me if I don't pay my taxes, they taking my house.""

Lawmakers let steel mills estimate costs, set high bar for tax appeals

How did this happen? In the early 2000s, Indiana lawmakers argued local assessors didn't know the steel industry and couldn't determine the value of something like a decades-old blast furnace.

So they allowed steel plants and oil refineries in northern Indiana to estimate the cost of their own equipment and give it a value based on its age.

Instead of local governments checking that math, lawmakers gave the job to the Indiana Department of Local Government Finance. Spearman said if you want to appeal an assessment by the agency:

""The bar is pretty high — it's almost impossible to clear actually for assessing officials,"" she said.

Before she can even petition for an appeal, Spearman said she has to estimate how much that appeal would cost and get it approved by the county council. She also has to present evidence that the appeal is likely to succeed.

""If you've not had an opportunity to actually visit the property, you have no personal knowledge of the facility because you're not charged with assessing it — how would one be expected to have this information?"" Spearman said.

Lake County managed to clear that high bar last year, but ended up withdrawing the appeal. This year, Lake County discussed U.S. Steel's property tax value with the DLGF before it was finalized to see if there was an opportunity to change it, but Spearman said that effort wasn't successful either.

Spearman said the county will continue to weigh its options to ensure U.S. Steel is assessed fairly.

How higher taxes for U.S. Steel could help the city of Gary

Cities that host steel plants like Gary could be missing out on that extra revenue. Gary Common Council President Lori Latham said there's a lot the city could do with that money.

""Road improvements, improved city services, drive by one of our parks, more code enforcement officers, police, fire improvements, technology improvements — the list goes on and on,"" she said.

Even if U.S. Steel's assessed value goes up, it's not clear how much money would actually flow to cities like Gary.

Scott Schmal is the finance director for the Lake County Council. He said if U.S. Steel already pays close to its property tax cap, that higher value won't end up adding that much to city budgets.

Still, U.S. Steel would make up a bigger slice of the taxable pie.

""It wouldn't necessarily mean U.S. Steel would end up paying more. It would mean that the rates would be lower, and potentially homes would pay less. Residents would pay less,"" Schmal said.

Residents, local officials look to the future under U.S. Steel sale

Wanda Royal Torres said U.S. Steel should offset the cost of its pollution by setting up centers for kids who have autism or learning difficulties.

Torres said people are starting to buy property in Gary, but if the city doesn't have a strong foundation — with more businesses than U.S. Steel alone — she worries the community will fracture again.

""That's what I won't want us to do anymore. I don't want to depend on the steel mill anymore. I want to depend on us,"" she said.

Japanese steelmaker Nippon recently acquired U.S. Steel for more than $14 billion.

State Rep. Ragen Hatcher (D-Gary) said Indiana has become welcoming for businesses — and that brings in jobs and tax revenue. But, she said it also has to take the health and financial risks of these businesses into account.

Hatcher pointed to recent layoffs at a steel operation owned by Cleveland-Cliffs in Illinois, close to the Indiana border.

""I just think we have to take all of these things into consideration, especially in the state, when we decide who to support,"" Hatcher said. ""Should we be supporting the people or should we be supporting these businesses? And I think we have to take into account for Cleveland-Cliffs, for U.S. Steel, BP in Whiting. I mean, they're all along our coast line on Lake Michigan. We have to start taking greener production more seriously and the health of the people who live in this area more seriously.""

Hatcher said Gary needs a corporate partner that will ""help the city stabilize and grow.""

Whatever Gary's future holds, city and county officials agree U.S. Steel should pay its fair share. County Assessor LaTonya Spearman said it may be time for Indiana lawmakers to reconsider the way it assesses property like Gary Works.

U.S. Steel said it has ""fully cooperated"" with the Department of Local Government Finance on the property valuation for Gary Works and will continue to do so. The DLGF declined an interview.",https://www.wfyi.org/files/wfyi/articles/original/file_IvLm2dwm.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 11:02:51.013730

CENTREVILLE, Va., Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Car shoppers are racing to buy electric vehicles before time runs out. With the federal tax credit for new and used EVs and some plug-in hybrids set to expire at the end of September, CARFAX data shows EVs and hybrids are selling much faster than usual, even as their prices hold steady.

Now, EVs and hybrids are selling about 30% faster than they were at the start of the summer, according to CARFAX data. Over the same period, overall vehicle sales have remained mostly steady, despite analysis showing that overall vehicle sales trends typically align with EV and hybrid sales. This gap marks a major shift in consumer buying behavior, as EV and hybrid demand break from traditional sales patterns seen over the last few years.

""EV and hybrid sales are spiking, yet prices remain stable,"" said Patrick Olsen, Editor-in-Chief at CARFAX. ""For shoppers considering a purchase, experts say now is the time to act.""

The Inflation Reduction Act included EV and some plug-in hybrid incentives with a $7,500 tax credit for new models and $4,000 for used ones. This summer, Congress voted to eliminate the credits, setting Sept. 30 as the final day for eligible purchases to qualify.

Here are CARFAX's Top Tips to Help Navigate the Used EV & Hybrid Car Market:

Do Your Research: Always check the CARFAX Vehicle History Report for accident history, service records, and past ownership.

Know Your Budget: Explore financing options early and stay open to different makes and models that fit your price range.

Take a Test Drive: Experience the performance, comfort, and features before buying.

And sales are expected to remain strong even after a federal tax incentive ends next week.

Total sales for electric vehicles have grown 42% in Florida since last year. More than one out of every 10 new cars sold in the state is electric, which is above the national average.

On a recent webinar, the founder of the data and research firm Atlas Public Policy, Nick Nigro, said Florida is an ""attractive"" place for EVs.

""It's very flat. It's very warm. It's very conducive to electric vehicles because you get a lot more predictability over the range of the vehicle,"" he said.

""If you look at the top vehicles in Florida ... It's the Tesla Model Y, it's the Chevy Equinox EV. These are the same vehicles that are most popular nationally,"" he continued.

Even though EVs are really popular in the state, Nigro said, Florida hasn't taken enough advantage of federal funding to increase the number of fast-charging stations.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which was funded by the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, was the largest investment in EV charging in U.S. history at $5 billion.

Nigro said Florida is slacking on these funds.

""Florida, where are you? You've got to get off the dime. Florida, of all the states in the country, is falling the farthest behind and taking advantage of these federal dollars,"" he said.

ALSO READ: Trump plugged back into bankrolling EV chargers. When will Florida see more?

He encouraged the state to use it while it's available, saying Florida has a ""really great EV market.""

""And I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate having more fast chargers available for them to use,"" he continued.

In January 2025, Florida was awarded $37 million in Round 2 Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grants, which is more than any other state in the Southeast.

According to the SACE transportation report, Florida came second per capita for charging stations in the region and 21st in the nation, with 3,502 fast-charging ports and 8,665 level 2 ports.

Separately, consumers are fast approaching a deadline: They have until Tuesday to utilize a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 to purchase or lease a new or used electric or hybrid vehicle from former President Joe Biden's Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The breaks were supposed to last until 2032, but were phased out sooner by President Donald Trump's ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Nigro said the country is heading toward full vehicle electrification, even without the federal tax credit.

""Probably about less than half of the vehicles that were being sold in the last year even qualified for the credit. So, a lot of vehicles are being purchased by Americans without the credit in place,"" he said.

The commission also reports that it is working on the regulations for deep Class V geothermal reinjection wells, and that it expects these to be ready by the first quarter of 2026.

As mandated by the Texas Natural Resources Code, “the exploration, development, and production of geothermal energy and associated resources on public and private land for the purpose of conservation and the protection of correlative rights” falls under the powers and duties of the Texas RCC. This gives them the authority to adopt rules as necessary to regulate, as well as issue permits for geothermal injection wells.

The published Class V geothermal reinjection well regulation, under Subchapter A of Chapter 6 of the State Regulations for the Texas RCC, allows for a “permit by rule” for shallow closed-loop geothermal injection wells. This greatly simplifies and streamlines the permitting process, giving developers greater confidence to move forward with planned projects.

The new regulation also provides an updated definition of a shallow closed-loop geothermal system as follows:

A closed-loop geothermal injection well, including all heat pumps and tubing, heat transfer fluids, and connections from the injection well to the infrastructure and the geothermal heat exchange system, that operates as a heat source or heat sink in concert with a heating, ventilation, and air conditioning system designed to heat or cool infrastructure. These systems are also called “ground source heat pump systems.” All energy used from this type of system is consumed by the onsite infrastructure and is not provided to an energy market.

We led on tailpipe standards, pioneered cap-and-invest and showed the world that advancing on clean energy and building the world’s fourth-largest economy can go hand in hand.

But there’s one sector we’ve kept on the backburner: the factories across the state that use old technologies to make the goods we love and depend on, from tortilla chips to toilet paper. California’s industrial sector is the second-largest source of climate pollution in the state, and it severely lacks the resources needed to help businesses modernize facilities to cut climate and air pollution.

The good news is that solutions are ready to go: Industrial heat pumps and thermal batteries can clean up manufacturing today, and we can seize this opportunity with Assembly Bill 1280. Introduced by Assemblymember Robert Garcia, D-Rancho Cucamonga, this bill would expand the California Energy Commission’s Industrial Decarbonization and Improvement of Grid Operations grant program.

A Merced County cheese processor and a large industrial laundry in Stanislaus County have already used this program to make the switch to cleaner technologies, proving these upgrades can simultaneously reduce local pollution, create jobs, cut climate emissions, reduce operating costs and help stabilize our electric grid.

The bill would also make it easier for manufacturers to afford upgrades by providing low-cost loans through the state’s Green Bank — an initiative of the state treasurer’s office that finances projects aimed at sustainability — and ensure projects meet strong labor standards and prioritize communities that have borne the brunt of industrial pollution.

Modernizing this antiquated machinery is also critical for Californians’ health. The industrial sector’s outdated equipment is a huge source of pollution. According to a recent report from the American Lung Association, upgrading industrial heating equipment from gas combustion to zero-emissions equipment could protect 3,220 Californians from an early death and prevent nearly 2 million asthma attacks in California by 2050 — delivering an estimated $47.5 billion in public health benefits statewide.

Beyond its health benefits, modernizing our manufacturing sector is a smart economic strategy. More than 35,000 manufacturers across the state employ over 1.3 million people and contribute 12% of California’s gross domestic product.

Supporting the installation of clean, efficient heating technologies is an opportunity to keep consumer goods affordable and ensure manufacturers continue to operate here and employ workers across California for decades to come.

AB 1280 has the united support of labor unions, manufacturers, environmental justice groups, Republicans and Democrats because it demonstrates a commitment to California’s workers, communities and global competitiveness.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/ofo2wt/picture312249063/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/Imagn-21943491.JPG,N,,2025-09-25 10:01:14.429891

US equities’ capitalisation is approximately 64% of the FTSE Global All Cap Index. As such, US equities cannot be considered a monolithic investment, and important geographic (regional and state) differences may become important to investors once they have access to convenient geographic investment vehicles.

The Russell approach to providing US equity indices has been to give investors more choice over granular subsets of the very large US equity market. FTSE Russell recently launched a new series of US state indices (based on company headquarters location) adding a geographic dimension, with the Russell Texas Equity Index being the first.

Texas is a large and growing part of the US economy that seems to have macro tailwinds—a large and growing population, a correspondingly large and growing GDP, and a relatively high GDP per capita. Investment based on the Texas index could help investors focus on participating in its economic growth potential.

The Texas economy has historically been driven by the energy industry, but more recently it has become a hotbed of technological innovation. This changing economy is reflected in the evolution of the Texas index’s industry composition. This balance between old and new industries could be attractive for some investors, either for strategic long-term allocations, or more tactical allocations if investors have a particular view on the direction of markets.

A state’s business environment is key when companies are able to move headquarters. Several innovative, fast-growing companies, both in technology and beyond, have moved their locus of operations to Texas in recent years. This reflects advantages the state offers for businesses to thrive in terms of a business-friendly operational environment and the availability of or ability to attract a talented workforce. Capitalising on this trend, the Texas index may present investors with another investment theme to consider.

ACTION: Final rule. ----------------------------------------------------------------------- [[Page 46068]] SUMMARY: The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is approving a state implementation plan (SIP) revision submitted by the State of Delaware. The SIP revision addresses Clean Air Act (CAA) requirements for the enactment of a Basic vehicle emissions inspection and maintenance (I/M) program for the Delaware portion (i.e., New Castle County) of the Philadelphia-Wilmington-Atlantic City, PA-NJ-MD-DE Nonattainment Area (Philadelphia NAA) for the 2015 8-hour ozone national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS).

Kennedy Boulevard, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania 19103. The telephone number is (215) 814-2026. Mr. Adam Lewis can also be reached via electronic mail at Lewis.Adam@epa.gov. SUPPLEMENTARY INFORMATION: I. Background On June 11, 2025 (90 FR 24554), the EPA published a notice of proposed rulemaking (NPRM) for the State of Delaware. In the NPRM, the EPA proposed approval of a formal SIP revision, ``Basic Performance Standard Certification for New Castle County Inspection and Maintenance Program'' (Basic I/M Certification SIP), that was submitted by Delaware on February 14, 2024. The Basic I/M Certification SIP was submitted to satisfy the applicable CAA requirements for the New Castle County portion of the Philadelphia NAA for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS. This Basic I/M certification SIP revision was submitted prior to the reclassification of the Philadelphia NAA from Moderate to Serious nonattainment for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS (89 FR 61025, July 30, 2024). CAA section 182(c)(3) requires states with areas designated as Serious or above to submit SIP revisions that provide for the implementation of an Enhanced I/M program in certain urbanized areas of the NAA. As noted in the NPRM, that requirement will be addressed at a later date. On October 7, 2022, the EPA determined that the Philadelphia NAA failed to attain the 2015 ozone NAAQS by its August 3, 2021 attainment date and reclassified the area from Marginal to Moderate nonattainment.\1\ The requirements for a Moderate ozone nonattainment area include a Basic vehicle I/M program. CAA section 182(b)(4). The Basic I/M requirements are further articulated in the EPA's I/M Rule at 40 Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) part 51, subpart S.\2\ The Federal performance standards \3\ for a Basic I/M program are outlined in 40 CFR 51.352. Consistent with the I/M Rule, areas with existing I/M programs need to conduct and submit a performance standard modeling analysis as well as make any necessary program revisions as part of their Moderate area SIP submissions to ensure that I/M programs are operating at or above the Basic I/M performance standard level for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS. These areas may determine through the performance standard modeling analysis that an existing SIP-approved program would meet the performance standard for purposes of the 2015 ozone NAAQS without modification. In this case, the state could submit a SIP revision with the associated performance modeling and a written statement certifying their determination in lieu of submitting revised regulations.\4\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \1\ 87 FR 60897 (October 7, 2022). \2\ See 40 CFR 51.350(a) for nonattainment area population I/M criteria applicability. \3\ An I/M performance standard is a collection of program design elements which defines a benchmark program to which a state's proposed I/M program is compared in terms of its potential to reduce emissions of the ozone precursors, nitrogen oxides (NOX) and volatile organic compounds (VOCs). \4\ See section II.E of the October 7, 2022 final rule (87 FR 60897, 60906) and the April 13, 2022 proposal (87 FR 21842). --------------------------------------------------------------------------- II. Summary of SIP Revision and EPA's Analysis Delaware submitted the February 14, 2024, SIP revision to address this Basic I/M program requirement for the Delaware portion of the 2015 ozone Philadelphia NAA as required for the Moderate classification. Due to more stringent nonattainment classifications under previous ozone NAAQS and Delaware's inclusion as part of the Ozone Transport Region (OTR),\5\ Delaware previously established and continues to implement an Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program in New Castle County and Kent County.\6\ The EPA recently approved (via a final rule published November 4, 2024, 89 FR 87500) updates to Delaware's prior approved I/M SIP that were submitted in March 2023.\7\ This previous I/M program revision included regulatory updates made between the inception of Delaware's current Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program and March 2023. In approving this March 2023 SIP revision, the EPA's November 2024 action determined that the current I/M program in New Castle County (and Kent County) met the applicable CAA requirements for an Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program, a more stringent standard than a Basic program for which Delaware now seeks certification. Delaware's Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program (applicable to the Kent and New Castle Counties) was originally codified at Delaware Code Title 7, Regulation 31.\8\ --------------------------------------------------------------------------- \5\ The Philadelphia-Wilmington-Trenton NAA was previously classified as severe nonattainment under the now revoked 1979 ozone NAAQS. CAA Section 184(b)(1)(A) provides that an area within a state in an ozone transport region and with a metropolitan statistical area population of 100,000 or more must implement an enhanced I/M program. \6\ See 40 CFR 51.351(g) for the Alternate Low Enhanced Performance Standard. \7\ See 89 FR 87500 (November 4, 2024) and 89 FR 66295 (August 15, 2024) for these actions and a summary of the Delaware specific CAA requirements for I/M Programs, additional background on the Ozone NAAQS, and resulting Delaware Area Ozone Nonattainment Designation. \8\ Recodified by the State as 7 DE Admin. Code 1131 in 2012. --------------------------------------------------------------------------- Pursuant to the February 14, 2024, SIP submittal, the EPA concurs with the State's determination that the Delaware I/M program for New Castle County (within the 2015 Ozone Philadelphia NAA) meets the applicable performance standard and requirements for a Basic I/M program. Further details of Delaware's Alternate Low Enhanced I/M program, the February 14, 2024 SIP submittal, and the rationale for the EPA's proposed (and now final) action are explained in the NPRM and will not be restated here. III. EPA's Response to Comments Received The EPA's June 11, 2025 NPRM (90 FR 24554) opened a 30-day public comment period, which closed on July 11, 2025. The EPA received one anonymous comment that is generally supportive of enforcement and strengthening of the NAAQS. The comment provides no further [[Page 46069]] explanation or context as to the relevancy to this action. Therefore, the EPA is not responding to this comment. IV. Final Action The EPA is approving the Basic I/M Certification SIP submitted by Delaware on February 14, 2024 for the New Castle County Portion of the Philadelphia NAA for the 2015 8-hour ozone NAAQS as satisfying the applicable CAA requirements. V. Statutory and Executive Order Reviews Under the Clean Air Act, the Administrator is required to approve a SIP submission that complies with the provisions of the Clean Air Act and applicable Federal regulations. 42 U.S.C. 7410(k); 40 CFR 52.02(a). Thus, in reviewing SIP submissions, the EPA's role is to approve state choices, provided that they meet the criteria of the Clean Air Act. Accordingly, this action merely approves state law as meeting Federal requirements and does not impose additional requirements beyond those imposed by State law. For that reason, this action: Is not a significant regulatory action subject to review by the Office of Management and Budget under Executive Order 12866 (58 FR 51735, October 4, 1993); Is not subject to Executive Order 14192 (90 FR 9065, February 6, 2025) because SIP actions are exempt from review under Executive Order 12866; Does not impose an information collection burden under the provisions of the Paperwork Reduction Act (44 U.S.C. 3501 et seq.); Is certified as not having a significant economic impact on a substantial number of small entities under the Regulatory Flexibility Act (5 U.S.C. 601 et seq.); Does not contain any unfunded mandate or significantly or uniquely affect small governments, as described in the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (Pub. L. 104-4); Does not have federalism implications as specified in Executive Order 13132 (64 FR 43255, August 10, 1999); Is not subject to Executive Order 13045 (62 FR 19885, April 23, 1997) because it approves a state program; Is not a significant regulatory action subject to Executive Order 13211 (66 FR 28355, May 22, 2001); and Is not subject to requirements of section 12(d) of the National Technology Transfer and Advancement Act of 1995 (15 U.S.C. 272 note) because application of those requirements would be inconsistent with the Clean Air Act. In addition, the SIP is not approved to apply on any Indian reservation land or in any other area where the EPA or an Indian Tribe has demonstrated that a Tribe has jurisdiction. In those areas of Indian country, the rule does not have Tribal implications and will not impose substantial direct costs on Tribal governments or preempt Tribal law as specified by Executive Order 13175 (65 FR 67249, November 9, 2000). This action is subject to the Congressional Review Act, and the EPA will submit a rule report to each House of the Congress and to the Comptroller General of the United States. This action is not a ``major rule'' as defined by 5 U.S.C. 804(2). Under section 307(b)(1) of the Clean Air Act, petitions for judicial review of this action must be filed in the United States Court of Appeals for the appropriate circuit by November 24, 2025. Filing a petition for reconsideration by the Administrator of this final rule does not affect the finality of this action for the purposes of judicial review nor does it extend the time within which a petition for judicial review may be filed, and shall not postpone the effectiveness of such rule or action. This action may not be challenged later in proceedings to enforce its requirements. (See section 307(b)(2).)

Jeep announced last year that it would introduce a plug-in hybrid version of its Gladiator pickup truck by the end of 2025.

However, in September, the Jeep Gladiator 4xe became the latest EV model on the chopping block.

A spokesperson for the brand, which is owned by European conglomerate Stellantis, told TechCrunch that Jeep no longer planned to include an electrified Gladiator in its product lineup after ""reassessing its product strategy."" Jeep cited changing customer preferences as the reason for the shift.

Another Stellantis brand, US-based truck maker Ram, announced its own EV shift earlier in September.

The company said it would discontinue production of the REV 1500, a full-sized electric pickup truck that Ram had positioned as a challenger to Ford's F-150 Lightning. Ram said the decision was in response to slowing demand for EV trucks in North America.

Porsche had bet heavily on luxury EVs, but the German carmaker announced it would shelve plans to build an electrified SUV and pivot back to gasoline-powered and hybrid models.

The German carmaker, which has faced falling sales in EV-friendly China, said it would take a €1.8 billion ($2.2 billion) hit over the strategy shift, sparking a record share price plunge.

British brand Bentley, known for its ultra-classy luxury motors, has also walked back plans to stop selling combustion-engine vehicles completely by 2035,

CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser told Autocar on September 22 that Bentley was now planning to build new gasoline versions of its most popular models, rather than just offering them as hybrids or EVs.

Ford confirmed in August that it had pushed back the launch of its new full-size electric pickup truck, known internally as ""Project T3,"" and a new commercial van to 2028.

“Canada’s auto industry is facing an existential crisis, with U.S. tariffs threatening current and future product investments, including electric vehicles,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne.
Mexico recently raised its tariffs to 50% in response to surging imports that now represent 70% of its EV market.
“We need to work constructively to protect North American auto jobs and supply chains.” In its submission, Unifor recommended that the federal government: Maintain the existing 100% surtax on imported Chinese EVs for an additional 24 months.
“Workers have done everything asked of them to build Canada’s auto industry for the future,” added Payne.","TORONTO- Unifor is urging the federal government to maintain its 100% surtax on electric vehicles imported from China, warning that lifting the measure would deal a devastating blow to Canada’s auto industry at a time of unprecedented crisis.

“Canada’s auto industry is facing an existential crisis, with U.S. tariffs threatening current and future product investments, including electric vehicles,” said Unifor National President Lana Payne. “Lifting tariffs on China, will make a bad situation far worse, if Canada becomes a dumping ground for cheap, unfairly subsidized imports.”

Unifor’s submission to the government’s Section 53 China Electric Vehicle Surtax Review underscores that unfair competition from Chinese automakers – backed by massive state subsidies, labour rights abuses, and coal-powered production – poses an immediate threat to Canadian jobs and the country’s automotive supply chain, including the steel and aluminum sectors.

Since 2020, Canada has positioned itself for growth in the automotive sector by securing investments in vehicle assembly programs, battery production, and critical mineral processing. Unifor warns that recent disruptions, from U.S. tariffs on Canadian-built vehicles, to policy rollbacks on EV supports, to rising Chinese import penetration, threaten to reverse these hard-won gains.

“As of August 2025, one-third of our members at Detroit Three facilities in Canada are on layoff, with three assembly plants sitting idle,” said Payne. “At a time when auto workers are facing layoffs and uncertainty, lifting the surtax would be nothing short of a self-inflicted wound.”

Unifor emphasized that, along with efforts to secure a zero-tariff resolution to the U.S. tariff dispute, Canada must remain aligned with its CUSMA partners regarding Chinese vehicle and parts imports. The United States maintains combined tariffs of 127.5% on Chinese EVs and is preparing restrictions on Chinese “connected car” technology by 2027. Mexico recently raised its tariffs to 50% in response to surging imports that now represent 70% of its EV market.

“There is no strategic advantage for Canada to go it alone,” Payne said. “We need to work constructively to protect North American auto jobs and supply chains.”

In its submission, Unifor recommended that the federal government:

Maintain the existing 100% surtax on imported Chinese EVs for an additional 24 months.

Extend surtaxes to strategic EV and battery-related components.

Reinstate and expand federal EV rebate programs, with conditions to prioritize Canadian- and North American-built vehicles.

Strengthen enforcement against goods produced with forced labour.

“Workers have done everything asked of them to build Canada’s auto industry for the future,” added Payne. “Now it’s time for government to stand firm, defend our industry, and ensure our net-zero future is made in Canada with good, union jobs at its core.”

Fermi's Gas Generation Equipment Secured or under LOI to Date Now Totals 2.0 GW of Combined Cycle Power at ISO Conditions, Scheduled for 2026 Delivery

Siemens Energy Displays Strong U.S. Commitment Via Gas Turbine Allocation and Highlights its Broadening Nuclear Capabilities Via AP1000 Steam Turbine Collaboration

AMARILLO, Texas, Sept. 25, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Fermi America, in partnership with the Texas Tech University System, is announcing two landmark letters of intent with Siemens Energy to secure 1.1 GW (at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode) of Frame F Class Generation Equipment for 2026 delivery and collaborate on Siemens' flagship nuclear steam turbine technologies, in support of Fermi's 11-Gigawatt AI campus.

These agreements mark a major milestone in the fulfillment of President Donald J. Trump's promise to restore U.S. energy dominance and to ensure America wins the global race to power the future of artificial intelligence.

Under the first letter of intent, Siemens Energy will negotiate to deliver three F-class SGT6-5000F gas turbine units, producing up to 1.1 GW at ISO conditions once in combined cycle mode. These turbines are proven, efficient, industrial-grade machines capable of highly reliable 24/7 base load applications.

""Winning the AI arms race doesn't just take software developers. It takes more electricity,"" said Chairman of the National Energy Dominance Council Doug Burgum. ""This campus proves that we can integrate natural gas, nuclear energy, and artificial intelligence into a single, powerful ecosystem. Modern energy infrastructure isn't a luxury, it's the foundation of global leadership. By advancing President Trump's Energy Dominance Agenda, we're not just fueling America — we're powering the future of intelligence.""

Fermi's campus was envisioned as a flagship example of the Trump administration's strategy: pairing advanced, reliable, quickly-deployable natural gas generation with nuclear power and modern infrastructure to ensure the U.S. can safely meet America's growing energy demand—particularly from AI and high-performance computing. With the new agreements, Fermi's gas generation equipment secured or under LOI to date now totals 2.0 GW of combined cycle power at ISO conditions, scheduled for 2026 delivery.

""No one understands the global energy race better than Donald Trump,"" said former U.S Secretary of Energy and Fermi Co-Founder Rick Perry. ""The Department of Energy, Department of the Interior, and Department of Defense are all working tirelessly to secure America's position in this AI race and to ensure that our private sector, with the strong support of this pro-energy administration, has what we need to lead the way in abundant, reliable, and innovative energy solutions.""

""I want to thank President Trump for his strong leadership and action in clearing the path for companies like ours to help America win this race,"" added Toby Neugebauer, Fermi America CEO and Co-Founder. ""Fermi America is doing what it takes 24/7 to build exactly what the President has asked for, highly reliable, unshakable, base load energy — through our 11 GW gas-bridged nuclear build. We understand the stakes are high and we are playing to win – because that's how America keeps its AI edge.""

The second letter of intent furthers the two companies' collaboration on integrating Siemens' industry-leading steam turbines, generators, and control systems into Fermi's expanding nuclear power portfolio, which include the deployment of an expected four Westinghouse AP1000 reactors.

Siemens Energy brings deep expertise, demonstrated by several modernizations of turbines and generators at multiple nuclear plants. Fermi and Siemens Energy will work closely to deliver nuclear generation with clean, efficient, robust performance.

This framework aligns with the Trump administration's executive orders to accelerate advanced nuclear deployment, streamline nuclear regulation, and ensure that the U.S. infrastructure needed for AI and data centers has the clean, reliable, always-on power that only nuclear and strategic redundancies can provide, without unnecessarily putting a strain on the public grid.

Not only do these agreements reinforce the administration's goal of U.S. energy dominance by expanding domestic, reliable, low-carbon power, they deliver on President Donald J. Trump's pledge to speed up nuclear licensing and regulation, rebuild the nuclear industrial base, and expand natural gas generation to meet the urgency of demand.

Costly challenges to build nuclear generation Building nuclear power reactors in Oklahoma would require a financial investment that outweighs other forms of generation.
Brandy Wreath, executive director of the OCC, said companies could one day build nuclear energy infrastructure using the new law.
Oklahoma's past with nuclear energy fuel Although the state has never generated nuclear energy, it was home to several processing plants for nuclear fuel owned by the Kerr-McGee Corporation.
""When you move from support for nuclear energy broadly to, 'Should I have one sited nearby,' the conversation becomes different,"" he said.","If energy analysts are correct, a tidal wave of electricity demand is on Oklahoma's horizon. Data centers are being welcomed into the state and framed as economic boons for communities like Pryor and, soon, Stillwater.

In three years, data centers could account for up to 12% of the country's energy consumption, according to the U.S. Department of Energy and the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory.

To satisfy that projected demand, utility companies like Public Service Company of Oklahoma are asking the state to encourage new energy generation.

A new state law requiring utility regulators to investigate a future with advanced nuclear energy generation could fit the bill. A working group of researchers, utilities and experts is being assembled for a feasibility study on the low-carbon energy that will wrap up in March.

In an energy landscape primarily comprised of natural gas and wind generation, the regulating agency sought outside help to decide the state's nuclear future.

""We don't regulate nuclear energy here at the commission. We don't have nuclear experts,"" said Mark Argenbright, director of the OCC's public utility division. ""So, to create this report, we went to the Hamm Institute and partnered with them, and we're identifying nuclear experts that we have access to that can speak to these nuclear issues.""

The Southwest Power Pool, of which Oklahoma is a part, reports the nuclear energy footprint across the transmission organization is small. Wind is the largest contributor, followed by natural gas and coal, according to a spokesperson with the corporation.

Researchers with the University of Oklahoma's Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis will also be part of the group. They've collected data on the public perception of nuclear energy going back to the 1990s.

Argenbright said he has seen a shift in the way people view nuclear power as energy demands climb.

""Growing up in the 60s and 70s, public perception was completely different,"" he said. ""Those things seem to be changing, and I think those are driven by the need – the hyperscalers with AI and data centers – there's a need for massive amounts of energy.""

Public perception of renewable energy could also be changing in Oklahoma, even as experts warn of the incoming energy demand.

Lawmakers this year targeted renewable energy in multiple bills, including Senate Bill 2, which opponents said would have restricted the wind industry in certain parts of the state. Some of those same legislators voted to pass the nuclear energy feasibility study bill, including Rep. Brad Boles (R-Marlow), who co-authored the measure.

The lawmaker, who is also campaigning for a seat on the Corporation Commission next year, said nuclear energy could provide dependable generation for the state. Although batteries can store extra energy from wind and solar to be called upon during high demand, they're still not seen as continuous sources.

""There's no doubt that nuclear is considered a more reliable baseload energy source than wind/solar, which are considered intermittent sources, but nuclear is also more costly than any of our current energy sources due to the initial [capital expenditure] cost,"" he said in an email.

Boles said the study should determine if advanced nuclear energy is safe, practical, cost-effective and beneficial for long-term generation.

Costly challenges to build nuclear generation

Building nuclear power reactors in Oklahoma would require a financial investment that outweighs other forms of generation. Traditional nuclear technology can cost tens of billions of dollars, like Georgia's Plant Vogtle, which finished last year.

Newer tech, such as advanced small modular reactors, would also come with a steep price. The technology is designed to be safer, but has yet to come on the market.

Should a utility company receive approval to build a reactor in Oklahoma, the cost would likely be passed down to customers the same way as other power plants.

""So, the need has to be pretty significant to justify the investment,"" Argenbright said. ""Now, I've seen where some of the hyperscalers, be it Google or Microsoft, they're entering into some agreements to have these kinds of facilities built, and they're taking on a very significant piece of the financial picture to overcome that initial investment that's required.""

""I think it's going to cause some creative looks at financing and, of course, in our traditional role here at the commission, impact on ratepayer is something we're very concerned about,"" he said.

A new option for large companies building data centers in Oklahoma is to generate energy on-site. House Bill 1374, authored by Boles, gives entities a ""behind-the-meter"" alternative, allowing them to generate power while unplugged from the grid.

Brandy Wreath, executive director of the OCC, said companies could one day build nuclear energy infrastructure using the new law.

""As long as they follow all the appropriate state and federal laws, they can build a power plant,"" he said. ""And as long as they're using the power, they can do whatever they want.""

Utility companies in Oklahoma have submitted public comments to the OCC with general information on the potential for nuclear energy.

Western Farmers Electric Cooperative said its energy mix is heavily reliant on renewables and encourages an ""all-of-the-above"" approach to generation. It said it supports the OCC's feasibility study. According to OG&E, the company sought proposals in 2024 for energy generation but did not receive any for nuclear power. It also said it wants to maintain a diverse mix of sources.

PSO stressed in its public comment that nuclear energy is safe and dispatchable. The Corporation Commission can minimize the risk of financial burden on customers by allowing utilities to recover costs early in the process, it said, rather than carry costs forward.

PSO's parent company, American Electric Power, currently operates a nuclear power plant in Michigan.

Once a nuclear energy site is running, the cost to generate power is relatively low, according to Hank Jenkins-Smith, director of the Institute for Public Policy Research and Analysis. He and Kuhika Gupta, associate director, are part of the OCC's working group.

Gupta said communities with nuclear energy generation could see collateral financial benefits.

"" Places that have these types of low-cost energy availability, they might get, indirectly, an economic boon from industry that wants to come there,"" she said. ""Because, from a grid perspective, there's easy availability of low-cost, reliable energy.""

Oklahoma's past with nuclear energy fuel

Although the state has never generated nuclear energy, it was home to several processing plants for nuclear fuel owned by the Kerr-McGee Corporation. Workplace accidents, and later the death of laboratory technician Karen Silkwood, shaped national conversations about nuclear energy. The company closed its fuel operations in Oklahoma years later.

Matthew Pearce, state historian for the Oklahoma Historical Society, said most residents likely associate nuclear energy with large silos and notable accidents.

""But in the case of Oklahoma, it's much more subtle,"" he said. ""The Cimarron facility near Crescent, for instance, many people would likely drive by that every day, not knowing the amount of uranium and plutonium that was processed there.""

In the 1970s, PSO proposed a nuclear energy plant near downtown Inola. But safety concerns and community protests brought the plans to a halt. According to The Oklahoman, more than 600 activists were arrested while protesting over the course of two years.

The state should consider past events and consult communities that might host future reactors before deciding whether to welcome the nuclear energy industry, Pearce said. Uranium left from the Crescent facility still contaminates the surrounding groundwater, according to documents obtained by KOCO.

""As a historian, I would advise thinking holistically, thinking historically, thinking about what's happened in the past, what's worked and what hasn't,"" he said. ""Thinking about who's at the table and who's not, and why that might be the case, and how, potentially, to resolve those issues.""

The study will consider the potential siting of nuclear energy technology, Argenbright said. Since the generated power needs transmission, he said coal plants could potentially be appropriate for future reactors.

Researcher Jenkins-Smith said finding the right locations and understanding residents' safety concerns will be key.

""When you move from support for nuclear energy broadly to, 'Should I have one sited nearby,' the conversation becomes different,"" he said. ""And so the challenge, particularly in a state like Oklahoma that doesn't have much of a nuclear history, is going to be how those narratives get managed and negotiated.""

But as economic uncertainty, rising input costs, and generational turnover continue to reshape agriculture and land use, many rural landowners are looking for ways to keep their land and keep generating income. Many are turning to clean energy leasing. It’s a way to add another “crop” to their field and keep their farms family-owned and operated.

Evergreen Action and the Private Property Rights Institute (PPRI)—two organizations with different ideological roots but shared goals around energy independence, individual freedoms, and rural economic development—partnered to interview rural stakeholders in Michigan and Pennsylvania about their experiences with energy siting on their land and in their communities. Protecting Property Rights, Powering Rural Economies includes case studies of farmers, township officials, and county leaders with firsthand experience navigating these issues.

The takeaways were clear: Rural landowners want the freedom to decide what’s best for their property, and many are voluntarily choosing to lease their land for energy infrastructure as a way to generate revenue, continue to own their operations, and make ends meet for their families. But too often, that opportunity is blocked by misinformation, permitting delays, and politically motivated restrictions that undermine landowners’ right to make decisions about their own property.

This economic opportunity requires a siting and permitting system that supports, rather than hinders, that right. These resources are intended to guide local decision-makers, legislators, and energy developers as they work to improve permitting processes.

Farmers in Michigan and Pennsylvania want the freedom to lease clean energy on their property to support their businesses and the local economy. Local leaders support landowner rights, see solar as an economic and national security benefit, and support clear, transparent zoning standards.

Protecting landowner freedom and streamlining energy development are not mutually exclusive goals; in fact, they are in the same vein.

Here's what landowners and decisionmakers are saying in their own words, and the policies that make their needs possible.

BASF Freeport powered by renewables: Spanish renewable energy company X-ELIO has begun operations at its 72 MW Liberty Energy Project in Dayton, Texas, which also includes 60 MW of battery storage. The facility is X-ELIO’s maiden combined solar and storage project in the US. The American arm of the German chemicals group BASF will source 48 MW of electricity from the Liberty project to power its Freeport site under a 12-year PPA announced in 2022. “Thanks to our partnership with X-ELIO, we are able to supply 100% of our expected purchased power at our Freeport site from renewable sources,” said BASF Freeport Senior Vice President and General Manager, Brad Morrison.

Turning EVs into power plants: Residential solar and storage company Sunrun has activated the US’s 1st residential vehicle-to-grid distributed power plant with Baltimore Gas and Electric Company (BGE), using Ford F-150 Lightning trucks to send stored energy to the grid during peak demand. The pilot program, which began with vehicle-to-home capability last year, now dispatches power from 3 participating customers’ trucks to both their homes and the grid. Starting in July, the enrolled F-150 Lightning trucks dispatched energy to the grid between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. on weekdays, earning participating customers a payment based on the amount of energy shared – up to a maximum of $1,000 for the dispatching season that runs through the end of September. Sunrun says that the initiative showcases how electric vehicles can support grid reliability, lower costs, and offer new income streams while advancing clean energy goals.

Amazon inks solar deal: Part of Spain’s Iberdrola group, US-headquartered energy company Avangrid has signed a power purchase agreement (PPA) with e-commerce giant Amazon for energy from the 57 MW DC/41 MW AC Oregon Trail Solar project in Gilliam County, Oregon. Expected to begin operations in 2027, the project will supply renewable power to Amazon data centers in the region, create about 200 construction jobs, and deliver $6 million in local tax benefits.

“We’ve long been interested in safer, more flexible battery materials,” said Lutkenhaus.
Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, which rely on metals and petrochemicals, this new material is derived entirely from renewable biological sources.
“As a chemist, my most exciting moment was when Professor Lutkenhaus’ laboratory demonstrated that our materials could be fabricated into working battery systems,” Wooley said.
“It was a confirmation that the strategy has promise to move forward.” Lutkenhaus added, “Seeing the materials come together in a functioning battery was a major milestone.","A team of researchers at Texas A&M University, including Distinguished Professor of Chemistry Dr. Karen Wooley and Professor of Chemical Engineering Dr. Jodie Lutkenhaus, has developed a biodegradable battery using natural polymers. Its findings were published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.

Wooley’s research group in the College of Arts and Sciences has spent the past 15 years shifting toward natural products for the construction of sustainable and degradable plastics materials. Lutkenhaus, associate dean for research in the College of Engineering, has been using organic materials to design a better battery. She suggested collaboration to combine Wooley’s naturally sourced polymers with her battery expertise.

“We’ve long been interested in safer, more flexible battery materials,” said Lutkenhaus. “When Dr. Wooley’s lab began developing these naturally sourced polymers, it opened the door to something entirely new — a battery that could perform well and also disappear safely when it’s no longer needed.”

A battery made from vitamin B2 and amino acids

The new material is made from two key ingredients found in nature: riboflavin, also known as vitamin B2, and L-glutamic acid, an amino acid that helps build proteins in the body.

“Those components were identified by a talented recent Ph.D. graduate, Dr. Shih-Guo Li, who began his dissertation research five years ago with the intention of enhancing the content of bio-renewable building blocks for organic polymer battery construction,” Wooley said. “He then developed synthetic methods to connect the molecular building blocks into chain-like structures called polypeptides.”

What makes this material special is that it’s redox-active, which means it can gain and lose electrons. This is how batteries store and release energy. In this case, the riboflavin handles the energy, while the polypeptide provides structure and helps the material break down naturally.

Unlike conventional lithium-ion batteries, which rely on metals and petrochemicals, this new material is derived entirely from renewable biological sources. It’s designed to degrade safely when exposed to water or enzymes, making it a promising solution for reducing battery waste, especially in cases where batteries aren’t properly recycled.

“Although there are significant efforts to recycle batteries, in cases where batteries are not actively collected and processed for recycling, they should be capable of undergoing breakdown naturally and with release of non-toxic degradation products,” Wooley said.

Safer for the environment and living cells

In lab tests, the material showed its suitability as an anode, the part of a battery that stores electrons. Importantly, the material was also shown to be non-toxic to fibroblast cells, a type of cell found in connective tissue.

“At this point, we’ve merely confirmed that our materials are cytocompatible, meaning they are non-harmful to cells,” said Wooley. “This may matter if the materials were to be used in implantable or wearable devices.”

Lutkenhaus said the performance results were especially promising given the material’s natural origins.

“We were excited to see that the electrochemical behavior was on par with synthetic non-sustainable polymeric materials,” she said. “It shows that you don’t have to sacrifice performance to gain sustainability.”

Toward a circular future for battery design

The researchers say this kind of design — starting with the end in mind — is key to building a more sustainable future. Instead of creating materials that last forever and become waste, they’re designing them to be part of a circular economy, where materials are reused, recycled or safely returned to nature.

“I like to consider every synthetic material that my laboratory produces as being a point along its journey toward function and purpose,” Wooley said, “with an ability to perform physical and chemical transformations that allow reuse of the molecular components in several other directions.

“Most extreme in this case, the batteries could become edible to provide a different kind of ‘energy’ supply.”

For now, the team is focused on improving the material’s performance and finding ways to make it more affordable. Currently, the chemical process used to make the material is too expensive for commercial use.

“We need to improve performance and then develop processes that would be profitable,” Wooley said. “That could require 5-10 years.”

The excitement of interdisciplinary collaboration

One of the most exciting parts of the project, the researchers say, was the collaboration across Texas A&M colleges.

“As a chemist, my most exciting moment was when Professor Lutkenhaus’ laboratory demonstrated that our materials could be fabricated into working battery systems,” Wooley said. “It was a confirmation that the strategy has promise to move forward.”

Lutkenhaus added, “Seeing the materials come together in a functioning battery was a major milestone. It validated the concept and gave us a clear direction for future development.”

The International Court of Justice (ICJ) delivered its advisory opinion on climate change on 23 July 2025, holding that States are obligated to limit climate change and are responsible for climate damages. This ICJ advisory opinion offered crucial interpretations of human rights obligations in the climate crisis. How can States now leverage the ICJ’s guidance to meet their obligations regarding climate change mitigation, adaptation, and loss & damage?

With a Climate Summit on the agenda for the UN General Assembly (UNGA) session in September 2025, this blog post argues that States should draw from the ICJ advisory opinion to call for a UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on Climate Change. This UNGASS could provide an opportunity to debate and adopt a ‘Declaration of Commitment to Climate Action’ – with human rights-based commitments that complement, not duplicate, obligations under the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), the Kyoto Protocol and the Paris Agreement (‘the climate treaties’). Facilitating accountability for State action, the Declaration should also request the UN Secretary-General to report periodically to the UNGA on States’ progress in achieving the commitments in the Declaration.

Climate Change Before International Courts and Tribunals

In March 2023, the UN General Assembly requested that the ICJ issue an advisory opinion on international legal obligations, including human rights obligations, to protect vulnerable populations and future generations from the adverse effects of climate change. Drawing from wide-ranging testimony by national governments and intergovernmental organizations, the ICJ advisory opinion (para. 172) held that States’ obligations to address climate change are governed by a wide range of applicable laws, including certain environmental treaties, core human rights treaties, and customary international law.

This ICJ advisory opinion is in line with the evolving consensus of the UN General Assembly and the UN human rights system. Other international courts and tribunals and adjudicating bodies such as the Inter-American Court of Human Rights and the European Court of Human Rights, as well as the UN Human Rights Council, Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, and the UN Special Rapporteurs on the human right to a healthy environment and on human rights and climate change have all provided extensive guidance on human rights-based approaches to climate change.

Applying these rights in April 2024, the European Court of Human Rights, recognizing the right to health of older women, held in KlimaSeniorinnen and Others v Switzerland [para 573] that the Swiss authorities had not acted in a timely and appropriate way to devise, develop, and implement relevant legislation and measures to address climate change. In May 2024, an advisory opinion [para 66] issued by the International Tribunal for the Law of the Sea (ITLOS) similarly noted that climate change represents an existential threat and raises human rights concerns. Drawing from these previous decisions in July 2025, the Inter-American Court of Human Rights delivered an advisory opinion [part VII (1)] declaring that the climate crisis is a human rights emergency.

A UN General Assembly Special Session (UNGASS) on Climate Change

The ICJ advisory opinion, affirming international legal guidance across the global governance system, must now be supported by political commitments in the UN General Assembly. The General Assembly has already begun to engage with the human rights implications of climate change, recognizing in 2022 the right to a clean, healthy and sustainable environment and affirming the importance of the environment to the enjoyment of all human rights. Building from this engagement at its 80th session in September 2025, the General Assembly will have a unique opportunity to request that the UN Secretary-General convene an UNGASS to debate the climate crisis, the advisory opinion from the ICJ and decisions of other global and regional courts and tribunals, the human rights implications of climate injustice, and the inadequate progress in achieving the Paris Agreement goals.

In this context, the UN General Assembly is authorized to hold high-level Special Sessions to address urgent, wide-ranging concerns, as seen in previous special sessions on corruption, COVID-19, drugs, children, and the HIV pandemic. An UNGASS may be convened by the UN Secretary-General at the request of the UN Security Council or a majority of UN Member States (UN Charter: art. 20). Voting at the UNFCCC and Paris Agreement Conferences of Parties (CoPs) requires a consensus, and motions can be blocked by a single country. This limitation has long stalled progress at the CoPs. However, the General Assembly only requires a simple majority to adopt a decision to convene a Special Session. Given that the General Assembly request for an ICJ advisory opinion in 2023 was sponsored by more than 130 States and adopted without a vote, it is likely that the simple majority needed to request an UNGASS on Climate Change could easily be obtained.

Commitments to Human Rights-based Climate Action to Complement the Climate Treaties

This proposed UNGASS on Climate Change should reflect the ICJ’s guidance, address the human rights implications of climate injustice, and aim to complement, not duplicate, obligations and processes under the UNFCCC, the Kyoto Protocol, and the Paris Agreement. The climate treaties focus on inter-state processes: the Paris Agreement goals, national political commitments expressed in States’ Nationally Determined Contributions, and periodic reporting of progress and replanning. By contrast, the international human rights treaties and related customary international law also set out States’ obligations to respect, protect, and fulfil the human rights of their citizens and other persons within their jurisdictions. The ICJ advisory opinion has clarified that States have obligations to respond to the climate crisis under both the climate and human rights legal regimes [paras 369-404].

The UNFCCC Secretariat has already published guidance that reflects, to a limited extent, States’ human rights obligations. These include the Enhanced Transparency Framework, which requests Member Parties to report on institutional arrangements and governance, including for ‘consultation and participation.’ In preparation for States’ updated nationally determined commitments, due in 2025, the UNFCCC Secretariat has also developed guidance on ‘inclusive engagement’ for specific groups, including people in vulnerable situations, children and youth, women and girls, persons with disabilities, Indigenous Peoples, and local communities. Yet, while the Paris Agreement references human rights, including the right to health, in its Preamble, the UNFCCC Secretariat guidance does not reference applicable international human rights law, and there is no periodic monitoring of States’ application of this UNFCCC Secretariat guidance.

With the ICJ advisory opinion looking beyond the UNFCCC to address obligations under international human rights law, the UNGASS should also look to the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR), which has provided explicit human rights-based guidance on integrating human rights at the core of the UNFCCC and on integrating human rights into NDCs. As noted, there is as yet no periodic monitoring process to assess how States have implemented this guidance in, for example, participatory planning, mainstreaming gender, and the perspectives of Indigenous Peoples. Such monitoring mechanisms will be crucial to facilitate accountability for the realization of human rights in the climate change response.

An Accountability Framework for Human Rights-based Climate Action

An UNGASS on climate change could develop a policy framework to implement the procedural and substantive obligations identified by the ICJ and other entities noted above, concluding with a Political Declaration that reaffirms human rights obligations for a healthy environment and establishes an accountability framework to periodically monitor States’ actions to meet their obligations.

In facilitating this accountability, there is a useful precedent in the global HIV/AIDS response for rigorous reporting and monitoring of UNGASS commitments, which could be adopted at the UNGASS on climate change. In this earlier context in 2001, the UNGASS on HIV/AIDS adopted the Declaration of Commitment on HIV/AIDS. This Declaration reflected States’ human rights obligations to address the HIV pandemic and, critically, called for periodic reports from the UN Secretary-General on States’ progress in achieving their commitments in the Declaration.

To establish this monitoring mechanism following the UNGASS on HIV/AIDS, UNAIDS developed a comprehensive monitoring tool to assess States’ progress, which includes the formal participation of civil society in the monitoring process. The monitoring tool incorporates the ‘National Commitments and Policy Instrument’ (NCPI), with questions on related policies, strategies, and laws. UNAIDS publishes the Global AIDS Update annually, reflecting States’ progress in implementing their commitments on HIV/AIDS. This monitoring of State implementation of their HIV/AIDS commitments, which continues today, has been critical to maintaining policy momentum and facilitating State accountability following the UNGASS.

Conclusion

The ICJ advisory opinion provides a springboard for States and civil society to galvanize the UNGA in September 2025 to call for a UNGASS on climate change. By focusing on the human rights dimensions of the climate crisis, including States’ obligations to their citizens, other people within their jurisdictions, and international responsibility for transboundary harm, this UNGASS would be crucial to advancing human rights in the climate response. Critically, the ensuing Declaration of Commitment to Climate Action should request the UN Secretary-General to report periodically to the UNGA on States’ progress in achieving the commitments in the Declaration.

This UNGASS on Climate Change will require urgent UNGA action to maintain the momentum coming out of the ICJ. In 2017, environmentalist Bill McKibben noted that:

Winning slowly is the same as losing. If we don’t win very quickly on climate change, then we will never win. That’s the core truth about global warming. It’s what makes it different from every other problem our political systems have faced.

The ICJ has seized the imperative to advance State obligations in the climate crisis. The UNGA must now carry these obligations forward to ensure that States meet their commitments to urgent, effective, human rights-based climate action as soon as possible.",https://i0.wp.com/opiniojuris.org/wp-content/uploads/abstract-green-watercolour-3.jpg?fit=1200%2C818,N,,2025-09-25 08:59:58.408576

“Economists have long criticized this approach as something that doesn’t provide great cost efficiency incentives,” Crowley said. “It doesn’t provide the utility with an incentive to really cut its costs as much as possible.”

Rather, when costs for utilities go down, so do their rates.

“It’s a situation where no good deed goes unpunished,” he summarized.

But while Crowley had recommendations for improvement, it’s not clear when — or if — the state will adopt them.

Sen. Eric Koch, R-Bedford, said that while he anticipated legislation may be filed, it wasn’t quite “fleshed out” and might be “premature” to consider such a move in the 2026 legislative session.

“I’m not going to carry the bill,” confirmed Rep. Ed Soliday, R-Valparaiso. “Somebody is, but we’re going to crawl before we walk.”

The two lawmakers lead the Interim Study Committee on Energy, Utilities and Telecommunications.

More on recommendations

Performance-incentive mechanisms and forecasted multiyear rate plans differ in their focus, with the former seeking to improve output efficiency — such as capacity or reliability — while the latter looks at input efficiency — such as capital, labor or materials.

A multiyear plan sets either prices or revenues for three or more years without rate cases.

“The longer the amount of time the utility has to manage outside of that rate case, the higher the incentive it has to keep its costs low because they want to earn a rate of return. And you can see why there’s risk involved,” Crowley said.

Indiana kicks off hunt for new utility regulators as affordability outrage grows

Though this can take several forms, the one his firm recommended to Indiana was known as forecasted revenue, under which the utility would project its future costs and revenue needs. Though the utility runs the risk of potentially underselling their need, it can provide stable rates for them and for their customers while reducing administrative costs.

Utilities in Indiana can already do this to a more limited extent, known as “forward testing.” Under a multiyear proposal, a “reopener” can be scheduled to renegotiate a rate should a utility’s performance falter.

Performance-incentive mechanisms, on the other hand, allow commissioners to “ding” or reward utilities based on their results. For example, Crowley shared, utilities could be tasked with reducing their average service interruption times and could be fined if they fall below the benchmark.

“Especially in the state of Indiana, where you have all these service quality metrics, you don’t need to overhaul the current regulatory framework — just add a little bit of incentive power to the current framework,” Crowley said.

But some standards could be “unrealistic,” he warned, such as saying utilities need to average zero minutes of service interruption time.

Seventeen states and Washington, D.C. have some sort of formalized performance-based regulation, Crowley said, with another dozen exploring such methods, including Indiana.

The above options allow for more “incremental change, as opposed to a complete overhaul of the system,” he said.

Crowley explicitly opted not to include potential tools like price or revenue caps in the options for Indiana, due to the state’s vertically integrated system — which could make such choices expensive. Other places, such as parts of Canada or Massachusetts, have “distribution-only” systems that make such options available.

“We do have caps, but they are not hard caps and they are set by the IURC,” said Soliday. “If you break the cap, then you get additional scrutiny and the IURC can order you to bring them back. Putting a hard cap when you live in an inflationary and changing environment, the issue is: What are you trying to achieve?”

Soliday noted that the state’s aging utility structure makes it difficult for such corporations to adhere to such standards. He also suggested looking at recovery time for utilities after severe weather.

“We’re taking a hard look at the performance-based regulation that we’ve got,” Soliday said. “… And we have to look at it in the long term, not in the short term.”

Luke Wilson, the executive director of the IURC, concluded Crowley’s presentation by saying his body would recommend that the General Assembly “look at enabling the commission to establish performance-based rate-making plans for utilities.”

Doing so would be the next step in bringing the process to Indiana. Wilson also said the commission would recommend, “at least for now,” pausing considerations for multiyear planning.",https://indianacapitalchronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/GettyImages-1316185179-2048x1365-1.jpeg,N,,2025-09-25 10:01:45.085414

Spanish brake components manufacturer ICER Brakes is making significant strides in environmental responsibility through its comprehensive sustainability program, “ICER Goes Green.” The initiative focuses on making the entire manufacturing process more sustainable by reducing consumption, waste, and emissions, all while maintaining the high quality of its products. The program has already demonstrated measurable success in decreasing the company’s environmental impact.

Key Highlights

The “ICER Goes Green” program, established in 2020, integrates sustainability across the company under an Environmental Management System certified by ISO 14001:2015.

More than 78% of the energy consumed by ICER comes from renewable sources, with its manufacturing plant in Navarra, Spain, self-generating 35% of its electricity via an expanded photovoltaic installation.

The company has achieved a 35.7% reduction in CO2​ emissions since 2021 and is implementing a plan for further reductions through 2030.

All ICER brake pads are free from copper and heavy metals, and their formulations for passenger cars incorporate over 13% recycled materials, including rubber from used tires.

Waste management policies have led to a 27% reduction in waste generated per brake pad since 2020 and a 19% decrease in hazardous waste since 2021.

The “ICER Goes Green” Initiative

Launched in 2020, the “ICER Goes Green” program is a company-wide initiative designed to embed sustainability into every facet of the business. A key component of this strategy is its Environmental Management System, which is certified under ISO 14001:2015 standards. This system ensures that environmental risks associated with its industrial activities are consistently identified and controlled. 11ICER prioritizes offering environmentally friendly products without compromising its position as a market leader in quality and innovation.

Circular Economy and Material Formulation

ICER Brakes actively promotes a circular economy by using recycled materials in its products. The friction material in its brake pads for passenger cars and light commercial vehicles contains over 13% recycled content, such as rubber from recycled tires. This practice results in an annual saving of nearly 500 tonnes of rubber and other recovered materials that would otherwise be extracted or discarded as waste. Furthermore, all brake pads produced by ICER are free of copper and other heavy metals.

Commitment to Clean Energy

The company shows a strong commitment to clean energy. A significant 78% of the energy ICER uses is sourced from renewables. An on-site photovoltaic installation, which was expanded in 2024, allows its Navarra plant to generate 35% of its own electricity. This focus on clean energy prevents the emission of 1,100 tonnes of CO2​ annually, an impact equivalent to the air quality improvement provided by 83,000 new trees.

Reducing Emissions and Waste

Through its sustainability efforts, ICER achieved an 11.2% reduction in CO2​ emissions in 2024 compared to the previous year. Since 2021, total emissions have fallen by 35.7%. The company has also implemented effective waste management policies, reducing waste per brake pad by 27% between 2020 and 2024. In that same period, the volume of hazardous waste generated at its facilities was cut by over 19%.",https://thebrakereport.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ICER-Goes-Green.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 12:06:06.894375

Isolation amongst ourselves has never served us well when it comes to nuclear power.","The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB) Act recently passed by the US Congress accelerated the phasing out of many federal incentives like Investment Tax Credit and Production Tax Credit for renewable energy like wind and solar. At the same time, it retained incentives for nuclear energy (Sections 45U, 45Y and 48E) and expanded the loan guarantees and support programs under the Department of Energy. This is perhaps the biggest investment push toward nuclear after the Bipartisan Infrastructure Act and the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. While this is a much-needed policy move, incentives and subsidies aren't enough to truly build our nuclear energy ecosystem. The US needs to rethink its regulatory framework to build necessary infrastructure as well as invest into cutting-edge technologies if it is ever to become energy independent.

In our modern society, energy is like oxygen — invisible in its abundance and catastrophically obvious in its absence. A lot depends on it from day-to-day household workings, functioning of public infrastructure, prices of goods and supplies, national security and more. Hence, the goal of every country in the 21st century is to become “energy independent.” This has been an American dream, too, and nuclear power can be a catalyst.

In 1973, President Richard Nixon pledged allegiance to the goal of energy independence, following the Arab oil embargo with the goal to build 1000 nuclear power plants by the year 2000. The next administration continued on this path and reorganized the Energy Research and Development Administration intended specifically to accelerate nuclear energy development while addressing safety concerns through the creation of the separate Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC).

But the dream remained unfulfilled because of systemic regulatory obstacles. The NRC’s changing requirements during licensing and construction period, along with additional regulations under National Environmental Protection Act (NEPA), resulted in multiyear delays. The same happened during George W. Bush’s Nuclear Power 2010 program under which only two new reactors were built at Vogtle, seven years behind schedule and double the initial budget.

Reframing Policy, Regulation and Innovation

Today, there is a renewed interest in nuclear energy because of a steady rise in electricity demand to keep up our digital infrastructure. When you throw into the mix expansion of artificial intelligence data centers, smart manufacturing and electrification of industries, our power demand is projected to double or triple by 2028. Whether the goal for the future is “net zero” or “energy independence,” increasing the nuclear mix in our power portfolio is the only way toward a stable energy future. But we cannot begin to address the solutions of the future without addressing the failures of the past.

The OBBB Act of 2025 has established a comprehensive nuclear energy policy by modifying existing tax incentives, providing substantial funding for modernization and implementing Foreign Entity of Concern Restrictions to preserve national interest. It has maintained the nuclear power production credit for operational facilities as well as investment tax credits for any reactor design approved by NRC through construction permits and combined licenses. The Act also introduced a 10% energy community bonus credit for advanced nuclear facilities, further incentivizing deployment in nuclear experienced region. It has allocated substantial funding for military nuclear programs and infrastructure. However, since the OBBB was a budget bill passed through reconciliation, the policy tracks have remained budgetary. It did not have the scope to address the complex regulations and outdated standards of NRC that still stand in the way of our goal.

My co-author and I firmly believe that the future of energy is nuclear. However, between planning, land acquisition, meeting regulatory compliance and construction, it takes more than 20 years and tens of billions of dollars to build a legacy nuclear reactor, more so to place it in service.

The primary challenge with NRC regulations is that the majority of the standards were developed for legacy light-water reactors that create an unnecessary burden for next-gen reactor technologies like small modular reactors (SMRs) and microreactors. For example, SMRs are smaller, flexible and can be constructed on the factory floor and assembled elsewhere near power grids and by design safer. It doesn’t make sense for them to follow the same prolonged review processes as a legacy reactor.

The Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act of 2019 agency mandated NRC to complete its new regulatory framework for next-gen reactors by December of 2027. However, the attempt has not been very successful and has instead revealed the depth of institutional resistance to reform. The initial draft submitted by the agency in March 2023 was rejected by commissioners and sent back for extensive revision. The second draft still hasn’t reached consensus and is unlikely to meet its deadline.

Similarly, for NEPA reviews, the current framework requires extensive documentation, with environmental impact statements often exceeding 1,500 pages even for smaller projects. These reviews consume one-third of overall licensing resources at the NRC and can take anywhere between two to three years. Not all reactors pose the same risk profiles and shouldn’t require the same cookie-cutter, full-length review treatments.

Executive orders signed by US President Donald Trump have been the most aggressive NRC reform attempts in recent history, specifically in reducing licensing timelines and environmental safety reviews like linear no-threshold standards. However, many of these orders overlap with the Advance Act of 2024, passed with bipartisan support, creating more uncertainty within the agency.

Strategic and Visionary Policy Needed

Despite these incredibly chaotic scenarios, there is still scope for reform and advancement, but we need a comprehensive effort involving Congress, the NRC and businesses developing advanced reactor technologies.

First, our energy policy needs to be strategic and visionary, and it needs long-term investments whose return on investment cannot be fully realized in the short term. It is clear that we have bipartisan support in Congress for advancing nuclear technology. What we need, more than ever, is consensus and consistency is advancing these policies without creating unnecessary overlaps or overhauls. Beyond legislation, we also need considerable Congressional oversight on how NRC is translating policy framework into regulation that prioritizes safety without stifling progress. Congress must focus on management accountability, not just rule-making timelines.

Second, we need regulatory reforms in the near term (till mid 2030s) to support initial deployment of reactors and for the long term (after mid 2030s) for wide-scale deployment and advancing nuclear energy. To make it happen, we need a more practical two-tiered reform approach at the agency level.

Tier 1: Immediate Regulatory Triage. This should focus on establishing separate licensing tracks for different reactor classes. Manufacturing licenses for factory-built microreactors should operate under expedited six-month timelines with standardized safety cases. SMRs referencing certified designs should follow 12-month licensing processes. Only first-of-a-kind large, advanced reactors should require the full current review process.

Tier 2: Systematic Institutional Reform. This should focus on addressing the NRC’s organizational culture and workforce challenges that prevent efficient implementation of any regulatory framework. The agency suffers from chronic understaffing in advanced reactor expertise, over-reliance on contractors and risk-averse decision-making that defaults to extensive review processes. We need to fill these roles with experts who understand next-gen reactors. Many low-risk, repetitive processes should be automated to reduce timelines and paperwork. At the same time, we need a shift in attitude within the agency itself where efficiency is a goal, change is met with adaptability and forward-thinking, innovative initiatives are encouraged.

Nuclear Future: A Shared Dream

In the end, the nuclear dream is a dream of shared humanity. This is not a challenge any one person, or one company, or the government can tackle alone. Isolation amongst ourselves has never served us well when it comes to nuclear power. By bringing together researchers, scientists and engineers as well as policy experts from both private sector and government, we can share the burden and accelerate progress.",https://energyintel.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/7bfab01/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1651x867+0+0/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fenergy-intelligence-brightspot.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com%2Fdb%2Fa6%2F943602ec47cead00841f4d916c33%2Fss-1422000914-nuclear-concept.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 07:58:17.740487

How are you thinking about other institutions’ approaches and the applicable lessons for North Carolina?","Ever since President Donald Trump returned to office and deluged colleges with federal policy changes, many faculty across North Carolina have felt uneasy about the state of affairs in higher education.

Belle Boggs, an English professor at North Carolina State University and the president of the statewide chapter of the American Association of University Professors, wants faculty to know that her group will stick up for them.

“Our role is to stand up for academic freedom, to fight for shared governance, and to insist on the importance of our role as champions for the public good,” Boggs told The Assembly.

Other faculty in North Carolina appear to agree: Boggs said the number of national dues-paying members in the statewide AAUP conference has more than doubled since the beginning of the year, to 570. Many of them joined after Trump’s inauguration. “And I hope we’ll double again by the end of the year,” she said.

Boggs spoke with The Assembly about how the North Carolina AAUP conference is navigating the second Trump presidency and planning to support faculty members this academic year.

How did you get involved with the AAUP and become president of the statewide group?

I got involved with what became the AAUP chapter at N.C. State during the initial wave of the COVID crisis…we were very concerned that coming back into those public spaces was not going to be safe. So there was a big effort outside of AAUP…coming together and speaking to our chancellors across the UNC System.

This was a group within the UNC System that allowed us to see that we could work together and have a voice and that that was going to be very necessary. We were moving into a different time—and I think we had already moved into a different time—and it was very clear that this was life or death, not only for vulnerable people, but also for the university.

From there, I have just been mostly a rank-and-file member at my N.C. State chapter. When our wonderful president of the state conference of AAUP, Jay Smith, who teaches at UNC-Chapel Hill, decided that he needed to step down after a long-term stint as president, the group of state-level executive leaders asked me if I would be willing to be considered for leadership. And I said OK, knowing that it would be challenging, because this was after the election, but not knowing exactly what that challenge would look like.

What has the statewide AAUP chapter seen in response to President Trump’s higher education agenda?

The AAUP and AFT [American Federation of Teachers] together are the largest higher education union in the country. And as an AAUP conference that also offers its members AFT membership, we are growing daily. We have added new chapters. We are in the process of adding still more chapters.

We are being contacted by faculty who have concerns, and we are responding. That is part of what we do is we try to provide resources and help. … So we are there for higher education, and so we hope that whatever happens this fall and beyond, people will see us and know that we’re there to offer the help that we have to give.

This summer, you attended the national conference for the AAUP. What was the environment there and how are others thinking about this moment?

I was excited going in, but I was worried that there would be a feeling of fear, and a sense of doom and negativity. But there is none of that. The people who came together were reminded that we are all knowledge workers and that our work is very important. And in fact, when you look at what the administration is doing and who they’re putting in place to accomplish some of the things that they’re trying to accomplish, we actually have better-than-even odds of coming out ahead.

We have law professors; we have doctors; we have epidemiologists; we have journalists; we have historians; we have teachers; we have healthcare workers; we have nurses. Every field you can think of, we have the best of that field within our group. We’re also a very old group, so we’ve been through some very bad times. The AAUP as an institution has been through McCarthyism.

There was some talk of the fact that this is actually the worst challenge that higher education has ever faced in the United States. And that is scary, but the energy within our sessions and within our plenary conversations was extremely energetic—sometimes angry, but always determined. The work that people are doing in different, very challenging spaces all across the United States is really inspiring.

Many people have been following the Trump administration’s battles with specific schools, like Harvard and Columbia. How are you thinking about other institutions’ approaches and the applicable lessons for North Carolina?

I think that all AAUP members and most faculty in higher education are looking at Columbia and noticing that the bullying never stops, the demands do not stop. There is no way to bend the knee and ever stand up straight again.

So we very closely are watching the different lawsuits, AAUP v. Rubio, and also the suit with Harvard that is in court right now. [Editor’s note: A judge ruled in Harvard’s favor in September, but the Trump administration says it will appeal.] I think a lot of people were very inspired by how Harvard stood up, and by the chancellor of UVA [University of Virginia] and his principled decision [to step down]. But we want Harvard to continue to stand strong. Everyone wants that.

We’ve seen Big 10 schools and others push for coalitions to defend their institutions. Are there talks about doing something like that in the South?

Absolutely. A mutual academic defense compact is a really great strategy that has happened…saying that we will stand together. We’re going to pool our resources. We are going to make sure that we’re not picked off, university by university, or program by program, or college by college.…But you also have to have the resources in place.

So what we have been working on this summer very hard at AAUP, with a team of almost entirely volunteers in North Carolina…We are working on setting up, establishing resources so that universities, but also individual faculty members and academic professionals, understand that there is some muscle behind this group, and there is some meaning behind the promises that we make.

We do have folks who work on rapid research. We do have folks who reach out to media and organize those conversations. You’ve probably seen AAUP in the media more lately, and that is because we are actively doing that work. But we are also setting up a legal hotline that will be dedicated to protecting the First Amendment rights of faculty members within the state of North Carolina who face challenges this fall and beyond. So we want to say that we have resources before we have a compact.",https://i0.wp.com/www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/Belle_Boggs_Portraits-023.jpg?fit=1000%2C1504&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-25 09:00:03.101144

The Sierra Club was an active part of a large coalition—and hundreds of thousands of people across the country–that spoke out against the proposal and in favor of protecting our current standards for cars and trucks.

We showed up with dozens of testifiers for a four-day hearing (that was originally scheduled for just one day but had to be extended due to sign-ups!)

We contributed almost 23k signatures to the coalition’s overarching 225k

We co-led a sign-on letter with GreenLatinos that 100+ organizations joined

We spoke out in the media and had a national op-ed published in The Hill from Clean Transportation for All Director Katherine García

We took over E&E’s Climatewire newsletter with a weeklong ad campaign that told the EPA to do its job

And we showed up in person in Motor City, a city particularly threatened by the Trump administration’s anti-EV actions, to protest the EPA’s proposal. On Sept. 19, the Friday before the Sept. 22 comment deadline, we attended a press conference in Detroit where local elected officials, advocates, and business owners gathered to demand that the EPA protect the clean vehicle pollution standards.

Stephanie Chang, Senate District 03; Alan Hejl, Founder and lead Accessibility Consultant at Spark Access; Sarah Hoogterp, Project Manager at Southwest Detroit Environmental Vision

Speakers highlighted how Detroit stands to lose significant momentum for resolving some of the worst in the nation particle pollution in the air. Attendees heard about how the rollback would threaten children's and residents’ health and well-being through both toxic air pollution and from the impacts of the worsening climate crisis. One speaker spoke about having to cancel camping trips due to summer wildfire smoke, once a rarity in the Midwest, threatening their toddler’s lung development.

Each community leader touched on the importance of preserving the standards to protect the long-term validity of the city's economic comeback, as the standards help protect long-term investments in domestic electric vehicle manufacturing. That means good-paying jobs and community revitalization for Detroit.

And it’s clear that the community, and not just the event speakers, know what the EPA’s proposed rollbacks mean for their communities. Shortly after the event, Eric overheard a conversation between two old friends over lunch at the table next to me. Fittingly enough, they were talking about Stellantis’ recent investments in the city, and what they meant for the community at large. One friend even highlighted what Stellantis’s announcement last year to open new plants for EV battery production meant for the long-term comeback of the Motor City’s residents, community, and their wealth and wellbeing. And he expressed concern about what the Trump administration meant for this momentum and progress. Their conversation could have been the press conference.

The battery gigafactory project will transform the North African kingdom into a major supplier of batteries for electric vehicles (EVs) and renewable energy storage. This facility will cement Morocco’s role as a bridge between Africa, Europe, and Asia in the fast-growing green economy.

Asian companies are currently trying to tap into African market through Morocco. Recently joining the list of companies is Tata. Tata has set up the Tata Advanced Systems Maroc Facility in Morocco that will produce armored vehicles. With these projects, Morocco will emerge as a leading industrial hub in Africa in years to come.

May 22, 2025

Gotion Power Morocco which is a subsidiary of Sino-Europe electric vehicle battery maker Gotion High Tech, is expected to kick off Morocco’s Gotion Gigafactory Construction Project in the north African country “within days.” This was revealed by the company’s Morrocan head Khalid Qalam on Wednesday.

Gotion High Tech had already signed an investment deal with the Moroccan government in June 2024. The company will set up the first gigafactory in Africa near Kenitra, northwestern Morocco. Additionally, the project is expected to cost a total investment of $6.5 billion.

The investment of the company is spurred by government incentives. Additionally, it is in line with Morocco’s aim that foresees the country to expand and adapt its automotive sector.

Furthermore, Qalam told an industry conference in Rabat the groundwork for the factory project had been completed. The first production of the factory is expected in the third quarter of 2026.

First Phase of the Project

The first phase of the project is expected to cost of $1.3 billion. Also, as for the capacity, the plant would have 20 gigawatt capacity. He also added that the company had agreed with the Moroccan government to increase the capacity of the factory to 40GW in the second phase. However, he did not give a timeline.

Other than batteries, the plant will also produce cathodes and anodes. According to Qalam, these will be exported in bulk to Europe.

“In fact, we have already gotten orders from several European car manufacturers,” Qalam stated.

Lastly, the geographic location of Morocco is close to Europe. This therefore and its makes it an attractive destination to Chinese EV battery makers.",https://constructionreviewonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/images-59.webp,N,,2025-09-25 12:08:43.506545

Not surprisingly, the report downplays the threat of climate change and fossil fuels, in keeping with the administration’s other anti-climate-action measures. (See, for instance, this recent piece about Energy Secretary Chris Wright from the New York Times.)

The backlash from the American scientific community began immediately and will certainly continue. The public comment period ended on September 2, at which point 59,563 comments had been received by the government. So this collection of news reports and scientists’ responses is an early snapshot.

One thing to note: The Environmental Protection Agency’s “endangerment finding” is the ruling that greenhouse gases count as harmful pollutants and are therefore subject to government regulation. Several of the news stories mention the efforts of President Donald Trump and his administration to get rid of this finding — and the fear of scientists and climate-aware policy makers that the new Department of Energy report might be designed to bolster those efforts in litigation.

“Contrarian climate assessment from U.S. government draws swift pushback.” Paul Voosen, Science, July 30. This is a good overview of both the report and the initial pushback.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing a new EV, and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing a used one, will disappear Sept. 30. The cuts were included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress in July. Some believe it may put the brakes on the EV industry’s momentum in Tennessee.

“Those are both really important consumer incentives to encourage folks to take a closer look at an electric vehicle, and those will be going away at the end of the month,” Aaron Viles, senior director of campaigns for the Electrification Coalition, said.

According to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, the state has made more than $16 billion in capital investments in the EV industry since 2017. Additionally, more than 191,000 EVs have been produced in TN since 2013 by the four major EV manufacturers located in the state.

Viles told News 2 the exact impact of the federal tax credit cuts on Tennessee’s EV industry is unclear, but any impact will likely be short-lived.

“Obviously, if you take away a $7,500 or $4,000 tax credit, there will be fewer people who make that decision [to buy EVs],” Viles said. “It will be interesting to see how many fewer, but I think overall because manufacturers are still very committed to this transition [toward EVs], that ultimately EVs — there will be more and more on the roads.”

Some experts have also predicted potential manufacturing job loss due to the elimination of the tax credits. According to a recent report by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Tennessee has already lost nearly 150 EV manufacturing jobs within the past 12 months due to cancellations or downscaled investments.

However, the state remains among the top in the country for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs, the report said.

Despite that, multiple EV manufacturers in the Volunteer State have slowed or delayed EV production in recent months due to slower sales, including Ford’s EV plant — known as BlueOval City — located just outside of Memphis.

“In Tennessee, there’s a lot of skin in the game because it’s one of the bigger states in terms of those EV investments, so we’ll all need to watch pretty closely and carefully and see what the companies decide to do,” Viles said.",https://www.wjhl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/98/2025/09/VOSOT.00_00_22_00.Still001.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-25 13:01:47.320472

“Higher blends of ethanol in gasoline can save consumers money at the gas pump reduce greenhouse gas emissions and prevent an over-dependence on foreign oil.”","Highlighting the downturn in the farm economy, the president of the National Corn Growers Association and leaders from 17 state corn grower groups sent an open letter to Democratic and Republican Congressional leaders on Sept. 16, calling on them to pass legislation, yet this year, that would extend nationwide, consumer access to fuels with 15% ethanol blends as a way to begin to address the economic decline.

“The most durable way to help farmers through these troubling times is by creating more demand for corn and corn products,” the letter said. “The most immediate path to begin to address this issue is by increasing consumer access to higher blends of corn ethanol.”

The letter, which was sent to Senate Majority Leader John Thune (R-S.D.), Minority Leader Charles Schumer (D-N.Y.), House Speaker Mike Johnson (R-La.) and House Minority Leader Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.), comes as corn growers across the country have been dealt a very difficult hand with input costs near record highs as corn prices fall to unsustainable lows.

To make matters worse for growers, a recent report released by the Department of Agriculture suggests that farmers are on course to produce a massive corn yield that is expected to be the largest on record, an outgrowth of exceptionally efficient and continually improving management practices. But additional corn on the market will only drive prices even lower.

Corn grower leaders have said one of the quickest ways to create demand for corn is by passing the Nationwide Consumer and Fuel Retailer Choice Act of 2025, which would remove an outdated regulation under the Clean Air Act that bans the sale of fuel with 15% ethanol blends during the summer months.

Heat pumps are a key way to make heating more sustainable, affordable and secure, say experts.

They could reduce global CO2 emissions by 500 million tonnes by 2030 – vital when environmental issues dominate the Forum's Global Risks Report 2025.

But countries will need to subsidize heat pumps if they are to achieve their climate targets, as high installation costs are a barrier for many households.

Heat pumps could make our homes, workplaces and public buildings more sustainable.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates they could reduce CO2 emissions by 500 million tonnes by 2030. With environmental issues featuring in four of the top five risks to the world over the next 10 years, a global switch to heat pumps could be a step in the right direction.

Heat pumps are already cheaper to run than conventional boilers, and research shows they are three to four times more efficient than traditional gas boilers, but their high initial cost is still a considerable deterrent. Countries will need to subsidize installations if they are to achieve their climate targets, the IEA says.

Some people are also concerned they lack the efficiency of conventional boilers when the temperature outside is particularly low. However, research suggests that even at temperatures well below freezing heat pump efficiency is still significantly higher than fossil fuel systems.

What's the World Economic Forum doing about the transition to clean energy?

Moving to clean energy is key to combating climate change, yet in the past five years, the energy transition has stagnated.

Energy consumption and production contribute to two-thirds of global emissions, and 81% of the global energy system is still based on fossil fuels, the same percentage as 30 years ago. Plus, improvements in the energy intensity of the global economy (the amount of energy used per unit of economic activity) are slowing. In 2018 energy intensity improved by 1.2%, the slowest rate since 2010.

Effective policies, private-sector action and public-private cooperation are needed to create a more inclusive, sustainable, affordable and secure global energy system.

Benchmarking progress is essential to a successful transition. The World Economic Forum’s Energy Transition Index, which ranks 115 economies on how well they balance energy security and access with environmental sustainability and affordability, shows that the biggest challenge facing energy transition is the lack of readiness among the world’s largest emitters, including US, China, India and Russia. The 10 countries that score the highest in terms of readiness account for only 2.6% of global annual emissions.

To future-proof the global energy system, the Forum’s Centre for Energy & Materials is working on initiatives including Clean Power and Electrification, Energy and Industry Transition Intelligence, Industrial Ecosystems Transformation, and Transition Enablers to encourage and enable innovative energy investments, technologies and solutions.

Additionally, the Mission Possible Partnership (MPP) is working to assemble public and private partners to further the industry transition to set heavy industry and mobility sectors on the pathway towards net-zero emissions. MPP is an initiative created by the World Economic Forum and the Energy Transitions Commission.

So what is the potential of heat pumps? Here are four charts that show how they work and what they can do to warm our indoor spaces, while helping to stop the climate warming even further.

1. How do heat pumps work?

Heat pumps use similar technology to that of a refrigerator or air conditioner. They extract heat from a source – the surrounding air – and amplify this heat.

Heat pumps are much more efficient than boilers, because they transfer heat rather than generate it. Almost all of this heat reaches the space intended to be warmed.

The technology is effective even in cold climates. By extracting latent heat from the outside air, modern heat pumps can operate efficiently at temperatures well below freezing. For added resilience in the coldest conditions, they can be installed as part of a hybrid system, working alongside a conventional gas boiler that provides supplementary heat only when needed.

2. Which region is installing heat pumps fastest?

In 2024, heat pump sales outpaced gas boilers by 30%, the largest gap ever recorded, reports the IEA's Global Energy Review 2025.

The chart above shows that China leads the way in heat pump installations, with the country responsible for 30% of the global total, according to the IEA. The US comes next, followed by the EU – largely led by Norway, which has 632 heat pumps installed for every 1,000 households.

China's dominance is partly due to the fact that it's a leader in heat pump manufacturing; the country's net-zero plans are also helping to increase demand.

3. How much of global heating demand can they cover?

Over one-sixth of global natural gas demand is for heating buildings – so heat pumps could make a significant dent in emissions if widely installed. Currently, they cover about 10% of global space heating demand, but the potential is there for a much greater reach.

The extent to which heat pumps can be rolled out depends on whether nations deliver what they’ve written into their existing policies or climate pledges. In the chart above, STEPS refers to countries’ Stated Policies Scenarios on heat pumps, with demand for them expected to double by 2035.

The IEA reports that trade in heat pumps has grown less rapidly than other clean energy technologies, but that installations are set to increase in the coming decades. Government support for heat pumps – as originally laid out in the US Inflation Reduction Act, for example – is needed for nations to achieve their climate and energy security goals, says the IEA. Bans on new fossil fuel boilers across Europe will also help.

4. Which homes will benefit most?

Insulating buildings is a key component of improving energy efficiency and reducing emissions. The data from Denmark in the chart above demonstrates that heat pumps in the best-insulated homes use 30% less electricity than those with poor insulation.

Improving a home’s energy rating by just two grades (from D to B) can halve energy demand, the IEA says. Making buildings more energy-efficient also means households can use lower-capacity heat pumps, which are cheaper to install.

A recent study in the UK found that heat pumps could cut heating bills for British people by around half – but only if the government takes steps to make electricity cheaper and reins in gas companies' profits.",https://assets.weforum.org/editor/MAZkPh7ev33vX44i8cDS4F7MqS--jXARGvrhqkLhjsA.JPG,N,,2025-09-25 08:59:10.445068

Experts warn that undoing it could weaken national climate policy, with ripple effects felt in California.
In July, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Endangerment Finding and the emissions standards that followed “the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods,” blaming them on costly federal regulations.
Experts agree that the state’s broad authority to regulate pollution from power plants, refineries and other stationary sources under its own climate laws would remain intact, even if the Endangerment Finding were rescinded.
The comment letter argues that the proposal undermines climate protections, which are critical as climate change harms “every region of our country, and especially California,” through extreme summer heat and the resulting increase in heat-related illness and deaths.","California officials this week lined up in opposition to the Trump administration’s proposal to rescind the 2009 Endangerment Finding, led by Gov. Gavin Newsom, who called the plan a “moral abdication” in a letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin while accusing the agency of betraying its mission to protect Americans.

“By siding with polluters over science, EPA is telling wildfire victims to ignore the flames, flood victims to ignore the rising water, and parents of asthmatic children to ignore the dirty air that chokes their respiratory systems and takes their breath away,” Newsom wrote on Monday as thepublic comment period ended.

In an email to The Sacramento Bee, the EPA said the agency “welcomes all public comments on the proposal through September 22, 2025,” and that it “looks forward to reviewing a diverse array of perspectives on this issue.”

The Trump administration’s latest attempt to roll back environmental protections targets what is widely considered the legal foundation for regulating carbon dioxide, methane and other greenhouse gases. Experts warn that undoing it could weaken national climate policy, with ripple effects felt in California.

The 2009 Endangerment Finding, issued by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the Obama administration, determined that six greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide and methane “endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations” under the Clean Air Act.

In July, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin called the Endangerment Finding and the emissions standards that followed “the real threat to Americans’ livelihoods,” blaming them on costly federal regulations.

“In our work so far, many stakeholders have told me that the Obama and Biden EPAs twisted the law, ignored precedent and warped science to achieve their preferred ends and stick American families with hundreds of billions of dollars in hidden taxes every single year,” Zeldin said.

“If finalized, rescinding the Endangerment Finding and resulting regulations would end $1 trillion or more in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.”

The goal, according to the EPA, is “reinstating consumer choice and giving Americans the ability to purchase a safe and affordable car for their family,” while lowering the cost of living on goods delivered by trucks.

California’s stricter auto emissions

For California, the consequences of the repeal are complicated. Experts agree that the state’s broad authority to regulate pollution from power plants, refineries and other stationary sources under its own climate laws would remain intact, even if the Endangerment Finding were rescinded.

Where the impact is less clear is on vehicle standards, which have been central to California’s climate policy, because under the Clean Air Act, California can apply for a waiver to set stricter vehicle emissions rules than the federal government.

“There are two possibilities. One is, if the federal government is no longer regulating greenhouse gasses, there might be some argument that California no longer even needs a waiver outside of the Clean Air Act,” Dan Farber, professor of law at the University of California, Berkeley, said.

The other possibility, Farber added, is that if California still needs a waiver, the legal rules for obtaining one would remain unchanged.

“I don’t really see that California is harmed anyway in terms of regulating vehicles,” Farber continued.

Albert Lin, co-director of the California Environmental Law and Policy Center at the UC Davis, agreed that California will still be able to regulate stationary sources like power plants and refineries, while noting the situation is more uncertain for vehicles.

If EPA claims it has no authority to regulate greenhouse gases from cars, that could weaken the federal rules that normally block states from setting their own standards. In that case, California might be able to step in. But Lin cautioned that the final word would rest with the courts.

Attorneys general: Rescinding climate finding would be unlawful

Lin also pointed to a comment letter filed on Monday from a coalition of 23 attorneys general, led by California Attorney General Bob Bonta, which argued that rescinding the Endangerment Finding would be unlawful and ignore established scientific evidence on climate change. The comment letter argues that the proposal undermines climate protections, which are critical as climate change harms “every region of our country, and especially California,” through extreme summer heat and the resulting increase in heat-related illness and deaths.

“We could expect to see the kind of climate change impact we’ve already seen in California and in the Sacramento region, intensifying some of those effects that are already familiar to many residents,” said Frances Moore, an associate professor of environmental science and policy at the University of California, Davis, pointing to the destruction of property and lives, as well as the “serious health implications of wildfire smoke” from wildfires, as examples.

“Sacramento is really vulnerable to flooding…that’s the other major immediate climate impact in addition to just extreme temperatures.”

Meanwhile, Newsom denounced President Donald Trump on Wednesday at a climate event while speaking to the New York Times a day after the president dismissed climate change as “the greatest con-job ever perpetrated on the world.” Newsom called Trump’s remarks an “abomination,” an “embarrassment,” and a “fraud.”

“And I say that as a guy that lives in one of the most crisis-prone states in America ... a state that’s seen lifestyles, places, traditions completely destroyed because of the reality of climate change,” Newsom said.",https://www.sacbee.com/public/latest-news/oy4z9a/picture311641869/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/SAC_1572_DRH_250808_TexasInCAPresser.JPG,N,,2025-09-25 13:02:28.117525

U.S. Rep. Chris Deluzio (D-Pa.-17) toured the installation to highlight how renewables can save energy and money, even as Republicans in Washington have ended clean energy incentives through the federal spending plan signed by President Trump in July.

CCAC President Quintin Bullock said the 543 kilowatt solar array at the North Campus was turned on in January 2022. It generates about 30% of the building’s electricity needs, saving the college up to $16,000 each year. Bullock said that’s money that can go back into programs that benefit students.

Deluzio said the end of federal tax credits will make it harder for others to make a switch to cheaper renewables. He said people in Western Pennsylvania are getting sticker shock from their electricity bills and other rising costs.

“ Life is very expensive. People expect our government — our federal government, where I serve — to do something to make life less of a ripoff for people,” Deluzio said. “ They also expect our government to deal with pollution, to protect our air quality, to combat climate change.”

The phase-out of clean energy tax credits is also a job killer, Deluzio said. The Clean Economy Tracker estimates the move will result in 16,000 lost energy jobs, and prevent 19 gigawatts of new energy generation across Pennsylvania over the next decade.

“I think a Democratic majority in the Congress will take as a priority restoring these tax credits to keep costs down, to protect our clean air and more,” Deluzio said. “I think we need to have a different control of the Congress and the House and the Senate to force the President back to the negotiating table to restore these tax credits.”

Gavin Lynch, a student volunteer with Moms Clean Air Force who attended Deluzio’s tour, said the federal government is going in the wrong direction on climate change.

Investors are pouring billions into the field to build power plants, and some companies are even signing huge agreements to purchase power from those still-nonexistent plants. All this comes before companies have actually completed a working reactor that can produce electricity. It takes money to develop a new technology, but all this funding could lead to some twisted expectations.

Nearly three years ago, the National Ignition Facility at Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory hit a major milestone for fusion power. With the help of the world’s most powerful lasers, scientists heated a pellet of fuel to 100 million °C. Hydrogen atoms in that fuel fused together, releasing more energy than the lasers put in.

It was a game changer for the vibes in fusion. The NIF experiment finally showed that a fusion reactor could yield net energy. Plasma physicists’ models had certainly suggested that it should be true, but it was another thing to see it demonstrated in real life.

But in some ways, the NIF results didn’t really change much for commercial fusion. That site’s lasers used a bonkers amount of energy, the setup was wildly complicated, and the whole thing lasted a fraction of a second. To operate a fusion power plant, not only do you have to achieve net energy, but you also need to do that on a somewhat constant basis and—crucially—do it economically.

So in the wake of the NIF news, all eyes went to companies like Commonwealth, Helion, and Zap Energy. Who would be the first to demonstrate this milestone in a more commercially feasible reactor? Or better yet, who would be the first to get a power plant up and running?

So far, the answer is none of them.

And yet, the money pours in. Commonwealth raised over $800 million in funding earlier this year. And now it’s got two big customers signed on to buy electricity from this future power plant.

Why buy electricity from a reactor that’s currently little more than ideas on paper? From the perspective of these particular potential buyers, such agreements can be something of a win-win, says Adam Stein, director of nuclear energy innovation at the Breakthrough Institute.

By putting a vote of confidence behind Commonwealth, Eni could help the fusion startup get the capital it needs to actually build its plant. The company also directly invests in Commonwealth, so it stands to benefit from success. Getting a good rate on the capital needed to build the plant could also mean the electricity is ultimately cheaper for Eni, Stein says.

Ultimately, fusion needs a lot of money. If fossil-fuel companies and tech giants want to provide it, all the better. One concern I have, though, is how outside observers are interpreting these big commitments.

US Energy Secretary Chris Wright has been loud about his support for fusion and his expectations of the technology. Earlier this month, he told the BBC that it will soon power the world.

He’s certainly not the first to have big dreams for fusion, and it is an exciting technology. But despite the jaw-dropping financial milestones, this industry is still very much in development.

And while Wright praises fusion, the Trump administration is slashing support for other energy technologies, including wind and solar power, and spreading disinformation about their safety, cost, and effectiveness.

To meet the growing electricity demand and cut emissions from the power sector, we’ll need a whole range of technologies. It’s a risk and a distraction to put all our hopes on an unproven energy tech when there are plenty of options that actually exist.

The NGO said investments in market-based conservation solutions for the ocean will be key to combating climate change and securing global food security.

“The ocean is our greatest ally in the fight against climate change, absorbing carbon, safeguarding biodiversity, and sustaining billions of people worldwide, but it’s also a driver of innovation, jobs, and food security,” Ocean Wise CEO Lasse Gustavsson said in a release.

Ocean Wise said its new Invest in the Ocean campaign will be running across a range of different media channels, including social media, digital displays, and broadcast channels, throughout the month.

Part of that call to action includes recognizing that the ocean is more than just an environment; it’s an economic engine for the communities adjacent to it. The NGO pointed out that 11 million people visit Canadian beaches each year and that 80 percent of all tourism takes place in coastal areas.

“By investing in the ocean, we can create safe and healthy environments that everyone can enjoy,” Ocean Wise said.

Ocean Wise also highlighted the number of people who rely on the ocean for food security, and said the blue economy and resources in the ocean are key to range of economic drivers and industries.

“When we invest our time, money and voice for the ocean, the returns are measurable, immediate, and long-lasting,” Gustavsson said. “This campaign is about mobilizing that collective investment so that together, we can unlock the ocean’s full potential to protect both people and the planet.”",https://s3.divcom.com/www.seafoodsource.com/images/06847ee08fbe95bd68b177dea049785b.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 07:00:38.091153

Here’s a sample:

What Has This Got to Do with Electric Cars?

Thanks to the general metropolitan-progressive war on cars, government subsidies for electric vehicles, the Biden administration’s anti-energy agenda, and regulations from states like California that target combustion engines for elimination, the Detroit Three have increasingly focused on electric vehicles. This changeover has led the companies to commit to a combined $120 billion infrastructure investment related to electric cars—cars on which at present, they are losing scads of money.

The automakers argue that conceding to the union’s demands amid this electric vehicle changeover expense could send them under. Job losses that the union hopes to avoid are also likely from the shift from combustion to charging. The right-of-center America First Policy Institute estimated that adopting the Biden administration’s directives to increase the proportion of electric vehicles on the roads from 6 percent to 67 percent would eliminate 117,000 jobs in the industry.

Watson’s full report is linked here.

InfluenceWatch has a profile of the UAW that begins with this overview:

The United Automobile, Aerospace and Agricultural Implement Workers of America International Union—also known as the United Automobile Workers (UAW)–is a labor union mainly comprised of American automobile manufacturing employees but that also includes unionized casino and higher education workers.

The UAW was at the forefront of the American labor movement and used militant strikes and sit-downs to force American car manufacturers to enter into their first labor agreements during the 1930s and 1940s. Over the years, the UAW has lobbied for excessive labor handouts—at one point including a “jobs bank” that paid laid off autoworkers 95 percent of their salary. The UAW also fought for an $80 billion government-funded auto industry bailout that critics claimed was merely a thinly veiled bailout for the UAW.

Since 2010, the UAW has spent over $87 million on politics and lobbying.4 The union uses this money to push a left-of-center agenda that includes traditional labor union prerogatives, such as replacing secret-ballot unionization elections with public “card check” and other liberal items including environmentalist manufacturing mandates, tax increases, legal status for millions of illegal immigrants, and laws to ease prison sentencing.

In 2017, a U.S. Justice Department corruption investigation revealed the corporate executives at Fiat Chrysler had illegally paid millions of dollars in kickbacks to UAW executives in exchange for union concessions.

In Puerto Rico, Vermont, California, Texas, and other states, virtual power plants have helped the grid survive spikes in demand, avoiding outages or the need to fire up gas-fueled peaker plants, and saving consumers money.

Illinois is among the areas expecting electricity demand to grow rapidly because of new data centers; meanwhile, the state is mandated to phase out fossil-fuel generation by 2045, and residential and commercial solar have boomed thanks to state incentive programs. If those solar arrays were paired with batteries, they could provide crucial clean power to the grid during high demand.

HB 4120, an ambitious bill that Illinois lawmakers may consider during an October veto session, would create a basic virtual power plant (VPP) program while mandating that the state’s two largest utilities — ComEd and Ameren — propose their own VPP programs by 2027.

The bill’s plan would offer a rebate to customers who purchase a battery, if they agree to let the battery be tapped for several hours a day during the summer months, when air conditioners drive up electricity use.

The Illinois proposal is less nuanced and comprehensive than VPP programs in other states. For example, in Vermont, Green Mountain Power subsidizes the purchase of batteries, which the utility can then tap while also controlling customers’ smart thermostats, EV chargers, and water heaters whenever the grid is stressed.

But stakeholders in the solar and energy storage industry say Illinois’ proposal is an important first step, opening the door for more ambitious VPP services.

“A utility may want a program to address ​‘emergency calls’ to reduce peak load, or deal with a winter peaking issue, or address locational capacity constraints,” said Amy Heart, senior vice president of public policy at Sunrun, a national company that has invested heavily in Illinois solar and that runs VPPs in Puerto Rico, California, and other places. ​“There is an official pathway and timeline for all of this.”

Building momentum

Energy players in Illinois have been talking seriously about VPPs for several years, during negotiations over what has now become the HB 4120. The legislation would incentivize the construction of large-scale energy storage in Illinois, through procurement by the state power agency. VPPs, meanwhile, would provide a decentralized form of storage.

Under the bill’s VPP program, residential customers would get a rebate of $300 per kilowatt-hour on the capacity of the battery they purchase, and then receive at least $10 per kilowatt during scheduled dispatches from 4 p.m. to 6 p.m. on weekdays in June, July, August, and September for a five-year period. ​“It’s sort of a ​‘set-it and forget-it’ program,” said Heart.

Illinois residents already receive a rebate for the same amount when they purchase a battery, but with the new rules, consumers would need to participate in the VPP program to qualify.

All community solar projects with storage would be required to participate in the VPP program, dispatching from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m.

ComEd, which serves northern Illinois, and Ameren, which serves most of the rest of the state, could petition the Illinois Commerce Commission for permission to tap the batteries on a different schedule, for no more than two or three hours a day over 80 days each year.

The basic program would not help with peak demand during unscheduled times — like unexpectedly hot fall weather. But at least utilities would be guaranteed power during the scheduled peaks, said Heart.

“People wanted to move quickly,” on getting a VPP program in the legislation, she added. ​“You avoid delays [caused by] trying to make this perfect. Industry is talking about how we need stability; nonprofits, ratepayer advocates, utilities, [and] labor are all talking about why we need these investments.”

Illinois, like many states, has demand-response programs that are often considered part of virtual power plants, helping people reduce their energy use during peak demand. And ComEd has already proposed a VPP program to state regulators.

But legislation is crucial for VPPs to really take off, to ensure that programs ​“feature robust participation, innovation by aggregators, and a wide range of benefits,” said Samarth Medakkar, policy principal for Advanced Energy United, a national trade association of power, transportation, and software companies focused on clean energy.

Illinois’ bill would permit third-party aggregators to manage VPP deployment, a common setup in other states wherein a company, like Virtual Peaker in Vermont, coordinates battery deployment and demand response for the customer and utility.

ComEd and Ameren would be required to file reports by the end of 2028 detailing how many people have enrolled in the VPP program and its effects on energy supply.

By the end of 2027, the companies would have to file proposals for their own VPP programs, which the state regulatory commission must approve by the close of 2028. Those programs would need to include higher incentives for low- to moderate-income customers, ​“community-driven” community solar projects, and areas targeted for equity investments in Illinois’ existing energy laws.

“VPPs have a huge potential in a state like Illinois, where there are already many capable devices — like smart thermostats and solar systems which can pair with storage — increasing in number at a rate we can accelerate,” said Medakkar.

Saving customers money with VPPs

An analysis conducted by clean-energy think tank RMI found that VPPs could meet most of the expected new demand in Illinois, providing a crucial bridge while more clean-power generation and transmission lines are built.

The report notes that the state will need around 3.9 gigawatts of new generation or energy savings by 2029, as demand grows and old fossil-fueled plants retire.

VPPs could satisfy about three-quarters of that need, the analysis says, if they account for 10% of electricity used during peak demand times by tapping batteries and dialing down customers’ energy consumption.

Plus, it takes much less time to set up a VPP than to build a new traditional power plant. ​“VPPs can be deployed in as little as six months, nearly three years quicker than the median deployment timelines for utility-scale batteries and natural gas plants,” notes the RMI report, which was produced for Advanced Energy United to inform the legislative process.

The analysis determined that VPPs would save the average Illinois customer $34 a year by reducing the amount of expensive capacity that utilities would have to purchase in the auctions run by regional grid operators. ComEd’s customers especially are seeing their bills skyrocket due to record-high capacity costs in the PJM regional market.

“There’s great untapped potential in demand-response and VPP-type products,” said Sarah Moskowitz, executive director of the Citizens Utility Board, which advocates for Illinois’ electric and gas customers. ​“It’s disappointing we haven’t seen more opportunities of this sort take root here. But maybe now, with the spiraling energy prices, policymakers will finally see that these are programs that can bring real benefit not just to those who directly participate but to everybody.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/GettyImages-1329792444.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=0f25b25f90f3b3593043db8e7714e9bb,N,,2025-09-25 07:00:05.644272

President Trump, at the UN General Assembly, criticized renewable energy as ineffective and costly, challenging climate change consensus. Despite his claims, renewables drove 80% of global electricity generation growth in 2024. While the US clean energy sector employs over 3.5 million, job growth has slowed, potentially worsened by Trump's policies, including project cancellations and regulatory hurdles.

President Donald Trump delivered a sharply critical speech on renewable energy at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, September 23 dismissing clean energy sources as ineffective and costly. His remarks directly challenge the scientific consensus on climate change and come at a time when the US clean energy sector employs more than 3.5 million people, as more Americans working in the sector than as servers or cashiers.

During his address, President Trump made unsubstantiated claims about renewable energy and climate change. He said that clean energy sources such as solar and wind “don’t work” and are “too expensive.” Trump warned that the economics of renewable energy are harming the economy and resulting in higher energy costs. He described renewable energy as “a joke” and said they are not powerful enough to meet modern infrastructure needs.

Reality check: Renewables drive energy growth

ABC News fact-checked this claim and said in 2024, 80 per cent of the growth in global electricity generation came from renewable and nuclear sources, which together contributed 40 per cent of the world’s total electricity generation for the first time. Solar and wind alone accounted for 16 per cent of the United States’ electricity, surpassing coal. Renewable energy sources are forecast to meet approximately 95 per cent of global electricity demand growth through 2027.

The outlet cited the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) report and said that more than 90 per cent of new renewable projects are now cheaper than fossil fuel alternatives. In 2024, solar photovoltaics were, on average, 41 per cent cheaper than the lowest-cost fossil fuel options, while onshore wind projects were 53 per cent cheaper.

Clean energy job scenario

Clean energy job growth has been one of the sector’s major successes. According to E2, a clean energy advocacy group, the US added close to 100,000 jobs in solar, wind, batteries, energy efficiency, grid upgrades, biofuels, and electric vehicles in 2024. Wind turbine technician and solar installer are currently the fastest-growing jobs in America.

Live Events

The report says that over 3.5 million Americans now hold clean energy sector jobs, more than are employed as nurses, cashiers, servers, or elementary school teachers, as claimed by a Yale Environment 360 report.

But growth is slowing and Trump’s policies may worsen it

Despite the strong job numbers, clean energy job growth slowed in 2024, with the US adding 50,000 fewer clean energy jobs compared to 2023. Analysts attribute this slowdown to a weakening economy and uncertainty about energy policy.

Since President Trump took office, the administration has taken steps that critics say threaten the clean energy industry’s growth. These include blocking renewable energy projects on federal lands and waters, slashing tax credits for clean technology, and introducing new regulatory hurdles for solar, wind, and electric vehicles, according to a previous analysis from E2.

That analysis found that in the first half of 2025, businesses canceled $22 billion worth of clean energy projects projects that would have created more than 16,500 jobs, most of them in Republican strongholds.

Nigro said the country is heading toward full vehicle electrification, even without the federal tax credit.","More electric vehicles are sold in Florida than anywhere in the southeastern United States, an analysis by Southern Alliance for Clean Energy shows.

And sales are expected to remain strong even after a federal tax incentive ends next week.

Total sales for electric vehicles have grown 42% in Florida since last year. More than one out of every 10 new cars sold in the state is electric, which is above the national average.

On a recent webinar, the founder of the data and research firm Atlas Public Policy, Nick Nigro, said Florida is an ""attractive"" place for EVs.

""It's very flat. It's very warm. It's very conducive to electric vehicles because you get a lot more predictability over the range of the vehicle,"" he said.

""If you look at the top vehicles in Florida ... It's the Tesla Model Y, it's the Chevy Equinox EV. These are the same vehicles that are most popular nationally,"" he continued.

Even though EVs are really popular in the state, Nigro said, Florida hasn't taken enough advantage of federal funding to increase the number of fast-charging stations.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure program, which was funded by the federal Bipartisan Infrastructure Law in 2021, was the largest investment in EV charging in U.S. history at $5 billion.

Nigro said Florida is slacking on these funds.

""Florida, where are you? You've got to get off the dime. Florida, of all the states in the country, is falling the farthest behind and taking advantage of these federal dollars,” he said.

ALSO READ: Trump plugged back into bankrolling EV chargers. When will Florida see more?

He encouraged the state to use it while it's available, saying Florida has a ""really great EV market.""

""And I'm sure a lot of people would appreciate having more fast chargers available for them to use,"" he continued.

In January 2025, Florida was awarded $37 million in Round 2 Charging and Fueling Infrastructure grants, which is more than any other state in the Southeast.

According to the SACE transportation report, Florida came second per capita for charging stations in the region and 21st in the nation, with 3,502 fast-charging ports and 8,665 level 2 ports.

Separately, consumers are fast approaching a deadline: They have until Tuesday to utilize a federal tax incentive of up to $7,500 to purchase or lease a new or used electric or hybrid vehicle from former President Joe Biden’s Inflation Reduction Act of 2022.

The breaks were supposed to last until 2032, but were phased out sooner by President Donald Trump’s ""One Big Beautiful Bill.""

Nigro said the country is heading toward full vehicle electrification, even without the federal tax credit.

""Probably about less than half of the vehicles that were being sold in the last year even qualified for the credit. So, a lot of vehicles are being purchased by Americans without the credit in place,"" he said.

Although, Nigro added, the timeline for electrification is going to be stretched out a bit.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/622710a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/5712x2999+0+216/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F40%2Fa1%2F34ea68ac41e2afb8ea16437614e2%2Felectric-vehicle-tesla-near-water.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 07:58:28.168312

New Jersey's utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause ""unreasonable"" cost increases for other users.
Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

""You can't follow the facts, you can't follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,"" DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts—equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta's infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta's contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP's questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis—the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan—said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

""There's certain information we should know and need to know but don't have,"" Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to ""tens of millions of dollars or more each year"" in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be ""very little"" impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta's facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University's Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay ""every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.""

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania's utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey's utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause ""unreasonable"" cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a 'kill switch' law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

""We don't come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,"" said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

""We have a lot of concerned people—they've put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. ""I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.""

Dubbed the Voltpost Air, the new Level 2 charger is much smaller than the company’s previous model.

It can be installed on almost any type of lamppost at a fraction of the cost of a traditional public Level 2 EV charger, which could supercharge the charging infrastructure in urban areas.

The little lamppost-installed box you see in the photos below might be the key to unlocking a more stress-free EV ownership experience in dense cities where parking and overnight charging is an issue.

It’s called the Voltpost Air, and it’s the brainchild of a New York-based startup that was founded just four years ago with a big idea: turn boring street lights into electric car chargers. They’re pretty much everywhere, so why not take advantage of their ubiquity to make life easier for EV owners everywhere?

The Air is Voltpost’s second model, and compared to its first generation of lamppost-mounted chargers, it’s a lot smaller. According to the company, up to two chargers can be installed on a single post, providing up to 9.6 kilowatts of power to each connected EV. A smartphone app can be used to find chargers and pay for charging sessions.

Compared to the first version of Voltpost’s Level 2 charger, which is installed at the base of a street light, the Air is mounted at roughly 10 feet (3 meters) above the ground to protect against vandalism and weather. A retractable charging cable ensures no wires are dangling over the sidewalk, reducing the risk of pedestrians tripping.

According to Jeffrey Prosserman, cofounder and CEO of Voltpost, installation takes just a couple of hours and costs a few thousand dollars because there’s no need to need to dig up sidewalks or wait for utility upgrades. Prosserman told Axios that it’s merely a case of pulling a cable bundle through the post’s existing conduit.

“With millions of streetlights in the United States, the opportunity to convert even a fraction into chargers will make a significant positive impact,” the startup’s CEO added. “Born in America and built coast to coast, Voltpost is empowering communities with accessible, affordable charging.”

The first Votpost Air charger was installed in Brooklyn at the MADE Bush Terminal with funding from the New York City Economic Development Corporation (NYCEDC), the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) and Con Edison. The charger will be available to the public by the end of the year, the company said.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

The company announced that it will continue to increase investment in R&D, market expansion, and international cooperation over the next three years, further strengthening its leadership position in the global low-carbon transportation transition.
Allen Jones EFS Media Technology Inc. Allen (at) efsonline.net","Denver, Colorado, Sept. 24, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Against the backdrop of rapid global urbanization and the growing challenges of climate change, the sustainable transformation of the transportation sector has become a focal point for governments and society alike. Today, EFS Media Technology Inc. announced that it will further advance the implementation of low-carbon transportation solutions by strengthening its global partner network and leveraging technological innovation, helping major cities achieve goals in green mobility and carbon reduction.

Founded in 2019 and headquartered in the United States, EFS Media Technology Inc. has always adhered to its core strategy of “low-carbon, intelligent, and sustainable.” The company is dedicated to reshaping urban transportation systems through shared bicycles and smart technologies. Over the years, it has expanded operations to more than 30 countries, working with governments, urban planners, and local partners to turn sustainable mobility from vision into reality.

“Urban transportation not only affects residents’ daily commuting efficiency but also has a direct impact on air quality and global climate change,” said the CEO of EFS at the press conference. “Our goal is to expand low-carbon mobility models from pilot demonstrations to broad adoption. Through our global partner network and technological innovation, we aim to help more cities move faster and more steadily along the path of green transformation.”

The company’s newly announced strategic priorities include three areas:

Promoting the adoption of electric vehicles and charging infrastructure, thereby increasing the share of renewable energy in transportation systems;

Leveraging artificial intelligence and big data for real-time traffic monitoring and smart scheduling, reducing energy waste and road congestion;

Expanding shared mobility solutions in emerging markets, easing urban traffic pressure while creating new employment opportunities.

Industry analysts note that carbon emissions from the transportation sector remain a significant share of global greenhouse gas output. Therefore, scalable low-carbon transportation solutions will play a profound role in shaping urban development and energy structures over the next decade. By establishing long-term partnerships with governments and leading enterprises worldwide, EFS Media Technology Inc. is well-positioned to gain a competitive edge in the global race for green transportation transformation.

A notable initiative is the company’s plan to launch a “Zero-Carbon Transportation Corridor” pilot project by 2026, selecting several international transport hub cities as demonstration sites. The project will integrate electric vehicles, smart mobility platforms, and renewable energy systems to achieve a fully low-carbon operational chain. EFS expects this model to be replicated and scaled across more cities, creating a sustainable industry benchmark.

“The future of low-carbon transportation is not a distant vision but a reality being realized step by step through collaboration and innovation,” added EFS’s Head of Strategy. “We believe that as our partner network continues to grow, EFS will play an even greater role in advancing the global low-carbon future.”

As nations accelerate the implementation of climate policies, EFS Media Technology Inc.’s strategic initiatives align closely with industry trends and policy directions. The company announced that it will continue to increase investment in R&D, market expansion, and international cooperation over the next three years, further strengthening its leadership position in the global low-carbon transportation transition.

,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-25 07:32:48+00:00,Canary Media,North Carolina funds repairs so Helene-hit homes can get energy upgrades,Not Available,,,,,https://www.canarymedia.com/articles/energy-efficiency/north-carolina-funding-repair-hurricane-damage-weatherization,"Now, North Carolina plans to solve that problem by allocating $10 million to urgent home repair in the region.
The program’s services — including sealing leaks around doors and windows, adding insulation, and improving appliance efficiency — benefit hundreds of North Carolina households each year, lowering their utility bills by up to $300.
That’s why the newly announced money for western North Carolina households is so vital, said Claire Williamson, energy policy advocate at the North Carolina Justice Center: It will unlock assistance for households that have previously been unable to access weatherization aid.
Some municipalities have their own fix-it programs, Williamson said, as does the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.
​“When homes are more efficient, it helps benefit the rest of North Carolina,” she added.","A year after Hurricane Helene hit western North Carolina — dumping as much as 30 inches of rain and felling thousands of trees — countless homes still suffer from leaky roofs, mold and mildew, and rotting floors.

All that damage doesn’t just threaten residents’ comfort, health, and safety. Unless it’s resolved, low-income households can’t access free energy-efficiency retrofits that could save them hundreds of dollars each year on their utility bills.

Now, North Carolina plans to solve that problem by allocating $10 million to urgent home repair in the region. Officials in the administration of Gov. Josh Stein, a Democrat, hope the funds will aid more than 575 households in the counties most devastated by Helene.

“This effort is going to increase western North Carolina’s sound and efficient housing stock, reduce energy costs for the most vulnerable families and individuals, and make homes safer and more comfortable,” Julie Woosley, director of the State Energy Office, said in a statement.

Drawing on a disaster-relief package passed by lawmakers in the early aftermath of Helene, the home-repair monies will be distributed to a regional government entity and nine community action agencies that implement the federal Weatherization Assistance Program.

Established nearly a half century ago, the weatherization initiative is aimed at families below certain annual income thresholds; for example, a family of four must earn about $60,000 or less to qualify. The program’s services — including sealing leaks around doors and windows, adding insulation, and improving appliance efficiency — benefit hundreds of North Carolina households each year, lowering their utility bills by up to $300.

But the Weatherization Assistance Program only scratches the surface of need for the energy burdened. Because its funds are restricted to minor repairs and mostly can’t be used for major ones such as roof replacement, about one in five families nationwide are deferred from receiving benefits, according to a survey by the nonprofit American Council for an Energy-Efficient Economy. Of those, 40% never get weatherized at all.

That’s why the newly announced money for western North Carolina households is so vital, said Claire Williamson, energy policy advocate at the North Carolina Justice Center: It will unlock assistance for households that have previously been unable to access weatherization aid.

“It’s not only helping families recovering from Hurricane Helene,” Williamson said, ​“but also helping these families not be burdened by rising energy costs.”

To be sure, there are several existing efforts to bridge the gap for households that need energy-efficiency retrofits as well as major repairs. Some municipalities have their own fix-it programs, Williamson said, as does the North Carolina Housing Finance Agency.

For Duke Energy customers, Williamson’s group helped win $16 million for urgent home fixes financed by shareholders. But the predominant utility doesn’t serve the state’s farthest-flung counties, including some heavily hit by Helene.

“It’s fantastic that pre-weatherization dollars can be used for people who are members of electric cooperatives,” she said. ​“Otherwise, these households are getting left behind.”

The $10 million announcement from the State Energy Office comes at a crucial time for weatherization efforts statewide. In 2021, the program got a $90 million boost from the federal bipartisan infrastructure law — funding not yet swept up in the Trump administration’s assault on clean energy and energy efficiency.

After months of planning, the Stein administration says those funds will be deployed starting in January and spent by the end of the decade, with hopes of serving around 2,000 households annually. The plan includes up to $12.6 million for major health and safety repairs.

“It’s such a great sign that the state is dedicating funds to this issue,” Williamson said. ​“When homes are more efficient, it helps benefit the rest of North Carolina,” she added. ​“They’re lowering energy use and lowering their impact on the grid.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Helene-Tree-Asheville.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=56abe94bac1b6bc557d73624b69eb499,N,,2025-09-25 03:58:41.934150

""We wish India would work with us to buy (oil). You can buy oil from every nation on the earth, just not Russian oil. That's our position. America has oil to sell, so does everybody else.

Chris Wright's remarks are the latest in the series of US officials talking about US President Donald Trump's punishing 50 per cent tariffs on India, half of which are a penalty for buying oil from Russia.

‘Huge fan of India’

Wright also said that he is a “huge fan” of India and that the US wants to expand energy trade with India, however, the latter is “caught up in the middle of another issue”, seemingly referring to the Russian war in Ukraine.

Echoing President Trump's reasoning of punishing India with steep tariffs for doing business with Russia, Wright said that Trump's “greatest passion is peace"" and that India's purchase of Russia's sanctioned oil, along with China and Turkey, helps fund the war in Ukraine.

“I am a huge fan of India. We love India. We look forward to more energy trade, more interactions back and forth with India and then India is caught up in the middle of another issue. President Trump's greatest passion is peace in the world...The Russian war in Ukraine, of course, is brutal. We all want to see it come to an end. But where does the sanctioned Russian oil go? It goes to China, India, and Turkiye and that helps Russia fund that war,” Wright said.

His remarks come after Trump accused India and China of being the ""primary funders"" of the Ukraine war on Tuesday during his address at the United Nations General Assembly.

New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users.
Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. (AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Private deals for public power supply

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

How is this tackled in other states?

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Locals have mixed feelings

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Clean energy jobs grew much faster than jobs in other sectors last year, a new report finds.

Southern states were among those with the biggest rates of increase. They now account for almost a third of these jobs.

Federal policy changes could slow continued growth, opening the door for states and business to lead.

The growth of clean energy jobs was more than three times that of overall job growth in 2024, according to the 2025 Clean Jobs America report.

There were nearly 100,000 new clean energy jobs by year’s end. Almost 3.6 million Americans now work in sectors including clean vehicles, renewable energy generation and energy efficiency.

These numbers are drawn from Bureau of Labor Statistics data, supplemented by a survey of more than 40,000 companies. The jobs report comes from E2, a nonprofit that works with investors and business leaders.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director.

The South Is Leading

The highest rates of job increase in 2024 weren’t in Western states, with the exception of Idaho (see map). West Virginia, Louisiana, Florida and Oklahoma were all in the top 10.

Longer-term trends are similar. Only two blue states are among the 10 that have seen the fastest growth in clean energy jobs since 2020. Kentucky, Alabama and Tennessee are all on this list.

This concentration is reflected in the overall size of the workforce. Nearly a third of the 3.6 million clean energy jobs are in the South.

Renewable jobs have increased dramatically since 2020. A continuous upward trend accelerated after 2022.

Growth Is Slowing

Changing federal policies, including the One Big Beautiful Bill’s rollback of Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) tax credits and an executive order freezing disbursement of IRA funds to support clean energy programs, are expected to slow growth.

E2 has identified more than $22 billion in clean investments that have been canceled since the beginning of 2025. This means the loss of nearly 17,000 jobs.

States are realizing that they need to step up, Keefe says. Ninety percent of the new power capacity added in 2024 came from renewables.

Data centers and AI are driving intense demand, and solar and wind are the fastest and cheapest ways to get more electricity. The wait for a new turbine for a natural gas power plant is currently seven years, Keefe says.

He points to recent bipartisan bills enacted in California that extend its cap-and-trade program and call for establishment of a regional electricity market that would increase grid stability as an example of how states can lead.

The tech industry is also moving toward clean energy, Keefe says. States aren’t happy with their huge electricity demands. A workforce that can foster ongoing energy innovation, and build and maintain systems, is part of the AI support system.

“We need to reinvest in innovation in America,” he says. “These companies are going to continue to grow — unfortunately, just not at the pace they have in the past.”

Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.","HOLLY RIDGE, La. (AP) — In a rural corner of Louisiana, Meta is building one of the world's largest data centers, a $10 billion behemoth as big as 70 football fields that will consume more power in a day than the entire city of New Orleans at the peak of summer.

While the colossal project is impossible to miss in Richland Parish, a farming community of 20,000 residents, not everything is visible, including how much the social media giant will pay toward the more than $3 billion in new electricity infrastructure needed to power the facility.

Watchdogs have warned that in the rush to capitalize on the AI-driven data center boom, some states are allowing massive tech companies to direct expensive infrastructure projects with limited oversight.

Mississippi lawmakers allowed Amazon to bypass regulatory approval for energy infrastructure to serve two data centers it is spending $10 billion to build. In Indiana, a utility is proposing a data center-focused subsidiary that operates outside normal state regulations. And while Louisiana says it has added consumer safeguards, it lags behind other states in its efforts to insulate regular power consumers from data center-related costs.

Mandy DeRoche, an attorney for the environmental advocacy group Earthjustice, says there is less transparency due to confidentiality agreements and rushed approvals.

“You can’t follow the facts, you can’t follow the benefits or the negative impacts that could come to the service area or to the community,” DeRoche said.

Under contract with Meta, power company Entergy agreed to build three gas-powered plants that would produce 2,262 megawatts — equivalent to a fifth of Entergy's current power supply in Louisiana. The Public Service Commission approved Meta’s infrastructure plan in August after Entergy agreed to bolster protections to prevent a spike in residential rates.

Nonetheless, nondisclosure agreements conceal how much Meta will pay.

Consumer advocates tried but failed to compel Meta to provide sworn testimony, submit to discovery and face cross-examination during a regulatory review. Regulators reviewed Meta’s contract with Entergy, but were barred from revealing details.

Meta did not address AP’s questions about transparency, while Louisiana's economic development agency and Entergy say nondisclosure agreements are standard to protect sensitive commercial data.

Davante Lewis — the only one of five public service commissioners to vote against the plan — said he's still unclear how much electricity the center will use, if gas-powered plants are the most economical option nor if it will create the promised 500 jobs.

“There’s certain information we should know and need to know but don’t have,” Lewis said.

Additionally, Meta is exempt from paying sales tax under a 2024 Louisiana law that the state acknowledges could lead to “tens of millions of dollars or more each year” in lost revenue.

Meta has agreed to fund about half the cost of building the power plants over 15 years, including cost overruns, but not maintenance and operation, said Logan Burke, executive director of the Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group.

Public Service Commission Jean-Paul Coussan insists there will be “very little” impact on ratepayers.

But watchdogs warn Meta could pull out of or not renew its contract, leaving the public to pay for the power plants over the rest of their 30-year life span, and all grid users are expected to help pay for the $550 million transmission line serving Meta’s facility.

Ari Peskoe, director of Harvard University’s Electricity Law Initiative, said tech companies should be required to pay “every penny so the public is not left holding the bag.”

Elsewhere, tech companies are not being given such leeway. More than a dozen states have taken steps to protect households and business ratepayers from paying for rising electricity costs tied to energy-hungry data centers.

Pennsylvania’s utilities commission is drafting a model rate structure to insulate customers from rising costs related to data centers. New Jersey’s utilities regulators are studying whether data centers cause “unreasonable” cost increases for other users. Oregon passed legislation this year ordering utilities regulators to develop new, and likely higher, power rates for data centers.

And in June, Texas implemented what it calls a ‘kill switch’ law empowering grid operators to order data centers to reduce their electrical load during emergencies.

Some Richland Parish residents fear a boom-and-bust cycle once construction ends. Others expect a boost in school and health care funding. Meta said it plans to invest in 1,500 megawatts of renewable energy in Louisiana and $200 million in water and road infrastructure in Richland Parish.

“We don’t come from a wealthy parish and the money is much needed,” said Trae Banks, who runs a drywall business that has tripled in size since Meta arrived.

In the nearby town of Delhi, Mayor Jesse Washington believes the data center will eventually have a positive impact on his community of 2,600.

But for now, the construction traffic frustrates residents and property prices are skyrocketing as developers try to house thousands of construction workers. More than a dozen low-income families were evicted from a trailer park whose owners are building housing for incoming Meta workers, Washington says.

“We have a lot of concerned people — they’ve put hardship on a lot of people in certain areas here,"" the mayor said. “I just want to see people from Delhi benefit from this.”

Now, the 50 or so remaining residents must plant portable gardens in canoes and small boats.
We’re part of the land, the air, the water.” Philippe explained.
“Instead of fixing it, I broke it.” Chris Brunet took the offer and left the island for the new community.","Third and final in a series on a recent visit to Louisiana’s bayous, a trip sponsored by the Nicholas School of the Environment at Duke University, to start a conversation between people there who are being flooded out and those in the Down East communities of Carteret County who face similar threats.

GRAND BAYOU VILLAGE, La. – Home is where we feel we belong. Its mystic cords connect us to everything we know and cherish – our family, our friends, our culture, our past. Its hold on us is so complete that we must fight to save it, even as the water rises around our ankles.

Maybe, in the end, that’s the simple, but profound, lesson in all this.

A group of North Carolinians had gone to the battered bayous of southern Louisiana to connect with those at the edge of the climate crisis. We found resilient people who have withstood numerous storms and the constant flooding that comes with living at ground zero for rising seas. We found a natural world that is changing so rapidly and so dramatically that those who live there barely recognize it anymore. We had hoped to return better prepared for what’s coming because our state’s uniformly flat coastal plain will be one of most-threatened landscapes in America.

The scientists, as they did there in Louisiana, will almost certainly advise us to surrender to the impending flood. But it’s never that simple. Like the survivors of the bayous, we will try to adapt, pick up the pieces and soldier on, many to the bitter end. This is home, after all, and retreat isn’t an option.

“Leaving would be almost like death,” said Rosina Philippe, before we boarded the small skiffs for the short trip to her village in the bayou. We can reach it only by boat. “For us, home is more than the building you live in.”

Philippe is an elder in the Atakapa-Ishak/Chawasha Tribe, one of the several small Native American groups we visited. They fled from Andrew Jackson in the 1830s and sought refuge along the remote, watery fringes of the continent. Her people settled here in south Plaquemines Parish, close to where the Mississippi River empties into the Gulf of Mexico. Here, they fished; they farmed; they survived.

But, then, the water started rising. Slowly, at first. Then, more rapidly. Now, acres of marsh disappear in what seems like a blink of an eye. (See a previous story for the reasons.)

The small squadron of skiffs glided through Grandpa Bayou to what remains of Grand Bayou Village. Fourteen houses, perched on wooden stilts pounded into small plots of squishy land, dotted the water. No road connects them. “When I was a girl, there were forests as far as you can see,” Philippe said, as she scanned the open waters of the Gulf. “You could walk for miles without boots on your feet.”

Her grandparents told of a time, back in the 1940s, when almost 1,000 tribal members lived in hundreds of houses that lined the high ground of the bayou for more than five miles. Each had a proper yard with enough land to raise goats and plant peach orchards. The surrounding waters provided their bounty of fish, shrimp, crabs and oysters. Now, the 50 or so remaining residents must plant portable gardens in canoes and small boats. They try to protect their burial grounds and other sacred sites with reefs made from oyster shells recycled from New Orleans restaurants, 40 miles away.

Most of the tribe’s 800 members have left, but those who remained, including Philippe and her brother Maurice, intend to stay. She already has a solution for when dry land completely disappears. She’ll live on a houseboat moored to her sunken home.

“Everything you see around us is in our DNA. We’re part of the land, the air, the water.” Philippe explained. “If you leave, you become someone else. You are no longer the same person. No longer the same people.”

A Homecoming

In Ironton, 20 miles to the north on Louisiana Highway 23, the Rev. Haywood Johnson Jr. is trying to bring his flock home after a series of devastating hurricanes scattered it to the wind. Most are descendants of the slaves who founded the settlement soon after emancipation, making Ironton one of the oldest Black communities in the state.

Being Black and poor in the Deep South during the reign of Jim Crow meant nothing was ever easy. Life was particularly onerous in Plaquemines Parish, where Leander Perez ruled with an iron fist for more than 40 years during the mid-20th century. The Democratic Party boss, district attorney and head of the parish commission was a racist and an avowed segregationist in the old Dixiecrat mold. He cared nothing for the Black residents of the parish and made sure they were last in line for everything – voting rights, equal schooling, sewerage, even running water. The parish didn’t lay water lines to Ironton until 1980 and then only after “60 Minutes” made a big deal of it.

The same was true of flood protection. Ironton was excluded from the massive federal levee that Congress authorized after Hurricane Katrina inundated much of southern Louisiana in 2005. Had the wall been extended 10 miles south, hurricanes Issac in 2012 and Ida nine years later would likely have been less destructive. “Ida was the worst,” Johnson said. “It devastated our community. I had never seen anything like it.”

The eye of the Category 4 storm passed over the Ironton on Aug. 29, 2121, just months after Johnson and his congregation celebrated the 143rd anniversary of their St. Paul Missionary Baptist Church. The hurricane damaged or destroyed every building in the community. Even caskets floated out of their graves.

For the third time in 16 years, Johnson’s church was wrecked. “We weren’t going anywhere,” he said. “We were going to come back and rebuild because this is our heritage. This is our identity. If you lose that, you cease to exist.”

It took four years, but Johnson was notified just before our visit in June that the Federal Emergency Management Agency had finally approved money to raise and rebuild the church. He hopes the reopening will reunite his congregation. “Many left after Ida,” he said. “Their hearts had been broken.”

He promised to invite us to the first Homecoming.

Staying Home

The bright orange globe of the setting sun was dipping into Terrebonne Bay when we came upon brothers Dominic and Levis Dardar sitting on a dilapidated dock sipping beers and admiring the sunset. They are the last members of their tribe living on their ancestral island.

The Isle de Jean Charles Band of Biloxi-Chitimacha-Choctaw Indians have lived on a narrow ridge of high ground in the marsh in Terrebonne Parish for more than 170 years. Until the asphalt road was built in 1953, boats were the only reliable way to get home. Island Road today is often impassable because of high winds and tides. But few people use it now.

The amount of land that has been lost here is staggering, from 22,000 acres in 1955 to about 300 acres today. With the land went the people. Several hundred tribal members once lived in 60 or so homes. By the early 2000s, only 25 families remained on the island.

Chief Albert Naquin then began his tireless efforts to relocate the entire community to save the tribe’s culture and traditions. It took almost two decades, but the federal government In 2016 gave Louisiana $48 million to voluntarily move island residents to higher ground. It was the first federally funded climate migration program in the US.

The country’s relationship with its native peoples has been marked by disappointment and betrayal, and this deal was no different. Naquin had hoped that all his people would be reunited in one place, but only tribal members who left Isle de Jean Charles after 2012 were offered money to move. They could choose to live in a new, planned community, The New Isle, 40 miles to the north, or anywhere else in the state that was safe from flooding. Homes in the new community would eventually be available to anyone. “The plan was to reunite the tribe, and now it’s going to be destroyed,” a heart-broken Naquin told the Los Angeles Times in 2019. “Instead of fixing it, I broke it.”

One way to do this is to require state incentive applicants to report electric commercial vehicle prices.","Vehicle cost is a major barrier to electric truck adoption. That barrier has been getting higher, not lower, over the past five years.

A new study from the International Council on Clean Transportation shows that the price of Class 6-8 electric trucks has increased since model year 2020. This is despite a 20% drop in battery pack costs.

Comparatively, prices are falling for Class 5 and smaller electric commercial vehicles. Electric cargo van and full-size pickup truck prices are down 42%. Larger walk-in electric vans and electric utility trucks model year 2025 are 46% cheaper than they were with model year 2020.

When it comes to heavy-duty commercial vehicles, it costs more to buy an electric version today than it did five years ago.

Median prices for Class 8 electric trucks are up 27% since model year 2020. They now cost over $411,000, which is $87,000 more than before.

Diesel truck prices have also risen, but not as much. A new diesel truck costs about $172,500, up $18,000 (12%) since model year 2020.

Fleets may face even higher costs soon. The federal Commercial Clean Vehicle Credit offers up to a $40,000 tax credit for electric truck purchases. However, that ends on Tuesday, Sept. 30.

Any sticker shock relief will have to come from the states. Nearly 80% of the price data points in the study come from electric trucks bought with state incentives. Some states offer vouchers or rebates for electric trucks. Many of those states had adopted California’s Advanced Clean Trucks rules, which were eliminated in June.

The United States appears to be an outlier when it comes to electric truck prices. In the European Union, prices for Class 7-8 equivalent electric tractor trucks and straight trucks have fallen by 32% and 23% respectively.

What’s driving up electric truck costs?

Several factors may drive up electric truck costs, with stakeholders pointing fingers at each other.

Manufacturers told researchers changes in raw materials costs and higher demand for vehicle warranties have raised the price tag. One manufacturer said it has no control over the final price, suggesting dealerships may be at least partially responsible. However, one trucking fleet rep pushed back, saying dealerships work in slim margins and are vulnerable to pricing that manufacturers give them.

New players have also entered the market. Initially, new manufacturers were offering electric trucks while legacy manufacturers stuck with diesel. Newer companies offered lower prices to capture a larger market share.

Now, legacy manufacturers have entered the arena. With market dominance and customer loyalty, it is possible big companies like Daimler and Volvo drove up prices.

Differences between U.S. and European Union prices may be more easily explained. To start, there are significant supply chain differences between the two. Also, U.S. trucks will likely always be more expensive because of longer driving ranges that require larger batteries.

What can drive down costs?

Researchers have suggested that higher price tags may come from consumers not knowing the price in the first place.

The study notes that, unlike electric passenger vehicles, electric truck prices are not publicly available. Making these prices public could lower costs and boost electric vehicle adoption. One way to do this is to require state incentive applicants to report electric commercial vehicle prices.

“Cheaper upfront prices will make zero-emission products more accessible to fleet customers,” the study states. “Importantly, lower purchase costs amplify the total cost of ownership advantages of zero-emission commercial vehicles compared with internal combustion engine options.”

While lower upfront costs can ease one barrier to electric truck adoption, many others remain. Limited mileage ranges mean electric commercial vehicles cannot travel as far as diesel trucks before needing to recharge. The current heavy-duty charging infrastructure is sparse, causing logistical challenges for electric truck fleets.",https://landline.media/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/09-24-25-EV-prices-pic.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 01:59:21.276643

The Town of Carrboro filed suit last year, accusing Duke Energy of deceiving the public about the dangers of fossil fuels, a strategy town leaders say delayed the clean-energy transition and left taxpayers on the hook for millions of dollars in damages.

Other WRAL Top Stories

“We need to protect our community from future harms, and this is why we find ourselves here as a plaintiff in this lawsuit,” Carrboro Mayor Barbara Foushee said.

Carrboro estimates it could face up to $60 million in future costs from road repairs, flooding and higher electricity use in public buildings as hotter temperatures and heavier rain batter the town. The complaint also cites industry ads from the 1990s questioning whether climate change was real, which attorneys say created confusion and stalled action.

Duke Energy, in its motion to dismiss, says Carrboro’s claims are misplaced and preempted by federal law. The company argues the Clean Air Act gives the Environmental Protection Agency authority over greenhouse gas emissions, not local governments. It also says climate change is a global phenomenon that cannot be traced back to a single utility.

“Artful pleading cannot transform the City’s complaint into anything other than a suit over global greenhouse gas emissions,” Duke lawyers wrote in a brief, citing similar cases dismissed in other states.

Carrboro counters that the case is not about regulating emissions but about deception. In its opposition filing, the town said Duke ran “widespread deception campaigns about its fossil-fuel products and climate change” and that courts have a duty to hear such claims.

The lawsuit is unusual because most climate cases in the United States have targeted oil and gas producers. Legal experts say bringing utilities into the fold could raise new questions for courts, since power companies are heavily regulated and also responsible for keeping the lights on.

The hearing comes as Duke Energy is expanding its natural gas infrastructure after state lawmakers this summer repealed a requirement that the company cut carbon emissions 70% by 2030. The General Assembly overrode Gov. Josh Stein’s veto, eliminating the interim deadline while keeping a 2050 net-zero goal in place. Analysts warn the shift could drive up customer costs, while supporters say it ensures reliable electricity as data centers and new factories move to North Carolina.

Duke has pledged to retire its coal plants by 2035 and reach net-zero emissions by mid-century. In a recent filing, the company said it is “executing an ambitious clean energy transition” that balances affordability and reliability.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act1 (OBBBA) makes major changes to the Internal Revenue Code’s (Tax Code) clean energy tax provisions, particularly to the provisions that were extended, expanded, and established as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act (IRA). In some cases, the OBBBA terminates or limits the duration of energy tax incentives. In other cases, it imposes new requirements that must be met in order to claim the remaining incentives. In particular, the OBBBA imposes a series of restrictions that apply when a “prohibited foreign entity” (PFE) participates in the production supply chain for a facility or product for which a taxpayer seeks to claim an energy tax credit.

This alert describes the new PFE rules based on the statutory language of the OBBBA. Pursuant to Executive Order 14315 of 7 July 2025 and Internal Revenue Service (IRS) Notice 2025-42, forthcoming guidance from the US Department of the Treasury (Treasury) is expected that will shed additional light on the implementation of these rules. The discussion starts with some brief background. Then it describes the operation of the rules, including their scope; the key definitions of PFE, specified foreign entity (SFE), and foreign-influenced entity (FIE); and the application of the material assistance test.

These new PFE rules are important. They also are complicated, requiring a cascading series of determinations, which are outlined below.

Background

Over the past several years, there has been growing congressional concern about the United States’ reliance on companies related to potential foreign adversaries, particularly China, in the supply chain for critical products. This concern has been the subject of investigations and hearings,2 and it has resulted in the enactment of several laws imposing restrictions on foreign products and components.

The first of the new statutory restrictions was enacted in 2021, as part of the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA).3 The IIJA established grant programs for, among other things, battery processing projects, recycling projects, and critical minerals mining projects. In each case, the law prohibited grants from being awarded to projects using material that originates from or is supplied or processed by a foreign entity of concern (FEOC).4 The definition of a FEOC covers organizations that are designated as threats to national security by various federal agencies.5

Several other recent laws imposed similar restrictions, including the 2022 CHIPS and Science Act, which imposed restrictions with respect to semiconductor manufacturing projects;6 the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2021, which imposed restrictions associated with Chinese military companies;7 the Uyghur Sanctions Act, which imposed restrictions on various companies operating in or associated with China’s Xinjiang autonomous region;8 and the NDAA for fiscal year 2024, which imposed restrictions on seven specifically identified Chinese battery production companies.9

The 2022 IRA extended, expanded, and established various clean energy tax credits. In one case—the new section 30D tax credit for electric vehicles—the IRA imposed a FEOC restriction, making the credit unavailable for an otherwise eligible clean vehicle if any of the critical minerals contained in the battery “were extracted, processed, or recycled by a foreign entity of concern [as defined in the IIJA]” or if any of the vehicle’s battery components “were manufactured or assembled by a foreign entity of concern (as so defined).”10

As Congress began work on the bill that became the OBBBA, there was significant interest, among the bill’s proponents, in cutting back the IRA clean energy tax provisions, partly for budgetary reasons and partly for other policy reasons.11 The final version of the OBBBA enacted many provisions along these lines, including provisions terminating or limiting the duration of energy tax incentives and imposing new requirements that must be met in order to claim the remaining incentives.

A key part of this effort was the dramatic expansion of the FEOC restrictions. Under the OBBBA, the FEOC restrictions—now referred to as the PFE restrictions—apply more broadly to many more energy tax provisions than just section 30D; the restrictions also reach more deeply, imposing restrictions that go well beyond those under the FEOC rules. The new PFE rules are, essentially, FEOC on steroids.

We now turn to the operation of the new rules.

Operation

The new restrictions apply to six tax credits, but the scope of the restriction varies. For three credits—the section 45Q carbon sequestration credit, the section 45U nuclear credit, and the section 45Z clean fuels credit, the scope is relatively limited, simply prohibiting a PFE from qualifying for the credit.12 For the three other credits—the section 45Y and section 48E clean electricity credits and the section 45X advanced manufacturing credit, the scope is broader, not only prohibiting a PFE from qualifying for the credit but also denying the credit for projects with respect to which a PFE provides material assistance.

We next discuss the definition of a PFE. Then we turn to the rules regarding material assistance.

Definition of a PFE

New Tax Code section 7701(a)(51) provides, simply, “the term ‘prohibited foreign entity’ means a specified foreign entity or a foreign influenced entity.” (Emphasis added.) So, at the most basic level, a PFE includes both an SFE and an FIE.

The first of these terms, SFE, comprises five categories of entities drawn from the FEOC rules and other existing statutory definitions.13 The five categories are as follows:

A FEOC (per the existing statutory definition).14

A Chinese military company (per an existing statutory definition).

A listed Uyghur sanctions entity (per an existing statutory definition).

A listed prohibited battery entity (an existing statutory definition).

A “foreign controlled entity,” which is the government of a “covered nation” or an entity that is a citizen of, incorporated in, or controlled by a “covered nation.”15

There are various details to consider, and some of the relevant lists can be expanded by administrative action.16 That said, as a general matter, the determination of whether an entity falls into one of these five categories, and hence constitutes an SFE, is relatively mechanical, although facts and circumstances, such as indirect ownership, could be complicating factors.

Then comes the more difficult part. A PFE, again, includes not only an SFE, but also an FIE. With respect to an FIE, the determination requires the application of a series of tests, some complex and subjective.

As a general matter, the determination that an entity is an FIE looks back to whether an SFE is involved. Specifically, an FIE is an entity that is subject to either formal control or effective control by an SFE.

The test for formal control,17 in section 7701(a)(51)(D)(i), is mechanical. An entity is an FIE if any one of the following relationships exists:

An SFE has authority to appoint a covered officer.

A single SFE owns at least 25% of the stock.

SFEs, in the aggregate, own at least 40% of the stock.

SFEs, in the aggregate, hold at least 15% of the debt.

However, testing for formal control is only the first level of analysis. Even if none of these relationships exist, an entity nevertheless is an FIE if it has made a payment to an SFE in exchange for the SFE’s right to exercise any one of four forms of “effective control,” which are control of a qualified facility; control of energy storage technology; control of the extraction, processing, or recycling of a critical mineral; or control of the production of an eligible component.

This takes us to the meaning of the term “effective control.” As a starting point, the statute provides that “effective control” means an agreement providing a SFE counterparty with “specific authority over key aspects of the production of eligible components, energy generation … or energy storage….” The Treasury Secretary then is directed to issue guidance regarding effective control. Until such guidance is issued, the statute further provides that “effective control” means the unrestricted contractual right of an SFE counterparty to control any one of the following: the amount or timing of the production of components; the amount or timing of the production or storage of electricity; the use of components; the purchase or use of output; access to data, a site, or personnel; or maintenance, repair, or operations.

There are special rules for licensing. New Tax Code section 7701(b)(51)(D)(ii)(III) provides that, with respect to agreements for licensing intellectual property (and related agreements), “effective control” means the retention of a contractual right to specify or direct the sources of components, subcomponents, or applicable critical minerals; the retention of a contractual right to direct operations; the retention of a contractual right to limit the use of the intellectual property; the retention of a contractual right to receive royalties for more than 10 years; the retention of a contractual right to provide services for more than two years; or a limitation on the provision of data, information, or know-how.18

Finally, the statute establishes special rules exempting certain publicly traded entities,19 defining various terms, and establishing rules for determining the beginning of construction (BOC). Notably, BOC rules for PFE purposes differ from BOC standards for other energy credit purposes.20

Pulling this together, the definition of a PFE starts with a relatively mechanical definition, of a SFE, then expands to include a FIE, which is an entity that is subject to either formal or effective control by an SFE, with effective control determined by several tests that are subjective and will be fleshed out by forthcoming guidance.

For three energy tax credits, the determination of whether an entity is an PFE is the end of the matter: Under sections 45Q, 45U, and 45Z, if the taxpayer itself is a PFE, it is not eligible for the credit; if the taxpayer itself is not a PFE, no limitations apply.

Not so for three other energy tax credits: Under sections 45Y, 45X, and 48E, even if the taxpayer itself is not an PFE, it is prohibited from claiming the credit for a facility that receives material assistance from a PFE.

The key provision is OBBBA section 70512(b), which amends Tax Code section 45Y(b)(1) to add new subparagraph (E), which provides, “[t]he term ‘qualified facility’ shall not include any facility for which construction begins after December 31, 2025, if the construction of such facility includes any material assistance from a PFE (as defined in section 7701(a)(52)).” Sections 45X and 48E contain similar limitations.21

We now turn to the definition of material assistance.

Material Assistance

The OBBBA establishes a new overarching definition under paragraph (52) of Tax Code section 7701(a). It provides, in subparagraph (A), that the term “material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity” means:

With respect to any qualified facility or energy storage technology, a material assistance cost ratio which is less than the threshold percentage applicable under subparagraph (B), or

With respect to any facility which produces eligible components, a material assistance cost ratio which is less than the threshold percentage applicable under subparagraph (C).

Paragraph (52) then goes on, in subparagraphs (B) through (G)—which stretch over more than a dozen pages of statutory text—to elaborate: defining the material assistance cost ratio (MACR), establishing threshold percentages, establishing a system for providing safe harbors, and establishing certification requirements.

The general rule establishes that material assistance is provided if the MACR is less than the relevant “threshold percentage.” Put simply, the MACR measures the percentage of applicable direct costs attributable to non-PFE sources. Determining the MACR is, on its face, relatively straightforward. Under section 7701(a)(52)(E), the MACR is the quotient of the amount of total applicable direct costs attributable to the qualified facility, energy storage technology, or production of eligible components, less the applicable direct costs attributable to products, components, or energy storage technology that are mined, produced, or manufactured by a PFE, divided by the total applicable direct costs. In other words, the MACR is the ratio of total applicable direct costs minus applicable direct costs attributable to an PFE compared to the total applicable direct costs. For example, if the total applicable direct costs of constructing a qualified facility are US$100, and the applicable direct costs attributable to an PFE are US$20, the MACR is 100-20/100, or 80%. For qualified facilities and energy storage technology, applicable direct costs include labor and materials. For eligible components, the applicable direct costs are materials.

So far, so good. The MACR then is applied against a “threshold percentage,” which varies by product and over time. With respect to products, there are separate percentages for qualified facilities, for energy storage technology, and for components—with components broken down into solar components, wind components, inverters, battery components, and critical minerals. With respect to the time period, in each case, the threshold percentage increases (that is, becomes more stringent) by year. For example, for inverters, the threshold percentage rises by increments of 5 percentage points a year from 2026 to 2030—that is, from 50% in 2026 to 70% in 2030, effectively reducing the percentage of applicable direct costs that can be PFE-related.

In an implicit acknowledgement of the complexity of the MACR system, the Treasury Secretary is directed to establish “safe harbor tables” and other appropriate guidance to identify the total direct costs (of manufactured products and components) attributable to a PFE and to “provide all rules necessary to determine the amount of a taxpayer’s material assistance from a prohibited foreign entity.” The statutory deadline for the safe harbor tables and other guidelines is 31 December 2026.

In the meantime (that is, before the safe harbor issues are promulgated), a taxpayer may rely on two sets of materials, so long as the taxpayer does not know or have reason to know to the contrary: on the tables included in IRS Notice 2025-0822 (to establish the total direct cost of any listed component or manufactured product) and on a supplier’s certification (to establish that the product or component was not produced or manufactured by a PFE and to establish total direct costs).

Having thus laid out the system for calculating the MACR, the section 7701(a)(52) definition of “material assistance” then briefly concludes with some “housekeeping” provisions: defining various terms, providing regulatory authority, and establishing rules for the treatment of existing contracts, to prevent circumvention, for determining BOC23 and for determining ownership. The OBBBA also extends the statute of limitations and establishes significant penalties in the case of errors and understatements associated with the MACR.

Forthcoming Guidance

The provision of regulatory authority, in paragraph (52)(G), comes with a post-enactment twist. Three days after signing the OBBBA, President Trump issued an executive order, entitled “Ending Market Distorting Subsidies For Unreliable, Foreign Controlled Energy Sources,”24 directing the administration to implement the OBBBA clean energy tax provisions consistently with the intent of the OBBBA, which the executive order describes as including the “end [of] taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries.” As part of this implementation effort, the executive order specifically directs the Treasury Secretary to “take prompt action as the Secretary of the Treasury deems appropriate and consistent with applicable law to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions in the [OBBBA].” Given this direction, we expect the administration, in issuing guidance interpreting the PFE provisions, to lean into a stringent interpretation that will provide further clarity on the implementation of the PFE rules. Members of Congress continue to retain a close interest in these developments as well. Several senators, including Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA), Sen. John Curtis (R-UT), and Sen. Thom Tillis (R-NC) have placed holds on certain Treasury nominees as they evaluate Treasury’s guidance.25

With respect to nonbudgetary policy, President Donald Trump’s recent executive order (see footnote 24) decried “taxpayer support for unaffordable and unreliable ‘green’ energy sources and supply chains built in, and controlled by, foreign adversaries.”

Section 7701(a)(51)(B)(i) incorporates four of the five, subparagraphs (A), (B), (D), and (E), but not subparagraph (C), which includes a list of “covered nations” that is identical to the list of covered nations incorporated elsewhere in this OBBBA provision and hence would be redundant.

15 Under present law, a “covered nation” is China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran. See Pub. L. No. 116-283 § 9901(8).

16 Under subparagraph (D) of the fiscal 2021 NDAA FEOC provision, an entity is a FEOC if it is “alleged,” by the US Attorney General, “to have been involved in activities for which a conviction was obtained” under various national security laws. Under subparagraph (E), an entity is a FEOC if the Treasury Secretary determines that the entity is “engaged in unauthorized conduct that is detrimental to the national security or foreign policy of the United States.”

17 Tax Code § 7701(a)(51)(D)(i). “Formal control” is not the term used in the statute itself; rather, it is a term we use here for convenient reference.

18 There is an exception for the bona fide purchase or sale of intellectual property. Tax Code § 7701(b)(51)(D)(ii)(III)(bb).

19 The rules with respect to publicly traded entities are particularly complex. As a starting point, the definition of a PFE excludes an entity that is traded on a national securities exchange regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or on any other exchange or market that the Treasury Secretary determines has sufficient rules in place (unless the exchange is incorporated, organized, or has its principal place of business in a covered nation (currently China, Russia, North Korea, or Iran)), or either the entity’s securities are traded in a similar manner or at least 80% of the securities are held by an entity whose securities are traded on a national exchange regulated by the SEC. However, the exclusion does not apply if the entity is required to report under certain beneficial ownership rules or if a SFE either has the authority to appoint a covered officer or holds more than 15% of the debt. 26 U.S.C.

20 See footnote 3 of IRS Notice 2025-42, noting “Section 70512 of the OBBBA added . . . new restrictions regarding certain foreign entities in order to qualify for the § 45Y credit and the § 48E credit, among others, and included separate beginning of construction rules for those new provisions.” The IRS Notice further indicates the IRS and Treasury are drafting responsive guidance to implement those restrictions.

,Clean Energy ,2025-09-25 03:04:31+00:00,the Guardian,The Guardian view on the climate crisis: green energy is booming – but fossil fuels need to shrink too,"Editorial, www.theguardian.com",,,,,https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2025/sep/24/the-guardian-view-on-the-climate-crisis-green-energy-is-booming-but-fossil-fuels-need-to-shrink-too,"All is not lost, Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, told the Guardian last week.
A decisive test looms at the end of the month, when governments must file new climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs).
This is no time to ease off: the fossil-fuel era must end, and the clean‑energy transition must accelerate.
Since Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, the US will make no fresh commitments at all.
Global investment in clean energy, including nuclear and grid upgrades, is also up, and expected to reach around $2.2tn in 2025 – roughly twice the amount being spent on fossil fuels.","All is not lost, Simon Stiell, the UN’s climate chief, told the Guardian last week. But the latest planetary health check from the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research is a brutal reminder of how close the Earth is being pushed beyond repair. Seven of the nine planetary boundaries are now breached, with ocean acidification added to the danger list. Yet the world has proved that cooperation works: the ozone layer is healing, air pollution controls are working. A decisive test looms at the end of the month, when governments must file new climate pledges, known as nationally determined contributions (NDCs). This is no time to ease off: the fossil-fuel era must end, and the clean‑energy transition must accelerate.

There is real concern that big emitters, including Australia and the EU, will fall short of what is needed to avoid extreme heating. The EU is set to miss this month’s NDC deadline, while most fossil-fuel producers plan to cut emissions at the margins instead of phasing out production. Since Donald Trump has withdrawn from the Paris climate agreement, the US will make no fresh commitments at all. At the UN, Mr Trump trotted out the same stale oil-industry talking points he’s been peddling for years.

But there are also encouraging signs, including the fact that global investment in renewables keeps rising. In the first half of 2025 it reached a record $386bn, 10% higher than the same period last year. China alone installed more than 250GW of solar power capacity in this brief period – more than twice as much as the rest of the world combined. However, China’s new NDC targets just 7% to 10% cuts in emissions by 2035 – not enough to hit Paris’ goals. It’s the right direction but the wrong speed.

Global investment in clean energy, including nuclear and grid upgrades, is also up, and expected to reach around $2.2tn in 2025 – roughly twice the amount being spent on fossil fuels. Since inadequate grids have been an obstacle to the expansion of clean power in many countries, including the UK, this too is good news. However, the rise of anti-climate populists in European states including Germany is deeply concerning, and perhaps explains the EU’s increased caution. A “statement of intent” by the bloc last week indicated that it expects to commit to emissions cuts of up to 72.5% by 2035 (compared with 1990 levels), which falls short of the 79% or more that campaigners have pushed for.

Responsible politicians everywhere must proactively address voters’ concerns about the impact of green policies on their lives, and keep reminding them how much more costly and dangerous the alternatives to a green transition are. In the US, too, climate policies are progressing – despite the Trump administration’s opposition. About 19 states, and corporations covering two-thirds of US corporate revenues, still back net zero.

Renewables growth is essential, but unless carbon emissions are reduced at the same time, net zero is impossible. If planned fossil-fuel projects proceed, global output in 2030 will be more than double the limit for keeping heating to 1.5C. Mr Stiell is right to point to progress as well as threat. The crisis won’t be solved at this Cop or the next. But abandoning the process would mean abandoning hope – and handing victory to the wreckers.","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/a5b27927ae5fca97b811b26d8f38f7d3a04915ac/722_0_2673_2138/master/2673.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8865dbc58f6a2c55c6304410bc938e1e",N,,2025-09-25 01:58:44.216942

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, September 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy announces the LAMP National Summit, taking place October 8–10, 2025, at the historic St. Regis Hotel in Washington, D.C. This annual gathering brings together state legislators, policymakers, business leaders, and innovators from across the nation to shape the policies powering America’s digital and energy future.

Over three days, attendees will take part in plenary sessions, awards presentations, policy breakouts, and skills workshops designed to equip leaders with practical tools to make an impact in their state. Discussions will span artificial intelligence, national security, energy dominance, clean energy innovation, government efficiency, free and fair elections, and lessons learned from recent disaster response efforts. The program also includes recognition ceremonies honoring leaders and community heroes who have advanced freedom, equality, and civic excellence nationwide.

“The LAMP National Summit is about preparing today’s leaders for tomorrow’s challenges,” said Sarah E. Hunt, President and Founder of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “Through LAMP we’ve created a space where state lawmakers, innovators, and civic leaders can exchange ideas, strengthen relationships, and leave better equipped to make an impact in their state.”

This exclusive summit will bring together 50+ state legislators, members of Congress, federal appointees, industry leaders, and innovators. Participants will engage directly with decision-makers at the state and federal levels; drive conversations at the intersection of national security, energy abundance, AI, and resilience; and help shape breakout sessions, panels, and sponsorships aligned with their priorities.

“Attending the last LAMP Summit gave me the chance to connect with peers from across the country and dive into practical solutions—everything from advanced nuclear and hydrogen to the responsible use of AI. These conversations didn’t just stay in Washington. I’ve brought ideas home that are now informing policy discussions in my own state on national security, strengthening the energy grid, and tackling housing so that the American dream remains within reach for every family,” said Amelia Powers Gardner, Utah County Commissioner.

The LAMP National Summit is open to elected officials, policy professionals, and invited guests who share a commitment to effective leadership and collaborative problem-solving.

The global technology company is expected to create more than 400 new jobs as it expands its server manufacturing and fulfillment capabilities in Guilford County.

“Lenovo has been a significant contributor to the North Carolina economy for the past 20 years and the expansion of our facility in Guilford County, which first opened in 2007, will build on our long-term commitment to the state and Triad region for many years to come. Our desire to further expand here is driven by strong customer demand and the strength of the region’s connectivity, workforce, and business infrastructure, meaning we can deliver to customers more quickly and efficiently,” said Ryan McCurdy, President, North America and North America Site Leader, Lenovo. “We welcome the support received from the community and government agencies and look forward to working with all to bring this investment to fruition.”

North Carolina is one of more than 30 manufacturing locations for Lenovo in 11 different markets around the world, and is part of the company’s global/local strategy that balances global scale with local capabilities and delivery. The Guilford County expansion will strengthen the company’s footprint in the Piedmont Triad, further integrating the region into Lenovo’s global supply chain excellence and innovation.

The Guilford County Economic Development Alliance, comprised of the Greensboro Chamber of Commerce and the High Point Economic Development Corporation, worked together with the EDPNC, North Carolina Department of Commerce, Guilford County, Duke Energy, Guilford Technical Community College, and Guilford Works to support Lenovo’s expansion.

CMC Brings Jobs, Investment To East Spencer

CMC, a global leader in the manufacturing, recycling, and fabrication of steel and metal products, will establish operations in East Spencer, North Carolina. The company will locate in a facility within the new Rusher Farms Commerce Center, creating new jobs over the next five years and investing $1 million in equipment. CMC plans to begin operations at the facility in fall 2025.

The new East Spencer facility will support CMC’s growth strategy while contributing to Rowan County’s expanding industrial sector.

“As the first company to establish operations in the new Rusher Farms Commerce Center—our town’s first designated economic development area—CMC’s arrival is truly a catalyst for revival,” said East Spencer Mayor Barbara Mallett. “We are thrilled to welcome CMC to our community and are confident that their presence will bring transformative benefits, fostering growth and prosperity for all.”

“CMC’s decision to expand in Rowan County highlights the advantages our area offers, from a skilled workforce to a strategic location,” said Greg Edds, chairman of the Rowan County Board of Commissioners. “We look forward to building a long-term partnership with CMC as they continue to grow.”

“We are thrilled to welcome a company with CMC’s longstanding reputation and global reach to our community,” said Rod Crider, president of the Rowan Economic Development Council. “This investment not only brings high-quality jobs but also strengthens the foundation of advanced manufacturing in our region.”

Valencia Pipe Company Grows In South Rocky Mount

California-based Valencia Pipe Company (VPC) will open a 70,000-square foot manufacturing facility in the old Trinity building in Edgecombe County at 1549 Vance Street in South Rocky Mount with operations set to begin October 1, 2025.

The company manufactures rotationally molded polyethylene containers for use as water, septic, cistern and multi-use tanks. The company also manufactures parts used with various types of tanks. With $18 million in annual sales, Valencia Pipe Company is the 32nd largest rotational molder in North America according to Plastic News magazine.

Rocky Mount will be the third production facility that Valencia Pipe has opened in the past two years. Facilities were opened in Miami, OK and Wabuska, NV in 2024. Opening the Rocky Mount plant is a major step for the company as it moved to attract more East Coast customers as well as to better serve all of its customers across the U.S.

“We invested in this market using the latest in manufacturing technology and bringing in industry experts to guide us at every stage of our process. We’re very excited for this next phase in Rocky Mount,” said Valencia Pipe Company CEO Andrew Dervin.

Valenica Pipe officials point to the company’s success based on its track record for meticulous product design, customer service and deep industry expertise. The products the company will manufacture in Rocky Mount are difficult to bring to market because they are produced in accordance with environmental and government regulations.

The company has invested in the latest manufacturing technology for the plant so that it can be put into operation as quickly as possible, according to Christopher Butler, Valencia Pipe Vice President of Manufacturing and Distribution.

“I am thrilled to welcome Valencia Pipe Company to Rocky Mount to launch their East Coast distribution hub,” said Rocky Mount Mayor Sandy Roberson. “They are renowned for their quality product, superior customer service, rapid turnaround times, and corporate community support. We are grateful for the new jobs and look forward to their continued growth. I stand ready to support them however I can.”

“We are so excited that Valencia Pipe Company has chosen Rocky Mount because they see an opportunity to not only expand a successful company, but to make a difference in a community that is underserved with minimal job opportunities,” commented Bob Pike, President and CEO of the Carolinas Gateway Partnership. “This project is the first of many new efforts that Carolinas Gateway Partnership is working on that will help build better futures through economic growth.",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/valencia-news-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-25 01:58:53.131836

Those struggling to pay their energy bills often sacrifice other basic needs such as food, education, and healthcare to do so, with low-income households hit the hardest.

To lend a helping hand to these Americans, federal programs such as LIHEAP exist, as do smaller-scale state and local programs and initiatives.

For example, cash-strapped Illinoisans are being invited to attend a helpful workshop where they can get their hands on a $300 energy credit.

The City of Carbondale, Illinois - roughly 100 miles southeast of St. Louis - is encouraging customers of the energy company Ameren to attend the Ameren Illinois Community Development Workshop on October 2, per a city press release.

Ameren, which provides electric and natural gas services to customers in Illinois and Missouri, will host the event from 9 am to 4 pm at the Carbondale Civic Center located at 200 South Illinois Avenue.

Ameren energy advisors will be on-site to help review attendees' accounts in real-time and offer tips for how to save on future energy costs.

The event will also feature a brief workshop that will educate participants on the company's clean energy programs.

Those who complete the onsite educational workshop will receive a $300 energy bill credit toward their Ameren Illinois account.

The workshop will also benefit Ameren by providing feedback that the company can use to better support its customers in the future.

Space is limited and available on a first-come, first-served basis, with Ameren encouraging customers to pre-register for the event to secure a spot.

This event is expected to take roughly one hour, according to the power company.

ARE YOU ELIGIBLE?

In order to qualify to receive the $300 energy bill credit, workshop participants must have an active Ameren Illinois electric or gas account.

They are also required to have a household income at or below 300% of the federal poverty level.

A single-person household, for example, must make $3,912 or less per month, while a family of two is capped at $5,289.

A three-person household is subject to a $6,663 monthly income, and a family of four must make $8,037 or less per month to be eligible.

The Ameren account holder must be present at the event in order to qualify for the bill credit, with participants being instructed to bring the following:

Ameren Illinois bill

Photo identification

Proof of income for the past 30 days

The $300 credit will come as a relief to Americans as many grapple with energy insecurity.

“Americans nationwide are facing an unprecedented affordability crisis from rising utility bills. A majority of consumers say they do not fully understand the charges on their utility bills. They feel powerless as energy consumers,” said Charles Hua, founder and executive director of PowerLines.

“Factors driving these increases are diverse and vary by region, but the end result is the same: utility consumers who are stressed out. They want to see action.”

Washington, D.C. – U.S. Senators Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley today said that they are joining nine of their Senate colleagues in calling for the Trump administration to reverse course on its disastrous decision to eliminate federal standards for greenhouse gas emissions from passenger cars and medium and heavy-duty trucks that curb air pollution.

The Environmental Protection Agency recently walked away from decades worth of settled science that greenhouse gas emissions threaten Americans’ health and welfare by contributing to climate change. This rollback of an EPA decision from 2009 would decimate regulations that reduce greenhouse gases and air pollution from cars.

“If the Trump administration persists with eliminating federal vehicle greenhouse gas emissions standards, it will be responsible for damaging the environment, hurting public health, costing drivers money, cutting American jobs and competitiveness, and increasing our dependence on foreign oil,” the senators wrote in their letter to EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

“Americans should be able to drive and share the road with cleaner, more efficient vehicles that help clean up our air, save families money at the pump, and strengthen American competitiveness and energy independence. We urge you not to destroy these life- and cost-saving vehicle emission standards on the basis of faulty science and unlawful attacks on the clean air statutes passed by Congress,” the senators conclude.

The letter was led by Senator Edward J. Markey, D-Mass. In addition to Wyden and Merkley, the letter was cosigned by Senators Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I., Jack Reed, D-R.I., Kirsten Gillibrand, D-N.Y., Alex Padilla, D-Calif., Chris Van Hollen, D-Md., Mazie K. Hirono, D-Hawai’i, Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., and Cory Booker, D-N.J.

Wyden and Merkley have long worked to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and secure investments promoting clean air in Oregon and nationwide. In March 2025, Wyden, Merkley, and 11 other Democratic senators slammed the Trump administration’s decision to roll back its finding that greenhouse gases are harmful to health and welfare. In September 2025, Wyden and Merkley sounded the alarm on EPA’s proposal to declassify greenhouse gases as a public health threat. During that same month, Wyden and Merkley joined the entire Senate Democratic caucus in opposing the Trump administration rolling back the endangerment finding. In September 2024, Wyden, Merkley, and other members of the Oregon congressional delegation secured a major investment in transportation decarbonization research at Portland State University.

Yes, the news of the idling of the Itmann site is a concern, but we would be remiss if we did not mention that the Leer South site remains offline as well.
Will the site be able to reopen in the near future, or will Core Natural Resources opt to lease the site for another energy company to step in?","One of the largest coal producers in the Wyoming region has taken the tough decision to idle two out of three units at the Itmann mine. Core Natural Resources made the announcement that the site will temporarily halt production, keeping only one of the three units online. In the current state of the American economy, and the rise in inflation being felt across several sectors, not just in the United States, but all around the world as well, jobs are at a premium. Union activists have come out to state their concerns over the job cuts that halting production might cause.

Consol Energy’s merger with Arch Resources was supposed to create more employment

America, along with the rest of the world, is reeling from the disastrous state of the global economy. Everything is on the rise, especially in the United States. So when a large employer like Consol Energy makes an announcement that they will keep most of the Itmann site idling, the inevitable effect on the workers will be substantial, to say the least.

According to data from the Mine Safety and Health Administration, the site produced an astonishing 292,500 short tons (265,000t) of coal in the first half of this year. The company announced in August that it would be laying off around 200 coal miners in Wyoming County, which has not gone down well with the workers’ unions, which we must remember play a crucial role in securing and safeguarding workers’ rights.

While not representing the workers at the Itmann site, the United Mine Workers of America did make a statement on the matter.

“While the Itmann Mine #5 and Preparation Plant are not represented by the UMWA, we are always concerned when coal miners and their families face job loss. The announcement that more than 200 workers are impacted is unfortunate news for those affected and their communities. No one who works hard to provide for their family and power our nation should be left without support. We hate to see anyone in the mining community lose their job, and our thoughts are with those affected. We hope Core Natural Resources will do everything possible to support its workforce during this time,” – UMWA Communications Director, Erin Bates.

With Itmann idling, and Leer South still offline, what does the future have in store for Core Natural Resources

West Virginia is a crucial location for the company. Yes, the news of the idling of the Itmann site is a concern, but we would be remiss if we did not mention that the Leer South site remains offline as well. It is seen as one of the company’s most valuable assets, producing 500,000-800,000 st/quarter of high-volatile coking coal.

The mining company chose to halt operations at Itmann following a devastating fire that damaged crucial infrastructure in January. They stated at the time that they hoped to reopen the site in the summer; however, workers sealed the site after detecting high levels of carbon monoxide inside. Will the site be able to reopen in the near future, or will Core Natural Resources opt to lease the site for another energy company to step in?

CEO Transition

As previously announced on September 3, 2025, Zentek's former CEO Greg Fenton has resigned, and CFO Wendy Ford has been appointed Interim CEO. Zentek's Board of Directors has expressed its full confidence in Wendy's ability to guide Zentek during this transition, citing her deep financial expertise, proven leadership within the Company, and strong commitment to advancing Zentek's commercialization strategy. Her appointment ensures continuity in both operations and strategy while the Board of Directors conducts a comprehensive search for a new CEO to support Zentek's next phase of growth.

As part of this process, the Board of Directors has engaged Lock Search Group - a leading executive recruitment firm that helps organizations grow and scale by placing high-impact leaders in mission-critical roles. In tandem with the Board, they will facilitate the search for the Company's next CEO who can provide strategic leadership to communicate and execute Zentek's long-term vision.

ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters

Canada

As announced on June 12, 2025, ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters achieved an average infectious aerosol removal efficiency of MS2 bacteriophage of 42% compared to an untreated filter, which achieved an average of 16%. These robust results align with previous tests performed with bacteriophage Phi6 - a surrogate for SARS-CoV-2 and other enveloped viruses. These results validate that ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters are unique in their ability to accomplish the following simultaneously:

Controlling infectious aerosols effectively, in line with American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (""ASHRAE"") standard 241

Maintaining this performance without an increase in pressure drop, energy consumption or carbon emissions

Operating with existing Heating, Ventilation and Air Conditioning (""HVAC"") units

Eliminating the need for any additional equipment

Extending filter life and reducing changeout frequency, thereby lowering labour and waste disposal costs compared to denser filters

ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters were advanced through the Government of Canada's Innovative Solutions Canada (""ISC"") program, underscoring their credibility and relevance to public-sector needs and beyond. ISC also profiled Zentek in its ""Helping Canadians Breathe Easy"" feature, further validating the innovation and potential demand across Canada. As mentioned on October 17, 2023 a result of Zentek's successful ISC Testing Stream project, and eligibility under the Pathway to Commercialization (which ""gives small and medium-sized enterprises the opportunity to sell their innovation directly to the Government of Canada""), the Company looks forward to working with Public Services and Procurement Canada to facilitate federal procurement and adoption of ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters at scale.

To fully capitalize on this unique opportunity, Zentek is actively engaging with customers and manufacturing partners to service both Western and Eastern Canada. In addition, the Company is planning to hire a National Sales Leader - as well as building out a commission-based sales team - to drive adoption of ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters across key sectors, including commercial, institutional, government, education, and healthcare. This will facilitate direct engagement with both prospective and existing clients, deepen market penetration, and is intended to accelerate revenue growth as Zentek scales its go-to-market strategy in Canada.

The Company believes another one of its unique opportunities is to work with electrical utility companies interested in funding and supporting widespread adoption of technologies that can reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions. Zentek can help these organizations achieve this objective simply by using ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters in place of more dense filters to improve indoor air quality and the requirements of ASHRAE Standard 241, ‘Control of Infectious Aerosols.'

As part of its continuing technical business development strategy, Zentek will be presenting at the ASHRAE IEQ 2025 Conference in Montreal, one of the industry's leading global forums on indoor environmental quality. The Company's presentation, ""Energy-Efficient Solutions for Improving Indoor Air Quality and Reducing Carbon Emissions in a Canadian School: The Role of Silver-Graphene Oxide Treated HVAC Air Filters"", will take place on September 25, 2025 and demonstrate how ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters deliver superior pathogen removal, measurable energy and CO₂ savings, and seamless compatibility with existing HVAC systems compared to alternative strategies. Showcasing this data to an international audience of experts and decision makers not only further validates ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters but also expands Zentek's visibility and creates new pathways for business development and strategic partnerships in the HVAC and indoor air quality markets.

Health Canada

Zentek continues to work closely with Health Canada on the regulatory classification of its ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters, having recently submitted a formal response to the agency's preliminary regulatory position.

The Company continues to evaluate its options during the review period and remains committed to a fair and transparent regulatory process that ensures Canadians have access to innovative, energy-efficient solutions that improve indoor air quality and reduce the spread of respiratory illness.

United States

Zentek continues to explore the optimal product registration pathway to access this market in a timely manner while also ensuring the strategy supports long-term, sustainable growth. This includes exploring options with Altek Advanced Materials Inc., a Nevada incorporated private company focused on the commercialization of advanced material technologies in the United States as previously announced on September 3, 2025.

The Company intends to leverage the supply chain model for its go-to-market strategy in Canada to help support a successful launch in the US when it is able to do so.

International

Zentek continues to create awareness of the unique ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filter value proposition outside of North America by collaborating with partners in the Middle East, India and South America.

In the Middle East, the Company is actively collaborating with its Saudi-based manufacturing partner, Filtration Solutions Industrial Co. (""FSCO""), a leading manufacturer and distributor of air filtration products, to support local deployment and scale-up of ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters. In the Gulf region, the Company is advancing discussions with large-scale infrastructure stakeholders and government-linked organizations to better understand regional market needs. To help accelerate commercialization, the Company has engaged two experienced commission-based representatives for this region. In addition, the Company's partnership agreement with RSK Group is structured to help coordinate technical and business development activities in the Middle East.

This combined approach of on-the-ground representation and diplomatic support is designed to establish early traction, foster trusted relationships, and position ZenGUARD™ Enhanced Air Filters as a leading solution for energy efficiency, emissions reduction, and improved indoor air quality across South American markets

Albany Graphite Corp.

Albany Graphite Corp. recently achieved a major milestone, purifying its graphite to 5N (99.9992%) purity with an Equivalent Boron Concentration of 2.60 ppm, meeting the less than 3 ppm threshold required for the nuclear industry. This result, delivered with American Energy Technologies Company using a halogen-free purification process, confirms that Albany graphite has the potential to be a nuclear-grade material; a space historically supplied almost exclusively by synthetic, emission-intensive graphite from China.

This achievement comes at a time when artificial intelligence (""AI"") and data centres are reshaping global energy demand. According to a recent report by the International Energy Agency, global electricity demand from data centres is projected to more than double by 2030, driven largely by AI workloads.1Meeting this demand sustainably will require a significant expansion of nuclear power generation, which many expert analyses, including research by Goldman Sachs, identify as a critical part of the energy mix to provide reliable, carbon-free baseload capacity.2

By developing a clean, natural, North American source of nuclear-grade graphite, Albany has the potential to play a strategic role in enabling the AI revolution, supplying the material critical to nuclear reactors that will power the data centers driving global digital transformation. In doing so, Zentek is not only advancing a high-value resource project but also positioning itself at the nexus of two megatrends: the rise of AI computing power and the need for secure, sustainable clean energy infrastructure.

As development of the Albany Graphite deposit progresses, Zentek is working closely with Constance Lake First Nation (""CLFN"") and engaging with government partners to ensure the project creates meaningful local benefits. Our approach emphasizes collaboration, transparency, and long-term value sharing, with a focus on training, employment, and economic opportunities for the community. By advancing Albany in partnership with CLFN and within the framework of government support for critical minerals, we aim to demonstrate how projects of this scale can deliver not only strategic supply chain security but also lasting social and environmental value for the region.

TrieraBiosciences

Triera Biosciences continues to develop the multivalent aptamer platform technology with Dr. Yingfu Li at McMaster University. Over the last year as part of the $1.1 million Government of Canada contract received via the ISC testing program, Triera utilized the multivalent aptamer technology for the development of a countermeasure for highly pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1).

On September 18, 2025, Zentek provided a preliminary update on the in vivo (mouse model) testing of the lead candidate developed for H5N1 as a prophylactic agent against A(H1N1) pdm09. Animals given the aptamer lead candidate prophylactically had substantially improved clinical scores, 5x greater survival rates, 80% less weight loss 5 days post-infection, and decreased recovery times compared to the control group.

Following up on these encouraging results, researchers have improved the formulation and administration schedule of the treatment and have prepared materials for more comprehensive testing of the lead candidate's performance against H1N1 and H5N1, which is scheduled to begin in a few weeks.

While those federal tax credits will be gone, the New York state tax credit of $500 to $2,000 remains in effect depending on the car's mileage range.
Bloomberg and other news sites report some economists feel without the tax deal EV sales could dip by as much as 27 percent.
Stasiak agrees that the Sept. 30 deadline applies to a confirmed purchase and not the actual delivery date of the electric vehicle.
Certain other federal tax credits of thousands of dollars for home energy projects, such as installation of a heat pump if you want one, will actually expire at the end of December.","BUFFALO, N.Y. — Any consumer who liked the idea of going with a clean, green electric vehicle may have also sought some green tax benefits in the form of a federal rebate for that major purchase.

But as of Sept. 30, that incentive goes away. And while local car dealers aren't sure about the impact, some others feel it will affect sales.

When asked about the situation, Niagara Frontier Auto Dealers Association President Paul Stasiak said, ""What it does is create some urgency, some excitement, and some nervousness. All three.""

And maybe a last-minute opportunity to convince an on-the-fence electric vehicle customer to buy now instead of later as the Biden Administration's up to $7,500 federal tax credit for such purchases gets wiped away by the GOP's Budget Reconciliation measure passed in the summer.

It reflects a difference of political philosophies and priorities on both sides of the climate divide, but also a major multibillion-dollar issue for the auto industry.

So dealers are now trying to spread the word about this incentive to make EV's more affordable and deal with lingering concerns that EV models are more expensive than gas powered cars.

""It varies on a vehicle,"" Stasiak said. ""I mean, there's very affordable EVs depending on the product line, manufacturer, volume. It was a huge difference a little while back, but that's been minimized in many, many cases.""

That soon-to-expire federal tax credit also applied to EV leases and it allowed up to $4,000 for the purchase of a used electric vehicle.

While those federal tax credits will be gone, the New York state tax credit of $500 to $2,000 remains in effect depending on the car's mileage range.

Bloomberg and other news sites report some economists feel without the tax deal EV sales could dip by as much as 27 percent.

So what about overall sales of such vehicles here in Western New York? Stasiak said, ""Is it up a little? Of course it is. The education is there, the utility, the range. Performance. But consumers in our market they're still somewhat skeptical on the infrastructure. The infrastructure (EV charging station availability) is a big thing. People are asking dealers, where do I get a charge? Can I charge it at home? What's it take? Remember, our manufacturers are now offering incentives. You buy the car to get the charger free in many cases.""

Stasiak agrees that the Sept. 30 deadline applies to a confirmed purchase and not the actual delivery date of the electric vehicle.

""It gives the dealers the chance to get a vehicle that's coming in. They might have ordered it, been enroute. They had a commitment from a customer, so if they can proverbially sell the vehicle, they'll allow a little grace period.""

Certain other federal tax credits of thousands of dollars for home energy projects, such as installation of a heat pump if you want one, will actually expire at the end of December.",https://media.wgrz.com/assets/WGRZ/images/bba46ba3-d9b6-42e3-a97e-5c1e840ceeff/bba46ba3-d9b6-42e3-a97e-5c1e840ceeff_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 22:00:29.669112

By Rachel McDevitt

Pittsburgh Congresswoman Summer Lee is leading the Pennsylvania Democratic congressional delegation in opposing the Trump administration’s move to prevent climate action.

The administration wants to overturn the Endangerment Finding, which provides the basis for the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to regulate pollution that contributes to climate change.

In a letter to the Environmental Protection Agency’s head sent Monday, Pennsylvania’s seven Democratic U.S. Representatives and Sen. John Fetterman said that move would put their constituents in greater danger.

“These are not distant projections but present realities affecting our constituents from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, from rural farming communities to urban neighborhoods,” the lawmakers wrote.

Lee, who represents Pittsburgh and parts of Allegheny and Westmoreland counties, organized the letter.

The lawmakers said the commonwealth has recorded the largest increase in rainfall nationally since the 1950s. That’s fueled more frequent and severe flooding.

Scientists overwhelmingly agree that climate change increases the likelihood of severe storms and floods.

Pennsylvania saw 12 extreme weather events last year that killed 253 people and cost more than $36 billion in damages, the letter said.

The state is also threatened by rising temperatures, which can worsen air quality, the lawmakers said. They noted that in June this year, Allegheny County hospitals treated over 40 patients for heat-related illnesses.

“By proposing to eliminate the Endangerment Finding, the administration will undermine essential safeguards against climate pollution, leaving our constituents to face more pollution, more health harms, more extreme weather, and higher costs, especially in communities already overburdened by pollution,” the lawmakers said.",https://houlahan.house.gov/images/facebook-meta2.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 22:01:27.669613

Lee (PA-12) led the Democratic Pennsylvania congressional delegation in calling on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin to withdraw his proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding, the science-based determination that obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution.
Eliminating the Endangerment Finding would effectively undermine the foundation of federal climate policy, leave Pennsylvania communities exposed to more pollution, more extreme weather, and increasing public health risks.

Lee (PA-12) led the Democratic Pennsylvania congressional delegation in calling on Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin to withdraw his proposal to repeal the 2009 Endangerment Finding, the science-based determination that obligates the EPA to regulate climate pollution. Eliminating the Endangerment Finding would effectively undermine the foundation of federal climate policy, leave Pennsylvania communities exposed to more pollution, more extreme weather, and increasing public health risks.

In the letter to Administrator Zeldin, the members expressed their strong opposition to eliminating the Endangerment Finding, stating it would strip away critical protections and expose constituents to escalating climate hazards that are already devastating Pennsylvania communities.

“The Endangerment Finding is the cornerstone of federal climate action, serving as the EPA's science-based determination that greenhouse gas pollution threatens public health and welfare. Repealing it will not change that reality,” the members wrote. “The overwhelming scientific evidence remains unchanged: greenhouse gas pollution is warming our planet, intensifying extreme weather events, and imposing escalating costs on families, workers, and communities nationwide.”

The delegation highlighted Pennsylvania's vulnerable position as a state that has already experienced devastating climate impacts. According to recent data, Pennsylvania has seen the largest increase in rainfall in the nation since the 1950s, leading to frequent and costly flooding. In 2024 alone, the state endured 12 extreme weather events, resulting in nearly $37 billion in losses. These events caused widespread destruction, killing hundreds of people and leaving disproportionately affected communities with limited resources to recover.

“Pennsylvanians are already feeling the effects of climate change through more frequent and severe extreme weather. These are not distant projections but present realities affecting our constituents from Philadelphia to Pittsburgh, from rural farming communities to urban neighborhoods,” the members wrote. “We urge you to maintain the Endangerment Finding and uphold EPA's fundamental responsibility to protect communities in Pennsylvania and across the country from the documented harms of climate change.”

The letter is signed by Representatives Mary Gay Scanlon (PA-07), Chris Deluzio (PA-17), Brendan Boyle (PA-02), Dwight Evans (PA-03), Madeleine Dean (PA-04), Chrissy Houlahan (PA-06), and Senator John Fetterman (D-PA).

(WKRN) — Buying an electric vehicle may not be as beneficial for your bank account starting at the end of the month, and some believe the change could impact the Tennessee’s electric vehicle industry.

The $7,500 federal tax credit for purchasing a new EV, and the $4,000 tax credit for purchasing a used one, will disappear Sept. 30. The cuts were included in the “Big Beautiful Bill” passed by Congress in July. Some believe it may put the breaks on the EV industry’s momentum in Tennessee.

“Those are both really important consumer incentives to encourage folks to take a closer look at an electric vehicle, and those will be going away at the end of the month,” Aaron Viles, senior director of campaigns for the Electrification Coalition, said.

According to the Tennessee Department of Economic and Community Development, the state has made more than $16 billion in capital investments in the EV industry since 2017. Additionally, more than 191,000 EVs have been produced in TN since 2013 by the four major EV manufacturers located in the state.

Viles told News 2 the exact impact of the federal tax credit cuts on Tennessee’s EV industry is unclear, but any impact will likely be short-lived.

“Obviously, if you take away a $7,500 or $4,000 tax credit, there will be fewer people who make that decision [to buy EVs],” Viles said. “It will be interesting to see how many fewer, but I think overall because manufacturers are still very committed to this transition [toward EVs], that ultimately EVs — there will be more and more on the roads.”

Some experts have also predicted potential manufacturing job loss due to the elimination of the tax credits. According to a recent report by the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, Tennessee has already lost nearly 150 EV manufacturing jobs within the past 12 months due to cancellations or down-scaled investments.

However, the state remains among the top in the country for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs, the report said.

Despite that, multiple EV manufacturers in the Volunteer State have slowed or delayed EV production in recent months due to slower sales, including Ford’s EV plant — known as BlueOval City — located just outside of Memphis.

“In Tennessee, there’s a lot of skin in the game because it’s one of the bigger states in terms of those EV investments, so we’ll all need to watch pretty closely and carefully and see what the companies decide to do,” Viles said.",https://www.wkrn.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/73/2025/06/VOSOT.00_00_22_00.Still001.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-24 22:00:35.559285

The commission initiated the bird-friendly design effort last year with the formation of a working group that included commissioners, conservationists, developers and architects.
Currently, several planned unit developments approved by Council have bird-safe design elements incorporated into the ordinance to bolster the development’s environmental superiority.
In Arlington County, Virginia, bird-friendly design standards are tied to voluntary density bonus incentives, and noncompliant projects pay into the jurisdiction’s green building fund.
“This feels like a real triumph,” Vice Chair Mariana Krueger said of the progress being made on the bird-safe design effort.","With more than $5.5 billion generated annually in Texas from birdwatching and bird tourism, Austin leaders and community stakeholders want to ensure the safety of the roughly 400 species that reside in or migrate through Travis County each spring and fall.

As such, Watershed Protection staff have developed a set of recommended code amendments and policy updates that they’re rolling out to boards and commissions before sending the proposed changes to City Council, as directed in a resolution Council passed in late 2024.

Bird-friendly designs can include limiting the use of glass, adding solar shading or screens, applying ultraviolet coatings, using glazed or etched patterns or incorporating bird-friendly markers directly on the glass.

The Austin Environmental Commission got its first look at staff’s proposal last week and unanimously endorsed the work. The commission initiated the bird-friendly design effort last year with the formation of a working group that included commissioners, conservationists, developers and architects.

“Birds are a very important part of keeping our environment healthy,” said Craig Nazor of the Sierra Club’s Lone Star chapter, noting their role in controlling insect populations and enhancing the soil with nutrient-rich droppings. Nazor served on the working group with chair Jennifer Bristol, who has led the commission’s work on birds.

Under staff recommendations, new commercial and multifamily buildings larger than 10,000 square feet would be required to meet bird-safe design standards for the first 100 feet of façade, measured by a “material threat factor” rating of 20 or less. The American Bird Conservancy recommends a rating of 30 or less, but Watershed Protection staff are proposing the stricter 20 rating due to the rising threat that windows pose to hummingbird populations and their vital role as pollinators.

Additionally, staff recommends implementing dark-sky lighting compliance standards to include shielded light fixtures, exterior and interior lighting on timers for after midnight and during peak migration, and directional lighting requirements to reduce light pollution that can cause birds to become disoriented.

“Dell Children’s Hospital has dark-sky lighting on their campus and what other building could you possibly want to be safer,” said Watershed Protection’s Leslie Lillly, referring to the pangs one can feel after witnessing a deadly bird collision. The hospital’s “dark-sky lighting is not super bright, and it is very easy to see and navigate around their campus.”

Other dark-sky advantages include conservation impacts, the bio-diversity benefits, and the community-engagement that happens around having bird-friendly design incorporated into the buildings, Lilly said.

Currently, several planned unit developments approved by Council have bird-safe design elements incorporated into the ordinance to bolster the development’s environmental superiority.

Cities across the nation have already implanted bird-safe design standards, with New York City requiring 90 percent of the first 75 feet of a new building’s envelope to use bird-friendly materials. In Arlington County, Virginia, bird-friendly design standards are tied to voluntary density bonus incentives, and noncompliant projects pay into the jurisdiction’s green building fund.

For single-family homes, Watershed Protection recommends an outreach campaign to encourage bird-safe practices. Commissioners agreed the effort could be an easy sell, since retrofitting glass or adding bug or solar screens, exterior shades, or awnings not only reduces bird collisions but also offers energy savings. Moreover, placing landscaping away from buildings further minimizes glass reflections while adding protection from wildfires.

“This feels like a real triumph,” Vice Chair Mariana Krueger said of the progress being made on the bird-safe design effort. “When there’s so much bad news happening every day, this just feels like a little bit of good that I think could mark a real turning point for our city.”",https://i0.wp.com/austinmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_7379.jpg?fit=1936%2C1288&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-24 20:59:32.918686

Since February, EVs’ market share has averaged 17%.
Nationally, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids had a 9.5% market share in the first six months of 2025, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.
Grandbouche said the exhaust-free vehicles make sense even without state or federal tax breaks.","Electric-vehicle sales in Washington are lagging far behind targets the state has set for adoption of the climate-friendly vehicles.

After surging in 2024, sales have mostly sagged in 2025. But with federal tax breaks for purchasing electric vehicles disappearing at the end of September, sagging interest in plug-in vehicles has surged, at least temporarily, data from the Washington Department of Licensing shows.

One in four new cars sold in Washington in August can plug into an electrical outlet, the highest market share since October 2024. That was when a state-funded rebate program quickly ran out of money after helping 6,000 Washingtonians go electric.

“There's definitely been an increase that is tangible that we all see for the last 60 days or so, probably spurred by the federal tax credit ending here shortly,” said Kia of Puyallup dealership president Ryan Sawyer.

President Donald Trump’s broad spending and tax bill, passed in July, eliminates a $7,500 tax credit for buyers of new EVs and $4,000 credit for used EVs on Oct. 1. Those clean-vehicle tax credits were created in 2022 as part of former President Joe Biden’s agenda to boost adoption of climate-friendly technologies.

Electric vehicles’ share of new passenger-vehicle sales in Washington averaged 22% in 2024 and hit 25% in January 2025 before tumbling after President Donald Trump retook office. Since February, EVs’ market share has averaged 17%.

Federal support for clean cars has evaporated, and many potential buyers disapprove of Tesla CEO Elon Musk's efforts to help dismantle federal agencies for the Trump administration.

Washington state’s sales-tax exemption for electric cars, in place since 2019, expired in July.

Washington’s state requires 35% of model year 2026 vehicles, some of which are already at car dealerships, to run on electricity or hydrogen, with that percentage ramping up annually to 100% by 2035. Dealers can apply credits from the previous year's EV sales to meet the requirement.

Washington’s clean-vehicle requirements are currently in limbo as states including California and Washington are fighting the Trump administration’s attempt to block their clean-vehicle laws.

Though this year’s sales are not keeping pace with state requirements, electric vehicles are much more common on Washington roadways than in many states.

“Washington is second in the nation, behind California, for EV adoption. We have 250,000 vehicles on the road right now,” Josh Grandbouche with the Washington Department of Ecology said.

Nationally, electric vehicles and plug-in hybrids had a 9.5% market share in the first six months of 2025, according to the Electric Power Research Institute.

Grandbouche said the exhaust-free vehicles make sense even without state or federal tax breaks.

“The vehicles are already cheaper to own, in a lot of cases,” Grandbouche said. “Fueling these vehicles up is about $1 a gallon equivalent, if you're charging at home.”

Transitioning away from gas and diesel engines is central to Washington state’s push to eliminate climate-harming pollution.

Gov. Bob Ferguson announced on Monday that the state intends to provide new incentives for clean vehicles, with specifics to be determined after gathering public input. Any new tax breaks, rebates, or other incentives would have to be passed by the state legislature.

Those subsidies would not be available to drivers wanting to switch from climate-harming vehicles to climate-friendly ones until July.

Tesla remains the dominant maker of electric vehicles in the Washington state market, though its share of EV sales has fallen to 34% since Trump took office, down from 41% in 2024, according to Department of Licensing data.",https://kuow-prod.imgix.net/store/ee1895abb49f7a5969fd638bdb8bfb12.jpg?fm=jpg&fit=max&w=1200&h=628&q=80,N,,2025-09-24 20:01:18.082843

With help from state grants and a federal tax credit, Truro bought two 2025 electric Chevrolet Equinoxes and is buying a third. They will bring the town closer to its goal of making 10 percent of its vehicles electric by 2027.

A Chevy Equinox costs about $40,000, but for each one the town bought it got a $7,500 grant from the state and is expecting another $7,500 in federal tax credits, according to Communications Director Katie Riconda.

As electric vehicles generally cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, government incentives were crucial in encouraging people to buy cleaner cars.
However, Searcy said, many Californians have already bought electric vehicles and access to buying them has only increased.
“The tax credits did what they needed to do, which was a financial priming of the pump in order to impact consumer behavior in order to get people to adopt EVs,” Searcy said.
While public favorability when it comes to Musk is low, people shouldn’t lump the future of EVs and Musk together, he said.","Despite efforts at the federal level to curb California’s clean-air vehicle initiatives, including the phase out gas-powered vehicles, optimism remains on the future of electric vehicles in the state.

Yan Searcy, dean of California State University, Northridge’s College of Social and Behavioral Sciences, home of both CSUN’s Institute for Sustainability and its master’s degree in Sustainability Program, said the positive outlook comes despite federal government challenges related to environmental policies, including Pres. Donald Trump’s signing of congressional bill overturning California’s 2035 gasoline-powered car ban.

While Searcy said the state’s 2035 gasoline-powered car ban was always “an ambitious goal,” he remains optimistic as the infrastructure that has been built over the past decade in support of EVs and consumer buy-in that has followed.

“The state has always been the site of innovation when it comes to transportation and that’s going to continue in spite of what is going on in Washington,” Searcy said. “The EV industry is thriving, and I expect more people to buy-in when it comes to zero-emission vehicles in California.”

The positive outlook comes as federal tax credits for zero-emission vehicles — up to $7,500 for car buyers — is set to expire on Sept. 30 after Trump signed his legislative bill in July.

As electric vehicles generally cost more than their gas-powered counterparts, government incentives were crucial in encouraging people to buy cleaner cars. However, Searcy said, many Californians have already bought electric vehicles and access to buying them has only increased.

“The tax credits did what they needed to do, which was a financial priming of the pump in order to impact consumer behavior in order to get people to adopt EVs,” Searcy said. “We had to make it financially attractive for people to take a chance on what at the time was this new technology.

“It seems in California specifically, every third car appears to be a Tesla,” he continued. “You go to shopping malls and there used to be one or two spaces for EVs, now there’s entire sections for vehicle charging, and that can be attributed to having buy-in from people over a number of years.”

That momentum won’t stop anytime soon, Searcy said, despite controversy earlier this year when it came to Tesla CEO Elon Musk and his political activity. While public favorability when it comes to Musk is low, people shouldn’t lump the future of EVs and Musk together, he said.

“It was never about electric cars, people might have had second thoughts when it came to buying an Elon Musk product, but they don’t regret buying the electric car,” Searcy said.

There are also more options than a decade ago when it comes to electric vehicles, Searcy noted, pointing out that car brands like Lucid and Rivian have also broken into the EV car market. Rideshare companies like Waymo, which utilizes driverless EVs and have also sprung up in major cities like San Francisco and Los Angeles, are attracting younger audiences in the process.

All of this, Searcy said, makes him confident Californians will continue their support of EVs and their positive impact on the environment.

“We’re raising a generation that is keen on sustainability and we’re not going back,” Searcy said. “There has also been a change in less than one generation in other ways when it comes to being sustainable; everybody now has their own water bottle and that’s just water. At least we can say Southern California was able to do that in less than one generation and I think we will look at EVs the same way in the years to come.”",https://scvnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/CSUN-EVS.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 20:01:26.122436

The Department of Energy has created a Strategic Uranium Reserve, now actively purchasing uranium from U.S. producers.","The United States has entered a new phase of industrial policy unlike anything seen in decades. Washington is channeling billions of dollars—through legislation, executive authority, and direct procurement—into domestic supply chains deemed critical to national security. Rare earths, nuclear fuel (announced last week), lithium, drones, specialty defense materials, semiconductors, and dual-use emerging technologies are at the center of this effort.

For investors, this may be more than a passing policy experiment. It could represent what many optimists believe will be a lasting structural reallocation of capital—one that may create winners in key industries. Below is a breakdown of the primary programs, their financial commitments, and the investment implications.

How Washington Directs Capital

The backbone of America’s new industrial strategy rests on five powerful policy and funding vehicles. The CHIPS and Science Act of 2022 allocates over $52 billion to reshore semiconductor manufacturing, research, and workforce development, ensuring the U.S. can meet national security and economic needs without relying on foreign supply chains (think Taiwan). The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) complements this effort with tax credits and subsidies designed to strengthen clean energy, critical minerals, and advanced manufacturing. The Defense Production Act (DPA), Title III gives the Department of Defense authority to provide grants, loans, and long-term purchase agreements to shore up domestic production of materials deemed vital to defense readiness. Meanwhile, the Department of Energy’s Loan Programs Office leverages federal credit to finance large-scale energy, nuclear, and critical mineral projects that private lenders might consider too risky.

Finally, the Defense Logistics Agency’s National Defense Stockpile is being rebuilt after decades of neglect, with renewed purchases of rare earths, specialty metals, and other strategic materials to secure supply for future military and industrial needs. CHIPS and Science Act (2022): Over $52 billion allocated for domestic semiconductor manufacturing, R&D, and workforce training. The recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act also is helping to allocate $2 billion to the Department of Defense for enhancing the National Defense Stockpile.

Taken together, these tools allow Washington to shape entire supply chains—from mining through advanced manufacturing—while providing anchor demand for private industry.

Semiconductors: The Foundation of Modern Security

Semiconductors are the flagship of America’s new industrial push. The Commerce Department and NIST are already deploying nearly $39 billion in direct awards under the CHIPS for America program to fund new fabs, research centers, and equipment plants.

While chip foundries capture headlines, the ripple effects extend downstream. Makers of lithography equipment, deposition tools, wafer materials, and specialty chemicals could stand to benefit from sustained capital expenditures.

Importantly, CHIPS subsidies come with “guardrails”: firms that accept U.S. subsidies are restricted from expanding advanced capacity in certain foreign jurisdictions. For investors, this reinforces the need to focus on domestic suppliers and toolmakers positioned to capture a larger share of this reshaped global supply chain.

Rare Earths and Critical Minerals

America’s reliance on overseas sources of rare earths, magnets, and strategic minerals has long been recognized as a vulnerability. Washington is now moving decisively.

Pentagon grants and loans—hundreds of millions of dollars via DPA Title III—have gone to companies like MP Materials to build domestic separation and magnet production capacity.

The Defense Logistics Agency has resumed purchases for the National Defense Stockpile, including bismuth and other specialty metals vital for defense.

The Department of Energy has launched multibillion-dollar, multi-year initiatives supporting mineral processing, recycling, and new refining capacity.

For investors, the real opportunity may be in the midstream: processors and magnet makers with high barriers to entry, especially those with government purchase agreements that reduce project risk.

Read more: The New Geopolitical Battlefield: China’s 30-Year Play for Rare Earth Domination

Building a Strategic Uranium Reserve

Nuclear energy is back in focus—especially domestic uranium mining, enrichment, and fuel cycle capacity. The Department of Energy has created a Strategic Uranium Reserve, now actively purchasing uranium from U.S. producers. The first Trump administration tried to buy $150 million worth of uranium in 2020. In May 2024 Biden signed a law to begin moving away from our Russian dependency for uranium. Reuters recently wrote that the U.S. is far behind its peers with only 14 months of uranium inventory while Europe has two and a half years. China has 12 years of worth of inventory of uranium to supply its current needs.

DOE is also supporting advanced reactor designs and enrichment facilities through its Loan Programs Office and Civil Nuclear Credit program.

For investors, the thesis seems clear: uranium miners and fuel fabricators with U.S. operations may have the government as an anchor customer. This could create both a price floor and a financing backstop, improving project viability and long-term returns.

Drones and Autonomy

Unmanned systems have moved from experimental projects to frontline priorities. DARPA and the armed services are investing heavily—often in the hundreds of millions—into drone swarms, autonomy, and counter-drone technologies.

Small drone manufacturers, sensor developers, and autonomy software companies are particularly attractive, as their prototypes can quickly mature into full procurement programs. Unlike many areas of defense, this is a space where small- and mid-cap firms can compete with primes, as technology adoption cascades rapidly.

Investors who monitor DARPA solicitations and Air Force or Army contract announcements may be able to identify promising companies early, before they achieve mainstream recognition.

See Applied Energetics' Chris Donaghey on Directed Energy Weapons and Modern Warfare

Specialty Metals: Restocking the National Defense Stockpile

After decades of neglect, the National Defense Stockpile is being rebuilt. The Defense Logistics Agency has begun purchasing metals like titanium, tungsten, and bismuth through multi-year, multi-million-dollar contracts.

This benefits not only mining and refining companies but also the aerospace, electronics, and munitions manufacturers who rely on secure inputs. Because the global supply base for many specialty metals is narrow, even modest DLA contracts can create material demand spikes for niche producers.

Investors should track DLA solicitations closely, as they often highlight under-the-radar companies positioned for sudden growth.

Investment Implications: Following Federal Flows

For investors, Washington’s industrial policy wave may provide signals related to certain strategies:

Track solicitations and funding calls. NOFOs (Notices of Funding Opportunity) and RFPs (Requests for Proposals) often precede major contract awards.

Differentiate up- and downstream. While miners benefit, midstream processors and manufacturers may offer better risk-adjusted returns.

Seek offtake agreements. Government purchase guarantees, like MP Materials’ DoD partnership, may lower project risk and stabilize revenue.

Boosting Uranium Reserves. DOE uranium purchases and enrichment contracts could provide direct, immediate revenue streams to domestic producers.

Drone Innovation. Small defense and drone innovators could represent significant opportunities as contracts expand.

Mind the guardrails. Export controls and domestic sourcing requirements may determine which companies capture subsidies.

Conclusion: Investing in Washington’s Protectionism

The U.S. government is no longer content to rely on global markets for critical inputs. By combining legislation, executive authority, and direct procurement, Washington is rebuilding domestic capacity across semiconductors, rare earths, nuclear, drones, specialty metals, and artificial intelligence.

For investors, the opportunities could lie in identifying the companies aligned with federal commitments. Those that secure grants, contracts, or offtake agreements may stand to benefit from stable, long-term demand. These are themes I am exploring for my growth clients’ allocations including drone companies when the opportunity presents itself. By positioning ahead of these flows, investors may capture much of the upside of America’s industrial rebuild.

“In order to establish a genuine fusion industry, funding instruments must move beyond traditional research funding as quickly as possible,” the companies argued.
In their coalition agreement, the parties forming the government - chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD) - agreed more support for nuclear fusion research and the goal of building “the world’s first fusion reactor”.
“Germany boasts unique diversity in fusion technology,” their statement said.

With cabinet discussions about Germany’s fusion strategy scheduled for 1 October, the companies urged the government to commit 3 billion euros by 2029 to build the large-scale demonstration plants they have planned, which would mark a milestone on the way to commercial applications.

“This corresponds to the government funding required to build three pilot plants, which will herald the start of industrial production,” the companies said. Such funds would leverage additional private investment of 20 to 50 percent, they argued, adding that the US and China are already pouring billions into the technology in a bid for global leadership.

“In order to establish a genuine fusion industry, funding instruments must move beyond traditional research funding as quickly as possible,” the companies argued. “The technology has advanced so far that it now urgently needs mechanisms to enable the transition from research to commercial application at the necessary scale and speed.”

“The intermediate step of pilot plants significantly reduces the investment risk for the government, industry and private investors, drives the rapid growth of the fusion ecosystem right from the start and creates spillover effects across the German economy,” the statement said.

The companies also called for a new legal framework to exempt fusion from laws dictating the use of conventional nuclear fission, which Germany ended in 2023, and for EU coordination via the IPCEI (Important Project of Common European Interest) scheme, which requires member state cooperation and facilitates subsidies. “Germany must actively participate in the planning and implementation of a specific fusion IPCEI to ensure European coordination and exploit synergies.”

Germany wants to build “world’s first fusion reactor”

Germany’s government singled out nuclear fusion as one of six key future technologies two months ago, saying it will present a long-term “Fusion Action Plan” this year, which is to be followed by a “Fusion Energy Research and Innovation Roadmap (FIRE)” in 2026.

In their coalition agreement, the parties forming the government - chancellor Friedrich Merz’s conservative CDU/CSU alliance and the Social Democrats (SPD) - agreed more support for nuclear fusion research and the goal of building “the world’s first fusion reactor”. The European Commission is also preparing an EU fusion strategy.

Fusion technology is still in the experimental stage, and even many proponents say that commercial use is at least decades away, meaning that neither Germany nor Europe can count on the technology to become climate neutral by 2045 and 2050 respectively. But researchers and investors have become increasingly confident it one day can provide a safe, climate-friendly, and practically inexhaustible energy source. Dozens of startups backed by private capital joined the field, bringing new momentum through research milestones.

Window of opportunity

The startups argued that Germany is well-placed to turn its leading role in the technology into a long-term advantage, but it must hurry up.

“Germany boasts unique diversity in fusion technology,” their statement said. The companies pointed out successes in both laser and magnetic fusion, two different approaches with the same goal: fusing light atomic nuclei to release huge amounts of energy.

“Germany has a unique historical opportunity to develop its own industry with fusion energy and secure its own economic and technical sovereignty in the long term,” they said. “The launch of the fusion industry and the framework conditions for its success must be decided politically now, in the coming months.”

“The alternative is clear: without decisive action, the United States and China will take the lead, and Germany and Europe will once again miss out on a future technology.”",https://www.cleanenergywire.org/sites/all/themes/cleanenergywire/logo_og.png,N,,2025-09-25 06:00:09.109928

The event was designed to provide an opportunity for U.S. Sens. Mike Crapo and James Risch, along with U.S. Rep. Russ Fulcher, to hear and respond to local constituents’ concerns in an environment with rules for civility and respect.

Unfortunately, but not unexpectedly, the three representatives declined to appear. Nor did they send any prepared statements to be read to the attendees. The organizers had anticipated this and the event took place regardless, with a recording that will be sent to the members of Congress.

Over 75 people attended. Three chairs stood at the front of the auditorium, each with a large photograph of one of the absent legislators.

Kathy Dawes, one of the organizers of the event, and Mark Havens from Interlink, a nonprofit providing services to the elderly, served as co-moderators.

The forum was planned and conducted in accordance with guidelines from Braver Angels, a nonpartisan volunteer organization that embraces respect, honesty and responsible citizenship. They encourage this by teaching respectful communication skills through free workshops, one of which was conducted in the morning before the forum. The driving force that fuels their mission is “bringing Americans together to bridge the partisan divide and strengthen our democratic republic.”

Issues raised by nonprofit groups

Representatives from several nonprofit groups in the region gave short presentations about their work and the challenges they face. Each ended with some specific questions for the members of Congress.

They spoke about a wide range of topics that surely would’ve been of interest to our representatives. These included the need for bipartisan solutions to climate change, protecting the budget for scientific agencies, reforming the process for clean energy permitting, supporting funding for the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services and the Housing First initiative, the importance of investing in senior citizen services, concerns about cuts to federal funding for education and students with disabilities, the need to reduce the rancor in politics, and more.

Questions from the audience

During the second hour of the forum, audience members spoke to the photos on the dais in lieu of being able to speak to their absent members of congress. They asked tough questions about topics including concerns about the Smithsonian, protecting our First Amendment rights, the negative impact of tariffs on markets for Idaho agricultural products and family farmers, the chaos caused by ICE raids when crops need to be picked, investigation into conditions at immigration detention centers, stopping President Donald Trump from sending troops into American cities, increased housing costs, the conflict in Ukraine, the need for humanitarian aid for Palestinians, and the importance of adequate funding for national parks.

The tone of the questions was as varied as the people who asked them. Many questions were carefully phrased and delivered in even tones. Other questions reflected the individuals’ frustration and even desperation, with several people literally begging the representatives to take action on issues like rent increases.

Others questions were very pointed. One questioner raised issues with multiple Trump administration actions, saying, “You’re turning a blind eye to these actions, normalizing them. What has to happen for you to stand up to this administration and stop these undemocratic actions?” Another asked, “Are you three merely cowardly Republicans afraid of Trump’s retribution, or are you supporting his lunatic and fascist takeover of our country?”

Great turnout — except for the missing three

Despite not having the senators and congressman present, the mood in the room during the event was positive. People were attentive to the presentations and often applauded the questions.

The recording of the event is now being edited and will be sent to Sens. Crapo and Risch and Rep. Fulcher, with requests for their responses. A short video of Q&A highlights is already posted.

After the event, Dawes summed up the experience: “We were all very disappointed that our members of Congress did not attend, and that they did not even provide a statement that we requested to be able to read at the event. To not even acknowledge their constituents’ request for a statement is very difficult for me to understand. If they watch the video we send them, they will see the respectful demeanor of the crowd and the wide variety of sincere questions and comments made that really deserve a thoughtful response.”

Perhaps the only disrespectful aspect of the event was the behavior of our elected representatives.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-82/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/capitolnight-1-1024x7691758708186.jpeg?h=ae4494b8&itok=-m1GeNLo,N,,2025-09-24 22:58:32.621265

Climate jobs should be good jobs — safe, skilled and union-backed.","Despite recent federal setbacks to the climate justice movement, Austin has a pathway to reduce its carbon footprint, create hundreds of jobs and save nearly $3 million per year in energy costs, according to the Texas Climate Jobs Project (TCJP). The coalition launched its new report, “Powering Public Progress: Decarbonizing Austin’s Municipal Buildings for a Resilient Future,” at a press conference last week alongside city leaders. The report outlines pathways to bolster Austin’s sustainability initiatives while creating union-supported work.

About the Texas Climate Jobs Project

Labor unions across the state partnered to create the TCJP in 2021. The coalition explores policies to strengthen climate resilience while addressing income inequality and creating jobs.

“We founded the Texas Climate Jobs Project because working people deserve to be at the center of our state’s clean energy future,” said Jeremy Hendricks, secretary treasurer of the Laborers’ International Union of North America (LiUNA) Local 1095.

“Texas is the energy capital of the country — but it’s also the most dangerous state for workers, with the highest rates of workplace fatalities, injuries, wage theft and misclassification,” he added. “Texas has the potential to lead the nation in climate action and job creation. But that only happens if labor is at the table — not as an afterthought, but as a driving force. That’s why we launched this project: to make sure climate solutions are also economic justice solutions, rooted in the dignity, safety and strength of Texas workers.”

Ryan Pollock, executive director of the Texas State Building and Construction Trades Council and an organizer with the local chapter of the International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW), told the Austin Monitor the TCJP was intended to stand in the gap between the labor force and environmentalists.

“Texas being the energy state, we really needed to be on the front line of this,” he noted.

Coordination with existing city projects

The report’s recommendations fall into three categories: installing rooftop solar panels across city-owned buildings, retrofitting city facilities with climate-resilient infrastructure and creating high-quality union jobs to accomplish this work efficiently. These goals align with the city’s recent climate initiatives.

“I think there’s a lot of synergy between what the report asks for and what we’re doing already,” said Council Member Mike Siegel. Earlier this year, Siegel co-sponsored Council Member Ryan Alter’s resolution directing city staff to identify city properties with the greatest potential for solar generation.

“I was really happy to see the Office of Climate Action and Resilience is taking immediate action to implement this policy,” Siegel said. “Their urgency is driven in part by the federal administration basically canceling solar panel tax credits beginning in about a year. And so we are moving … to start the process of building these solar panels on city land so we can take advantage of the federal tax cuts that are still in existence.”

“Staff are now prioritizing the most viable sites and developing a procurement strategy,” Alter said of the initiative. “Once finalized, the city will issue a multi-site Request for Proposals for a portfolio of solar projects.”

Because Austin’s electrical utility is municipally owned, there is more flexibility to implement union-backed labor practices when expanding the city’s solar network.

“At this moment in history when the federal government is cutting their support for Austin, when the state government continues to be hostile to the goals of our community, it’s really important that we have strategies that are sustainable and realizable using our own resources,” Siegel told the Monitor. He emphasized that the TCJP report will further empower the city to make sure workers are taken care of throughout this initiative. “It’s not enough to say ‘We want solar,’” he said. “We want solar built by well-paid workers at safe work sites who have the right to join a union … all of these things go together.”

City leaders also indicated their support for the TCJP’s second recommendation: retrofitting city facilities for climate efficiency.

“Buildings generate nearly half of Austin’s emissions, so improving their efficiency is critical to reaching our 2040 net-zero goal,” Alter said. “While upgrades come with upfront costs, improved efficiency saves money over time — a win for taxpayers, a win for our environment, and a win for our future,” he added.

In fact, Siegel and Alter partnered during the recent budget cycle to create a climate revolving fund that could support this work. Inspired by similar initiatives in San Antonio and Harris County, the fund will support energy-efficiency projects around the city and will re-invest the savings generated by increased efficiency into additional improvements.

The report also bolsters an existing city priority of establishing local pipelines for green careers. The Austin Infrastructure Academy, a joint effort between the city and several workforce development partners, launched earlier this year. It trains Austinites for success in union and trade careers. Hendricks also pointed to the Austin Civilian Conservation Corps (ACCC), a green jobs program created by former Council Member Alison Alter during the pandemic.

“Austin has room — and real need — for all workforce programs that lift up trainees and workers,” Hendricks said. “There’s definitely potential for overlap and collaboration—especially when it comes to connecting ACCC participants to longer-term union careers in infrastructure, electrification or building retrofits.”

What’s next?

Looking ahead, Siegel told the Monitor he is interested in the potential to bring solar panel manufacturing to Austin, and to create more pathways for high schoolers to pursue union apprenticeships to help install them.

“By creating a goal of adding these additional hundreds of megawatts of solar panels, our electric utility has essentially created a new market of work,” he said. “We want to make sure we’re thinking about the supply chain aspect of this: Can we attract manufacturing to build the renewable energy infrastructure we need? And then also there’s a workforce part of this where we want to make sure we’re training up young Austin workers so that they can get the skills and experience to take advantage of these high-income job opportunities.”

City and union leaders agree that including workers in the transition away from fossil fuels is the only way to ensure an equitable climate future — especially in the face of ongoing pushback from the federal administration.

“Having a strong environmental message … is not enough. We need to build real power to demand and enforce that message, and that’s where the labor movement comes in,” Siegel noted.

“If we’re serious about building a clean energy future in Texas, then unions have to be at the center of it. Climate jobs should be good jobs — safe, skilled and union-backed. We need family-supporting careers with real benefits, so workers can afford to live in Austin and build a life here,” Hendricks said. “That’s how we ensure working people, especially those from communities historically left behind, aren’t just surviving the transition — they’re leading it.”",https://i0.wp.com/austinmonitor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/solar_installation.jpg?fit=2048%2C1365&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-24 20:01:39.560164

As extreme heat becomes one of the world’s most pressing public health challenges, tools like Shaded Route Planning and DeepShade are more than technical experiments.","At the 2024 Paris Olympics, marathoners pushed through miles of scorching pavement while fans crammed into sun-soaked plazas and stadiums. More than a year later, fans remember games that were both fun and fashionable. But for event planners, the sobering challenge of planning for extreme heat remains.

Shade, it turns out, can be vital when the mercury rises. A shadow from a building can lower surface temperatures by 20 degrees Fahrenheit or more, offering life-saving relief. But knowing where shade will be and how to get there isn’t always easy. That’s where Hua Wei and his team at Arizona State University believe artificial intelligence, or AI, can help.

Wei, an assistant professor of computer science and engineering in the School of Computing and Augmented Intelligence, part of the Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU, has launched two complementary projects that use AI to make shade information practical, accessible and actionable.

One helps people choose cooler walking or biking routes in real time. The other uses generative AI to simulate how shade shifts through the day, providing data for city planners and designers. Together, the projects are part of Wei’s broader mission: harnessing AI to support human-centered, smarter cities.

Staying cool on the move

The first project, called Shaded Route Planning, was designed with people in mind, especially pedestrians and cyclists who face hours of sun exposure during heatwaves. Traditional mapping apps prioritize speed or distance. Wei’s tool adds a third factor: shade.

The system starts by scanning satellite images to spot where shade falls from trees, buildings or other structures. It then lines that information up with maps of sidewalks and streets to figure out how much of each path is covered. From there, the tool gives users several options. They can take the fastest route, the shadiest route or strike a balance between the two.

The prototype has already been successfully tested at the Paris Olympics to help visitors choose cooler paths between venues. In a demo, the shortest route glowed orange across the map, cutting straight down sun-drenched boulevards. A slightly longer path appeared in green, winding through shaded alleys and tree-lined streets.

“Even a small change in the route can make a big difference,” Wei says. “It could mean fewer cases of heat exhaustion and a much more pleasant experience for thousands of travelers.”

Seeing tomorrow’s shadows today

While Shaded Route Planning helps people on the move, Wei’s second project looks at the bigger picture. DeepShade is a generative AI system that predicts how shade appears and shifts in urban areas over time.

The problem is that regular satellite photos don’t show shade very clearly. They may be out of date, grainy or taken inconsistently when shadows might look completely different. DeepShade fixes this by creating realistic “what-if” pictures of shadows throughout the day and across the seasons. It uses information about buildings and the sun’s position to simulate how shade should fall. Those examples then teach an AI system how to generate detailed shade maps on demand. A user could ask the system to show, for example, what an area looks like at 6 p.m. in July, and it will draw the shadows exactly where they’d be.

To refine accuracy, the model uses edge detection to capture crisp building outlines and contrastive learning to ensure shadows evolve realistically over time. In experiments across 12 cities, from Beijing to Tempe, Arizona, DeepShade consistently outperformed other AI methods in generating accurate shade predictions.

In practice, this means city planners could use DeepShade to test how adding a row of trees, adjusting building height or placing a new bus stop might change shade availability for pedestrians. It provides a data-driven way to design “cool corridors” and public spaces that protect vulnerable populations during extreme heat.

A researcher on the rise

For Wei, these projects are part of a growing portfolio of work that blends technical AI expertise with real-world impact. His research on decision-making systems has already earned him a prestigious 2025 National Science Foundation Faculty Early Career Development Program (CAREER) Award, support from Amazon and collaborations with city governments.

He is particularly focused on what AI researchers call the “simulation-to-reality gap,” or the problem that algorithms often perform well in clean, simulated environments but stumble in messy, unpredictable real-world conditions. Shade, with its dependence on weather, season and urban form, is a perfect example of such complexity.

To tackle these challenges, Wei works closely with other leading researchers, including Yezhou “YZ” Yang, a Fulton Schools associate professor of computer science and engineering. Yang is a thought leader in computer vision, making him an ideal collaborator for projects like DeepShade.

“For me, the promise of AI has always been about more than algorithms. It’s about creating tools that touch people’s lives in meaningful ways,” Yang says. “I’ve long believed that AI for social good means designing systems that don’t just push technology forward, but bring comfort, dignity and well-being to the communities we serve.”

Designing for people, not just systems

At its heart, Wei’s work is about empowering people. As extreme heat becomes one of the world’s most pressing public health challenges, tools like Shaded Route Planning and DeepShade are more than technical experiments. They’re glimpses of how cities might adapt — not in abstract ways, but in the lived experience of a cyclist finding relief under tree cover, a tourist enjoying a cooler walk to an Olympic venue or a community planner deciding where to add the next stretch of greenery.

“We want AI to support decisions that people can feel in their daily lives,” Wei says. “When the sun is beating down, finding shade isn’t just about comfort. It’s about health and resilience.”",http://fullcircle.asu.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/SCAI-Hua-Wei-2025-EG-6929-w-EDIT.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 20:01:44.558808

Revisions to Final Risk Evaluations The 2024 rule restricted EPA from revising final risk evaluations unless it restarted the prioritization process, except to protect health or the environment.
Manufacturer Requests for Risk Evaluations EPA proposes to scale back the broad information requirements placed on manufacturers by the 2024 rule.
These issues will shape how EPA conducts and documents risk evaluations going forward.","The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has proposed a potential reset of the risk evaluation process under the Toxic Substances Control Act. If adopted, the proposal would roll back certain procedural requirements of the Biden administration’s 2024 risk evaluation rule (or the Framework Rule), restore elements of the 2017 framework, and create new clarity on when and how EPA can revise evaluations. Manufacturers (including importers) and processors should review the proposal closely and consider submitting comments, as the rule could directly shape the speed, scope, and transparency of chemical risk evaluations going forward.

For the regulated community, this proposal carries several important implications. Because EPA’s determinations of “unreasonable risk” under Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) section 6(b) form the legal foundation for future restrictions, bans, and workplace requirements, any changes to the evaluation process directly affect regulatory outcomes. The proposal would also scale back manufacturer obligations, limiting information requests to what is “known to or reasonably ascertainable” and reducing data requirements that had been expanded under the 2024 rule (for a deeper dive into the 2024 Framework Rule, see our prior analysis).

At the same time, EPA seeks to preserve momentum in the risk evaluation pipeline by allowing revisions to final risk evaluations without restarting the prioritization process—ensuring errors can be corrected and new information addressed without derailing progress on other chemicals.

KEY PROPOSED CHANGES

1. Scoping and Fit-for-Purpose Provisions

EPA proposes to delete the rule language that prohibited the agency from excluding conditions of use from a risk evaluation. Instead, EPA would revise and merge the “fit-for-purpose” provisions to make clear that the scope and level of analysis will be tailored to what EPA needs to decide for a given chemical. In practice, this means EPA may conduct more detailed analysis where risks are more likely and rely on screening-level data where risks appear minimal. For example, EPA might require detailed workplace exposure data for a solvent widely used in industrial degreasing but apply a simpler analysis for a niche use of the same solvent with very low potential for exposure.

Why it matters: This restores EPA’s discretion to focus on uses most likely to drive risk, helping to speed up evaluations and reduce the time spent on low-risk or peripheral uses, while giving industry greater clarity about what will be in scope.

2. Risk Determinations by Condition of Use

EPA seeks to return to making separate risk determinations for each use of a chemical (e.g., workplace use, consumer product use, or environmental release). This was the 2017 approach, whereas the 2024 rule allowed one broad “chemical-wide” decision. EPA also proposes to codify factors it must weigh—such as hazard severity, exposure levels, affected populations, and data quality—while retaining the ability to find unreasonable risk when multiple uses are considered together.

Why it matters: By requiring separate determinations for each condition of use, the proposal makes it more difficult for EPA to regulate uses that are not actually driving risk. Under the current single-determination approach, once EPA finds unreasonable risk overall, it can justify broad restrictions that sweep in lower-risk or non-risk-driving uses of a chemical. A use-by-use approach narrows the scope of regulation to the conditions of use EPA has specifically determined present unreasonable risk, giving industry more certainty and limiting overbroad compliance obligations.

3. Definition of Potentially Exposed or Susceptible Subpopulations

EPA proposes to remove the phrase “overburdened communities” from the regulatory definition of “potentially exposed or susceptible subpopulations” (PESS). The 2024 rule added this term to the statutory examples (children, workers, elderly), but commenters argued it was too vague and could expand risk evaluations beyond exposures tied to the chemical itself. EPA proposes to return to the statutory framework while noting it can still consider other vulnerable groups when supported by science.

Why it matters: The definition of PESS sets the boundaries for who is considered at risk. For example, evaluation of a chemical used in consumer cleaning products might reasonably focus on risks to children and household users. Narrowing the definition makes the scope more predictable and helps manufacturers avoid being pulled into risk evaluations that cover groups unrelated to their chemical or use.

4. Definition of ‘Weight of Scientific Evidence’

EPA proposes to add a definition of “weight of scientific evidence,” describing how it integrates multiple studies and data sources when making risk determinations.

Why it matters: A formal definition increases predictability. For example, if EPA considers both animal studies and human exposure data, companies will know how EPA balances these sources and can tailor submissions accordingly. It also strengthens the consistency and defensibility of risk evaluations, reducing uncertainty for industry.

5. Aggregate Exposure Assessments

EPA proposes to drop the 2024 rule’s requirement that it provide an explanation each time it does not perform an aggregate exposure assessment (which looks at combined exposures from multiple sources). EPA will still conduct these assessments when supported by science but will not be required to justify their absence.

Why it matters: This change will reduce paperwork and keep evaluations moving. For example, if exposures from a chemical’s industrial use and consumer use are both low, EPA doesn’t need to spend time writing a justification for not combining them. That helps avoid delays while preserving EPA’s authority to perform aggregate assessments when needed.

6. Revisions to Final Risk Evaluations

The 2024 rule restricted EPA from revising final risk evaluations unless it restarted the prioritization process, except to protect health or the environment. EPA now proposes to remove that restriction. Instead, EPA could revise or supplement a final evaluation if needed while still ensuring transparency through draft and final documents, public comment, and peer review.

Why it matters: This allows EPA to correct errors or add new information without derailing work on other chemicals. For example, if new data show that a workplace exposure model overestimated risk, EPA could fix the evaluation directly rather than reopening the entire prioritization process. That balance helps protect companies from faulty conclusions while keeping the evaluation pipeline on track.

7. Manufacturer Requests for Risk Evaluations

EPA proposes to scale back the broad information requirements placed on manufacturers by the 2024 rule. Manufacturers would only need to provide information “known to or reasonably ascertainable” for the specific conditions of use they identify. EPA would rely on its other TSCA authorities to gather information on other uses—such as Section 4(a)(2), which allows EPA to require new data from any manufacturer or processor—to gather information on uses not identified by the requester.

If EPA determines that additional information is needed for a comprehensive evaluation, it may develop a strategy to obtain that information using these authorities and, if necessary, delay initiation of the evaluation for up to one year. EPA also clarifies that withdrawn requests do not incur fees.

Why it matters: This reduces burdens on companies by limiting requirements to information they reasonably control. For example, if a company requests evaluation of a chemical it produces for coatings, it must submit data about that use but not about unrelated uses like plastics production. EPA can then turn to other manufacturers or processors for additional data.

TOP 5 OPPORTUNITIES FOR INDUSTRY COMMENT

EPA is seeking public comment on 13 separate subjects in the proposed rule, but the following five may be of particular interest to manufacturers (including importers) and processors because they directly affect compliance obligations, regulatory certainty, and the standards EPA will apply in future risk evaluations.

Scope and Conditions of Use: EPA is asking whether its proposed revisions to the “fit-for-purpose” scoping provisions are clear and appropriate and how to handle conditions of use identified after an evaluation is complete. This will shape how narrowly or broadly future evaluations are framed.

Risk Determinations and Occupational Exposure: EPA invites comment on changes to how it makes and documents risk determinations, including assumptions about workplace exposures. These decisions are central because they drive regulatory outcomes under TSCA.

Definitions of Scientific Standards: EPA is seeking comment on the proposed definition of “weight of scientific evidence,” whether to restore the 2017 definition of “best available science,” and whether to define “systematic review.” These definitions will guide how EPA evaluates data and how companies should generate or present information.

Revisions to Final Risk Evaluations: EPA requests input on when and how final evaluations may be reopened—such as to correct errors or account for new information—and what circumstances should not warrant reopening. This directly impacts regulatory certainty and reliance interests.

Manufacturer-Requested Risk Evaluations: EPA seeks comment on whether to scale back the broad information obligations imposed in 2024, limiting requests to information “known to or reasonably ascertainable by” the manufacturer. This directly affects the scope and cost of the industry’s compliance burden.

Comments must be received on or before November 7, 2025.

These issues will shape how EPA conducts and documents risk evaluations going forward. Stakeholders should carefully review the proposed rule (published in the Federal Register on September 23, 2025) and consider submitting comments to ensure that industry perspectives on burden, scope, and scientific standards are reflected in the final rule.

The idea that rising carbon dioxide concentrations could warm the planet dates back to the mid-nineteenth century. Women’s rights campaigner and scientist Eunice Foote showed in 1856 that CO2 and water vapour trap heat in the atmosphere1. Her work, which was mostly overlooked at the time, has been validated by decades of research that has built a remarkably clear picture. Average global temperatures have risen since the Industrial Revolution, fossil fuels release CO2 that push up greenhouse-gas levels and human activity is the main cause of global warming.

‘Researching climate change feels like standing in the path of an approaching train’

Yet, as climate scientist Kate Marvel observes in Human Nature, policymakers have taken surprisingly little action in response to the mounting evidence. Efforts have been hindered by decades of lobbying by powerful organizations such as oil companies. In this persuasive book, Marvel argues that people need to embrace an emotional response, not just a data-driven one, to prompt widespread action. Climate scientists and activists would be familiar with some of the emotions that double as chapter titles — anger, fear and grief. But Marvel insists on the need for wonder, love and hope, too.

By weaving in personal anecdotes, she makes the science behind climate change accessible: how Earth’s system functions, how greenhouse gases disrupt it, the effects of global warming and the complexity and uncertainties of models. For instance, Marvel poignantly recounts her fearful experience of living through Hurricane Ida in 2021, which caused disastrous floods that killed at least 13 people in New York City. She then explains that air can hold about 7% more water vapour for every degree Celsius it warms. When that vapour condenses, it drives short, intense bursts of rain. The chapter is especially helpful because it shows not only how storms form but also why warming leads to heavier downpours.

An unsettling truth

I can’t help but share Marvel’s anger and frustration. Climate science has advanced to the point where denying human-driven climate change feels obtuse. Her models, and thousands developed by other scientists, might differ in spatial and temporal resolution, but they all lead to the same unambiguous conclusion: Earth is warming and will keep doing so unless greenhouse-gas emissions drop to zero.

Just how bad will climate change get? The only way to know is to fund basic research

Scientists have watched their models of a warming world come true during their own lifetimes — faster than many expected. It is exciting to see one’s predictions get confirmed, to have been able to forecast the future with remarkable accuracy. Yet, witnessing climate change unfold in real time, with the consequences already visible when they could have been avoided or mitigated, is profoundly unsettling.

The book highlights the devastating consequences of extreme weather by weaving together historical and contemporary examples: a huge volcanic eruption in 43 bc that caused political turmoil in the Roman Empire and famines in ancient Egypt; the devastating droughts of the 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States; and the catastrophic floods in Texas triggered by Hurricane Harvey in 2017. References to Greek mythology and historical events, such as the fall of ancient Egypt because of crop failures triggered by disrupted rainfall patterns after the volcanic eruption, make the narrative engaging and entertaining.

However, Marvel could have discussed social-science studies that demonstrate how climate shocks affect livelihoods and human well-being2–4. These impacts are rarely direct or isolated; they ripple through economic, political and environmental systems.",https://media.nature.com/lw1200/magazine-assets/d41586-025-03032-5/d41586-025-03032-5_51450668.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 22:01:51.512023

The company has also opened a Houston office to support its growth.

House will focus on strategic initiatives and opportunities to ensure the company remains competitive while adapting to the evolving energy landscape, USEDC said. He will also coordinate activities associated with opening and managing the new Houston office.

“Howard brings exceptional depth of experience and strategic insight to U.S. Energy,” Jordan Jayson, CEO and chairman of USEDC, said in a statement. “As we anticipate deploying $1 billion in capital over the next 12-18 months, M&A will be a central driver of our growth strategy. Howard’s track record in mergers and acquisitions is second to none—he understands Houston, he understands Texas, and he possesses extensive knowledge of the industry. Just as important, he’s built trusted, long-standing relationships across the energy community. That rare combination of deal-making expertise and industry credibility is exactly what we need as we strengthen our footprint in Houston.”

House also will join USEDC’s investment committee.

USEDC said that with more than 35 years as an energy investment banker, House brings over $125 billion in transactional experience in the energy space to his new role, including roughly $60 billion of completed strategic advisory mandates, including mergers, acquisitions, divestitures, takeover defense, and restructurings.

House has also raised more than $65 billion in public and private capital markets transactions, the company said.

Targeting growth

USEDC said that House’s industry reputation and extensive oil and gas network will be key to facilitating the firm’s growth and said that House will focus on strengthening industry relationships across the energy value chain as well as sourcing and evaluating strategic opportunities.

“I’m very excited to join U.S. Energy as we establish our presence in Houston,” House said in a statement. “I have watched USEDC grow from an Appalachian-focused enterprise into an active driller and acquirer of both operated and non-op interests across numerous basins. I look forward to playing a role in its future growth.”

House’s experience includes senior roles at Greenhill & Co., Raymond James & Associates, and Lehman Brothers. He began his career in the energy industry as a petroleum engineer at Exxon Co. USA.

USEDC said the opening of the Houston office reflects its commitment to continued growth in Texas and beyond. It said that with Houston being a global hub of the energy industry, establishing an office here will allow USEDC to leverage existing and new relationships in order to enhance deal flow.

Founded in 1980, USEDC is a privately held exploration and production firm that manages assets for itself and its partners. It has invested in, operated, and/or drilled roughly 4,000 wells in 13 states and Canada and has deployed more than $3 billion on behalf of itself and its partners.

The Voltpost Air uses that elevated design with a retractable cable system to protect against weather damage and vandalism, setting it apart from Voltpost’s original curbside charger. It’s also built for faster installation, broader pole compatibility, and better reliability.

It can be installed on both wooden and metal lampposts and utility poles, curbside or in parking lots. Site hosts can deploy one or two chargers per pole, making it a flexible option for cities and property owners. Drivers can pay with the app or by tapping with a credit card. Voltpost Air supports Level 2 charging, up to 9.6 kW per charging port.

Luke Mairo, COO and cofounder of Voltpost, said that “the modular design and quick installation reduce costs and complexity, making it easier than ever to expand charging infrastructure.” Voltpost is already operating chargers in Oak Park, Illinois, and at the American Center for Mobility near Detroit. The company has projects underway in New York, California, Michigan, Illinois, Connecticut, and Massachusetts.

Former US Joint Office of Energy and Transportation executive director Gabe Klein, now a Voltpost board advisor, said, “The transition to renewable transportation requires bold, scalable solutions that can integrate seamlessly into existing urban infrastructure. Technologies like Voltpost’s lamppost chargers are vital because they unlock new opportunities to deploy EV charging.”

The Brooklyn installation is part of New York City Economic Development Corporation’s (NYCEDC) Pilots at Brooklyn Army Terminal (BAT) program, which supports climate-tech companies in scaling new solutions. It’s expected to be available to the public by the end of the year. New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA) president and CEO Doreen M. Harris called the model “highly replicable” and said it could be adopted across New York State.

EPA Publishes Proposed Rule for Further Reconsideration of TSCA Risk Evaluation Procedures

On September 23, 2025, EPA released its much-anticipated proposed rule to revise its chemical risk evaluation process under section 6 of TSCA, updating key provisions of the 2024 regulation issued during the Biden administration. The proposed rule, titled “Procedures for Chemical Risk Evaluation Under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA),” reflects the new administration’s regulatory priorities and responds to concerns raised by regulated entities about the scope and methodology of prior chemical risk evaluations.

Among the proposed changes, EPA would be required to assess unreasonable risk for each individual condition of use identified within the scope of the evaluation undertaken, rather than issuing a single, overall determination for the “whole chemical” substance. The proposed amendments also would clarify how occupational exposure controls — such as the use of personal protective equipment and industrial safeguards — will be considered in such evaluations, and outline EPA’s discretionary authority in selecting relevant conditions of use, exposure routes, and exposure pathways. Additional revisions include proposed updates to regulatory definitions said to align with Executive Order 14303, “Restoring Gold Standard Science,” and amendments to the procedures for revising or supplementing risk evaluation documents to help EPA meet statutory deadlines. The proposed rule also amends the process and data requirements for manufacturers and importers requesting agency-led evaluations, described as enhancing transparency and regulatory certainty.

Litigation over the 2024 procedural rule has been paused while EPA pursues this rulemaking process.

Public comments will be accepted until November 7, 2025, and can be submitted electronically to the e-docket for EPA-HQ-OPPT-2025-0260.

EPA Announces It Will Prioritize New Chemical Review for “Data Center” Chemicals

EPA announced that it will prioritize review of new chemicals intended for use in data centers or manufacturing covered components, beginning with submissions received commencing September 29, 2025, pursuant to the Executive Order “Accelerating Federal Permitting of Data Center Infrastructure.”

The announcement explains that the July order calls for speeding up permitting “under laws including TSCA that impact the development of qualifying projects such as AI data centers and the infrastructure that powers them,” such as high-voltage transmission lines and other equipment. Therefore, the Agency plans to “prioritize review of certain new chemicals to reduce the regulatory burden to companies looking to invest in them.”

Submitters seeking priority designation must identify their submission as a chemical warranting expedited assessment by attaching a cover letter via EPA’s Central Data Exchange, specifying the application and providing details concerning the data center where the new chemical or covered component will be used.

International PFAS Developments

The European Chemicals Agency (ECHA) announced that the draft opinion of its Committee for Socio-Economic Analysis (SEAC) on the proposed EU-wide restriction of PFAS will be finalized at SEAC’s meeting in March 2026. The SEAC draft opinion will cover the evaluation of the socio-economic aspects of the 2022 proposed REACH restrictions on PFAS, including the availability of alternative substances and technologies. Following that meeting, ECHA plans to hold a consultation that will remain open for 60 days, during which stakeholders can provide feedback.

The consultation will use a structured survey format, inviting participants to respond to questions on the potential impacts of restricting the use of PFAS across various sectors. Participants will also be asked to provide specific information about the availability and feasibility of alternatives to these widely used chemicals. All feedback will be entered directly into the question fields for each survey topic.

In preparation for the consultation, ECHA will hold an online information session on October 30, 2025. After reviewing the consultation feedback, SEAC is expected to adopt its final opinion by the end of 2026.

This announcement follows ECHA’s publication of an updated proposal to restrict PFAS. The update was prepared by the authorities from Denmark, Germany, the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden, the countries that submitted the initial proposal in January 2023. The update was issued in response to and after completion of a review of more than 5,600 scientific and technical comments received from third parties during the 2023 consultation.

The update contains assessments for eight sectors that were not specifically named in the initial proposal and an assessment of alternative restriction options, beyond a full ban or a ban with time-limited derogations.

However, in response to the updated PFAS restriction proposal, ECHA stated that its Risk Assessment and SEAC Committees would not carry out a sector-specific evaluation of the eight sectors added in the updated proposal. ECHA explained that the European Commission has already stated that the scientific assessment of the restriction by the ECHA committees is scheduled to conclude in 2026. Including a further eight sectors into the committees’ evaluations would require significant time beyond 2026. Therefore, the committees will not evaluate the eight newly identified sectors.

State PFAS Products Prohibitions

There continues to be a growing number of states enacting laws that prohibit PFAS when it appears in consumer (and commercial use) products, with implementation timelines for certain prohibitions that have commenced already or are to come into effect during upcoming years between now and 2032. These bans target a wide array of product categories, including textiles, food packaging, cosmetics, cookware, cleaning products, and juvenile items. The following are recent notable examples.

In April, the PFAS Protection Act, HB 212, was enacted in New Mexico and is one of the most comprehensive pieces of legislation targeting PFAS in consumer products. The bill phases out PFAS over multiple years with an effective ban date in 2027 for cookware, food packaging, dental floss, juvenile products, and firefighting foam, and expands to include carpets, cleaning products, cosmetics, fabric treatments, feminine hygiene products, textiles, ski wax, and upholstered furniture by 2028. Starting in 2032, there will be a complete ban on PFAS in all products unless deemed “currently unavoidable” by the state. In addition, the act states that the New Mexico Environmental Improvement Board may adopt rules to require the labeling of products in English and Spanish.

In furtherance of the rule development process for labelling, the New Mexico Environmental Department will be holding an informational webinar on product labelling requirements on September 25, 2025 at 1 p.m. MT. To register, email NMED-PFAS@env.nm.gov.on.

This summer, Illinois enacted HB 2516, which amended the state’s PFAS Reduction Act such that beginning January 1, 2026, an individual may not sell, offer for sale, or distribute for sale any products containing intentionally added PFAS in cookware, cosmetics, dental floss, juvenile products, menstrual products, intimate apparel, and food packaging.

California has several pieces of legislation, as well as statutes on the books, targeting PFAS in consumer products. In 2022, AB 1817 was enacted, specifically targeting PFAS in textiles, including apparel, bedding, draperies, and backpacks. By January 1, 2025, manufacturers were required to certify compliance and use safer alternatives. Much more recently, SB-682 was passed by the legislature after some last-minute revisions and now awaits the governor’s signature. This bill would ban PFAS in food packaging, juvenile products, dental floss, some cleaning products, and ski wax by 2028 and phase in certain prohibitions affecting other cleaning product components by 2030, and cookware by 2031.

A Minnesota state administrative law judge has recently disapproved the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency’s (MPCA) proposed PFAS reporting and fees rule, saying that MPCA did not include a cumulative effect assessment of the regulation required under state law. Additionally, the Administrative Law Judge (ALJ) found that a number of the provisions were not rationally related to the MPCA’s objectives for the rules. Other provisions exceeded, conflicted with, or did not comply with the enabling statute. Consequently, the ALJ found those provisions did not constitute enforceable law. MPCA has stated that it will resubmit proposed rules to correct several smaller parts and better document the cumulative effects of the rule.

The synopsis of recent state actions above reflects a contrast, and perhaps growing frustration, with PFAS-related efforts by the federal government. State legislatures remain committed to restricting the use of PFAS — particularly in consumer products. The resulting patchwork of state requirements will serve to heighten compliance complexity for product manufacturers and distributors operating across jurisdictions.

Litigation

Several legal challenges have been filed challenging Agency actions completed during the Biden administration for certain TSCA risk evaluations and other EPA rules, though most have been stayed as the Agency continues its reconsideration efforts:

5th Circuit Extends Stay in PCE Rule Litigation. On September 12, 2025, the Fifth Circuit granted EPA’s request to extend the stay in litigation over its TSCA rule phasing out many uses of perchloroethylene (PCE) for an additional 90 days. Despite opposition from environmental groups, the court will allow EPA more time to reconsider the rule. EPA must report by November 19, 2025 on any plans to revise the regulation and how changes may affect the case.

EPA Seeks Abeyance in Carbon Tetrachloride Rule Litigation in the 8th Circuit. On September 12, 2025, EPA asked the Eighth Circuit to place litigation over its TSCA rule phasing out uses of solvent carbon tetrachloride (CTC) back in abeyance. This request follows a September 4, 2025 clerk’s order lifting the abeyance and directing the parties to submit an amended joint proposed briefing schedule. The Agency is developing a revised rule that will consider updated workplace exposure limits and aims to preserve judicial resources while the rule is reconsidered. No parties to the case have objected to the request.

EPA Extends Compliance Deadlines for TCE Rule Amid Ongoing 3rd Circuit Litigation. On August 18, 2025, EPA announced a 90-day extension of compliance deadlines for certain exemptions under its 2024 TSCA risk management rule for trichloroethylene (TCE), pushing the effective date to November 17, 2025. This follows a May 27, 2025 motion from EPA with the Third Circuit requesting an indefinite abeyance of consolidated litigation challenging its TSCA rule restricting TCE uses, stating that it intends to undertake a rulemaking process to reassess the regulation. The Agency has stated that the delay is necessary to maintain the status quo while litigation over the rule continues, and to allow time for the court to address competing procedural requests.

EPA Seeks Continued Pause in 9th Circuit 1,4-Dioxane Litigation. On July 28, 2025, EPA asked the Ninth Circuit to continue an extended abeyance in a 2021 lawsuit brought by environmental groups and states, challenging the Trump administration’s TSCA risk evaluation of 1,4-dioxane, which concluded certain uses posed no unreasonable risk. The Agency argues that pausing the case is appropriate while related litigation in Union Carbide Corp. v. EPA — which challenges the Biden administration’s reversal of that finding — proceeds in the Fifth Circuit.

5th Circuit Grants EPA Limited Extension in 1,4-Dioxane Litigation. On July 1, 2025, the Fifth Circuit extended its stay in Union Carbide Corp. v. EPA by 90 days, allowing EPA more time to reconsider its revised TSCA risk evaluation of 1,4-dioxane, though the court again declined the Agency’s request for a longer pause. EPA had sought a 180-day extension to continue its review of the Biden-era supplement to the original Trump-era evaluation, which had found no unreasonable risk for certain uses of the solvent. While the chemical company did not oppose the request, the court limited the extension to September 30, 2025, consistent with its earlier decisions to grant only partial stays. EPA now estimates it could complete its revised cancer risk analysis within six to 12 months, depending on the need for public comment or peer review. The Agency’s updated evaluation, released in late 2024, reversed earlier findings and concluded that 1,4-dioxane poses an unreasonable risk, prompting this novel industry challenge.

EPA Highlights 200 Environmental Actions During Trump’s Current Presidency

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced 100 additional environmental actions taken over the past 100 days, bringing the total to 200 since President Trump took office. Key initiatives highlighted in EPA’s August 7, 2025 press release include funding to address lead in school drinking water, steps toward resolving the Tijuana sewage issue, PFAS reduction efforts, and progress on State Implementation Plans.

Industry Veteran Nominated To Lead EPA Chemicals Office

In late July, President Trump nominated Doug Troutman — who served as the interim co-CEO, longtime general counsel, and government affairs lead at the American Cleaning Institute — to serve as Assistant Administrator of the EPA’s Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, which oversees toxics and pesticide programs. The Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works will soon hold a hearing on his nomination and, later, the chamber will vote on his confirmation.

Other TSCA Actions

EPA Issues Interim TCE Rule. EPA published an interim final rule in the September 17, 2025 Federal Register extending some compliance dates for the 2024 trichloroethylene TSCA risk management rule. Public comments are due October 17, 2025.

EPA Issues Draft D4 Risk Evaluation. EPA issued its draft TSCA risk evaluation for octamethylcyclotetrasiloxane, or D4, preliminarily determining that it “presents unreasonable risk of injury to human health and the environment under certain conditions of use.” The EPA granted a manufacturer request for the evaluation in 2020. Comments on all aspects of the draft, including the conditions of use without a preliminary determination, are due November 17, 2025.

EPA Confirms Reconsideration of CTC Rule. EPA announced its decision to reconsider the carbon tetrachloride, or CTC, TSCA risk management rule via notice-and-comment rulemaking. EPA asked the 8th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals to hold litigation over the 2024 TSCA section 6(a) regulation in abeyance in the meantime. A public comment period will be announced in the coming weeks.

The EPA’s proposal, issued August 1, 2025, seeks input on whether to revise or rescind existing motor vehicle GHG emission standards. The industry group argues that current standards for model years 2027–2032 are no longer feasible, citing changing market conditions, flattened consumer demand for electric vehicles (EVs), infrastructure constraints, and the repeal of federal EV incentives.

According to the group’s letter, the GHG standards finalized in 2024 under the EPA’s “Multi-Pollutant Rule” assumed rapid EV adoption supported by federal subsidies and infrastructure investments. However, EV market share has plateaued at under 10% of new vehicle sales through the first half of 2025, far below EPA’s projected path toward 50% market share by 2030.

The letter highlights the July 2025 passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which eliminated key incentives under the Inflation Reduction Act, including EV purchase tax credits and battery production subsidies. The Alliance for Automotive Innovation contends this change significantly undermines the assumptions behind the current standards.

The organization also points to slower-than-expected charging infrastructure growth and supply chain challenges as barriers to compliance. It warned that without adjustments, automakers face “imminent compliance challenges and infeasible standards” that could disrupt the automotive market.

The letter urges EPA to:

Document why current standards are no longer appropriate.

Issue revised, achievable GHG standards as a “backstop” if the 2009 Endangerment Finding is rescinded.

Consider interim rules based on recent model years to provide regulatory stability.

Maintain programs that offer compliance flexibility, such as credit trading and off-cycle credits.

The group emphasized the need for a legally durable, stable regulatory environment that balances emissions reduction goals with consumer affordability, infrastructure readiness, and long-term competitiveness of the U.S. auto industry.",https://www.act-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/vans-charging.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:03:01.121941

Ampeco and Autel Europe have passed Open Charge Point Protocol 2.0.1 testing with the MaxiCharger DH480. OCPP is a way for charging stations to securely communicate to the companies managing them.

This way, if there's something wrong with a charging point, staff can be deployed quickly to take care of the issue. The standard also includes security protocols to ensure bad actors can't tap into those communications.

OCPP is a widely popular standard used by ChargePoint and plenty of other charging networks, though Tesla has its own proprietary protocol. The latest version of OCPP, 2.1, has features that enable vehicle-to-grid transfers. An open-source version of OCPP is also available for companies that want to make specific customizations.

Autel's MaxiCharger DH480 is a high-speed 480-kilowatt EV charger. Autel claims it can charge up to 0.6 miles every second. Meanwhile, Ampeco makes the management software for these chargers.

Electric vehicles are a clear upgrade from gas cars, especially since they're much cheaper to fuel than traditional cars.

If you want to save even more on charging costs, home solar is a great option. EnergySage can connect homeowners to local vetted installers who can design a solar panel system perfect for EV charging. It can even save owners up to $10,000 on installation costs through rebates and credits.

With modern communications protocols in place, Autel is confident that its latest chargers will help provide reliable charging across Europe.

In 2009, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) formally concluded that the buildup of heat-trapping greenhouse gases in the atmosphere endangers public health and welfare. Based on scientific evidence and research, the agency identified six greenhouse gases as the main culprits and established the legal basis to regulate them under the Clean Air Act.

Energy and Climate Policy

President Donald Trump’s administration has proposed rescinding this determination, commonly known as the Endangerment Finding, which would upend the government’s ability to regulate emissions of those greenhouse gases from cars, trucks, power plants, and industrial facilities. The EPA, led by Administrator Lee Zeldin, claims that the endangerment finding has justified regulations costing more than $1 trillion, negatively affecting the U.S. economy and auto manufacturing. Critics argue that the Trump administration is ignoring peer-reviewed science and regulatory history to pursue this proposal; they have said it will not only diminish U.S. efforts to address climate change but also put people’s lives and livelihoods at risk.

CFR Climate Realism fellows Varun Sivaram, Alice C. Hill, and David Hart examine the potential fallout and benefit of the EPA proposal.

ALICE C. HILL: For sixteen years, the EPA’s 2009 Endangerment Finding has served as the legal foundation for climate regulations. Now, the Trump administration wants to reverse the EPA’s determination that six greenhouse gases constitute air pollution endangering public health and welfare.

More From Our Experts

In one bold move, the agency tasked with protecting the American people from environmental harm has sought to smother the regulation of heat-trapping pollutants. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin correctly predicts that, if successful, elimination of the Endangerment Finding “will be the largest deregulatory action in the history of America” He believes that it would drive “a dagger straight into the heart of the climate change religion.”

With the Endangerment Finding knocked aside, the EPA would have no obligation to regulate greenhouse gases, and the Trump administration could speed up its unraveling of existing climate regulations.

Energy and Climate Policy

Do you two see a way forward for the Endangerment Finding? Or will future administrations need to find alternative ways to re-establish climate protections?

DAVID M. HART: You’re the lawyer, Alice, so I will defer to you on the detailed legal questions involved here. The Supreme Court’s 2007 decision inMassachusetts v. EPA was 5–4, so my presumption is that there are credible legal arguments on both sides of the matter.

As a matter of policy, I would like the federal government to have the authority to control greenhouse gas emissions. They pose a threat to Americans. They also pose a threat to societies and ecosystems worldwide. As theworld’s largest historical source of emissions, the United States has an obligation to try to address that threat. Regulation could be an important tool to this end.

Unfortunately, this tool has not been used to great effect in the past. The Clean Power Plan, which the Barack Obama administration sought to use to reduce emissions from electricity generation, never went into effect and yet, emissions from that sectorstill declined.

The story is somewhat different for automobiles. Controls on tailpipe emissions have made cars sold in the United Statesmore efficient and encouraged manufacturers to offer electric vehicles, thereby reducing emissions compared to a business-as-usual forecast.

But there are large caveats here. Federal agencies can use authorities thatpredate the Endangerment Finding to regulate fuel economy, and many states—led by California—have been able to impose stronger controls than the federal government, all of which calls into question the particular impact of the Endangerment Finding. And, these regulations have had someperverse effects, notably encouraging sales of SUVs and pickup trucks.

VARUN SIVARAM: David, those are really compelling lenses to evaluate this policy shift, and thanks Alice for kicking us off.

To me, one of the goals of the Climate Realism Initiative is to speak plainly and truthfully about what the United States should do about climate change. I believe the public deserves such transparency, and that policies passed with clear and sensible justifications will have more durability. The EPA’s Endangerment Finding fails this test, so I’m happy to bid it good riddance.

To be clear, I completely agree with the Endangerment Finding’s factual assertion that “six greenhouse gases taken in combination endanger both the public health and the public welfare of current and future generations.” This is true on a global scale: The world’s emissions of greenhouse gases cause climate change and risk catastrophic impacts on human wellbeing around the world.

But it is equally true that trimming U.S. motor vehicle greenhouse gas emissions—as the EPA Endangerment Finding allows under section 202(a) of the Clean Air Act through vehicle efficiency standards—will reduce global greenhouse gas emissions by much less than 1 percent this decade.

HART: Of course, the United States cannot control global greenhouse gas emissions by itself. As youpoint out in your introduction to our initiative and as you just alluded to, Varun, even if the U.S. eliminated its emissions today, that might have little effect on the pace of climate change. On the other hand, if the United States joins the rest of the world in imposing limits on emissions, the threat could be reduced, if not averted. Handcuffing the federal government, as Trump’s EPA proposes to do, could take such collaboration off the table for future administrations.

SIVARAM: There are two questions at play here, though. First, are global cuts to greenhouse gas emissions desirable? And second, is regulation under the Clean Air Act, enabled by the Endangerment Finding, the best way to achieve it? The answer to the first question is, of course, yes. But I don’t think that the Endangerment Finding charts the best path forward.

On the international front, China and India will continue making energy policies that suit their own interests, irrespective of the decisions made in the United States. At home, one of the more frequently cited benefits of the vehicle emissions standards imposed under the Clean Air Act is lower vehicle running costs for consumers, since they do not need to buy as much fuel.

But this is a paternalistic, ex post justification. If Americans want to spend money on inefficient, gas-guzzling vehicles, the bar to infringe on their liberty to do so should be high. Before the shale revolution, there was a strong national security and energy security case for curbing U.S. fossil fuel import dependency, but those risks aren’t as pronounced anymore, now that the United States is a net oil and gas exporter.

In short, if we are being completely honest, the regulations enabled by the EPA Endangerment Finding have no measurable impact on averting climate-related risks to the health or welfare of future American residents. The Endangerment Finding is a tortured attempted to pass climate policies through an obscure back door without leveling with the American people.

HILL: Honesty and transparency are indeed critical components of effective climate policy. But the Trump administration isn’t just seeking to roll back climate regulations, it’s also going after the science and data that support them.

For example, the Trump administration has reportedly asked NASA to develop plans to end the onlytwo satellite missions designed to measure carbon dioxide in the atmosphere. And it has proposed terminating funding for Mauna Loa Observatory in Hawaii, which has measured atmospheric carbon accumulation for close to seventy years—the world’s longest continuous record. It also killed the long-runningdatabase that tracks climate-related disasters costing the nation more than $1 billion each. Started in 1980, that database documents the rising costs of climate extremes for Americans.

At the same time, the administration has dismissed the hundreds of scientists who volunteered to complete the nation’ssixth national assessment—a Congressionally mandated report grounded in peer-reviewed science that evaluates climate risk by region and economic sector. Without access to up-to-date authoritative climate information, American communities and businesses will fly blind to the risks from climate change that their government apparently no longer wants to protect them from.

HART: Climate policy would certainly be much stronger if Congress legislated it in a bipartisan fashion. But it never has. And perhaps it never will.

HILL: I agree that legislation would certainly be a desirable solution if regulation through the Executive branch proves impossible, though I share David’s skepticism that it is a likely one. In the absence of action under Articles I or II, however, one ironic outcome of lifting the Endangerment Finding might be increased activity under Article III of the Constitution: the judiciary.

It could remove a shield that polluting companies have used effectively in litigation. Companies have successfully argued that the Clean Air Act preempts federal common law actions against them. But if the EPA is out of the business of climate regulation, that preemption argument could fall. The dockets of both federal and state courts could swell with lawsuits against utilities and other greenhouse gas emitters. In addition, the regulatory void left by a reversal at the federal level could leave more room for state legislatures to force fossil fuel companies to pay for adaptation and disaster recovery through measures like the Climate Superfund Acts passed in New York and Vermont.

By the way, abandoning the Endangerment Finding also flies in the face of the International Court of Justiceadvisory opinion [PDF] issued earlier this year, which found that nations have legally binding obligations under international law to mitigate heat-trapping pollution and adapt to the changing climate.

HART: Alice, that is a really fascinating and unanticipated twist to this story. I have been and continue to be worried that the courts are being asked to do far too much in a wide range of policy areas, due to failures in our other branches of government. I don’t think that having the courts make climate policy will result in effective action. It’s unlikely to be better than legislation passed by only one party and the use of executive authorities, which the United States has now tried without much success. Perhaps I’ll be proven wrong; a combination of state-level and judicial action have led to important progress in civil rights policy, including most recentlysame-sex marriage.

SIVARAM: I don’t think we should give up on legislation. Building innovative, world-leading energy industries will create jobs and wealth in the United States, something both parties profess to support. It will also reduce the cost of deploying low-carbon energy in other countries. Developing next-generation technology that can be deployed quickly and at scale will enable faster, cheaper diffusion of these technologies to the countries where most future emissions growth will occur.

This kind of constructive approach under my Climate Realism Doctrine could have three components.

Focus our approach to electrifying the economy through the lens of American security and competitiveness. We should be honest that in the next decade, America will do quite well by continuing to extract fossil fuels, using fossil fuels to power domestic industries and the artificial intelligence (AI) boom, and achieving global geopolitical leverage through energy dominance. But in the medium- and long-term, the United States risks losing economic competitiveness to China, which is electrifying its economy and producing far more electricity (through clean sources such as nuclear, solar, and wind) and using electricity for electric vehicles, electrified industry, and more. Such an economy will be cheaper, more advanced, and fundamentally more competitive thanks to the basic physics of why electrified technologies are more efficient than combustion-based ones.

Pass legislation focused on advancing U.S. innovation in electric and clean technologies and scaling-up technology advances to commercial scale. U.S. clean industries need support to bring cutting-edge innovations to market and compete with giant Chinese producers.

Pass legislation creating early markets for advanced U.S. technologies, such as solid-state battery powertrains. The military might purchase drones or vehicles with next-generation batteries, restricting purchasing to U.S. companies, for example. Such early markets create a demand-pull for U.S. clean technologies.

When the United States is able to bring together voters and legislators on both the right and the left to agree that global climate change threatens U.S. security and welfare, the set of interventions we should undertake will likely focus heavily on the more than 85 percent of emissions from China and emerging economies, adopting a muscular and realist approach to induce those economies to reduce their emissions as a condition of the United States reducing ours.

HART: Either way, these developments ultimately put the burden back on people like us to persuade the public as well as policymakers why the United States ought to do something to help the world slow and ultimately eliminate greenhouse gas emissions.

Arizona State University and the Vellore Institute of Technology, or VIT, have created a pathway through International Transfer Programmes, or ITP, which allows students to begin their Master of Technology in smart mobility program at VIT and then complete a Master of Science in clean energy systems at ASU.

The clean energy systems program is offered through The Polytechnic School, part of Ira A. Fulton Schools of Engineering at ASU, and is located on the Polytechnic campus in Mesa, Arizona.

VIT is recognized as one of India’s leading private engineering institutions, with more than 90,000 students across its campuses. Its smart mobility program is very competitive, and the new degree pathway broadens opportunities for talented students, equipping them with additional resources and a global perspective.

VIT Chancellor G. Viswanathan welcomed the launch.

“We are excited to partner with Arizona State University in launching this dual degree program,” he says. “It brings a unique international dimension to our students’ academic journey and enhances their potential to lead in the clean energy revolution.”

A.M. Kannan, a Fulton Schools professor of engineering and program chair of the clean energy systems program at ASU, is excited to provide students with hands-on research opportunities in Arizona as they complete their second year of graduate school. The Polytechnic School has a heavy emphasis on applied, experiential learning to provide a strong foundation for the students’ growth.

“We have 12 faculty members in our program,” Kannan says. “The robust faculty base we have dedicated to clean energy systems can help students move to the next level.”

The faculty’s expertise spans photovoltaic systems, power electronics for renewable energy integration, electric vehicles, autonomous driving, batteries and much more. That breadth of subject matter expertise will guide students in shaping their research interests and, for some, help create pathways into ASU’s new doctoral program in clean energy systems.

Faculty members in the program also maintain close connections with industry, ensuring students can engage with experts, tackle practical challenges and strengthen their professional development skills.

During the first year of study at VIT, the curriculum provides a strong foundation in theoretical knowledge. In their second year at ASU, students begin advanced technical training and project-based learning. Ultimately, students will earn two master’s degrees — one from VIT and one from ASU — leaving the program equipped with academic depth, applied experience and international exposure that will set them apart in the field.

The collaboration benefits students, while strengthening the Fulton Schools’ clean energy systems program by expanding research, drawing top international talent and raising the school’s global profile.

Graduates of the program will have advanced knowledge of career pathways in clean energy systems, including at energy technology firms, research institutions and utilities.

They’ll also have the option to pursue Optional Practical Training, or OPT, upon completion of their degree, or continue to the doctoral program.

This program offering lays the foundation for future collaborations with other institutions around the world that share ASU’s commitment to advance clean energy systems.

By connecting students in India and the U.S., the collaboration contributes to the United Nations Sustainable Development Goal of affordable and clean energy, and gives students the skills they need to take on global challenges.

The collaboration also highlights ASU’s role as a global leader in innovation and workforce readiness.",https://news.asu.edu/sites/g/files/litvpz161/files/2025-09/ASU-VIT-hero-1920x1080-2025-v2-toWEB.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 18:02:32.369778

It’s that time of year again, when the world’s climate elite converge on New York for their annual pilgrimage. Climate Week 2025 is filling the skies with private jets and the streets with motorcades, while in between cocktail receptions and panels, the emissaries of environmental virtue instruct the rest of us to do with less.

The United Nations General Assembly is also in town, offering a convenient stage for the political left’s global climate agenda. For decades, it has imposed costly mandates — emissions targets, fuel standards and regulatory frameworks — that punish the U.S. energy sector, push allies toward unreliable renewables and allow major emitters such as China to ignore deadline after deadline without consequence.

That agenda is on full display at Climate Week, this time with a carefully chosen figure meant to lend bipartisan credibility.

Benji Backer, the 27-year-old founder of the American Conservation Coalition and Nature Is Nonpartisan, is billed as the conservative voice of the climate movement. Polished and adept at wrapping himself in MAGA-friendly language, he is precisely the sort of figure the movement hopes will render its program more palatable to young conservatives.

However, his record tells a different story. Mr. Backer has called President Trump “despicable and indefensible,” praised Greta Thunberg’s “critical role” in shaping climate awareness and endorsed government control over 30% of America’s land for environmental purposes. He supports many of the policies long championed by liberal climate activists, including subsidies for “green hydrogen,” government-created incentives that redirect markets toward wind and solar, and expanded restrictions on fossil fuel development.

Mr. Backer is invaluable to the climate left. After decades of failed predictions and economically destructive policies, the movement has a credibility problem with ordinary Americans. A self-declared conservative willing to echo their premise — that carbon dioxide is an existential threat and fossil fuels must be aggressively curtailed — gives an illusion of bipartisan consensus.

Never mind that the movement’s agenda hasn’t worked. The flagship U.N. climate agreements have cost trillions of dollars without meaningfully altering global temperature trends. The largest emitters, especially China, remain on the same trajectory, exempt from serious restrictions. Billions of dollars in subsidies for wind and solar have produced an energy grid that is more expensive and less reliable.

The movement’s apocalyptic deadlines have come and gone without the promised catastrophe. Climate-related deaths are down 99% since the 1920s. People around the world are living longer, healthier and wealthier lives, and the primary driver of that progress has been access to affordable, abundant energy, overwhelmingly from fossil fuels.

Mr. Backer’s “commonsense” branding can’t hide the fact that his approach would take us in the opposite direction. By accepting the left’s framing of the problem and the solution, he offers not a conservative alternative but a more marketable version of the same failed plan.

Fortunately, the Trump administration is intent on moving in the opposite direction. It is ending the regulatory war on domestic oil, gas and coal, restoring investment in American energy production, and recognizing that wind and solar cannot replace reliable baseload power. It refuses to treat carbon dioxide as the enemy and instead focuses on technology, efficiency and innovation that expand prosperity without sacrificing energy security.

American energy dominance means stable, affordable prices for American families, a secure supply chain for our nation and our allies and the ability to withstand global price shocks without reliance on OPEC or hostile regimes. It ensures that the power needs of a growing economy — from households to next-generation technologies such as artificial intelligence data centers — are met with reliable, abundant domestic energy.

That prosperity is worth defending. Affordable, abundant energy is the foundation of modern life. It has lifted billions from poverty, extended life expectancy and enabled freedoms and comforts unimaginable a century ago.

Climate Week is doing what it always does: staging a spectacle, declaring the crisis graver than ever before, and demanding more control over how we live, work and consume.

Mr. Backer may be the most useful prop in that performance, but he is not the voice of conservative environmentalism. He is the cover for an agenda that has failed on its own terms and now seeks to survive under a different brand.

We need to reject the repackaging and stay focused on what works: energy abundance, economic growth and the freedom to pursue both without apology.

WASHINGTON, DC, UNITED STATES, September 24, 2025 /EINPresswire.com/ -- The Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy announces the LAMP National Summit, taking place October 8–10, 2025, at the historic St. Regis Hotel in Washington, D.C. This annual gathering brings together state legislators, policymakers, business leaders, and innovators from across the nation to shape the policies powering America’s digital and energy future.

Over three days, attendees will take part in plenary sessions, awards presentations, policy breakouts, and skills workshops designed to equip leaders with practical tools to make an impact in their state. Discussions will span artificial intelligence, national security, energy dominance, clean energy innovation, government efficiency, free and fair elections, and lessons learned from recent disaster response efforts. The program also includes recognition ceremonies honoring leaders and community heroes who have advanced freedom, equality, and civic excellence nationwide.

“The LAMP National Summit is about preparing today’s leaders for tomorrow’s challenges,” said Sarah E. Hunt, President and Founder of the Joseph Rainey Center for Public Policy. “Through LAMP we’ve created a space where state lawmakers, innovators, and civic leaders can exchange ideas, strengthen relationships, and leave better equipped to make an impact in their state.”

This exclusive summit will bring together 50+ state legislators, members of Congress, federal appointees, industry leaders, and innovators. Participants will engage directly with decision-makers at the state and federal levels; drive conversations at the intersection of national security, energy abundance, AI, and resilience; and help shape breakout sessions, panels, and sponsorships aligned with their priorities.

“Attending the last LAMP Summit gave me the chance to connect with peers from across the country and dive into practical solutions—everything from advanced nuclear and hydrogen to the responsible use of AI. These conversations didn’t just stay in Washington. I’ve brought ideas home that are now informing policy discussions in my own state on national security, strengthening the energy grid, and tackling housing so that the American dream remains within reach for every family,” said Amelia Powers Gardner, Utah County Commissioner.

Critics argue the plan weakens safeguards to protect people from toxic exposures.

The EPA on Monday released proposed changes to the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) that would remove amendments made in 2024 under the Biden administration. TSCA is a federal law under which the EPA evaluates chemicals to make sure human and environmental health will be protected before chemicals are put into the marketplace. The proposed changes include removing the 2024 amendment that required the agency to consider every use and exposure route of a chemical when evaluating risk.

In its explanation, the EPA wrote that the 2024 amendment could “negatively impact EPA’s ability to complete risk evaluations in a timely manner” and added that the agency should have discretion in deciding which “conditions of use, exposure routes and exposure pathways it will consider in risk evaluation,” a move that would allow the EPA to exclude some uses of a chemical from its reviews.

This proposed change ignores that people are often exposed to the same chemical from different sources, said Maria Doa, senior director of chemicals policy for the nonprofit Environmental Defense Fund. “If you live in a community and there’s a facility nearby releasing a chemical into the air … and you are exposed to the same chemical from a product that you use at home, your body doesn’t treat these exposures differently,” she said.

“What happens is they would regulate the one use and not the other. But if you look at the combination, they both contribute to your exposure,” Doa added.

Other proposed changes include scaling back how much information manufacturers need to provide for a proposed chemical; considering personal protection and safety equipment use when evaluating workplace chemical risks; and allowing the agency to determine if certain uses of a chemical carry unreasonable risks instead of making a single risk judgment based on all of the chemical’s uses — the latter approach negatively impacts technological innovation and businesses, according to the proposed rule change.

Doa said these changes are “all coordinated in order to lower what they characterize as exposures and risk.”

EPA administrator Lee Zeldin touted the changes as “a clear, predictable, commonsense approach that’s grounded in the law and the science” in an accompanying statement.

“This work is yet another example of how we can and will protect human health and the environment while allowing manufacturing and industrial sectors to thrive,” he said.

Evidence of Industry Influence

The EPA has made multiple environmental rollbacks in the first few months of the Trump administration that appease the industries the agency regulates. The proposed TSCA changes are in line with suggestions from the National Association of Manufacturers’ “wishlist” sent to the Trump administration last December.

Last week, The New Lede reported that top EPA officials are frequently meeting with lobbyists from the chemical, plastic, agricultural and energy industries and mostly shutting out health and environmental groups.

The findings were based on the calendars of Nancy Beck, the EPA’s principal deputy assistant administrator in the Office of Chemical Safety and Pollution Prevention, and Lynn Ann Dekleva, the deputy assistant administrator of the same EPA office. Both previously worked at the American Chemistry Council — which represents chemical manufacturers and praised the proposed changes in a statement.

“By revisiting provisions that created unnecessary complexity, confusion and uncertainty, EPA is taking steps to ensure that TSCA risk evaluations incorporate the best available and most recent science by adequately considering relevant exposures and condition of use information to inform decision-making,” said Kimberly Wise White, the council’s vice president of regulatory and scientific affairs.",https://truthout.org/app/uploads/2025/09/GettyImages-2231277681.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 17:02:57.388186

The Service said in an August 2024 assessment that because it planned to use “Best Management Practices,” that any potential effects on soil erosion or Lake Monroe’s water quality would be mitigated.

But the Court reviewed studies that the Forest Service cited for its plans and found them either outdated or irrelevant to the project. One of the studies cited was 30 years old and another used a metric which “carries little to no weight” for measuring the impacts of logging in Jackson and Lawrence counties.

Pratt’s ruling says the Service’s assessment offers “only generalized assurances” that its efforts to mitigate harm will be effective, but no analysis or reason for this conclusion. And “platitudes are not enough to satisfy (the National Environmental Policy and Administrative Procedure Acts).”

The law doesn’t require that an agency prevent harm or mitigate its impact. But it needs to take a “hard look” to measure the effects of its plans.

The ruling says, “The project should not move forward until that determination is made.”

The ruling sides with Monroe County Board of Commissioners, Indiana Forest Alliance, Hoosier Environmental Council, and Friends of Lake Monroe. It’s the third suit trying to halt the logging plan since 2020.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4c6306b/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1197x628+0+85/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Flegacy%2Fimages%2Fnews-images%2Fhoosier_national_forest_copy.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:03:25.279567

Solar continues to break records in July

EIA’s latest monthly “Electric Power Monthly” report (with data through July 31, 2025), once again confirms that solar is the fastest growing among the major sources of US electricity.

In July alone, electrical generation by utility-scale solar (i.e., >1-megawatt (MW)) surged by 36.9% compared to July 2024, while “estimated” small-scale (e.g., rooftop) solar PV increased by 12.7%. Combined, they grew by 30.4% and provided 9.4% of US electrical output, up from 7.5% year-over-year.

Moreover, utility-scale solar thermal and photovoltaic expanded by 37.4%, while generation from small-scale systems rose by 11.0% during the first seven months of 2025 year-over-year. The combination of utility-scale and small-scale solar increased by 29.9% and was 8.9% (utility-scale: 6.7%; small-scale: 2.2%) of total US electrical generation for January to July – up from 7.0% a year earlier.

As a consequence, solar-generated electricity year-to-date (YTD) easily surpassed – by over 54% – the output of US hydropower plants (5.7%). In July alone, solar-generated electricity more than doubled the output of hydropower. In fact, in both July and YTD, solar produced more electricity than hydropower, biomass, and geothermal combined.

And for the first time ever, 4% more electricity was generated in July by utility-scale solar (33,119-GWh) than by wind farms (31,831-GWh). Including small-scale systems, solar outproduced wind by over 35% during the month (43,092 GWh).

Wind is still on a growth trajectory

US wind turbines produced 10.8% of US electricity in the first seven months of 2025, an increase of 3.5% year-over-year, and they almost doubled electrical generation by the nation’s hydropower plants.

In July alone, wind-generated electricity was 13.8% greater than a year before.

Wind + solar are beating coal, nuclear

During the first seven months of 2025, electrical generation by wind plus utility-scale and small-scale solar provided 19.6% of the US total, up from 17.8% during the first seven months of 2024.

Further, the EIA reports that the combination of wind and solar provided 19.1% more electricity than did coal during the first seven months of 2025, and 14.1% more than nuclear. In fact, as solar and wind grew rapidly, nuclear-generated electricity dropped by 1.0%.

Renewables are still on the rise

All renewables combined (wind, solar, hydropower, biomass, and geothermal) produced 9.9% more electricity between January and July than they did a year ago and provided 26.7% of total US electricity production compared to 25.1% 12 months earlier.

Electrical generation by the combination of all renewables grew three times faster than total US electrical generation (9.9% vs. 3.3%). Renewables’ share of electrical generation is now second to only that of natural gas, which saw a decline in electrical output by almost 3.5% during the first seven months of 2025.

“Notwithstanding enactment of the anti-renewables provisions in the Trump megabill, solar and wind continue to power ahead,” noted the SUN DAY Campaign’s executive director, Ken Bossong. “Meanwhile, the electrical output YTD by the Republicans’ preferred technologies – nuclear power and natural gas – has actually fallen.”

While these vehicles offer a cleaner future, they also pose an important question: what happens to their batteries once they reach the end of their lifespan?

By 2030, the global EV fleet is projected to exceed 250M units. Additionally, the cumulative lithium-ion battery waste is expected to exceed 1 billion tons by the same year. Without battery recycling, this waste becomes an environmental problem. However, recycling is not just about waste management but about resource recovery. The materials used in EV batteries, such as lithium, cobalt, and nickel, are expensive and in limited supply. To put it in perspective, lithium carbonate typically costs around $ 8,200-$ 10,000 per ton, cobalt (battery-grade MHP) more than $ 21,000 per ton, and nickel between $14,000-$16,000 per ton, depending on market conditions. Recovering and reusing these critical minerals makes recycling not optional, but mandatory.

In this article, we will examine what is inside an EV battery, what can be recovered when it reaches the end of its life, and how the recycling process really works. We will also explore where these used batteries come from, which regions lead the recycling market, and how the industry is projected to grow in the coming years.

What is inside an EV battery?

Let’s first examine what an EV battery is made of. Each battery varies depending on factors like energy density, chemistry, and capacity. To simplify, let’s use the Tesla Model 3’s 75 kWh battery as an example. It contains about 12 kg of lithium, 50 kg of nickel, 4.5 kg of cobalt, and 4 kg of manganese. It also includes 70 kg of graphite for the anode, 20 kg of aluminum foil, and 25 kg of copper foil. Besides active materials, each cell has a steel casing, and the pack itself is housed in aluminum and steel for strength and safety. Here, nickel and cobalt face supply risks, with over 60% of cobalt sourced from the Democratic Republic of Congo. Graphite and aluminum are more abundant, yet their significant weight share makes them economically important in recycling.

When EV batteries like these reach the end of their lifespan, material recovery begins. Currently, the global market for recycled EV battery materials is estimated to be worth $500 million in 2024 (according to a report by Stratview Research). Cobalt accounts for the largest share, about 30%. Copper follows with roughly 25%. Although essential for battery production, lithium makes up only about 8%. The remaining materials include manganese, aluminum, and iron.

How are EV batteries recycled?

But how do we recover these metals? The answer lies in the recycling process, where used batteries are carefully disassembled and processed so that every valuable item can be reclaimed. Two main methods are used. Hydrometallurgy relies on chemical leaching to dissolve and separate metals, while pyrometallurgy involves high-temperature smelting to extract them. Hydrometallurgy now dominates the market, accounting for about 70% of the share, because it achieves higher recovery rates (up to 99% for lithium, nickel, cobalt, and manganese, and 95–100% for lithium and aluminum under optimal conditions), consumes less energy, and produces fewer emissions. Pyrometallurgy, although more energy-intensive, remains a valuable method for processing various battery chemistries.

Where do used EV batteries originate from?

To understand this market, it is essential to examine the origin of these end-of-life EV batteries. Cars make up the biggest share, contributing around 58% of the batteries that go into recycling. Close behind are electric buses, with a 41% share, while other vehicles, such as scooters, bikes, or trucks, make up only a negligible representation for now. Since almost all modern EVs, including cars and buses (the biggest shareholders), are powered by lithium-ion battery packs, nearly 97% of the batteries recycled today are lithium-ion. The 3% that remains comes from nickel-metal hydride (NiMH) batteries, which were popular in early hybrid electric cars and are now reaching the end of their life, making their way into recycling facilities.

The global map of EV battery recycling

The geography of EV battery recycling closely resembles where EVs are sold and used. In 2024, China accounted for nearly 65% of global EV sales, and it already hosts more than half of the world’s EV fleet. Naturally, this dominance extends into recycling. China alone holds about 65% of the EVs' recycled battery market, giving the parent Asia-Pacific region a commanding ~78% share of the global market.

This is followed by Europe, with a share of around 17%, driven by strong EV adoption policies and battery recycling regulations. Interestingly, from 2025 onward, the EU Battery Regulations introduce minimum recycling efficiency and material recovery targets, such as a minimum of 90% recovery of cobalt, copper, nickel, and lead, and a 50% recovery target for lithium by 2027. Europe is followed by North America, but its share remains low as large-scale EV penetration is still catching up.

The growth of EVs has put critical minerals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel under the spotlight, making recycling increasingly important. These materials are scarce and costly, and recovering them eases both supply risks and financial pressures on the EV industry. In 2024, the global Electric Vehicles Recycled Batteries Market was valued at $250 million, and it is projected to reach $300 million in 2025. Looking further ahead, the market is expected to reach USD 3 bn by 2035, expanding at a robust CAGR of 26%. This trajectory illustrates how recycling is evolving from a supporting role to become a primary component of the EV ecosystem.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt26ece40ce4e16eb3/650c1c2b99c3f9722e2269c7/GettyImages-868516744.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-24 17:02:10.762648

Data for Broward County highlights the potential savings. Households in Fort Lauderdale pay approximately $0.16 per kWh and use around 20,256 kWh per year. A Tesla Solar Roof sized appropriately can offset most or all of this consumption, translating to roughly $3,240 in annual bill avoidance. Even a 10 kW Tesla Solar Roof producing about 15,000 kWh per year could save homeowners about $2,400 annually before incentives. These calculations are based on local EnergySage data and the typical South Florida solar yield of approximately 1,500 kWh per kW per year.

Homeowners can also take advantage of the federal Residential Clean Energy Credit, which provides a 30 percent tax credit for qualified residential clean energy systems, including solar panels and Tesla Solar Roof tiles. This credit applies to the solar components, such as panels, tiles, inverters, wiring, and paired batteries, but not to unrelated roofing materials or structural costs. The credit remains at 30 percent through 2032, stepping down gradually through 2034 unless extended by Congress.

In Florida, additional incentives further increase the financial benefit. While the state does not offer a personal income tax credit, it provides a 100 percent property tax exemption on the added value of solar systems and a sales tax exemption on solar equipment purchases. These incentives, combined with the federal tax credit, maximize the return on investment for homeowners installing a Tesla Solar Roof.

Florida utilities also support net metering, allowing customers of investor-owned utilities, including Florida Power & Light (FPL), to receive bill credits at the retail rate for excess solar generation. Utilities apply a customary 115 percent sizing guideline relative to past usage, with credits rolling over monthly and annual true-ups defined by utility tariffs. These policies help homeowners achieve the projected savings from their Tesla Solar Roof.

Beyond energy savings, the Tesla Solar Roof offers a fully integrated new roof replacement with Class A fire, Class F wind, and industry-leading impact ratings. It comes with a 25-year product and power warranty. Compared to conventional rack-mounted panels, the Tesla Solar Roof has fewer roof penetrations and is designed to withstand the severe weather common in Broward County, providing both durability and efficiency.

Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach households are ideal candidates for the Tesla Solar Roof, as Florida homes typically consume more electricity than the national average due to heavy air conditioning use. With abundant sunshine and stable incentives, a solar roof replacement provides a practical way to reduce long-term energy costs while modernizing the home’s appearance.

Joel Alcocer emphasized Air Force Roofing’s commitment to combining precision roofing with modern energy solutions. The team ensures homeowners receive a coordinated project with a single warranty and one dedicated installer. By combining Tesla Solar Roof expertise with local permitting knowledge, Air Force Roofing helps Broward County residents navigate product selection, interconnection, and utility paperwork efficiently, resulting in faster energy savings and a seamless experience.",https://solarquarter.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/5.png,N,,2025-09-24 19:02:03.943312
,Texas Environment,2025-09-24 20:03:48+00:00,Deceleration,"Texas Utilities Failing Climate Challenge, Sierra Club Report Finds - Deceleration News","Marisol Cortez, DeeDee Belmares, Alex Ip, The Xylom, Greg Harman",,,,,https://deceleration.news/texas-utilities-failing-climate-challenge-sierra-club-report-finds/,"While 65 percent of utilities surveyed have improved their clean energy scores over the last five years, 69 percent worsened on gas and 33 percent on coal.
And the amount of new clean energy collectively planned by these utilities would replace just half of existing fossil fuel use—not accounting at all for projected demand (or “load growth,” in utilityspeak).
And so, for its efforts, CPS gets a C—a passing grade, compared to the vast majority of utilities.
One other caveat here is that the Sierra Club report grades on a generous curve.
In fact, the average score across utilities was 15—three points lower than the Sierra Club’s baseline assessment in 2021.","Sierra Club’s Beyond Coal campaign released a report this month that scores utilities across the country according to the decarbonization and renewable energy targets scientists say we must hit by 2035 to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Titled The Dirty Truth, the report evaluated 75 utilities that together account for about half of all fossil fuel-generated electricity production in the United States, including San Antonio’s CPS Energy, which scored a C—not terrible, but not great either.

The Sierra Club used three specific benchmarks to rate utilities’ progress on climate over the past five years: 1) progress toward retiring all coal-fired power generation by 2030; 2) progress toward building the renewably sourced energy required to replace fossil fuels and meet energy rising demand by 2035; and 3) whether utilities planned to build new gas plants before 2035. The first two metrics added points to a utility’s score, while the third one subtracted them.

After taking stock of the portfolios and clean energy plans for the nation’s most prominent belchers of planet-warming gases, the findings were…not great, especially amidst the Trump Administration’s gutting of federal support for renewable energy and priming demand for power use by data centers and crypto miners.

Xcel Texas wrangled a B for plans to retire the Tolk coal plant in the Panhandle ahead of schedule, while the Lower Colorado River Authority (LCRA) earned an F due to its decision to keep one of the nation’s dirtiest power plants in operation—the Fayette coal plant outside Austin—while failing to advance on renewables.

“LCRA professes a mission to enhance Texans’ quality of life while keeping open a dirty, expensive coal plant and investing almost nothing in the most affordable forms of energy,” Cyrus Reed, legislative and conservation director of the Sierra Club Lone Star Chapter, stated in a prepared release from the nonprofit.

“In fact, LCRA got one of the lowest clean energy scores in the entire United States even though reversing course would help lower bills for its city and co-op customers.”

Overall, American utilities have committed to retiring only 29 percent of the coal in their portfolios by 2030, and seem to be replacing that with new gas-fired generation more than clean energy sources like wind, solar, and battery storage, the report states. While 65 percent of utilities surveyed have improved their clean energy scores over the last five years, 69 percent worsened on gas and 33 percent on coal. And the amount of new clean energy collectively planned by these utilities would replace just half of existing fossil fuel use—not accounting at all for projected demand (or “load growth,” in utilityspeak).

Sierra Club summed up its findings as such:

“[I]nstead of correcting course, many utilities continue to stall, wasting time as projected power demand increases and the transition [from fossil fuels to clean energy] becomes more urgent. This failure has contributed to rising affordability issues, which these companies are now using as excuses to justify continued reliance on fossil fuels.”

Maybe not surprisingly, Sierra Club’s assessments turned up a significant degree of greenwashing: though 65 of 75 utilities (about 87 percent) had made some kind of climate pledge on paper, their promises were not borne out in practice, given that 60 percent of utilities scored a D or F. Conversely, the report found “a clear pattern: utilities that set ambitious, near-term goals take more action to transition to clean energy. Meanwhile, companies that delay action try to hide their lack of progress behind vague, long-term climate pledges.”

Responding to the City of San Antonio’s own Climate Action and Adaptation Plan—which sets specific and actionable targets, aiming for a 41 percent reduction of greenhouse gas emissions by 2030, a 71 percent reduction by 2040, and carbon-neutrality by 2050—CPS Energy has taken significant steps to close its dirtiest coal- and gas-fired power plants and increase the share of renewables in its portfolio, alongside conservation goals (albeit less ambitious ones than in decades prior). But CPS has also undeniably leaned heavily on gas-fired peaker plants to make up for shuttered coal and aging gas, including a buying spree on existing plants across South Texas—three last year and four just last week.

And so, for its efforts, CPS gets a C—a passing grade, compared to the vast majority of utilities.

But the devil is in the details. According to a more granular breakdown provided via an online tool, CPS scored 100 percent on its current progress toward retirement of all coal by 2030. But it scored just 30 percent in its progress toward transitioning to all-renewable energy by 2035. And though Sierra Club reports that (as of July 1, 2025), CPS has “0 megawatts” planned from new gas plants through 2035, this doesn’t seem to account for CPS’s recent acquisitions, which add 3,332 MW of gas-fired generation to its portfolio. Nor does it account for the nuclear energy in CPS’s portfolio—still projected at 10 percent in 2030—which although low-carbon during power production is hardly renewable or “clean” on the mining, refining, or disposal side.

One other caveat here is that the Sierra Club report grades on a generous curve. Unlike Texas public school students, who are required to earn at least 70 percent to pass for the semester and graduate for the year, a C in utility world means earning just 35 points out of 100. In fact, the average score across utilities was 15—three points lower than the Sierra Club’s baseline assessment in 2021.

Did anyone even get an A? the students might be heard to grumble. According to The Dirty Truth, three utilities did, though none of these were listed in the report’s appendix, where the highest grade given was a B—including Xcel Texas and Xcel New Mexico.

What we can say is that, viewed against the backdrop of national trends—building some clean energy capacity but not nearly enough to meet rising demand, turning to gas in the name of affordability—CPS appears, well, entirely average. Mid, as the kids might say.

But if there is one main takeaway from this report, it’s that a C isn’t terrible. In fact, it’s pretty good…for a utility. Which is a problem.",https://d3l0i86vhnepo5.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/24125558/dirty-truth-report-sierra-club-1024x588.png,N,,2025-09-24 17:03:05.294645

Despite vast fossil fuel subsidies distorting markets, clean energy received double the investment of fossil fuels last year.
The bottom line: clean is competitive, and climate action is imperative.
A UN report will calculate their impact for global emissions.
We need urgent action: to unlock funds for developing countries; to seize clean energy benefits and protect lives and economies.","Following are UN Secretary-General António Guterres’ remarks to the opening of the high-level special event on climate action, in New York today:

As we have just heard, it is still possible to limit global temperature rise to 1.5°C by century’s end. We know what permanently breaching that limit would mean for people and planet. The science compels climate action. So does the economics.

Clean energy is powering jobs, growth and sustainable development, generating the fastest and cheapest electricity, insulating economies from volatile fossil fuel markets, providing energy security and sovereignty, and helping to deliver clean and affordable energy for all.

Despite vast fossil fuel subsidies distorting markets, clean energy received double the investment of fossil fuels last year. The bottom line: clean is competitive, and climate action is imperative.

The Paris Agreement has made a difference. In the last 10 years, projected global temperature rise has dropped from 4°C to less than 3°C — if current nationally determined contributions are fully implemented.

Now, we need new plans for 2035 that go much further, and much faster: Delivering dramatic emissions cuts aligned with 1.5°C; covering all emissions and sectors; and accelerating a just energy transition globally.

Your new plans can take us a significant step forward. A UN report will calculate their impact for global emissions. If they fall short, we must create the conditions for a decade of acceleration. We know it can be done.

China met its 2030 wind and solar target six years ahead of schedule. India reached 50 per cent electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels five years early. We are in the dawn of a new energy era. We must seize this moment of opportunity. The thirtieth Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP30) in Brazil must conclude with a credible global response plan to get us on track.

Five areas are crucial:

First, energy. Fossil fuels still dominate. We must supercharge the clean energy transition. Investing in grids and storage to unlock the full potential of renewables. Lowering capital costs for developing countries. And redirecting fossil fuel subsidies to a just transition.

Second, methane — a potent global heating gas. Drastic cuts this decade are essential — and most can be achieved quickly and cheaply. The International Energy Agency estimates fossil fuel operations could cut 40 per cent of methane emissions today with no net cost.

Third, forests. We must end the destruction of nature’s greatest carbon sinks. This could deliver a fifth of needed emissions reductions by 2030.

Fourth, heavy industry. We have seen important advances in technologies to cut emissions from steel and cement, and heavy transport. They must be deployed urgently.

Fifth, climate justice. Developing countries that did least to cause the crisis are suffering the most. Climate disasters are inflicting damages that exceed the gross domestic product (GDP) of some small islands. Droughts and floods are taking lives, fuelling hunger and inflaming conflict. All while finance gaps prevent investments in adaptation and resilience.

We need urgent action: to unlock funds for developing countries; to seize clean energy benefits and protect lives and economies. That requires reforming the international financial architecture to strengthen developing country participation.

We need effective debt relief and scaled-up solutions like debt swaps and disaster pause clauses. We need a major increase in the lending capacity of multilateral development banks; significant contributions to the Loss and Damage Fund, including from innovative sources; and a major boost in adaptation finance — with developed countries meeting their pledge to double funding this year.

COP30 must show a credible path to mobilizing the $1.3 trillion annually in climate finance by 2035, as agreed at COP29 in Baku: Identifying sources — existing and new; outlining policies, instruments and actions to make finance accessible, affordable and at scale; and establishing credible accountability measures to verify progress.

The science demands action. The law commands it. The economics compel it. And people are calling for it. I look forward to hearing how you will respond – and the UN stands ready to help you to deliver.",https://press.un.org/themes/custom/un3_press/favicon.ico,N,,2025-09-24 17:02:45.981867

“Businesses and investors know the truth: that acting on climate is no longer about compliance or reputation management.","NEW YORK CITY: At a main stage event at Climate Week NYC, prominent thought leaders from center-right organizations and former Republican members of Congress made the case for championing efforts to protect the long-standing rights of investors and companies to consider all financial risks in decision-making. They are part of a growing chorus of bipartisan voices working to safeguard the freedom to invest responsibly.

“If investors are denied the ability to invest in what they think is best, that will significantly reduce the opportunities to make profits, to have a market that functions, to have a free market that flourishes,” said Eli Lehrer, President, R Street.

The comments came at Ceres at Climate Week, which included a full-day residency at the Nest Climate Campus on Sept. 24, bringing together investors, companies, and policymakers to explore the current challenges and opportunities in advancing climate action. The main stage event, Championing the Clean Economy: Corporate Action and Protecting the Freedom to Invest, featured former Reps. Ryan Costello (Pennsylvania), Carlos Curbelo (Florida), and Bob Inglis (South Carolina), as well as senior representatives from DEPLOY/US, Freedom to Invest, National Taxpayers Union, and R Street. It was followed by a media availability and a 45-minute public roundtable discussion.

“People should be free to make their investment decision without the heavy hand of government pushing them in one direction or another,” said Brandon Arnold, Executive Vice President, National Taxpayers Union.

“The government shouldn’t be involved in instructing companies or investment firms or individuals in what kind of risks they should take into account or what opportunities they seek when they invest,” said former Congressman Carlos Curbelo (R-FL).

Ceres CEO and President Mindy Lubber and Inherent Group’s CEO and CIO Tony Davis highlighted the ways U.S. investors and businesses are prospering in the transition to an advanced, more resilient economy, spotlighting clean energy investment trends, including the prediction that clean investment globally is expected to reach $2.2 trillion by the end of 2025. “Last year’s 90 percent-plus of all new energy generation was renewables, and why is that? Because it is better technology. They are cheaper and they also provide energy security,” said Davis.

Ceres at Climate Week comes as the U.S. administration moves to undo federal environmental policies aimed at reducing climate pollution and rolls back federal incentives that have bolstered clean energy innovation and job growth. It also comes as frequent and costly extreme weather events continue. Such events cost the U.S. a record $182.7 billion in damages in 2024 and have already cost $93 billion in damages in the first half of 2025.

At the same time, recent analyses show sustained momentum in clean economy investing and corporate climate action. 92% of 500 chief financial officers surveyed said they expect to invest more in sustainability this year, with more than half significantly increasing their investments. An analysis of 6500 companies found 84% are standing by their goals to cut carbon pollution, with 37% increasing their ambitions. And 70% of 74 large asset owners surveyed now integrate responsible investment goals into their strategies, an increase from the previous year.

As Lubber noted in her opening remarks, investors and businesses continue to address climate and sustainability risks because these risks are financial issues.

“Businesses and investors know the truth: that acting on climate is no longer about compliance or reputation management. It’s about profit and resilience. It’s about materiality and not just morality. It is about jobs and the economy and building a clean energy revolution.”

Ceres called for increased business and government action to reduce climate pollution driving extreme weather, double down on prudent financial risk management and clean energy investments, maintain policies that ensure clean air and build a cleaner economy, and protect core investment and business freedoms.

The agreement supports development of UK nuclear construction skills and domestic supply chain capabilities while positioning the UK to participate in future global export opportunities.
Amentum: 3,000 UK Nuclear Jobs and Waste Management U.S. engineering company Amentum announced Sept. 18 plans to create 3,000 new jobs over four years in UK nuclear power and defense, representing a 50% increase in its UK headcount.
The comprehensive agreement covers artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and civil nuclear energy cooperation, with Microsoft leading a $30 billion investment commitment—its largest outside the U.S..","The most significant week in transatlantic nuclear cooperation since the 1950s atomic partnership unfolded Sept. 14–24, 2025, as a coordinated surge of commercial agreements—totaling over $100 billion—spanned advanced reactor deployments, advanced nuclear fuel supply chains, nuclear waste management, maritime nuclear applications, engineering services, and regulatory harmonization.

Formalized under the Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy signed Sept. 15, the announcements seek to align U.S. energy-dominance priorities with the UK’s nuclear ambitions as both countries seek to end reliance on Russian nuclear material and cut reactor licensing timelines from three to four years to roughly two.

The orchestrated wave around U.S. President Donald Trump’s Sept. 16–18 state visit to the UK demonstrates how rapidly the nuclear industry can pivot when regulatory barriers fall and government policies align with private capital. While Trump claimed $350 billion in bilateral deals across all sectors during the visit, the nuclear tranche alone opens the path for both countries to capture surging demand from AI-driven data centers and industrial decarbonization while cementing Western-controlled supply chains for next-generation reactors.

In London, UK Energy Secretary Ed Miliband called it the coordinated wave, the start of “a golden age of nuclear,” saying: “We’re kickstarting a golden age of nuclear in this country, joining forces with the U.S. to turbocharge new nuclear developments and secure the technologies of the future.” U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright matched that tone, noting that “today’s commercial deals set up a framework to unleash commercial access in both the U.S. and UK, enhancing global energy security, strengthening U.S. energy dominance, and securing nuclear supply chains across the Atlantic.”

Before the Surge: Life Extensions, Supply Chain Strengthening, and First U.S. Fuel Contract

Even before the fortnight of massive nuclear deals kicked off, momentum was building across the Atlantic nuclear partnership. EDF Energy on Sept. 1 announced 12-month life extensions for Heysham 1 and Hartlepool nuclear power stations until March 2028 to add about 3 TWh of generation to reduce imported gas dependence. On Sept. 3, Westinghouse formalized memorandums of understanding with six British suppliers—William Cook Cast Products, Trillium Flow Technology, Curtiss-Wright Controls (UK), Boccard UK, Bendalls Engineering, and Sheffield Forgemasters—to supply key reactor components including valves, pumps, actuators, mechanical electrical piping and instrument modules, pressure vessels, tanks, heat exchangers, and cast and forged steel components for AP1000 and AP300 projects in the UK and internationally. As significantly, U.S. startup Aalo Atomics revealed on Sept. 9 that it had quietly signed in July 2025 the first commercial contract by any U.S. advanced reactor company for enriched uranium delivery from UK-headquartered Urenco.

Centrica/X-energy: Hartlepool AMR Deployment and 6 GW Fleet Ambition

On Sept. 15—a Sunday—UK energy giant Centrica and U.S. advanced reactor developer X-energy announced a Joint Development Agreement to deploy up to 12 Xe-100 Advanced Modular Reactors at the EDF and Centrica Hartlepool site, totaling 960 MW of new capacity. The project would replace the current nuclear station, which is scheduled to retire in 2028, and provide both clean electricity and high-temperature process heat for Teesside’s critical industries. The agreement also sets an ambition for as much as 6 GW of advanced reactors across the UK—marking the largest announced AMR fleet to date. (Read POWER’s in-depth report about this project in POWERnews on Sept. 24).

Beyond headline power figures, the deployment addresses grid reliability and decarbonization needs for industrial loads that cannot depend solely on electrification. The UK Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) previously identified high-temperature gas-cooled reactors as the top advanced nuclear technology for demonstration, and the Xe-100 is designed to serve industrial clusters and regional utilities.

Centrica is set to provide initial project funding. Full-scale activities are targeted to launch in 2026, and first power is planned for the mid-2030s. The Hartlepool site already carries a new nuclear designation under the UK government’s National Policy Statement, supporting a clear regulatory path. Centrica and X-energy are in negotiations with equity partners and top-tier engineering firms to expand deployment across England, Wales, and Scotland.

Holtec, EDF UK Mull SMR-300 at Cottam Site

U.S. SMR developer Holtec International, EDF UK, and real estate partner Tritax on Sept. 14 announced an MOU to develop Holtec’s SMR-300 small modular reactors at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire. The project will provide clean power to new advanced data centers on the 900-acre site to leverage existing grid connections and infrastructure to reduce development costs and timelines.

The arrangement transforms a historic “Megawatt Valley” site into a clean energy and AI hub, with the 1 GW data center project targeted for this decade and SMRs operational in the early 2030s, the company said. The UK project will benefit from lessons learned to reduce risk and accelerate progress as a second-of-a-kind deployment (following Holtec’s SMR-300 at Palisades, Michigan). Holtec’s Dr. Rick Springman noted the project “represents a potential $15 billion project, creating thousands of local jobs while drawing on the lessons from our Palisades project.”

The project includes foreign direct investment in Framatome’s nuclear fuel fabrication and services and Arabelle Solutions’ turbine manufacture. Great British Energy—Nuclear and the National Wealth Fund are conducting feasibility studies and early-stage investment discussions.

Last Energy/DP World: £80M Port-Centric Microreactor at London Gateway

Washington, D.C.-based Last Energy and global logistics leader DP World on Sept. 15 signed a memorandum of understanding to develop the world’s first port-centric micro-nuclear power plant at London Gateway logistics hub, backed by £80 million in subsidy-free private investment. The proposed PWR-20 microreactor will supply 20 MWe of electricity to power DP World’s ongoing £1 billion expansion of the Thames Freeport facility, with surplus exported to the grid and operations targeted for 2030.

London Gateway links cargo to over 130 ports in more than 65 countries and handles more than 50% of the UK’s deep-sea temperature-controlled imports, making it strategically critical for UK trade resilience. The facility’s expansion will add two new all-electric berths and a second rail terminal, positioning it to become the country’s busiest container port within five years.

Last Energy’s PWR-20 design successfully completed a Preliminary Design Review conducted by the UK’s Office for Nuclear Regulation, Environment Agency, and Natural Resources Wales in July 2025—the first nuclear developer to achieve this milestone in the UK. The fully modular microreactor uses proven pressurized water reactor technology designed for flexible siting, plug-and-play installation, and rapid scalability within a 24-month delivery timeline. Last Energy plans to own and operate the power plant on-site, eliminating customer capital requirements while providing long-term power purchase agreements.

TerraPower/ KBR: Natrium Reactor Studies

U.S. advanced nuclear technology company TerraPower and engineering firm KBR agreed on Sept. 14 to cooperate in seeking potential deployment of TerraPower’s Natrium reactor in the UK. The collaboration will involve joint studies and site evaluations for the 345-megawatt sodium fast reactor with molten salt-based energy storage system, capable of boosting capacity to 500 MW.

KBR President Jay Ibrahim noted: “Expanding our collaboration with TerraPower to the United Kingdom marks a significant milestone in advancing clean, reliable energy solutions globally.” Each Natrium reactor is projected to create 1,600 construction jobs and 250 permanent full-time positions, building on the companies’ preexisting alliance formed in March for deploying Natrium plants across North America, UK, Europe and beyond.

The agreement supports development of UK nuclear construction skills and domestic supply chain capabilities while positioning the UK to participate in future global export opportunities.

Amentum: 3,000 UK Nuclear Jobs and Waste Management

U.S. engineering company Amentum announced Sept. 18 plans to create 3,000 new jobs over four years in UK nuclear power and defense, representing a 50% increase in its UK headcount. The $203 million investment builds on Amentum’s role as lead delivery partner for Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C nuclear power stations and provider of technical solutions for small modular reactors and fusion research.

Separately, Amentum was appointed Sept. 15 as the only company to win positions in all four lots of Nuclear Waste Services’ Integrated Waste Management Specialist Nuclear Services Framework, valued at £26 million over four years. Amentum Energy & Environment President Mark Whitney emphasized the company will “provide critical specialist capabilities and solutions to enable NWS in ensuring safe and secure management of the UK’s radioactive waste.”

Amentum CEO John Heller, who met with Trump and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer at Chequers, stated: “The energy resilience and national security of both nations depend on continued leadership and advances in energy and technology.”

Rolls-Royce SMR: U.S. Regulatory Engagement

UK SMR developer Rolls-Royce SMR confirmed Sept. 14 that it entered the U.S. regulatory process by submitting an engagement plan to the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in April 2025. The move paves the way for potential deployment of the 470 MW SMR design in the U.S. market, leveraging regulatory harmonization provisions in the new UK-U.S. cooperation agreement.

The regulatory engagement follows Rolls-Royce SMR’s selection in June as the chosen technology in Great British Nuclear’s SMR competition, which positions it to build the UK’s next generation of nuclear power stations. The company is 18 months ahead of competitors in European regulatory processes and has progressed to Step 3 of the UK’s Generic Design Assessment. The U.S. engagement enables potential licensing pathway acceleration through shared regulatory reviews, supporting the bilateral goal of reducing licensing timeframes from 3-4 years to approximately two years.

BWXT: $1.5 Billion Defense Fuels Contract

BWX Technologies announced on Sept. 16 a $1.5 billion contract from the U.S. National Nuclear Security Administration to build the Domestic Uranium Enrichment Centrifuge Experiment (DUECE) pilot plant in Tennessee. While primarily focused on U.S. defense needs, the contract supports domestic uranium enrichment capabilities that strengthen Western fuel supply chains amid efforts to eliminate Russian nuclear dependencies by 2028.

The pilot plant will demonstrate low-enriched uranium production for NNSA defense missions before being repurposed for highly enriched uranium for naval propulsion. BWXT President Rex Geveden noted: “Once operational, both facilities will enable us to scale manufacturing, so the United States maintains sovereign capability to produce vital nuclear materials for national security.”

A Big Boost for Regulatory and Policy Collaboration

The Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, signed Sept. 15, formalizes a renewed and expanded MOU between the U.S. NRC, the U.K. Office for Nuclear Regulation, and the Environment Agency of England. It builds on a collaboration that dates to 1975.

Under the refreshed agreement made public on Sept. 18, regulators will share technical reviews and mutually recognize each other’s safety assessments, and work to target reactor design approvals within 24 months and site licensing decisions within 12 months by leveraging completed work and avoiding duplication. The regulators will also coordinate fusion energy programs—employing AI-enabled simulation tools—and co-host a Global Fusion Energy Policy Summit in the United States in 2026 to deepen transatlantic cooperation.

The cooperation extends to site licensing workload sharing and fusion energy collaboration through coordinated experimental programmes combining British and American expertise with AI technology for advanced simulation tools. A Global Fusion Energy Policy Summit will be co-hosted in the United States in 2026 to strengthen international cooperation.

Broader Technology Prosperity Deal

The nuclear agreements form part of the broader UK-U.S. Tech Prosperity Deal signed Sept. 18, encompassing $42 billion in UK investments from major U.S. technology companies. The comprehensive agreement covers artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and civil nuclear energy cooperation, with Microsoft leading a $30 billion investment commitment—its largest outside the U.S..

The framework seeks to position both countries to capture AI-driven energy demand while establishing resilient supply chains for critical technologies and advanced nuclear fuels, bypassing hostile actors and improving energy security for both nations and their allies.",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nuclearcoolingtowerssunset_power_web1.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 16:01:08.719526

Part 98, and suspend reporting requirements for the remainder of the program until 2034. The proposal is in response to President Donald Trump's Executive Orders (EOs) 14154, ""Unleashing American Energy,"" and 14192, ""Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,"" and a continuation of the EPA's deregulatory initiative. (See Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""EPA Announces Deregulatory Initiative to ""Power the Great American Comeback,"" March 17, 2025.)

Since its enactment in 2009, and commencing in 2011, the GHGRP has required certain large greenhouse gas (GHG) emission sources, including fuel and industrial gas suppliers and carbon dioxide (CO2) injection sites, to report emissions data in a standardized way. The GHGRP data has been used in a number of areas, including in legal, tax and investment evaluation. The standardized data was seen as useful for many stakeholders but has been described as burdensome and unnecessary by the current leadership at the EPA in light of the continuing mandatory information submissions already required by the Clean Air Act (CAA). In its reasons for the repeal of the significant portions of the GHGRP, the EPA also notes that the program, in its current form, exceeds the authority included in the CAA and, otherwise, the agency action lies within the discretion of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin.

What Is the GHGRP?

The EPA developed the GHGRP in the wake of a 2008 congressional appropriations directive (P.L. 110-161), which provided $3.5 million for the EPA to issue a rule requiring ""mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas emissions above appropriate thresholds in all sectors of the economy of the United States.""

When the EPA created the GHGRP in December 2009, it relied on its information-gathering authority under Section 114 of the CAA. This provision allows the EPA to require entities to submit reports containing ""information necessary"" either 1) to develop certain types of regulations under the CAA or 2) to assess compliance with existing requirements.

The current GHGRP requires annual reporting of GHG emissions from facilities that directly emit GHGs, as well as from suppliers of fossil fuels and ""industrial GHGs"" such as hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). It also applies to CO2 injection sites used for enhanced oil recovery or geologic sequestration. Generally speaking, facilities must report if they emit 25,000 metric tons or more of CO2 equivalent per year. Currently, more than 8,000 entities report under the GHGRP.

Although the GHGRP does not itself impose emissions limitations or other regulatory restrictions, the data collected by the regulation has been utilized in a number of data regulatory and nonregulatory ways. On notable example lies in Subpart W of the GHGRP – which governs methane emissions reporting from petroleum and natural gas systems – which was referenced in Section 136 of the CAA, enacted via the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022. This provision established a ""methane emissions and waste reduction incentive program,"" including a statutory ""Waste Emission Charge,"" or WEC, applicable to certain facilities. See 42 U.S.C. § 7436(c). The legal and practical status of the WEC has since become significantly complicated.1

EPA Proposal

Under the proposed rule, the EPA would eliminate GHG reporting requirements for 46 of the 47 source categories currently covered by the GHGRP, the sole exception from the proposed source categories being petroleum and natural gas systems, as set forth in Subpart W. Within Subpart W, the EPA proposes to repeal reporting requirements for the ""natural gas distribution"" segment – the only segment not referenced in Section 136 of the CAA regarding the WEC. See 42 U.S.C. § 7436(d)(1)–(9).

The other eight segments in the Subpart W source category are unique because, as the EPA states in the proposal, reporting for them ""is specifically required under CAA section 136"" for the WEC.2 For those segments, the EPA would suspend all reporting obligations until 2034 because the WEC has been postponed to 2034,3 and thus reporting ""is not needed"" until that date.4

Otherwise, for the repeal of all other GHGRP reporting requirements, the EPA offers two alternative justifications. First, the EPA proposes to conclude that CAA Section 114 does not authorize the GHGRP because the reporting requirements do not appropriately serve the CAA's rulemaking or enforcement purposes. Alternatively, the EPA proposes that if the GHGRP is permissible, the EPA Administrator has the discretionary to rescind the program if he determines that it is not necessary to implement the CAA.

Implications

This proposal is aligned with recent deregulatory actions taken by the EPA, particularly with respect to GHG emissions. (See Holland and Knight's previous alerts, ""Up in the Air: EPA Opens Comment on Repealing Endangerment Finding, Motor Vehicle GHG Rules,"" Aug. 7, 2025, and ""EPA Launches Comment Period on Power Plant Climate and Air Toxics Rules,"" June 20, 2025.). The proposal also appears to align with President Trump's EOs on the subject.

State-Level Action

While most federal GHG reporting faces potential revision or elimination, several states have established or are currently developing GHG reporting programs of their own. For example, New York has proposed a GHG reporting program with reporting obligations that would begin in June 2027.

In terms of existing programs, the California Regulation for the Mandatory Reporting of Greenhouse Gas Emissions (California MRR) first went into effect in 2009. The data collected through the California MRR are used in California's cap-and-trade program and made publicly available annually through the state's GHG inventory. The California MRR generally requires reporting of certain third-party-verified emissions of CO2, nitrous oxide and methane at the facility level. Entities covered by the California MRR include producers of those electricity, cement, lime or nitric acid – as well as petroleum refining and CO2 sequestration, regardless of volume of emissions. In addition, facilities in certain other industries, including fuel suppliers, CO2 suppliers, and importers and exporters of CO2, must report if their annual emissions exceed 10,000 metric tons (MT) CO2 equivalent. More recently, additional reporting requirements have been established by California Senate Bill 253 (2023).

Similarly, the state of Washington's GHGRP went into effect in 2012. The data collected through the Washington GHGRP are used in Washington's cap-and-invest program and made publicly available through the Washington State GHG Inventory. Reporting under the Washington GHGRP is at the facility level, and the program applies to facilities that emit at least 10,000 MT CO2 equivalent annually, as well as fuel suppliers that produce, import or deliver products contributing 10,000 MT CO2 equivalent per year within Washington state and power entities that import or deliver electricity with emissions equivalent to 10,000 MT CO2 equivalent annually.

If the EPA's proposal becomes final, other state and local governments may feel pressure to develop their own programs that would mimic the data gathering requirements of the GHGRP.

Climate Science

The EPA's proposed rule brings to the center stage key questions about the underlying climate science and whether the agency has clear authority to regulate what it describes as a global environmental concern. When the EPA unveiled the proposed rule, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) produced at the same time a report, ""A Critical Review of Impacts of Greenhouse Gas Emissions on the U.S. Climate,"" prepared by the Climate Working Group.

The DOE report asserted that the science behind the endangerment finding was overstated and relied on overly sensitive models. The DOE report has subsequently been criticized because of DOE's failure to convene the Climate Working Group pursuant to the Federal Advisory Committee Act (FACA), 5 U.S.C. chapter 10. Studies conducted pursuant to FACA are subject to requirements of transparency, membership balance and open meetings. EPA has also asserted that there is no clear congressional authorization for it to regulate GHG, thereby raising the major questions doctrine. EPA also contends that GHG only impact public health and welfare indirectly.

Greenwashing

The proposed elimination of most GHGRP requirements could complicate the growing field of ""greenwashing"" litigation, in which companies are accused of misleading consumers with environmental marketing claims. If the EPA proposal becomes final in its current form, companies defending their environmental record could face a mixed result. On the one hand, where corporate marketing claims align with a company's reported data under a standardized federal program, the company can point to such alignment in defense of the reasonableness of its claims. On the other hand, standardized public reporting requirements rely on simplified assumptions that may not reflect more nuanced methodologies that companies use when formulating voluntary claims.

Tax

The EPA proposal acknowledges that the GHGRP is somewhat intertwined with several energy tax credits For example, the carbon capture and storage (CCS) tax credit under Internal Revenue Code Section 45Q requires ""secure geological storage"" of CO2 (other than for utilization) to be eligible for the credit. Section 45Q statutorily directs the Treasury Secretary to establish regulations for determining adequate security measures, in consultation with the EPA Ad ministrator, among others. Current Treasury Department and IRS regulations effectuate that rulemaking by cross-referencing, for secure geological storage, EPA's 40 CFR Part 98 subpart RR and other parts of the Section 45Q regulations and direct taxpayers to consider, for utilization, Table A-1 of subpart A. The EPA's proposal recognizes that the Treasury Department and IRS ""may need to revise"" their regulations if the GHGRP is rescinded.

Impact Investing Metrics

If the EPA finalizes the proposed rule, investors that utilize GHGRP emissions data to assess an entity's climate risk, progress toward net-zero goals and other environmental-related investment considerations will need to identify or develop alternative emission data, including attempting to require companies to self report emission data in a standardized manner. If finalized, the proposed rule may produce opportunities for third-party verifying companies to develop voluntary programs that replicate the GHGRP and could serve as a substitute source of data for impact investment purposes.

Conclusion

The EPA's proposed rescission of the GHGRP would serve as a significant deregulatory action. Stakeholders and parties impacted by the proposed rule should participate in the public comment process, which closes on Nov. 3, 2025. For guidance and assistance with engaging in the public comment process, please contact the authors.

Notes

1 In November 2024, the EPA finalized a rule implementing the WEC. However, in March 2025, Congress passed and President Trump signed a joint resolution of disapproval under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), invalidating the EPA's WEC rule. As a result, the rule no longer has any legal effect, and the EPA formally removed the WEC regulations from the books in May 2025. Importantly, the CRA prohibits the EPA from issuing a new rule that is ""substantially the same"" unless specifically authorized by Congress. While the statutory requirement for the WEC remains in place, the absence of an implementing rule has effectively stalled its enforcement. Further complicating the legal status, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law on July 4, 2025, postponed the effective date of the WEC until 2034. (See Holland & Knight previous alert, ""Senate GOP Passes Sweeping One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" July 1, 2025.)

The Justice Dept. is siding with Enbridge's contentions that Michigan's attempts to revoke its Line 5 easement interfere with federal regulation of pipelines, and U.S.-Canadian treaties.

President Donald Trump's Justice Department has intervened — and taken the side of Canadian oil and gas transport giant Enbridge — in Enbridge's federal lawsuit attempting to stop Gov. Gretchen Whitmer from revoking the company's 72-year-old easement to operate the Line 5 underwater oil and gas pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac lake bottom.

The U.S. Justice Department's Environment and Natural Resources Division and Civil Division announced its filing of a ""statement of interest"" in a lawsuit filed by Enbridge against Whitmer and Michigan Department of Natural Resources Director Scott Bowen in U.S. District Court in Lansing.

The Justice Department is agreeing with Enbridge's assertion in the suit that the Michigan action improperly attempts to override federal authority on interstate pipeline regulation, and federal foreign affairs authority as the pipeline from Alberta, Canada, is subject to U.S.-Canadian treaties.

""The federal government already comprehensively regulates pipeline safety, but Michigan is trying to usurp the Department of Transportation's statutory authority,"" Acting Assistant Attorney General Adam Gustafson said in a statement.

""President Trump has made clear that the United States will not tolerate state overreach that interferes with American energy dominance.""

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel's Office did not immediately respond to a Free Press request for comment.

Enbridge spokesman Michael Barnes, in an emailed statement to the Free Press, noted the 1977 Transit Pipelines Treaty between the United States and Canada ""expressly prevents public authorities such as the State of Michigan and courts from unilaterally shutting down the pipeline.""

""We will continue to protect and defend Line 5's continued operations consistent with federal law, interstate commerce, and international treaty agreements, all of which recognize the critical role Line 5 plays in providing for the region's energy needs and its economic strength,"" he said.

Built in 1953, Enbridge's Line 5 moves 23 million gallons of oil and natural gas liquids per day east through the Upper Peninsula, splitting into twin underwater pipelines on the Straits of Mackinac bottom, before returning to a single transmission pipeline through the Lower Peninsula that runs south to Sarnia, Ontario. Many have expressed concern about the aging pipes over several years, as anchor strikes, missing pipeline supports and loss of protective pipeline coating have been discovered.

A 30-inch oil transmission line also owned by Enbridge ruptured in July 2010 in Marshall, spilling more than 1.1 million gallons of oil, fouling 38 miles of the Kalamazoo River and prompting a cleanup that took four years and more than $1 billion. Many fear a similar pipeline mishap on the Straits bottom, where Great Lakes Michigan and Huron meet, would be greatly more devastating.

Whitmer in November 2020 announced her intention to revoke Enbridge's 1953 easement with the state to use state-controlled Great Lakes bottomlands for the Straits pipeline. Whitmer's office at the time cited Enbridge's ""persistent and incurable violations of the easement’s terms and conditions"" related to safety and maintenance.

""Enbridge has routinely refused to take action to protect our Great Lakes and the millions of Americans who depend on them for clean drinking water and good jobs,"" Whitmer said at the time. ""They have repeatedly violated the terms of the 1953 easement by ignoring structural problems that put our Great Lakes and our families at risk.""

Enbridge officials have countered that the Line 5 pipeline in the Straits has always remained safe and cite recurring inspections by the federal Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration, or PHMSA, affirming its contention.

In its filing, the Justice Department notes that the federal government took ""decisive action"" in three environmental events described in Whitmer's notice to revoke the Enbridge easement, including an April 2018 anchor strike that dented the outer Straits pipelines and the discovery of significant damage to a pipeline support in June 2020. Following the 2018 anchor strike, Congress amended federal pipeline safety laws, and PHMSA issued an interim final rule to protect the Great Lakes and connecting waters, the Justice Department's filing states.

""By revisiting these same incidents to impose different standards and different results, Michigan is not only thwarting Congressional intent to promote a nationally uniform safety program but also is creating an unworkable patchwork of state standards for interim pipelines,"" the Justice Department states in its court filing.

The Justice Department filing also declares the Michigan action infringes upon ""significant interests of the United States in its conduct of foreign affairs,"" adding the United States has a significant interest in an ""affordable and reliable domestic supply of energy"" that the state easement revocation attempt threatens.

Enbridge proposes to build a 21-foot diameter, 3.6-mile tunnel underneath the bed of the Straits of Mackinac to house a new, 30-inch diameter pipeline to move the oil and natural gas liquids. The tunnel pipeline would replace the twin pipes currently on the Straits bottom.

Michigan Supreme Court allows tribes to appeal MPSC approval of Line 5 tunnel

In other litigation related to Line 5, on Friday, Sept. 19, the Michigan Supreme Court granted an appeal by multiple Michigan Native American tribes and nonprofit environmental groups to challenge the Michigan Public Service Commission's approval of the Line 5 tunnel.

The Supreme Court is allowing a review of whether the state Court of Appeals erred in providing weight to earlier lower court rulings rather than considering on its own whether the proposed tunnel ""will pollute, impair, or destroy the air, water or state's other natural resources or the public trust in these resources."" The high court will also consider whether the MPSC should have excluded ""evidence of the history and risk of oil spills along the entire length of Line 5"" as it approved the tunnel.

“The tunnel project and the dual pipelines are just two versions of one terrible idea that threatens to destroy our clean water, our fishing, and our way of life for the sake of Canadian profits,” said Bay Mills Indian Community President Whitney Gravelle. “Our choice is not between the dual pipelines and the tunnel. Our choice is between an oil spill in the Great Lakes and a clean water future for our children and grandchildren to enjoy.

SACRAMENTO — Today, Governor Gavin Newsom announced that there are now 201,180 fully public and shared electric vehicle (EV) charging ports. This is 68% more EV charger ports than the number of gasoline nozzles statewide, according to the California Energy Commission (CEC).

California’s growing number of publicly available EV chargers can be found at locations that are fully publicly accessible, like grocery stores, park and ride lots, and even gas stations, whereas shared chargers can be found at apartment complexes, workplaces, doctors’ offices, sports facilities, and other parking areas that may have some level of restricted access. This statewide network of public and shared chargers is in addition to the estimated 800,000 EV chargers installed in single-family homes.

“With this expanding public network, EV chargers are becoming ubiquitous in California,” said CEC Commissioner Nancy Skinner. “Our goal is to make driving an EV a no-brainer choice for Californians. They are fun to drive, never need an oil change, don’t cause smog, and it’s getting easier to charge your vehicle with public EV infrastructure.”

It has never been a better time to buy and drive an EV in California. Federal incentives of up to $7,500 are still available through the end of September, and thanks to the state’s ever-expanding charger network, 94% of Californians live within 10 minutes of an EV charger.

The majority of California’s public chargers are Level 2, which will provide 25-35 miles of range in about an hour of charging. A growing number are direct current fast chargers (DCFC), which charge EVs much faster, providing almost a full charge in 15 to 45 minutes. Since the CEC’s last count, DCFC public and shared charging ports are up 14% and Level 2 charging ports are up 25%.

FEDERAL ZEV INCENTIVES END SEPTEMBER 30

With federal incentives ending on Sept. 30, 2025, the time to buy a zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) is now. Tax credits up to $7,500(link is external) are available for purchase or lease of eligible new ZEVs, which include EVs and hydrogen-fueled vehicles, and up to $4,000 for eligible used ones. Federal incentives for at-home charging and associated battery storage are also available, up to $1,000. Find the right vehicle for you at ElectricForAll.org(link is external).

CALIFORNIA IS CHARGING AHEAD

Each day, more chargers come online in the Golden State, improving the driving experience for EV drivers.

California state agencies are working hard to speed up EV charger installation and plan for increasing grid demand. This includes:

Providing grant funds that support publicly accessible, workplace and at-home EV charging installations, including in multi-family complexes.

Prioritizing shovel-ready DCFC charging installations for the funding incentives available through the CEC’s grant solicitation programs.

Developing the ZEV Infrastructure Plan, which provides critical guidance for meeting California’s zero-emission transportation goals.

Establishing EV charger reliability standards.

State agencies recently published a report(link is external) in response to Governor Gavin Newsom’s executive order reaffirming the state’s commitment to ZEV adoption. While the federal government is running away from ZEVs, California is charging ahead in the fight for clean air for all.

California is tearing down barriers to ZEV adoption and providing financial and other assistance to speed up EV charger deployment, including in low-income areas and rural communities.

MAKING PROGRESS IN THE MEDIUM- AND HEAVY-DUTY SECTOR

The CEC also announced today that there are 20,093 charging and hydrogen fueling points for medium- and heavy-duty (MDHD) zero-emission vehicle (ZEV) vehicles across the state. This is an increase of 3,766 (23%) since the last update in February 2025.

While trucks total just six percent of vehicles on California’s roads, they account for over 35 percent of the state’s transportation emissions and a quarter of the state’s on-road greenhouse gases. Investments in MDHD ZEV stations and infrastructure will result in cleaner air and fewer cases of asthma near major transportation corridors.

Deploying MDHD ZEVs and infrastructure as quickly as possible will benefit all Californians today and for future generations.

The study, published in Cell Reports Sustainability on Sept. 16, indicates that reinforcing the nation’s power grid to handle increased electricity demand could cost between $350 billion and $800 billion nationwide. This would translate to several thousand dollars per household.

Kevin Kircher, a mechanical engineering professor at Purdue and a faculty member of the university’s Ray W. Herrick Laboratories, discussed the challenges and potential solutions during an interview aired on Tuesday night’s “UnPHILtered” with Phil Sanchez on News 8 at 11 p.m. Kircher highlighted the need for efficient equipment and coordinated device operation to reduce costs.

Kircher said that the U.S. electricity grid has become cleaner over the past 10 to 15 years with the adoption of renewable energy sources like wind and solar power. This cleaner electricity, combined with competitive electric machines such as vehicles and heat pumps, supports the “electrify everything” movement. The movement aims to replace fossil-fueled equipment with electric alternatives, offering benefits for public health, air quality, and climate change. However, the transition poses significant challenges for the power grid.

Kircher said rebuilding the grid to accommodate increased demand could be costly, but alternatives exist. Those include deploying more efficient equipment, improving home insulation, and coordinating the operation of electric devices.

NEW YORK (AP) — Some countries’ leaders are watching rising seas threaten to swallow their homes. Others are watching their citizens die in floods, hurricanes and heat waves, all exacerbated by climate change.

But the world U.S. President Donald Trump described in his speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday didn’t match the one many world leaders in the audience are contending with. Nor did it align with what scientists have long been observing.

“This ‘climate change,’ it’s the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world, in my opinion,” Trump said. “All of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people that have cost their countries fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success. If you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”

Trump has long been a critic of climate science and polices aimed at helping the world transition to green energies like wind and solar. His speech Tuesday, however, was one of his most expansive to date. It included false statements and making connections between things that are not connected.

Ilana Seid, an ambassador from the island nation of Palau and head of the organization of small island states, was in the audience. She said it’s what they’ve come to expect from Trump and the United States. She added that not acting on climate change will “be a betrayal of the most vulnerable,” a sentiment echoed by Evans Davie Njewa of Malawi, who said that “we are endangering the lives of innocent people in the world.”

For Adelle Thomas, a climate scientist who has published more than 40 studies and has a doctorate, climate change disasters are personal, too. A vice chair of the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, the world’s top body on climate science, Thomas is from the Bahamas and said she experienced firsthand “the devastation of the climate disaster” when Hurricane Sandy hit the Caribbean and New York City, the city Trump was speaking from, in 2012.

“Millions of people around the world can already testify to the devastation that climate change has brought to their lives,” she said. ‘The evidence is not abstract. It is lived, it is deadly, and it demands urgent action.”

A look at some of Trump’s statements Tuesday, the science behind them and the reaction.

On renewable energy

WHAT HE SAID: Trump called renewable sources of energy like wind power a “joke” and “pathetic,” falsely claiming they don’t work, are too expensive and too weak.

THE BACKSTORY: Solar and wind are now “almost always” the least expensive and the fastest options for new electricity generation, according to a July report from the United Nations. That report also said the world has passed a “positive tipping point” where those energy sources will only continue to become more widespread.

The three cheapest electricity sources globally last year were onshore wind, solar panels and new hydropower, according to an energy cost report by the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA).

Subsidies endorsed by Trump and the Republican party are artificially keeping fossil fuels viable, said University of Pennsylvania climate scientist Michael Mann. “If one were truly in favor of the ‘free market’ to determine this, then fossil fuels would be disappearing even faster,” he wrote in an email.

Relatedly, Trump falsely claimed European electricity bills are now “two to three times higher than the United States, and our bills are coming way down.” But in fact retail electricity prices in the United States have increased faster than the rate of inflation since 2022, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration. The agency expects prices to continue increasing through 2026.

On the international politics of climate, the UN and the Paris Accord

WHAT HE SAID: Trump blasted the U.N.’s climate efforts, saying he withdrew America from the “fake” Paris climate accord because “America was paying so much more than every country, others weren’t paying.”

THE BACKSTORY: The Paris Agreement, decided by international consensus in 2015, is a voluntary but binding document in which each country is asked to set its own national goal to curb planet-warming emissions and decide how much money it will contribute to the countries that will be hit hardest by climate change.

Because carbon dioxide stays in the atmosphere for more than a century, the United States has put out more of the heat trapping gas than any other nation, even though China now is the No. 1 carbon polluter. Since 1850, the U.S. has contributed 24% of the human-caused carbon dioxide that’s in the air, according to Global Carbon Project data. The entire continent of Africa, with four times the population of the U.S., is responsible for about 3%.

On coal being referred to as clean

WHAT HE SAID: “I have a little standing order in the White House. Never use the word ‘coal.’ Only use the words ‘clean, beautiful coal.’ Sounds much better, doesn’t it?”

THE BACKSTORY: Coal kills millions of people a year. “The president can pretend coal is clean, but real people — mothers, fathers, sons, and daughters— will die for this lie,’’ said Stanford University climate scientist Rob Jackson..

Trump also called the carbon footprint “a hoax made up by people with evil intentions,” a contention that Texas A&M University climate scientist Andrew Dessler agreed with. Dessler said the term was coined by oiil companies and may have been designed to shift the responsibility for combatting climate change away from corporations to individuals.

The science of climate change started 169 years ago when Eunice Foote did simple experiments with flasks and sunlight showing that carbon dioxide trapped more heat than the regular atmosphere. It’s an experiment that can be repeated at home and has been done in labs hundreds of times and in greenhouses around the world every day. It is basic physics and chemistry with a long history.

“It is unequivocal that human influence has warmed the atmosphere, ocean and land,” reported the United Nation’s Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, which is hundreds of scientists, with doctorates in the field.

In 2018, Trump’s own government said: “The impacts of global climate change are already being felt in the United States and are projected to intensify in the future.”

On cows and methane

WHAT HE SAID: In “the United States, we have still radicalized environmentalists and they want the factories to stop. Everything should stop. No more cows. We don’t want cows anymore.”

THE BACKSTORY: Cows belch methane, a powerful greenhouse gas. Around the world, cattle are often raised on lands where forests have cut down. Since forests capture carbon dioxide, cutting them to raise cattle results in a doublt whammy. Still, no one is suggesting that cows be gotten rid of, said Nusa Urbancic, CEO of the Changing Markets Foundation.

“This polarizing and divisive language misrepresents the environmental message,” Urbancic wrote. “What is true, however, is that cutting methane emissions is a quick win to slow global heating and meet climate targets.”

Trump also blamed dirty air blowing in from afar, floating garbage in the ocean coming from other countries and “radicalized environmentalists.”

Although the United States does indeed now have cleaner air than it has in decades, the pollution seeping into communities is primarily caused by local dirty energy and industry projects, not by other countries. And many experts have said the biggest blow to local air and water quality is the Trump administration’s own wide-ranging rollbacks to the power of the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and other bedrock environmental laws.

“It is sad to see marine debris, a globally important issue, being misrepresented so completely,” said Lucy Woodall, an associate professor of marine conservation and policy at the University of Exeter.

In Louisiana, the results for the past year may see further grade deductions into the future.

The Sierra Club’s “Dirty Truth Report” evaluates utilities’ plans to deliver cheap, clean energy to customers and gives them a grade based on their investment in renewable energy and commitment to retire fossil fuel-generated electricity by 2035.

Cleco and Entergy are among the 75 utilities featured in the Sierra Club evaluation, which gave the entire industry an F – its lowest grade since it began issuing report cards in 2021.

Holly Bender, the Sierra Club’s chief program officer, said in a news release it was “alarming” to see utilities move backward in their transitions to clean energy transition.

But in contrast to the national trend, New Orleans-based Entergy Corp. earned a C average. It comes after a B last year and an F in 2023. Cleco, headquartered in Pineville, received a B grade for 2025 after four straight years of Ds.

The Sierra Club’s review included grades for utility affiliates.

Entergy New Orleans improved from a B to an A with more investment in renewable energy, who Entergy Louisiana, which fell from a B to a C, lost points for its “over-reliance on gas” and “fewer investments in renewable energy,” according to the report.

The Alliance for Affordable Energy, a consumer advocacy group, thinks utilities should emphasize more renewable energy generation, with a focus on community solar projects in particular.

The Sierra report analyzed documents up until a cutoff date of July 1. Alaina DiLaura, the alliance’s policy coordinator, said recent updates to utilities’ ongoing reliance on fossil fuels may make the results more pronounced into the future.

For example, Cleco’s filings with the Louisiana Public Service Commission show plans to transition a coal-burning power plant to natural gas, an aspect of continued fossil fuel use she said the Sierra Club report doesn’t fully consider, as it was filed after July 1.

Despite originally planning to retire its coal-powered Rodemacher Unit 2 power plant in Rapides Parish, Cleco submitted plans Sept. 5 to the Louisiana Public Service Commission to keep it running using natural gas, DiLaura said, which could impact clean energy report scores in the future.

Cleco is also looking to use natural gas at its largest power plant, Madison 3, alongside the petroleum coke (a crude oil refining byproduct) it currently runs on. The utility has informed state regulators it will add “700 megawatts of new gas generation,” DiLaura said, citing its latest filings.

Entergy Louisiana will add 2,200 megawatts of generation capacity – a 20% increase of its statewide output – once it builds three natural gas-powered plants to run the massive Meta data center under construction in Richland Parish.

Entergy New Orleans’ grade improvement may also take a hit, DiLaura said, because its latest plans involve expanding its use of natural gas, which means the utility won’t meet its 2035 goal of net zero carbon emissions.

Entergy New Orleans spokesman Beau Tidwell said that even though it intends to use more natural gas, the company will “remain committed to transparent disclosure about our progress and any challenges we might encounter.”

The Mayor of the West of England and council leaders were joined by business leaders and government ministers at the Bristol Digital Futures Institute to together make the case for more investment in our part of the world. A new investment prospectus includes Mass Transit to help get the West moving and the UK’s first AI Supercluster centred on Isambard-AI, the country’s fastest supercomputer, and sets out their scale of ambition, targeting 28% economic growth over next ten years.

Alongside this cutting-edge technology, the Mayor has highlighted the continued importance of our everyday economy, which provides 57% of jobs across the region including in health and education, hospitality and logistics, and keeps the West running. The Growth Strategy also confirms new work to tackle child poverty, deliver more affordable and accessible childcare, and generate another 135 megawatts of clean energy.

As the combined authority works ever closer with our North Somerset neighbours, the Growth Strategy sets out a future bold for business. With a growing population of more than 1.2 million people and a growing economy already worth £53.7 billion, the West has delivered 21% economic growth over the last decade – a major contribution to the British economy and above the national rate. The Growth Strategy sets out an ambition for a new £500 million West of England Land Acquisition Fund to tackle the housing crisis and ensure high-quality development with the infrastructure that local people and businesses need.

The 120-page strategy highlights sectors with the strongest job growth in the West during the last decade. In that time, the everyday economy (+17%), digital and tech (+52%), creative industries (+82%), and clean energy (+140%) here saw the highest job growth of any region in the country – including London. Planning ahead for the next ten years, major growth zones identified include the West Innovation Arc, Central Bristol and Bath, the Severn Estuary, the Somer Valley, and North Somerset Growth Gateway.

Airbus, Bath Fashion Museum, Boomsatsuma, Step and Stone, and YTL were among those showcasing what they bring to the region.

Helen Godwin, Mayor of the West of England, said:

“The future starts here. Every pound invested into the West of England delivers a real return.

“Our new Growth Strategy is about securing investment for our part of the world to make a difference that we can all can see and feel, including new jobs for local people and better transport to cut congestion and boost productivity.

“Growth must not be an intangible economic concept. It is about all of us – it is about our whole region working together for a brighter future in this new chapter for the West.”

Councillor Kevin Guy, Leader of Bath & North East Somerset (B&NES) Council and Deputy Mayor of the West of England, said:

“I warmly welcome this ambitious ten-year growth strategy which seizes on the amazing opportunities we have here in the West of England. I am personally very pleased to see our ambitious plans for Fashion Museum Bath recognised as a lever to secure investment, jobs and to boost the continued growth of the tourism and culture sectors in our region. We also have strategic plans to attract new commercial and employment opportunities within the Bath Riverside Innovation Quarter, and in the Somer Valley, which would see development-ready sites within a Somer Valley Enterprise Zone.”

Councillor Tony Dyer, Leader of Bristol City Council said:

“Spanning our entire city from its centre to the suburbs, Bristol’s strengths in creative industries, clean energy, and innovation make us a driving force in the region’s economy - attracting people and investment. By working together across the West, this strategy will help us deliver homes, jobs and opportunities for all our communities.""

Councillor Mike Bell, Leader of North Somerset Council, said:

“This strategy is about delivering real change for North Somerset. More chances for young people to build their careers, better transport for families, affordable homes in thriving neighbourhoods, and cleaner energy for the future. It’s about making sure every community share in the benefits of growth and helps to shape a brighter future for the West of England. It is an ambitious and credible pitch for government support and private sector investment that stakes our claim as the place where communities together make things happen.”

Councillor Maggie Tyrrell, Leader of South Gloucestershire Council, said:

“The new Regional Growth Strategy is an ambitious document, which clearly sets out the opportunities for the region, including for South Gloucestershire. The strategy makes it clear that South Gloucestershire stands out as a nationally significant growth opportunity, with an economy that has consistently outpaced the national average in terms of employment and productivity.

“Crucially, we also welcome that the Strategy says plainly that whilst productivity growth is important, economic growth just for the sake of it would be a missed opportunity. We need to make sure the benefits of prosperity are felt by everyone, through more and better jobs for our residents; new education and skills opportunities; new and better homes in accessible locations; and transport network that meets their needs and those of businesses to travel across the region and connect to the rest of the country and world beyond. The Regional Growth Strategy begins to address these challenges.

“Finally, we welcome the way in which the Strategy was developed collaboratively by our teams, and we look forward to continuing this collaboration as we develop the implementation plans that will help realise our shared ambition.”

Professor Evelyn Welch, Vice-Chancellor and President of the University of Bristol, which hosts the Bristol Digital Futures Institute, said:

“I welcome this ambitious Regional Growth Strategy, particularly its vision for the UK’s first AI Supercluster, centred on Isambard-AI—the nation’s most powerful and sustainable supercomputer. The University of Bristol is proud to collaborate closely with our regional partners as a driving force for growth in digital, tech, creative, and clean energy sectors. Our Temple Quarter Enterprise Campus, at the heart of the regeneration of Temple Quarter, exemplifies our commitment to powering innovation, attracting investment, and serving as a dynamic hub for talent, skills, and partnerships to drive our region’s economic future.”

Robert Campbell, Head of Culture and Heritage at B&NES, said:

“On behalf of Bath and North East Somerset Council’s Fashion Museum Bath, I’m pleased to express our strong support for the West of England Combined Authority’s Local Growth Plan. We welcome its recognition of the transformative role that cultural investment plays in driving regional growth. This plan marks a vital step forward in our region’s economic development and, we believe, will deliver substantial and lasting benefits to our communities.”

Today’s publication follows the Mayor and leaders’ pledge in the last fortnight to embed nature in the Growth Strategy, a move backed by the CEOs of Triodos Bank UK and national charity Wildlife and Countryside Link. As the home of the Western Forest, the UK’s first new national forest in three decades, and so much more, the West’s outstanding natural beauty is recognised as a unique selling point in a competitive national and global economy.

It also comes hot on the heels of new research from the Brunel Centre, showing the strength of economic growth across the region.

One of President Donald Trump’s initial Executive Orders following his January inauguration focused on energy production and eliminating billions being spent on solar and wind projects while favoring fossil fuels and nuclear power.

“The more people have gotten into so-called climate action, the more expensive their energy has become,” Wright said. “That lowers people’s quality of lives and reduces their life opportunities.”

The Trump administration aims to end “cancel culture”, Wright said, wherein “you can’t say anything about climate change” without being “shouted down”. He also defended a widely criticized energy department report which experts say was full of climate misinformation, claiming it only contained one figure that was out of line with a recent National Academies report on climate science.

Asked about concerns that the administration’s widespread attacks on climate policy, Wright said climate action had not delivered.

“We’ve had 30 years, more than 30 years, since the Kyoto protocol,” he said “We haven’t even changed the trajectory of global greenhouse-gas emissions.”

However, since the adoption of the Paris agreement, the projected rise in global warming has been dramatically reduced, from over four degrees celsius of temperature rise expected by the century’s end, to 2.6C if nation’s climate action plans are fully implemented, according to the UN secretary general.

Wright also announced plans to return $13bn in Biden-era funding for green projects, which his department said were “initially appropriated to advance the previous administration’s wasteful Green New Scam agenda”. He did not clarify which green projects would be targeted.

Questioned about his administration’s attempts to halt wind-farm construction, including ones that are already permitted, Wright said the administration is merely investigating widespread concerns about the projects’ impacts, including on whale populations. Scientists say there is no credible evidence that wind turbines pose a major danger to whales.

Asked if future presidencies should be able to launch similar attacks on already permitted fossil-fuel projects, he said they do, citing Biden’s revocation of a permit for the controversial Keystone XL oil pipeline.

The president has pledged to slash electricity bills by half. Yet grid operators have said the Trump administration’s efforts to halt renewable energy while keeping costly coal plants online have forced them to increase utility bills. Wright dodged a question about those rising costs, claiming Biden’s efforts to close coal plants raised the price of electricity.

Today, the Connecticut Congressional delegation sent a letter to Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lee Zeldin urging him to withdraw his proposal rescinding the 2009 endangerment finding that determined greenhouse gas emissions pose a serious risk to Americans’ health and well-being.

…

In late July, the EPA announced a proposal to rescind the landmark endangerment finding — a 2009 rule that found greenhouse gases and air pollution cause harm to human health and our climate. The finding allows the EPA to regulate greenhouse gas emissions as air pollutants under the Clean Air Act. The 2009 finding is widely accepted science and is a key tool for reducing pollution.

The delegation’s letter reads:

We write to express our profound concern over the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) proposal to reconsider the 2009 endangerment finding and demand that you withdraw the proposed rule immediately. Dismantling the life-saving determination will have dire long-term consequences for the people of Connecticut and our nation, especially our children and grandchildren.

The EPA’s endangerment finding is the agency’s scientifically-backed determination that greenhouse gas emissions pose a risk to peoples’ health and wellbeing.1 Pursuant to the Clean Air Act, this determination requires the EPA to regulate these emissions to protect people from the dangerous impacts.2 The endangerment finding underpins longstanding, commonsense measures the EPA has enacted to address climate change. Rescinding the agency’s determination does nothing to change the fact that climate change harms human health, and this action will put lives at risk.

Climate change is a significant threat to Connecticut, and our residents are already feeling its effects in the forms of sea level rise and extreme weather…Over the last 15 years, Connecticut has been impacted by 24 ‘billion-dollar’ disasters. In the absence of an endangerment finding that allows EPA to take commonsense steps to protect against climate change, disasters like those we have experienced in Connecticut will only continue to grow in scope and severity.

Washington, D.C., September 18, 2025 — Murphy, Bicameral Group of Democrats Announce Plans to Introduce Legislation to Protect Free Speech, Safeguard Against Politically Motivated Harassment and Prosecutions

U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) and U.S. Representative Jason Crow (D-Colo.-6) on Thursday joined Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and U.S. Senators Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Tina Smith (D-Minn.) and Representatives Greg Casar (D-Texas-35), Chrissy Houlahan (D-Pa.-06), and Maxwell Frost (D-Fla.-10) at a press conference to announce their intent to introduce the No Political Enemies (NOPE) Act, legislation to protect individuals and organizations, including non-profits, faith groups, media outlets, and educational institutions, from politically motivated harassment and prosecution by the federal government.

This bill would reaffirm the constitutionally protected right to free speech and establish clear and enforceable protections to deter abuse, empower individuals and organizations to defend themselves, and create meaningful accountability. The legislation would also prohibit the use of federal funds for any investigations or regulatory action that would suppress protected speech. The announcement follows threats from President Trump, Vice President JD Vance, Attorney General Pam Bondi, and White House Senior Deputy Chief of Staff Stephen Miller to use the tragic shooting of Charlie Kirk as justification to weaponize the federal government to go after left-leaning individuals and organizations that don’t align with Trump’s political agenda.

‘Since taking office, President Trump has engaged in a relentless campaign to silence dissent in this country. Targeting Democratic elected officials for prosecution, violating appropriations law to browbeat colleges and universities, and restricting access for journalists was just the start of this broad effort to weaponize the federal government to consolidate power and go after his perceived political enemies. Now, the president and the loyalists he’s installed at DOJ and the FBI have announced plans to exploit the horrific death of Charlie Kirk and use it as a pretext to intimidate and destroy any political opposition to Trump – it’s a page taken right out of the totalitarian playbook. This White House has proven time and time again that it’s willing to trample on the rights of Americans in service of Donald Trump’s agenda and Congress has an obligation to protect the American people and our democracy,’ said Murphy.

‘Charlie Kirk’s murder was horrific. Everyone, regardless of party, must unequivocally condemn political violence,’ said Crow. ‘Past presidents have used these tragic moments to unite the nation. President Trump has instead used this moment to squash political dissent, attack basic rights, and seize power. We must speak out and fight back to protect our democracy.’

‘The United States of America was built on the right to free speech – the right to organize and advocate, to petition your government, no matter your views. But it is simply abhorrent that this administration plans to use the death of Charlie Kirk as a predicate to supercharge their long-standing campaign against their perceived political opponents,’ said Leader Schumer. ‘This isn’t a new campaign – they have long been engaged in an ever-escalating campaign to use the mighty power of the federal government to attack civil society. We Democrats won’t stand for it – we are going to fight it in the courts, we are going to fight it in the court of public opinion, and we are going to fight these attacks in Congress.’

‘The Trump administration’s blatant disregard for our Constitution is eroding the bedrock values upon which our country is built. Congress must act to stop this Administration’s assault on people and organizations simply because they don’t agree with their point of view,’ said Booker. ‘This legislation offers a clear roadmap to protect non-profits, faith groups, media outlets, educational institutions, and others from politically motivated harassment and prosecution by the federal government. This isn’t about whether you are on the Right or the Left—every person and every organization has a right to free speech and to express their views without harassment or persecution. We cannot sit by and watch Trump desecrate the Constitution and undermine our fundamental right to free speech, even if the views expressed are unpopular, controversial, or simply disliked by him.’

‘The Trump Administration is attacking free speech – threatening anyone who dares to speak out against them. This politically motivated weaponization of government clearly defies the First Amendment and demands action from the Congress. This legislation will help provide additional safeguards to protect Americans’ free speech rights from a lawless administration,’ said Van Hollen.

‘The President and his Administration have shredded the fundamental principle that in America, we don’t punish our political opponents — we protect free speech,’ said Padilla. ‘History teaches us that when leaders try to silence entertainers or journalists like Jimmy Kimmel and Stephen Colbert simply for questioning their authority or disagreeing with them, it’s not a show of strength, it’s a sign of weakness. No matter how much this Administration tries to silence me or countless others for speaking our minds, we will not stay quiet. The NOPE Act will make critical reforms to help protect the right to free speech for all Americans.’

‘We are at a moment where we must spell out clearly that there will be costs when the people and organizations of our civil society are denied their right to do what they want, and say what they think within the bound of our laws and due process,’ said Smith. ‘This legislation is about upholding the most American of values: that in this country our speech, our words, our principles are protected.’

‘President Trump is abusing the vast powers of the federal government to shut down people who dare disagree with him,’ said Casar. ‘What’s at stake in this moment is the ability of the American people to speak out against the billionaire takeover of our government and be heard.’

‘The Constitution is not a buffet line where you take what you like and ignore the rest. The Constitution is absolute, and it is binding,’ said Houlahan. ‘We did not use the tragic murders of Melissa and Mark Hoffman to rip apart the Second Amendment in June, and we cannot use the murder of Charlie Kirk to rip apart the First Amendment in September. If we continue to smash the foundation of our democracy for short-term political gain, there will be nothing left for us to stand upon.’

‘The Trump Administration is trying to scare those that disagree with him into silence and attacking the most fundamental freedoms that we have as Americans: the freedom to speak out, to dissent, and to criticize our government without fear,’ said Frost. ‘The NOPE Act is about strengthening the laws that protect the people from any and all administrations that fear the truth and fear democracy.’

The NOPE Act would prevent the targeting of individuals or organizations on the basis of their constitutionally protected speech, beliefs, and political participation by:

Reaffirming our Constitution and laws prohibit the president from weaponizing government against people who disagree with the administration. Uphold foundational constitutional principles that protect free speech and political participation. The DOJ, FBI, IRS, and other government agencies cannot be used to silence or target people for criticizing the government with constitutionally protected speech.

Deterring government officials from abusing their power to silence or retaliate against critics. Deter misconduct by making clear there are consequences for violating federal civil rights laws and that federal officials can be held accountable for abuses.

Providing tools for those wrongly targeted to defend themselves in court, including meaningful access to evidence, correcting the imbalance of proof, having the legal costs to defend themselves covered, and allowing courts to quickly dismiss abusive actions.

Providing due process for any U.S. nonprofits the government attempts to label as criminal or terrorist organizations.

Improving transparency and accountability for federal agencies that seek to silence critics. Create mechanisms for improved reporting and accountability for government agencies so that officials who commit misconduct by abusing their power to censor or retaliate against critics can be held accountable.

Washington D.C., September 19, 2025 — Congressman Jason Crow’s (CO- 06)Floor Speech on the Concerning State of US Politics & the Path Forward to Unite Our Country

Almost seven years ago, I came to Congress to serve my community, my state, my fellow veterans, and the country I love – in a different way than I served it on the battlefield. When I put the uniform on as a teenager, I swore an oath to the Constitution. I stand here today to uphold that oath.

I came here to represent a state that has been wracked with trauma: Columbine, Aurora Theater, Club Q, Boulder, and most recently Evergreen High.

I came here because like so many of my fellow veterans I harbor deep resentment for our wars that cost thousands of lives, trillions of dollars, and decades of lost opportunity.

I came here because the American working class has been gutted, left behind, and excluded from the American dream while the elites grow wealthier than ever.

I came to Congress assuming that, together with my colleagues from both sides of the aisle, we could solve these problems together. And we could have open and safe debates in a free society.

…

There is courage everywhere we look. We have not yet lost our power.

So many Americans have been sounding the alarm bell for a long time, and they have been right.

We have now reached the inflection point. Now is the time to stand firm. And for us to stand with them. And for us to stand with all those defending democracy. …",https://berkshireedge-images.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/image1-21.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 16:01:28.772848

Automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain some baseline of demand, as fewer people are expected to buy EVs in upcoming months. However, it is uncertain how much savings that will provide buyers, and it probably wouldn’t make up for the money lost due to the end of the tax credit.

EV sales have been growing steadily over the years, and at a faster pace compared to traditional gas-powered cars. However, the sales have begun to slow down in the U.S. earlier this year, rising only 1.5% over the first six months of the year and actually falling 6.3% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credits expiring, more attractive offers are likely to be on the way, according to Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds. “If you already can’t sell the vehicles at current prices, there’s no way you are going to sell them at today’s prices with this credit going by the wayside,” he said.

Meanwhile, Cox found that 65% of the people planning to buy an EV in the next two years said they’ll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit.

Dive Brief:

Investments in residential heat pumps, batteries and solar arrays could meet 100% of projected electricity demand growth from AI data centers through 2029, according to a report from the pro-electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.

The large tech and infrastructure companies behind the U.S. AI boom could unlock more than 93 GW of grid capacity at costs comparable to building a new fleet of gas power plants by paying 50% of the cost of heat pump upgrades and 30% of the cost of onsite solar and storage, Rewiring America said Thursday.

“Hyperscalers are already thinking creatively about how to meet their growing power needs, and this report presents a solution that brings households into the conversation,” Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak said in an email.

Dive Insight:

U.S. utilities requested about $29 billion in rate increases in the first half of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for pro-consumer regulatory reform.

The sharp rise in rate hike requests and in already-approved rate increases show that “the status quo isn’t working for households,” Matusiak said. “There’s a way to rebalance the equation and ensure there’s something in it for Americans.”

Matusiak’s group said rising electricity prices compound the consumer burden of broad-based inflation and the pending expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient appliances and distributed energy resources, which experts say could push utility rates higher still.

Right now, hyperscalers and the utilities that support them are looking to “centralized, utility-scale solutions, like building fossil fuel or nuclear power plants” to meet near-term load growth projections, Rewiring America said. Instead, it said, targeted residential energy investments could effectively offset the loss of federal energy tax credits, free more than 100 GW of grid capacity over five years and lay the foundation for a more efficient, resilient power system over the longer term.

Those investments could also help hyperscalers and utilities sidestep five-to-six-year lead times and escalating construction costs for combined-cycle gas turbines while reducing exposure to volatile natural gas prices, Matusiak said.

Reported capital costs of combined-cycle power plants to be deployed around 2030 now exceed $2,000/kW, up nearly 50% from plants with expected 2026 deployments, the clean energy group GridLab said in a report this month.

Hyperscalers’ heat pump investments should focus on households using inefficient electric space heating, water heating and air conditioning, Rewiring America said in last week’s report.

For example, the report said fully transitioning Georgia homes from electric resistance heat to heat pumps could free up about 1.5 GW of capacity, or 22% of the state’s projected data center load growth through 2029. Swapping out traditional air conditioners for heat pumps in Texas could unlock 3.9 GW of capacity, or 23% of expected data center load over the next five years.

Heat pumps are two-way climate control devices that can heat or cool homes, depending on the season. By covering 50% of the upgrade cost, the report said hyperscalers could knock the upfront expense down to about $9,000 for a typical home — less than the combined cost of a new furnace and air conditioner.

To unlock 109 GW of additional grid capacity through distributed solar and storage, Rewiring America said hyperscalers would only need to cover 30% of installation costs — the same subsidy provided by the expiring federal home energy tax credit — to reach cost parity with new gas generation.

But that would require every “single-family household in the U.S. [to install] a home battery, and those with a suitable roof [to install] a 5-kW solar system,” the report said. Rewiring America also based its gas-parity projection on a reduction of at least 40% in installed solar and storage costs, driven by economies of scale, streamlined permitting and lower customer acquisition costs.

Though ambitious, the Department of Energy’s January report on virtual power plants and more recent research by the Smart Electric Power Alliance and Sparkfund suggest Rewiring America’s 109-GW target is plausible.

DOE estimated U.S. VPPs — which aggregate customer-sited batteries, thermostats and other latent energy sources — could reach 80 GW to 160 GW by 2030, offsetting 10% to 20% of peak grid demand. SEPA and Sparkfund said distributed capacity procurement, an emerging utility-led approach to VPP deployment, could supply a significant amount of the necessary capacity.

Distributed capacity procurement is just one of several strategies hyperscalers and utilities could pursue to offset expected AI load growth, Matusiak said.

Other promising strategies include clean transition tariffs supporting distributed capacity rather than new generation and scaled-up, performance-based contracts with third-party VPP aggregators, he said.

When Donald Trump won his second term in the most powerful office in the world, he promised that he would put the American worker first. We suspect that his advisors did take into account the effect on the renewable energy industry that implementing such tariffs would have.

The Trump led regulatory reforms have had a disastrous effect on the solar sector in the United States

The Trump administration stated that it would be rolling back tax credits and incentives for the solar industry. That, coupled with the disastrous tariffs that the current administration has implemented, has led to a significant drop in the standing of solar power in the country. In the first half of the year, investment dropped by 36%.

What we must remember is that the solar sector is heavily reliant on the global nature of the industry. Several countries in Asia and all around the world develop crucial components for the energy sector in the United States. And much like the rest of America, the tariffs imposed on those countries have had a less-than-ideal effect.

Developers in the solar sector have been forced to reevaluate their investments thanks to the sizable tariffs that the administration has imposed. The Trump-led Department of Energy has also rolled back many permits for operations in the sector, which has only added to the woes of the solar energy industry. Reports are that the requirement that Energy Secretary approve any and all permits for renewable energy projects on federal land has resulted in a bottleneck forming.

Despite the current problems, the outlook for the solar energy sector remains bright

Yes, the current state of affairs is a worry. Reports are that over $22 billion in projects have been scrapped or scaled back siginificantly in the first half of this year. Despite that, the industry insiders are not concerned, as they state that the long-term outlook of the sector remains as bright as a sunrise in Hawaii. Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) CEO Abigail Ross Hopper described this year as “one of the most challenging periods of our industry’s history”

Investors may opt to take their money to Europe, which has a much more positive view on the solar sector and renewables as a whole. The European market saw renewable investments by 63% in 2025. The policy shifts that the Trump administration has championed will inevitably affect the sector. The question becomes, can the US recover from the current state of affairs in the renewable energy sector?

“We fought together with you, tooth and nail on this bill, side by side,” Hopper said. “And thanks to your advocacy, to your presence and to your perseverance, you did prevent a worst-case scenario. While that may not be the outcome we wanted, that outcome matters. That outcome was hard fought and worth honoring. While we worked every possible angle to influence the outcome, I know so many of you are still picking up the pieces. But make no mistake, this is not the end of our story, because we are a mature, resilient industry, and we will not back down in the face of adversity.” – Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) CEO Abigail Ross Hopper

Dive Brief:

Investments in residential heat pumps, batteries and solar arrays could meet 100% of projected electricity demand growth from AI data centers through 2029, according to a report from the pro-electrification nonprofit Rewiring America.

The large tech and infrastructure companies behind the U.S. AI boom could unlock more than 93 GW of grid capacity at costs comparable to building a new fleet of gas power plants by paying 50% of the cost of heat pump upgrades and 30% of the cost of onsite solar and storage, Rewiring America said Thursday.

“Hyperscalers are already thinking creatively about how to meet their growing power needs, and this report presents a solution that brings households into the conversation,” Rewiring America CEO Ari Matusiak said in an email.

Dive Insight:

U.S. utilities requested about $29 billion in rate increases in the first half of 2025, according to PowerLines, a nonprofit that advocates for pro-consumer regulatory reform.

The sharp rise in rate hike requests and in already-approved rate increases show that “the status quo isn’t working for households,” Matusiak said. “There’s a way to rebalance the equation and ensure there’s something in it for Americans.”

Matusiak’s group said rising electricity prices compound the consumer burden of broad-based inflation and the pending expiration of federal tax credits for energy-efficient appliances and distributed energy resources, which experts say could push utility rates higher still.

Right now, hyperscalers and the utilities that support them are looking to “centralized, utility-scale solutions, like building fossil fuel or nuclear power plants” to meet near-term load growth projections, Rewiring America said. Instead, it said, targeted residential energy investments could effectively offset the loss of federal energy tax credits, free more than 100 GW of grid capacity over five years and lay the foundation for a more efficient, resilient power system over the longer term.

Those investments could also help hyperscalers and utilities sidestep five-to-six-year lead times and escalating construction costs for combined-cycle gas turbines while reducing exposure to volatile natural gas prices, Matusiak said.

Reported capital costs of combined-cycle power plants to be deployed around 2030 now exceed $2,000/kW, up nearly 50% from plants with expected 2026 deployments, the clean energy group GridLab said in a report this month.

Hyperscalers’ heat pump investments should focus on households using inefficient electric space heating, water heating and air conditioning, Rewiring America said in last week’s report.

For example, the report said fully transitioning Georgia homes from electric resistance heat to heat pumps could free up about 1.5 GW of capacity, or 22% of the state’s projected data center load growth through 2029. Swapping out traditional air conditioners for heat pumps in Texas could unlock 3.9 GW of capacity, or 23% of expected data center load over the next five years.

Heat pumps are two-way climate control devices that can heat or cool homes, depending on the season. By covering 50% of the upgrade cost, the report said hyperscalers could knock the upfront expense down to about $9,000 for a typical home — less than the combined cost of a new furnace and air conditioner.

To unlock 109 GW of additional grid capacity through distributed solar and storage, Rewiring America said hyperscalers would only need to cover 30% of installation costs — the same subsidy provided by the expiring federal home energy tax credit — to reach cost parity with new gas generation.

But that would require every “single-family household in the U.S. [to install] a home battery, and those with a suitable roof [to install] a 5-kW solar system,” the report said. Rewiring America also based its gas-parity projection on a reduction of at least 40% in installed solar and storage costs, driven by economies of scale, streamlined permitting and lower customer acquisition costs.

Though ambitious, the Department of Energy’s January report on virtual power plants and more recent research by the Smart Electric Power Alliance and Sparkfund suggest Rewiring America’s 109-GW target is plausible.

DOE estimated U.S. VPPs — which aggregate customer-sited batteries, thermostats and other latent energy sources — could reach 80 GW to 160 GW by 2030, offsetting 10% to 20% of peak grid demand. SEPA and Sparkfund said distributed capacity procurement, an emerging utility-led approach to VPP deployment, could supply a significant amount of the necessary capacity.

Distributed capacity procurement is just one of several strategies hyperscalers and utilities could pursue to offset expected AI load growth, Matusiak said.

Other promising strategies include clean transition tariffs supporting distributed capacity rather than new generation and scaled-up, performance-based contracts with third-party VPP aggregators, he said.

And in some hot data center markets, traditional utilities might not need to be directly involved at all.

“In competitive wholesale markets, such as [the Electric Reliability Council of Texas], data centers could contract directly with DER aggregators that monetize grid services,” Matusiak said.

In sum – what to know:

Meta enters wholesale power market – Atem Energy has applied to FERC to sell energy and capacity, aiming to secure supply and flexibility for Meta’s expanding U.S. data centers.

Louisiana AI data center drives demand – The 2 GW+ facility, powered by Entergy’s 2.26 GW gas turbines, underscores the scale of Meta’s AI infrastructure needs.

Nuclear options under review – Meta is also exploring 1.4 GW of nuclear power to meet long-term sustainability and capacity requirements.

Meta, through its newly formed subsidiary Atem Energy, has submitted an application to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) seeking approval to sell wholesale electricity in the United States.

The request, filed last week, asks for authorization to participate in energy markets by November 16. If approved, Atem Energy would be in a position to operate as a power marketer, allowing Meta to secure large-scale energy commitments for its data centers and sell unused capacity.

The filing seeks permission to sell energy, capacity, and ancillary services. If Atem intends to operate in competitive markets such as the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO)—where Meta is developing a major Louisiana data center—it would need to apply for membership.

Atem Energy, wholly owned by Meta and created earlier this year, was established with the aim of managing energy sales tied to the Meta’s growing data center footprint.

The move reflects surging electricity demand from AI infrastructure. Meta’s Louisiana facility is expected to exceed 2 GW of capacity, powered by three combined-cycle gas turbines totaling 2.26 GW, built and run by utility Entergy.

Separately, Meta last year launched a request for proposals to identify nuclear developers capable of providing 1.4 GW of new nuclear generation to support its U.S. operations.

In June, the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) had raised its projections for electricity consumption in the country, citing a spike in power demand from commercial sectors—especially data centers—as a key driver. In its latest update of the Short-Term Energy Outlook (STEO), the EIA said it expects total U.S. electricity demand to rise from 4,097 billion kilowatt-hours (kWh) last year to 4,193bn kWh in 2025, and 4,283bn kWh in 2026.

The forecast marks a significant upward revision compared to earlier forecasts, which had anticipated more modest growth. The report says that a major contributor to the revised outlook is the expansion of data centers, particularly those supporting artificial intelligence (AI) workloads. “The revisions are most notable in the commercial sector, where data centers are an expanding source of demand,” the report states.

AI data centers are the backbone of modern machine learning and computational advancements. However, one of the biggest challenges these AI data centers face is the enormous power consumption they require. Unlike traditional data centers, which primarily handle storage and processing for standard enterprise applications, AI data centers must support intensive workloads such as deep learning, large-scale data analytics as well as real-time decision-making.

AI workloads, especially deep learning and generative AI models, require massive computational power.

Meet our newest Net-Zero Hero, Thira Rose! Thira is an artist, runner, and community leader who’s turning worn-out sneakers and race bibs into powerful works of art. By blending her passions for running, sustainability, and creativity, she’s sparking conversations about the environmental footprint of the sport while reimagining what discarded gear can become. We met with Thira at the site of her most recent race, Zilker Relays, while she was working on her latest art piece. We dove into the inspiration behind her “shoe-scapes,” her journey, and how art can encourage us all to tread a little more lightly on the planet.

What inspired you to take action?

For most of my life, art, running, and sustainability have been core parts of my identity. It wasn’t until after I realized how much my gear impacted the environment that I had the idea to combine all three of my passions into one core practice.

It all began when I transferred from the School of the Art Institute of Chicago to Southwestern University in Georgetown, Texas, following the COVID-19 pandemic. As I was working toward my Bachelor of Fine Arts and Environmental Studies minor, three students and I were selected to attend the prestigious Tamarind Institute in Albuquerque, New Mexico, to learn the art of stone lithography from master printers in training. With only a week to come up with an idea and put it on paper, I was scanning aimlessly for items with interesting textures to print with that had a story to tell. I thought I was out of luck until I looked at the intricate patterns on the bottom of my running shoes.

Left to Right: Thira shows some of the shoes she uses to make her prints; Thira paints on her race-day bib.

How did you do it?

Before arriving at the Tamarind Institute, I had just finished reading We Can’t Run Away From This, a book by ultrarunner and environmental activist Damian Hall about the impact runners have on the environment. Running shoes are made from a variety of plastics and fibers, which means they take years to break down. With that in mind, I got a pair of shears and cut my worn shoes until I was left with the bare bones and dissected pieces of fiber and plastic soles displayed across the table. I would eventually use these objects as printing tools to create texture in landscapes, making my first shoe-scape, titled “Tread Lightly.”

Top to Bottom: Repurposed shoe materials used to make the shoe-scape art; Thira’s first piece, “Tread Lightly.”

These shoe prints would eventually find themselves painted in the texture of rocks, trees, and skies of colorful landscapes I’ve run through, illustrating the effects humans and our used gear have on the environment we traverse. As I continued working with running shoes as a medium, I began to think about other items runners often throw away — one of those being race bibs.

Race bibs, secured by a few safety pins on shorts or a T-shirt to track someone during a race, are made from Tyvek paper. Due to its waterproof qualities for sweaty people like me, Tyvek is not recyclable and takes a long time to break down. This gave me the idea to use the Tyvek bib as a canvas to capture memories from my races. My most recent race, the Zilker Relays, was hosted at Zilker Park in downtown Austin. The glowing lights of the Austin skyline at twilight are what inspired my bib painting, “Twilight at Zilker Relays.”

What’s been most rewarding about getting involved in this way?

Finding creative ways to reuse worn running gear that I might have otherwise discarded has been a rewarding way to recycle. But my most meaningful experience by far was summiting Mount Kilimanjaro, the world’s largest free-standing mountain, in Tanzania. I was one of twelve Southwestern University students chosen for this trip of a lifetime. With my trail racing background and passion for plein air painting, I set out with a goal: to capture the landscape throughout the eight-day trek using a portable, lightweight easel and painting supplies. At the time, I had recently developed a technique of printing shoe pieces into my landscapes with my own worn-out shoes. What I didn’t expect was to discover a much deeper meaning in the discarded soles I found scattered along the trail.

Left to Right: Thira paints outdoors in Tanzania, Africa; Thira and her friend, Goodluck, hold the paintings they did of each other.

During our trip, we hired African porters to carry our gear, food, and other essential supplies. I befriended Goodluck, one of the porters, who was close to my age and an artist himself. We painted together the entire trip and had many deep conversations about our individual cultures. I asked Goodluck about the shoe pieces I kept finding along the trail, and he informed me that porters wear shoes donated to them by other hikers until they begin to fall apart and degrade into the trail. This opened my eyes to the privilege we encounter in America and the ability people have to discard their gear before it’s used to the fullest extent. I collected every shoe piece I found along the mountain and took them back home to make a series of pieces centered around my experience.

What’s been the toughest part?

After the COVID-19 pandemic, running skyrocketed in popularity. Whether you run at a party-pace on the road or drink craft beers after a tough trail run, there’s a run club for whatever your niche might be. However, running companies have taken advantage of this growing trend by coming out with slightly new iterations of running shoes for every season, in every color you could imagine. More people travel across the globe for races just to earn a new shiny medal and snag another race shirt that will live in the depths of their closet. Running itself is a healthy hobby, but the unnecessary items that might come with it can harm the planet.

Top to Bottom: Thira’s running mate hands a baton off to Thira at Zilker Relays; Thira runs with the baton.

That’s where organizations like Racing for Sustainability give me hope for the future of running. Elite marathon runner and climate activist Tina Muir founded this nonprofit, aiming to help others make races more sustainable through environmentally-conscious race plans. These plans promote initiatives like cupless races and improved recycling station setups tailored to race size. I was fortunate to be accepted onto the Racing for Sustainability team for the Bank of America Chicago Marathon, where I will be fundraising to support the continuation of Racing for Sustainability. If you're interested in following my journey and helping me get to the start line for a good cause, find me on Instagram at @thirartist.

How has your art helped you spark conversations about climate and sustainability?

I’ve had the pleasure of showing my work in several galleries in and around Austin. These spaces provide me with an opportunity to share my work publicly with other runners, artists, and viewers who are curious about my work. I recently exhibited my work in the group show, Positioning Systems, at Northern-Southern gallery in downtown Austin. During a weekly Austin running group that I co-lead, “Artist Run Club,” I had the chance to speak about the meaning behind my work and why I feel it’s essential to preserve the gear that we own and make it outlast its capitalistic deadline.

I believe art and running both have the power to unite us. Through experiences like attending races and groups, like “Artist Run Club,” I’ve come to feel that I’m on the right path to sharing complex issues we must face together through art and the love of running.

What advice do you have for others?

While I choose to recycle my used gear through cutting it up, painting on it, and making it into art, that is certainly not the only solution. Next time you’re tempted to buy the newest pair of running shoes or gear up before trying to set a new personal record at your next race, ask yourself: Do I really need new shoes? Can I skip the race T-shirt? Where can I recycle my medal if I don’t want to keep it? How can I hydrate on race day without relying on plastic cups?

These are the kinds of thoughts and questions I want people to consider after viewing my work. If you’re part of a local running club, consider organizing a trail cleanup day or a “plogging” event (combining trash pickup with jogging). If you’re looking to run a local race, reach out to the race director to ask what kind of sustainable initiatives they have in place for race day. If your old shoes are no longer cutting it and you’re looking to upgrade for better physical health, do your research to find shoes that will outlast their desired mileage. In the rare times I do find myself buying new active wear, I thrift or buy local. Clubhouse Outfitters, a local athletic apparel store in Austin, aims to address the issue of mass production in active wear by prioritizing care and consideration in the items they produce and the fabrics they use.

The list goes on and on, but overall, be conscious of the gear you wear and the way you run as an individual and collectively.

Thira shows a couple of her race bib paintings.

Is there a book, documentary, or other piece of media you would recommend for folks wanting to learn more about these topics?

I previously mentioned the book that initially got me thinking about the connection between running and sustainability, which was Damian Hall’s (@untra_damo), We Can’t Run Away From This. This book dives into the statistics, numbers, and in-depth research on why running can be so detrimental to the environment.

Building on those ideas, Becoming a Sustainable Runner, co-written by accomplished runners and environmental advocates Tina Muir (@tinamuir88) and Zoë Rom (@carrot_flowers_z), explores how to approach running sustainably through the lenses of mind, body, and planet. This book is also what led me to discover Muir’s nonprofit, Racing for Sustainability.

Lastly, Alaskan watercolor artist and storyteller, Max Romey (@trailboundsketches), is inspired by trash and other discarded materials to illustrate stories about how we must work to protect the planet from climate catastrophe. Romey even had an entire project dedicated to collecting discarded shoes on an island in Alaska and illustrating each of them to bring awareness to the effects microplastics have on the planet.

Thira’s work reminds us that you don’t always have to go far to find sustainable ways to care for the planet — sometimes the greatest difference you can make starts with your everyday hobbies. Running has long been a favorite pastime in Austin, and Thira’s art highlights how even the gear we use for the activities we love carries an environmental footprint. She challenges us to rethink waste, find beauty in the overlooked, and make more intentional choices in our daily lives.

From our experience here in South Texas, I can tell you: BlackRock and GIP cannot be trusted with running your power supply.

On the South Texas Gulf Coast, BlackRock and GIP are behind the Rio Grande LNG export terminal. This massive fossil-fuel facility is being developed by bulldozing the ancestral lands of my people, the Esto’k Gna, the Carrizo/Comecrudo Tribe. This fossil-fuel behemoth threatens our sacred sites, our water, and our future. From the inception of the project, the tribe's perspective and concerns have been largely excluded and ignored. The developers never asked permission, never sought proper consultation, and never respected our inherent sovereignty.

For years, the tribe has told regulators and investors, both international and domestic, that this project is a direct assault on our community, our lands, and our futures. We’ve organized, marched, and testified. We’ve asked BlackRock to acknowledge our concerns. And still, these private-equity executives look past us, treating South Texans and original peoples of the land as mere obstacles to profits — not human beings tied to a land they are willing to destroy.

This is not an isolated incident but the next iteration of a never-ending, colonial, profit-seeking pattern. BlackRock has a long history of investing in companies that trample tribal sovereignty. When profit is at stake, Indigenous rights are dismissed. That’s why Minnesotans should be deeply concerned about this proposed takeover of Minnesota Power.

This is not an abstract problem, but real, lived realities for Indigenous communities in Texas. I know that your communities and environments in Northeastern Minnesota are unlikely to improve under BlackRock’s agenda of profit over people. GIP and BlackRock have already demonstrated that Indigenous voices in Texas do not matter. Why would they act differently once they control Minnesota Power? GIP and BlackRock won’t care about Minnesota, I predict; they won’t care about your futures. They only seem to care about making more money, including sacrificing the health of your communities and even the future health of the environment.

The warning signs extend beyond Minnesota’s borders. Minnesota Power imports a significant share of its electricity from Manitoba Hydro in Canada. Those hydroelectric dams have devastated the lands and cultures of First Nations communities for decades. Entire homelands were flooded, and traditional ways of life were destroyed. Yet this destruction remains hidden behind the “clean energy” label that utilities are cynically quick to advertise. Again, the settler-colonial pattern is clear: Indigenous communities pay the price so corporations like BlackRock can profit.

This is why I speak directly to you, the people of Northeastern Minnesota. What we have seen in South Texas promises to repeat itself on your lands if this sale goes through. BlackRock will say the right things to your utility commission. It will promise reliability, affordability, and even sustainability. It will employ its political leverage. But when it comes to respecting Indigenous sovereignty, the record speaks for itself: BlackRock and other forms of private equity do not respect tribal nations or communities.

Esto’k Gna, the “human beings,” in Texas, have been fighting Rio Grande LNG for years because we understand what is at stake. Our struggle is not just for our community and sacred lands but for future generations.

Minnesotans now face a choice. Will you hand control of your utility over to Wall Street firms that have already shown they will bulldoze Indigenous lands and trample Indigenous rights? Or will you demand that your officials and regulators put your own communities, sovereignty, and the environment first?

From the Rio Grande to Lake Superior, we know what it looks like when BlackRock is in charge. Minnesota, you don’t have to learn the hard way. Please, stop this deal before it’s too late.",https://cdn.forumcomm.com/dims4/default/09304c2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1200x800+0+0/resize/1599x1066!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fforum-communications-production-web.s3.us-west-2.amazonaws.com%2Fbrightspot%2F23%2F00%2Ffbd7d1c94ed888d5f42322a226ea%2Fchristopher-basaldu.png,N,,2025-09-24 15:02:53.013971

There is some very good news on the climate front. Every US state reduced per capita carbon dioxide emissions from primary energy consumption between 2005 and 2023. The US Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently released data indicating that total US CO2 emissions fell by 20% over the period, even as population rose by 14%. The result is a 30% decrease in per capita CO2 emissions.

The reductions by state range from 49% in Maryland down to 1% in Mississippi. Texas had 24% lower per capita CO2 emissions in 2023 than in 2005, a remarkable amount given that the state experienced 77% growth in real output, a 34% increase in population, and an eight-fold surge in oil and gas production. States at or near the same or smaller levels of reduction include California, Vermont, New York, Washington, Oregon, North Dakota, Rhode Island, and several others. These areas exhibit wide differences in climate policy, geographic size, industrial base, rate of economic development, and virtually every other measure, indicating the diversity of approaches available to address this critical issue.

In Maryland, the key to the decrease was reducing coal from 56% of its input fuel for electric generation in 2005 to only 5% in 2023; natural gas increased from 4% to 41% over the period, and some wind and solar came online. Similar coal retirement and replacement went on in all of the states with the largest reductions.

Transportation is generally the biggest factor on the east and west costs, with electric power the primary source in 18 states. Texas is one of only four states where the industrial sector (which includes manufacturing and agriculture) is the largest source of CO2, another underlying indicator of economic vitality.

While the sheer size and economic strength of the state results in a high level of overall emissions, the reductions indicate genuine and meaningful gains. In fact, Texas has improved dramatically in terms of far lower emissions on both a per capita and a per million dollars in gross product basis than in the past. These reductions take on even greater significance in light of recent scientific research at MIT which reveals that declines in carbon concentrations can be a catalyst to climate regeneration.

A key factor in the improvement in US emissions has been increased electricity generation from natural gas, which releases about half the CO2 per unit of energy as coal, as well as gains in wind and solar. Significant reductions in carbon dioxide released even as business activity has flourished is good news indeed, especially when coupled with credible analysis indicating that such efforts can move the needle on crucial climate issues. Much remains to be done, but the success is notable. Stay safe!

How did you first become active with the Sierra Club?

I was living in New York City, as an actress. I have always loved the theatre, but I longed to be in the woods. Central Park was my haven. I sought out friends who had cars who could take me to the Catskills to go hiking. Eventually I found the Sierra Club and began going on weekend hikes with them.

As an outings leader it is a joy to show someone a new trail. It is a comfort to hike with kindred spirits who share my love of the environment. The magic of being outdoors elicits heartfelt conversations, laughter and learning all while hiking the outdoors. When I began to see invasive plants encroaching into my beloved hiking trails, I volunteered with other groups that were eradicating these invasives. I soon began offering weed wrangles through the Sierra Club, all the while partnering with other groups who were doing the same. Pulling invasive plants with a hearty group of people is life enhancing.

What would you say to someone who’s thinking of volunteering with the Sierra Club?

Volunteering with the Sierra Club can make a person feel less alone. I have made many good friends through volunteering with the Sierra Club. I have had to ask many questions and people were always willing to help me learn. When we plan a hiking outing, first we scout it with another Sierra Club member. Then, we will list it in Campfire [our events portal] and hike with an interested, intriguing group of people.

Per the Advanced Clean Cars II program, Washington aims to have 35% of new light-duty vehicle sales be zero-emission vehicles by 2026. Last year, 20% of new sales were electric or plug-in hybrid.

By 2027, EV, or zero emission vehicles, will have to make up 43% of all car sales in Washington. That percentage increases to 51% in 2028 and eventually reaches 100% by 2035, when it will be illegal to register new internal combustion engine vehicles.

New data reveals that while July new title transactions for EVs were 4,380, up from the same time in 2023, they were significantly below that of July 2024 which had nearly 6,500 new title transactions. In both May and June, new title transactions were below those same months in 2023 and 2024.

Washington State Department of Commerce Electric Vehicle Council Analyst Santiago Beltran Laborde told the Electric Vehicle Coordinating Council at its Sept. 17 meeting that “August might even be an even better month of new EV sales.”

Nevertheless, an EVCC’s meeting presentation stated that while the state would be able to meet its 8% sales share for 2025, the “state will struggle to meet this (35% in 2026) mark absent a policy boost or change in market dynamics,” according to the presentation.

However, State Department of Commerce Clean Transportation Managing Director Steven Hershkowitz noted that the “struggle” to meet that goal is “an average across the whole market, but this is not saying that it would be a ‘struggle’ for compliance to be met in the actual Advanced Clean Cars II policy, because of the way credits can be traded in. I just want to make it abundantly clear for anyone who's tuning in to not misinterpret this as suggesting that compliance cannot be met in ACC2, just the across-the-board average of 35% market share.”

Department of Ecology Zero Emissions Vehicle Specialist Joshua Grandbouche added that “we have the significant amount of credits in the credit bank ... that manufacturers earned over the past few years of sales.""

Under Advance Clean Cars II, credits are generated based on the sale of vehicles that meet or exceed the program’s emissions standards.

New Jersey’s electricity ratepayers have experienced significant financial strain, with double-digit rate increases announced in February 2025, projected to range from 17.23% to 20.20% for June and further hikes expected after the July PJM capacity auctions. These increases, coupled with higher usage during heat waves, have created an urgent energy affordability crisis. Addressing this challenge will be a top priority for New Jersey’s next governor.

New Jersey is importing 35% of its electricity, making the state vulnerable to regional grid constraints and wholesale auction price spikes. This vulnerable position places energy policy at the forefront of the 2025 gubernatorial race between Jack Ciattarelli and Mikie Sherrill, making the election a referendum on New Jersey’s energy future.

This article analyzes the candidates’ energy policies and energy records.

Mikie Sherrill: Championing a Clean Energy Transition

Congresswoman Mikie Sherrill’s energy platform centers on the national Democratic stance that climate change requires urgent action via a rapid transition to renewable energy.

Sherrill promotes expanding New Jersey’s solar capacity and introduced the “RAISE the Roof Act” in Congress to broaden the solar investment tax credit to include integrated solar roofs.

Despite major setbacks, Sherrill continues to see offshore wind as essential to New Jersey’s renewable energy leadership.

Details of Sherrill’s position on nuclear energy are not included in this summary; however, her energy platform primarily focuses on renewables and the transition away from fossil fuels.

Sherrill’s natural gas policy centers on reducing methane emissions from existing infrastructure, highlighted by her 2021 “Mitigate Methane Now Act,” which aims to replace aging gas lines and shield low-income consumers from related rate hikes through state grants.

In her June op-ed, Congresswoman Sherrill advocated for increasing and accelerating the deployment of electric vehicle chargers to support the transition to electric vehicles. She backed the 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which provided funding for EV charging stations in the state.

Sherrill opposes recent utility rate increases, warning they could drive businesses out of state. Her main approach to lowering costs is to add more clean energy to the grid and speed up the process for bringing these sources online, while also holding the regional grid operator, PJM, accountable for delays.

Jack Ciattarelli: A Balanced, All-of-the-Above Approach

Supports an “all-of-the-above” energy strategy, advocating for a new Energy Master Plan that balances various energy sources. He acknowledges the reality of climate change but criticizes Governor Murphy’s clean energy initiatives as overly ambitious and rapid.

Ciattarelli’s stance on renewable energy is complex. While he acknowledges the need for more solar energy, he criticizes federal subsidies for wind and solar, describing them as costly and unreliable.

Champions nuclear power for its zero-carbon benefits and significant role in New Jersey’s energy mix, promoting new “micro nuclear” technologies—a notable change from his 2017 opposition to nuclear subsidies due to concerns over incentives for other renewables.

Supports expanding the use of natural gas as a transitional energy source to boost supply and reduce costs, advocating for its role alongside renewables and nuclear until clean energy becomes more practical and affordable.

In an 2023 op-ed published in the Asbury Park Press, Ciattarelli said the government incentives being used to drive the mandate forward are “insulting and unfair” to working-class people. In May of 2025 Mr. Ciattarelli posted on his social media accounts that he would eliminate the electric vehicle mandates on day one of his administration.

His energy affordability plan centers on repealing what he calls costly state mandates for electric vehicles, appliances, and home construction, which he believes drive up expenses for residents, especially the working and middle class. He also pledges to reform the NJBPU to speed up energy project approvals.

READ THEIR SIDE-BY-SIDE COMPARISON

The energy policy plans of Mikie Sherrill and Jack Ciattarelli both recognize New Jersey’s rising energy costs and the importance of a reliable power supply, but they differ sharply on how quickly and by what methods the state should change its energy mix. Their opposing approaches will shape New Jersey’s future strategies for balancing energy security, affordability, and environmental goals, as the state faces challenges from high electricity rates and dependence on imported power.

The New Jersey gubernatorial race offers voters a clear choice on energy policy: Sherrill advocates for a swift shift to 100% clean energy with investments in renewables and support for nuclear power, while Ciattarelli favors a gradual transition that maintains current use of natural gas and nuclear to prioritize affordability and reliability.

The upcoming governor will face mounting pressure to address rising electricity rates and ensure energy security. The 2025 gubernatorial race will determine whether New Jersey doubles down on a clean energy future or pursues alternative strategies for stabilizing rates and securing its energy supply.",https://originnjbiz.wpenginepowered.com/files/2025/09/Candidates-Energy-sRGB_feature-image.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 15:04:10.292921

This year, it’s been rechristened to something much simpler: the Cheap Energy Act.
Although oil and gasoline prices have stayed low this year, electricity prices have surged.
That points to the bill’s hybrid nature: Although it’s focused on cheap energy, it retains many policies from an era when Democrats were focused more exclusively on reducing carbon emissions.
If Democrats really do want cheap energy for consumers at all costs, as Casten said, are they willing to accept, say, new fossil fuel development to get it?","House Democrats introduced a new package of proposals on Wednesday taking aim at rising electricity prices. The move signals a shift in how the party plans to talk about the energy industry — and an even bigger change in how the party plans to talk about climate change in the Trump 2.0 era.

After four years in which the party focused on climate change as an existential crisis, Democrats have reoriented to talking about energy chiefly as an affordability problem.

The new package, sponsored by Representatives Sean Casten and Mike Levin, would encourage new power line construction and strengthen utility regulation in much of the country. It would also restore longstanding tax credits for wind and solar energy, which were repealed as part of President Trump’s partisan tax and spending law earlier this year.

Many of the provisions, although not all of them, were first proposed in a Democratic bill called the Clean Electricity and Transmission Acceleration Act last year. This year, it’s been rechristened to something much simpler: the Cheap Energy Act.

“The purpose of the bill is a longtime wish of mine — that we would have an energy policy that puts the interests of American consumers first, by making sure that American consumers have access to cheap, reliable energy,” Representative Sean Casten, who is one of the bill’s coauthors, told me. “We’ve never done that as a country.”

In his view, achieving that goal will require many of the same policies that would cut carbon emissions. But that’s just good luck: “It’s a happy coincidence that cheap is synonymous with clean,” Casten said. “But the goal is cheap.”

The bill arrives at an unusual moment for the American energy economy. Although oil and gasoline prices have stayed low this year, electricity prices have surged. Over the past year, power costs have grown twice as fast as overall inflation. At the same time, the artificial intelligence boom — as well as the rise of electric vehicles and the country’s spate of new factories — have helped increase overall U.S. electricity demand for the first time in decades.

The politics of energy, in other words, have gone topsy-turvy. Americans normally sweat over gasoline prices and don’t think too much about their power bills. But this year, 57% of U.S. registered voters say that surging electricity costs are having at least “a decent amount” of influence on their personal finances, according to a recent Heatmap Pro poll.

“I believe very strongly that right now, in this moment — when electricity costs are increasing at double the rate of inflation, and when the administration has totally doubled down on fossil fuels — that highlighting the ability to transition to more affordable energy, and that clean energy is cheap energy, and talking about the bill in the context of cheap energy, is really the way to go,” Representative Mike Levin, a cosponsor of the bill and a Democrat from California, told me.

The Trump administration knows that electricity is becoming a political problem. Energy Secretary Chris Wright admitted last month that the Trump administration “is going to get blamed” for higher power prices, although he blamed the increase on Democratic policies.

The new Democratic bill contains a slew of reforms to the country’s energy and electricity policies — including some changes that nobody expects to pass under the current administration, and some that could potentially advance in a bipartisan fashion.

Some of the most important are around transmission. The law would beef up the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission’s ability to plan and approve large-scale cross-country power lines. It would create a new tax credit for developers who build transmission lines, similar to those that exist for other clean energy technologies.

“We have to make it easier to site transmission lines so that we build where we need to build,” Levin said.

The bill also includes a proposal — which has support from some Republicans — mandating that each region of the country have enough infrastructure to send a minimum amount of electricity to its neighbors. And perhaps most importantly, it lays out the rules for how utilities would divide the cost of a new power line — an accounting hurdle that has held back many transmission projects.

Another important set of proposals would reshape the utility industry. The bill would allow state regulators to engage in “performance-based ratemaking,” which compensates utilities for how well they save money rather than how much infrastructure they build. (This is closer to how the EU and United Kingdom regulate utilities — my cohost Jesse Jenkins and I talked about it on a recent episode of our podcast, Shift Key.)

Casten said that changing how utilities are regulated will ultimately get more new power generation built — and keep rates lower — than loosening permitting rules alone. “If we fix the profit incentives in the energy industry so that [utilities] make money by saving their consumers money, then permitting is easy,” he said. (Such an approach is “much smarter” than that taken by Senator Joe Manchin and John Barrasso in their permitting bill last Congress, he added.)

The bill would also allow the government to step in and cover some of the cost of new grid-enhancing or wildfire prevention equipment. It would also spend $2.1 billion to unsnarl and build manufacturing capacity for transformers, a key piece of grid equipment, through the Defense Production Act. Electrical transformers, which can step up or down electricity voltage, have been in short supply since the pandemic, helping to drive up power prices.

“We’re trying to figure out where the bottlenecks are and trying to unclog them, as best we can, so that we can actually deliver the lowest cost energy to the end user,” Levin said.

Other proposals appear to respond to Trump-led initiatives. For instance, the bill would limit the Energy Department’s ability to keep fossil fuel power plants open for an “emergency” when that emergency is more than a year in the future. The Trump administration has used this emergency authority to keep coal, oil, and gas plants open in Pennsylvania and the Midwest.

It would also require the Energy Department to study whether approving a new liquified natural gas export terminal would drive up domestic gas prices before approving it. “If you take gas out of the United States and send it overseas, you're going to reduce supply,” Casten said. “The mere act of connecting those markets raises prices.”

Yet the bill also includes a grab bag of environmental proposals from other Democratic bills, not all of which seem necessarily designed to produce cheap energy. The package would support owners of reflective roofs, expand community solar programs, and double the cap on how much the government can spend on the weatherization assistance program. It would have FERC pay nonprofits that participate in public comment periods on proposed regulations — an approach already used in California — and it would speed up permitting approvals for infrastructure projects that include a community benefit agreement.

That points to the bill’s hybrid nature: Although it’s focused on cheap energy, it retains many policies from an era when Democrats were focused more exclusively on reducing carbon emissions. That change might make for good politics, but it leaves key questions about the future of Democratic energy policy unanswered. If Democrats really do want cheap energy for consumers at all costs, as Casten said, are they willing to accept, say, new fossil fuel development to get it?

Levin demurred. Democrats will next face something like that choice when Congress takes up a bipartisan permitting reform package, he said. But as long as the Trump administration continues to wage a regulatory war on wind and solar projects, he said, then it doesn’t make sense for Democrats to come to the table to negotiate a bill like that.

“If the [natural] gas folks — if they actually want a good-faith dialogue around what the energy system needs — an actual system analysis, looking at AI and data centers and all the rest of it, and then looking at what the permitting situation needs to look like — that would be one thing. But we’re not seeing that. We’re seeing a reflexive repetition of President Trump’s message that wind is bad,” he told me.

“I don’t know how we could have a good faith discussion around permitting reform — or a bipartisan permitting reform package — that would make any sense when people are saying things that are objectively untrue,” Levin said. Many Republican officials “know better,” he added, naming Wright and Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum. “But they don’t want to get sideways with Trump.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY0MDg2OC9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NzEyODc2Nn0.UsWyKY1KAqOgfue3xVwweSmg4I3MqLNrfdk6_mDQAsA/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-24 14:02:44.982517

In his speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Donald Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world.” He complained that scientists used to warn the governments about “global cooling … then they said global warming will kill the world.” Yet “all of these predictions made by the United Nations and many others, often for bad reasons, were wrong. They were made by stupid people” from countries with “no chance for success.” He urged other nations that “if you don’t get away from this green scam, your country is going to fail.”

Scientists first suggested over a century ago that the carbon dioxide released from burning fossil fuels could create a greenhouse effect warming the planet and destabilizing the climate norms in which human beings evolved to survive. As global emissions of carbon and other planet-heating gases have surged over the past several decades, the Earth’s average temperature has risen by more than 1 degree Celsius, an increase that the overwhelming majority of scientists around the world attribute to pollution from fossil fuels and agriculture. The Trump administration issued a report written by contrarians who raised the possibility that climate change won’t be as bad as most scientists say, but more than 1,000 peer-reviewed researchers signed onto a letter condemning the findings. In a statement on the president’s UN speech, Gina McCarthy, the Obama-era Environmental Protection Agency chief and the Biden administration’s climate policy director, said Trump “continues to embarrass the U.S. on the global stage and undermine the interests of Americans at home. He’s rejecting our government’s responsibility to protect Americans from the increasingly intense and frequent disasters linked to climate change that unleash havoc on our country.” For more on the basics of climate change, you can consult this explainer by Heatmap’s Jeva Lange.

3. Exclusive: New England unions sign historic offshore wind agreement

Rhode Island’s biggest labor federation has brokered a deal for union workers to carry out the construction on the SouthCoast Wind project, a 2.4-gigawatt offshore turbine array — and won what the Rhode Island AFL-CIO called the first agreement in the nation guaranteeing organized labor handles all the operations and maintenance of the facility. On a panel I moderated for the Climate Jobs National Resource Center on Tuesday evening, Rhode Island’s AFL-CIO president, Patrick Crowley, told me the “labor peace agreement” will help the union organize more workers in the offshore-wind industry. “The labor movement is in this to win, and we’re not ready to give up the fight yet,” he told me. “If developers want to have a winning strategy, they have to partner with organized labor, because we’re going to make sure that, come hell or high water, we get these things built.”

After a federal judge lifted Trump’s stop-work order halting construction on the Revolution Wind farm off Rhode Island’s coast, a project that was 80% complete before the president’s abrupt intervention, Crowley said executives immediately directed workers onto boats to restart work on the turbines.

Microreactor developer Oklo’s stock price has been on a tear for months, surging to $21 billion in September despite no revenue or completed facilities. That’s starting the change. On Tuesday, the company broke ground on its debut nuclear plant at the Idaho National Laboratory. The California startup, which is also seeking to construct the nation’s first nuclear recycling plant, is the only company in the Department of Energy’s newly established Reactor Pilot Program to secure two projects in the federal effort to prove that new reactor technologies – Oklo’s tiny reactors use a different and rarer kind of coolant and fuel than the entire U.S. commercial fleet – can successfully sustain fission reactions by next July.

“As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race,” Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum said in a statement.

5. U.S.-backed startup looks to break China’s stranglehold on gallium

Earlier this month, the federal Defense Logistics Agency backed Xerion Advanced Battery Corp. to help the Ohio-based startup’s efforts to commercialize a novel technology for processing cobalt for batteries. Now, as I reported in an exclusive for Heatmap on Tuesday, the company is applying its approach to refining gallium, another key industrial metal over which China has a monopoly grip.

It’s not the so-called DLA’s only push into minerals. On Tuesday, Reuters reported that the agency is seeking to stockpile up to $40 million worth of scandium oxide over the next five years. The agency plans to buy the rare earth element used as an alloying agent used in aerospace, defense, and automotive technologies from mining giant Rio Tinto.

THE KICKER

A team of researchers in China found a way to turn clothianidin, a widely used pesticide notorious for accumulating in soil and crops and harming human health, into a nutrient for plants that removes the chemical from the dirt. Scientists at Hunan Agricultural University developed a novel biochar-based catalyst that converts the pesticide residues into ammonium nitrogen, a form of fertilizer that helps crops grow. “Instead of simply eliminating pesticides, we can recycle their nitrogen content back into the soil as fertilizer,” Hongmei Liu, a co-author of the study, said in a press release. “It offers a win–win solution for food safety and sustainable agriculture.”",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MTY0NDE1Mi9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTgwNTcwNzY5OH0.VA955vN07bZFMlXa4_JKjAkhyu-5o_f2K0JJ5tHC7_o/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-09-24 14:03:31.015898

This story was originally published by Canary Media and is reproduced here as part of the Climate Desk collaboration.

Since 2021, the Sierra Club has been grading US utilities on their commitment to a clean-energy transition. While most utilities have not earned high marks on the group’s annual scorecards, as a whole they had been showing some progress.

That’s over now. The latest edition of the Sierra Club’s ​“The Dirty Truth” report finds that the country’s biggest electric utilities are collectively doing worse on climate goals than when the organization started tracking their progress five years ago. This year they earned an aggregate grade of ​“F” for the first time.

With only a handful of rare exceptions, US utilities have shed the gains they made during the Biden administration. Almost none are on track to switch from fossil fuels to carbon-free energy at the speed and scale needed to combat the worst harms of climate change. “It’s very disappointing to find we’re at a lower score than in the first year,” said Cara Fogler, managing senior analyst at the Sierra Club, who coauthored the report. But it’s not entirely unexpected.

Utilities had already begun slipping on their carbon commitments last year, in the face of soaring demand for electricity, according to the 2024 ​“Dirty Truth” report, largely in response to the boom in data centers being used to power tech giants’ AI goals. But the anti-renewables, pro–fossil fuels agenda of the Trump administration and Republicans in Congress has pushed that reversal into overdrive.

“We have a new federal administration that’s doing everything in their power to send utilities in a direction away from cleaner power,” Fogler said. ​“They’re doing away with everything in the Inflation Reduction Act that supported clean energy. They’re straight-up challenging clean energy, as we’ve seen with Revolution Wind,” the New England offshore wind farm that’s now under a stop-work order. ​“And they’re doing everything in their power to keep fossil fuels online”—for example, through Department of Energy actions that force coal, oil, and gas plants to keep running even after their owners and regulators had agreed on retirement dates.

But utilities also bear responsibility for not doing more to embrace technologies that offer both cleaner and cheaper power, Fogler said. ​“From a cost perspective, from a health perspective, from a pollution perspective, there are so many reasons to build more clean energy and fewer fossil fuels. Unfortunately, we’re seeing that utilities are much less concerned about doing the right thing for the climate and their customers.”

For its new report, the Sierra Club analyzed 75 of the nation’s largest utilities, which together own more than half the country’s coal and fossil-gas generation capacity. The report measures utilities’ plans against three benchmarks: whether they intend to close all remaining coal-fired power plants by 2030, whether they intend to build new gas plants, and how much clean-energy capacity they intend to build by 2035.

As of mid-2025, the utilities had plans to build only enough solar and wind capacity to cover 32 percent of what’s forecast to be needed by 2035 to replace fossil-fuel generation and satisfy new demand. While 65 percent of the utilities have increased their clean-energy deployment plans since 2021, 31 percent have reduced them.

Meanwhile, commitments to reduce reliance on fossil fuels have taken a big step backward as utilities have turned to keeping old coal plants running and are planning to build more gas plants to meet growing demand. As of mid-2025, the utilities had plans to close only 29 percent of coal generation capacity by 2030, down from 30 percent last year and 35 percent in 2023.

And the amount of gas-fired generation capacity the utilities plan to build by 2035 spiked to 118 gigawatts as of mid-2025. That’s up from 93 gigawatts in 2024, and more than twice the 51 gigawatts planned in 2021.

That expanding appetite for new gas-fired power has been supercharged by the surge in forecasted electricity demand across much of the country—data centers are the primary driver of that growth. But much of that expected data-center demand is speculative. And the lion’s share of it is premised on the idea that the hundreds of billions of dollars in AI investments from tech giants like Amazon, Google, Meta, and Microsoft, as well as AI leaders like OpenAI and Anthropic will end up earning those companies enough money to pay off their costs—a risky bet.

The Sierra Club is among a growing number of groups demanding that utilities and regulators proceed with caution in building power plants to serve data centers that may never materialize. Forecasted data-center power demand is already driving up utility rates for everyday customers in some parts of the country, and the new gas power plants now in utility plans aren’t even built yet.

“There is some load we’re naturally going to see—there’s population growth, lots of beneficial electrification we want to see happen,” said Noah Ver Beek, senior energy campaigns analyst at the Sierra Club and another coauthor of the report. ​“But we also want utilities to be realistic about load-growth projections.”

Unfortunately, booming demand growth gives utilities ​“more cover” to invest in polluting assets, Fogler said. Utilities earn guaranteed profits on the money they spend building power plants and grid infrastructure, which gives them an incentive to avoid questioning high-growth forecasts or seeking out lower-cost or less-polluting alternatives.

Some of the most aggressive fossil fuel expansions are planned for the Midwest and Southeast, including by Dominion Energy in Virginia, Duke Energy in North Carolina, and Georgia Power.

Even the handful of utilities that have previously earned high marks for clean-energy and coal-closure commitments in past ​“Dirty Truth” reports have slipped. Fogler highlighted the example of Indiana utility NIPSCO, which earned an ​“A” in the past four reports but only a ​“B” in the latest, largely due to its plan to rely on gas power plants to meet expected data-center demand.

NIPSCO has ​“no plans to pursue the high-load-growth scenario until they see contracts signed and progress made,” Fogler said—a prudent approach that avoids burdening customers with the costs of new power plants built for data centers that may never come online, she said. ​“The problem? Their high-load-growth scenario calls for all new gas. There should be more clean options.”

Most utilities are not capitalizing on the solar and wind tax credits that are set to disappear in mid-2026 under the megalaw passed by Republicans in Congress this summer, she said. Only a handful of utilities, such as Xcel Energy in Colorado and Minnesota, are accelerating their clean-energy deployments to take advantage of those tax credits. ​“We want more utilities to take that period of certainty and speed up what they’ve already planned.”

Going big on clean energy is also the only way to quickly add enough generation capacity to meet growing demand forecasts and contain rising utility costs, Ver Beek noted. Utilities and major tech companies are pinning their near-term capacity expansion plans on new gas plants, despite the yearslong manufacturing backlogs for the turbines that power those plants and rapidly rising turbine costs.

It all adds up to proof there’s still plenty of pent up demand for new vehicles, Smoke said.
If the import tariffs are Thing One, the demise after September 30 of federal EV tax credits qualifies as Thing Two.
“No question we have seen clearly in the data that the first quarter almost always sucks for EV sales.
It will be interesting, however, to see how the various EV brands perform on a more level playing field when there’s no dividing line between those that qualified for tax credits and those that didn’t.","Somehow the auto industry and consumers are figuring out how to deal with the double jeopardy of import tariffs and the impending end of federal tax credits for many electric vehicles, and it’s not at all how insiders thought it would all go down.

When President Donald Trump announced he planned to impose stiff tariffs on imported vehicles among other products, consumers made a mad dash to dealer lots to beat expected price hikes on post-tariff vehicles.

The expectations were dealers would be left with fewer vehicles on their lots and prices would skyrocket on cars and trucks made outside the United States and sales would tank.

It all seemed logical, but sometimes logic doesn’t mirror reality.

Indeed, what happened over the summer is more like an amusement park ride to Cox Automotive chief economist Jonathan Smoke.

“So you’re seeing inventory deliveries slow down, but yet sales are stronger. So we are seeing supply tighten, a bit like it was back in 2021 or 2022, but it’s created what I’ll call this summer, particularly, a love roller coaster,” observed Smoke during a panel on sales trends at the Automotive News World Congress in Detroit on Thursday.

It all adds up to proof there’s still plenty of pent up demand for new vehicles, Smoke said.

That expected tariff-triggered price spike? It was more like a thumb tack.

Average new vehicle prices rose only about a hundred bucks between July and August from $49,400 to $49,500, according the Car Gurus August 2025 Intelligence Report released Thursday.

“Even with rising import costs and economic uncertainty, the market is showing surprising strength. Prices for both new and used vehicles held steady in August, while demand hit multi-year highs. For buyers, that means strong competition for value models—especially affordable EVs, which surged ahead of upcoming tax credit changes,” wrote report author Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market Intelligence at CarGurus.

There’s also the fear of missing out factor, even if not missing out on a new car or truck means missing out on the make or model first on a consumer’s list.

“There's still this disconnect, sort of between how consumers are feeling and what they're doing,” observed Ford Motor Company chief economist Emily Kolinski Morris during Thursday’s panel. “So they may be rushing out to get what they think are the last of the deals. They don't seem to be particularly happy about it.”

So who’s picking up the tab on the added tariff expense? It’s not that easy.

In keeping with Smoke’s “love roller coaster” there are ups and downs. Average list prices of new vehicles actually fell about $500 from $50,000 to $49,500 between April 2 and August 31, according to the CarGurus report.

While some automakers did lower their prices, some, including the Detroit Three companies, Mitsubishi, Subaru, Hyundai, Volvo and Jaguar Land Rover boosted theirs as 2026 models reach showrooms.

But don’t be fooled. That doesn’t mean the cost of other vehicle brands declined as automakers found ways to make up the difference, according to Jessica Caldwell, AVP insights, at auto research site Edmunds.com.

“We have seen is an increase in destination prices in 2025 model year, the average destination was over $1,500. That's another like way I think that you could see some cost increases, and then also changes in vehicle contenting and trim levels,” Caldwell said during the panel discussion.

Indeed, while the combination of pent up demand and ample inventories propped up sales over the summer, Smoke warns consumers are likely to soon see prices affected by tariffs as 2026 models arrive.

“About a quarter of what dealers have on their lots being model year ‘26 so we are seeing more of an acceleration in the increase in MSRP and invoice and average transaction price, but it's still well within what is normal for inflation,” Smoke said.

If the import tariffs are Thing One, the demise after September 30 of federal EV tax credits qualifies as Thing Two.

The rush to beat the deadline is continuing through September, with Smoke predicting record EV sales for the third quarter, boosted by both urgency from consumers and record incentives from some automakers.

But come October, the party is likely to be over.

“We’re going to hit a speed bump when those credits go away,” predicted Smoke. “No question we have seen clearly in the data that the first quarter almost always sucks for EV sales. So I would expect this to have a little bit of a hangover that's going to last us at least through the first quarter of next year.”

Given automakers already laid on generous incentives, Morris notes there’s not much more they can offer to mitigate loss of the tax credits. It will be interesting, however, to see how the various EV brands perform on a more level playing field when there’s no dividing line between those that qualified for tax credits and those that didn’t.

All three panelists agreed EV adoption is simply a slower process than the industry had hoped it would be, but that more consumers who desire some sort of electrified vehicle prefer hybrids.

“For a lot of people, a hybrid is fine, like, that's enough of a change,” said Caldwell. “Because I think for an EV, there is that fatigue of trying to learn something else, and especially like in the post-Covid world, where everyone is really stressed out, and we see this in customer surveys, is they don't necessarily want to buy an EV because they just don't want to. They don't want to deal with the hassle. They've got to figure out the charging situation and all of that, and you just don't want to deal with it.”

One thing is for sure, asserts Smoke, is that the number of internal combustion engine, or ICE, vehicles is beyond the point of growth, declaring that in terms of sales and those on the road, “we’re past peak ICE.”

Indeed, both consumers and the auto industry need to come to grips with a stark reality, said Smoke.

“It's going to be a multiple powertrain world, and we have to deal with the complexity of that.”

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) in August estimated 2 GW of domestic cell production capacity is online, compared with 57.5 GW of module capacity.
Another 19.3 GW of cell capacity is in the works, part of 34.1 GW of announced plans for capacity additions.","Vietnamese solar manufacturer Boviet Solar said it has finished installing a third module production line, adding 1 gigawatt of annual module production capacity in Greenville, N.C., where it already operated 2 GW.

The total of 3 GW in capacity to assemble the company’s proprietary Gamma Series monofacial and Gamma Series bifacial solar panels will pair with 3 GW of solar cell capacity that the company is installing in the same location, the company said in a release.

In late August, Boviet announced it had completed exterior construction for the second phase of its cell manufacturing facility, which it said would start volume production next year.

Boviet’s news is sure to hearten solar-industry observers tracking a resurgence in the U.S. domestic manufacturing industry, which has made something of a comeback from severe retrenchment in the face of low-price Chinese imports.

All eyes are particularly focused on developments in domestic cell fabrication. While many manufacturers have brought back gigawatt-plus module-production plants, only a few, such as ES Foundry in South Carolina and Suniva in Georgia, are domestically producing cells.

Earlier-than-expected phaseouts of federal tax incentives for solar have further begged the question of whether announced plans for adding cell capacity, such as Qcells’ intention to include cell production in its intended fully vertically integrated plant in Carterville, Ga., remain on track for completion. Boviet’s announcements of progress to expand both cell and module production might be considered important data points in favor of domestic production.

The Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA) in August estimated 2 GW of domestic cell production capacity is online, compared with 57.5 GW of module capacity. Another 19.3 GW of cell capacity is in the works, part of 34.1 GW of announced plans for capacity additions.

Founded in 2013 in Vietnam, Boviet projects that it will spend a total of $400 million on its Greenville production site, creating more than 1,300 high-skill local jobs once all production phases are online.

EPA considers wastewater injection permit for Montana Renewables in Pondera County

Evans serves as vice president of government relations for Montana Renewables.

However, Pondera County officials oppose the proposal, citing environmental concerns.

""The commissioners had been assured this would be such a good thing for Pondera County, but the more we looked into it, we thought this if this wastewater migrated into any of the usable aquifers, it could be disastrous,"" Corrine Rose said.

Rose is the Pondera County sanitarian.

Evans said Montana Renewables will comply with all EPA requirements for water quality standards.

""What I can confirm is that what EPA requires from a water quality perspective, for any injection water, we will meet or exceed that,"" Evans said.

Rose also criticized how the EPA has characterized the community in its assessment.

""They characterize us as being, we're losing population and low population. Well, we're important too, and I agree that that's a little offensive. So that is not a reason to then use this area as a waste disposal site,"" Rose said.

We will update you as we get more information.

(JUNE 3, 2024) Many Pondera County and Rocky Mountain Front residents are concerned over a proposed plan to classify wells in the area to Class V, which would allow wastewater from Montana Renewables to be injected thousands of feet below into the Madison Aquifer.

Montalban Oil & Gas is seeking permits from the Environmental Protection Agency, so Montana Renewables can inject their wastewater into the earth.

Pondera County citizens concerned over proposed injection well plan

Montana Renewables create sustainable aviation fuel. To do so they clean feedstocks, creating a by-product referred to as ‘agricultural wash water’. They’re working with Montalban Oil & Gas who are looking to receive permits from the EPA to give the wells Class V distinction. This would permit the injection of treated non-hazardous waste which may have been hazardous prior. Water is taken from the Missouri river.

Some critics have called the extraction of water from the Missouri River to be resource shedding, and damaging to the ecosystem. The water that is pulled goes into an aquifer and not back into the river.

“They need to put up a treatment plant. So at least the City of Great Falls can use that water with that amount of water being taken out of the river,” says David Waldner, a Hutterite living in a colony just a mile or so from one of the proposed injection sites.

Some individuals are calling on Montana Renewables to invest in a treatment plant, so the water can be put back into the river rather than wasted. The company are due to receive a $600 million loan. With he money, they plan to upscale production instead. Montana Renewables have said they plan to submit a discharge permit application to treat their wastewater at the city of Great Falls Water Treatment Plant.

Water planned to be injected has been characterized by Montana Renewables as non-hazardous. Some people are unsure. The Pondera County Sanitarian, Corrine Rose, says despite multiple requests for a sample of injection fluid, she has been repeatedly denied.

When I spoke with Chad Anderson of the Montana DEQ, he told me that Montana Renewables has the responsibility to send in fluid for sampling and testing. With their current Class II permits, they send their sample to Montana Board of Oil & Gas. If the Class V permits are granted, they will send a sample to the EPA. Because the permits haven’t been granted, they have no legal obligation to share their samples with anybody else. If the injection permit is granted, a sample can be shared with the public by way of petition.

Critics who believe Montana Renewables are ‘hiding something’ by withholding their sample say this is counter-intuitive because at this point the fluid would already be in the process of being injected.

I received a letter from the CEO of Montana Renewables Bruce Fleming, which was also sent to Pondera County Commissioners. In it, he outlined a response to some concerns, especially those regarding the contamination of drinking wells. The letter states that the Madison Aquifer (where wastewater will be injected) is not drinkable and that the aquifer does not contact surface water supplies based off geology and experience. It also states the permit they hope to receive would put a ‘cap’ on the maximum quantity of water allowed for injection. The proposed amount being a “tiny fraction of a percent in an enormous, non-potable, deep aquifer.”

The EPA are no longer holding public comment sessions, and many living along the Rocky Mountain Front believe the permits will be granted imminently.

“They're willing to do this because there's not many people there. Well, there's still people there that live in these areas of these two injection wells and those people, according to the Constitution of the state of Montana, have a right to dignity,” says another concerned Montanan, Nathan White.",https://ewscripps.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/5d8a56e/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1920x1008+0+36/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fewscripps-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F80%2Fa7%2F3da7cf2f4ebb87a030c696ad04bb%2Fkrtv00002.png,N,,2025-09-24 14:03:00.137430

The Urban Institute projects that in 2026, the average premium paid by individuals or households with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level (250 percent of the federal poverty level is $39,125 for an individual) would be $919, up from $169.
Premiums would more than double, from $1,171 to $2,455, for people with incomes from 250 percent to 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
And they would nearly double, from $4,436 to $8,471, for people with incomes above 400 percent of the federal poverty level.
If Congress acts quickly, states can lock in lower premiums and spare families a wave of sticker shock this fall,” the letter said.","Without congressional action, more than 7 million people who buy their health insurance on Affordable Care Act marketplaces would pay much higher premiums next year. Close to 5 million of them wouldn’t be able to absorb the price hike – nor would they be able to afford to buy coverage anywhere else, according to a new analysis.

The study by the Urban Institute, a left-leaning research organization, estimates that in eight states (Georgia, Louisiana, Mississippi, Oregon, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, and West Virginia) the number of people buying subsidized insurance from the marketplace would drop by at least half. Non-Hispanic Black people, non-Hispanic white people, and young adults would see the largest increases in the number of insured.

Enrollment in marketplace coverage surged from 11.4 million people in 2020 to 24.3 million this year, largely because of enhanced federal subsidies first made available by the American Rescue Plan Act in 2021 and later extended through the end of 2025 by the Inflation Reduction Act.

Unless Congress extends the subsidies, they will expire at the end of this year.

The Urban Institute projects that in 2026, the average premium paid by individuals or households with incomes below 250 percent of the federal poverty level (250 percent of the federal poverty level is $39,125 for an individual) would be $919, up from $169.

And they would nearly double, from $4,436 to $8,471, for people with incomes above 400 percent of the federal poverty level.

Jessica Banthin, a senior fellow at the Urban Institute, said in an interview that the expiration of the tax credits would leave millions without access to any affordable health care options. She also noted that it likely would raise the cost of insurance for those who do remain on the marketplaces.

“People who are sicker will make the effort or find the money to stay enrolled,” Banthin said. “People who are healthier are more likely to leave the marketplace and either find another source of coverage or stay uninsured — they’re more likely to risk it.”

“And so what that means is the people remaining in the marketplace are a little bit sicker on average than they were before, and that means the risk pool is more costly, and premiums go up across the board.”

Last week, Democratic governors from 18 states sent a letter to congressional leaders of both parties, urging them to extend the subsidies.

“The timing couldn’t be more urgent. Insurers are already setting 2026 rates. If Congress acts quickly, states can lock in lower premiums and spare families a wave of sticker shock this fall,” the letter said. “If not, the damage will be felt for years.”",https://kiowacountypress.net/sites/default/files/favicon-512.png,N,,2025-09-24 14:03:41.194410

It was not immediately clear which funds were being targeted. The department did not immediately respond to a request for more details.

""By returning these funds to the American taxpayer, the Trump administration is affirming its commitment to advancing more affordable, reliable and secure American energy and being more responsible stewards of taxpayer dollars,"" the department said.

President Donald Trump dismissed climate change as ""the greatest con job"" in the world during his address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, doubling down on his skepticism of global environmental initiatives and multilateral institutions.

Trump has pushed to maximize the output of oil and gas, which were already at record production when he returned to office in January, while cutting subsidies for renewable energy and EVs.

Energy Secretary Chris Wright mentioned cancelling the funds in a press conference in New York earlier in the day. Wright said Trump sent a message that the UN and many countries ""have just gotten wildly off track with climate change, exaggerating it into the world's greatest threat. It has spurred massive amounts of spending with very little positive impact.""

But jobs in solar, wind and other clean energy industries grew three times faster than in the rest of the U.S. workforce in 2024, said a study published by environmental advocacy group E2, last week, saying that many of them could go due to Trump's efforts to block renewables.

Wright also said that he has no plans to go to UN climate talks in Brazil in November. But Wright said he enjoys talking about energy and climate with people who see things differently than him, so ""nothing is impossible"" when it comes to his participation in Brazil.

It would help companies ""jump through the hoops,"" he said, putting business owners and others in touch with local economic development officials and assisting them with navigating regulations rather than ""picking winners and losers.""

Leonard wants to do away with the Michigan Economic Development Corp, a quasi-governmental agency, in favor of the Michigan Business Action Center. It is among 58 recommendations in his policy agenda released Wednesday, a blueprint he wanted to put out early, he said, to be transparent with voters, to show he is passionate about governing and to present a ""positive vision focused on real solutions to solve problems.""

Other proposals include restoring the ""right-to-work"" law that Democrats repealed in 2023, confronting the literacy crisis with moves such as promoting kids to 4th grade only when benchmarks are met, cutting the 4.25% state income tax to 3.9% and ultimately phasing it out, adopting universal occupational license reciprocity and redirecting ""corporate welfare"" incentives to road funding.

""The scope would be completely refocused,"" Leonard told Crain's of economic development efforts. ""Instead of having a department that hands out hundreds of millions of dollars to select companies, sometimes at the cost of $400,000 per job, this Michigan Business Action Center would be what I would deem a customer service center for all businesses large and small.""

It would help companies ""jump through the hoops,"" he said, putting business owners and others in touch with local economic development officials and assisting them with navigating regulations rather than ""picking winners and losers.""

Leonard, a former House speaker who is one of six Republicans, three Democrats and one independent running for governor, said he is not opposed to state-funded business development programs ""as long as it's fair for everybody,"" adding that he supports things like workforce education and certification.

He criticized giving individual businesses cash or tax breaks up front for jobs and investment but said he backs transformational brownfield plans in which developers put money in and, if successful, get a tax cut on the back end. If they fail, he said, taxpayers are ""not out anything.""

The MEDC's Business Development and Community Revitalization programs, which are funded at $100 million, are in limbo during an ongoing budget impasse in the Capitol that might lead to a partial government shutdown next week.

Second-term Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, who cannot run again in 2026 due to term limits, proposed keeping them intact. The Republican-led House's budget would eliminate all $100 million. The Democratic-controlled Senate's budget would slash the funding by $59 million.

Leonard said the Strategic Outreach and Attraction Reserve Fund, which was created in 2021, should be eliminated immediately and the money spent on fixing roads and bridges. Automatic $500 million annual deposits into the account are due to end in the coming fiscal year, though Whitmer last week renewed her call for ""new job-creating tools"" to stay competitive with other states and countries.

Leonard said ""subsidies is not the answer. It is the right regulatory and licensure environment, making Michigan a right-to-work state and (having) the right tax environment but also making certain that you have an educated workforce. We've got to address this third-grade reading crisis, and we've got to do something to bring more skilled trades workers into the state of Michigan.""

Other proposals listed in Leonard's plan include:

Ending mandatory implicit bias training for health care professionals, which Whitmer ordered in 2020.

Providing property tax relief by giving competitive grants to local governments and schools that consolidate services; protecting caps even when homes are sold and taxes ""pop up""; and requiring all millage requests to appear on ballots in November of even-numbered years, when turnout is highest.

They’re all urging the EPA—led by former New York State Assemblymember and former Congressmember Lee Zeldin—to abandon the proposal and maintain current climate protections.
The endangerment finding established that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public welfare, and served as the basis for many regulations under the Clean Air Act.
Per the EPA, current greenhouse gas standards increase prices, limit consumer choice, and keep old vehicles on the road.
Here’s the letter from James and the other AGs: And here’s the letter from New York’s congressional Democrats:","ALBANY, N.Y. (NEXSTAR) — New York Attorney General Letitia James and the state’s Democratic congressional delegation are working against a proposal by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to rescind a climate change finding. James, alongside attorneys general from over 20 states, both U.S. Senators from New York, and 18 members of the House of Representatives want to preserve the 2009 “endangerment finding” establishing greenhouse gas emissions as a threat to public health and welfare.

They’re all urging the EPA—led by former New York State Assemblymember and former Congressmember Lee Zeldin—to abandon the proposal and maintain current climate protections. Concerned over the EPA’s proposal to roll back the endangerment finding, the electeds published two separate letters to Zeldin and the EPA, available to read at the bottom of this story.

In a press release, James said, “Climate change is real, it is dangerous, and it is already hurting communities in New York and across the nation.” The EPA said that the regulations in question cost Americans $1 trillion in aggregate costs, plus an additional $54 billion each year.

The endangerment finding established that greenhouse gas emissions threaten public welfare, and served as the basis for many regulations under the Clean Air Act. The letter-writers insist that undermining the legal basis for the EPA’s climate regulations will make the environment less livable for New Yorkers. Under Zeldin, who prizes deregulation, the agency wants to repeal all greenhouse gas emission standards for vehicles and engines.

Claiming that its prior scientific analysis was unreasonable, doubtful, and unreliable, the EPA said that it can’t actually set emission standards over climate concerns under the Clean Air Act. The agency uses several legal arguments, including the “major questions doctrine” saying that major policy decisions must be explicitly authorized by Congress and not left to regulatory agencies. EPA also claims its previous findings on fossil fuels were flawed because they considered a mix of gases, not just carbon dioxide in isolation.

EPA is basing its proposed rollback at least in part on the Climate Working Group report from the U.S. Department of Energy. It suggested that scientific climate models “run hot,” overestimating future warming. It also suggested that there are benefits to increased carbon dioxide in the world, such as promoting plant growth. Per the EPA, current greenhouse gas standards increase prices, limit consumer choice, and keep old vehicles on the road.

Attorney General James—leading prosecutors from Arizona, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Delaware, Hawaii, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Minnesota, Nevada, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin, and Washington D.C.—said that repealing the finding would violate established law, Supreme Court precedent, and broad scientific consensus. They contend that the known climate skeptics in DOE climate working group wrote an inaccurate report that didn’t meet scientific integrity standards.

The AG letter pointed to worsening risks of asthma, heart disease, and premature death without climate protections, especially among children, the elderly, and poor communities. James’s office also underscored a previous EPA analysis showing that current vehicle standards could prevent over 8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide-equivalent emissions in the next 30 years, saving $1.82 trillion that would be spent to repair climate-related damage.

In their letter, the congressional delegation said that climate change is already affecting the state from Montauk to Niagara Falls. They pointed out specific climate-related events that have impacted the state since 2009, including Hurricane Irene and Tropical Storm Lee in 2011, Superstorm Sandy in 2012, Hurricane Ida in 2021, and historic snowstorms in Western New York in November and December 2022.

The delegation tallied average temperatures in New York as having risen by nearly 2.6 degrees since 1901 and will increase by as much as 11 degrees by 2100. This warming trend is particularly dangerous in cities. New York City’s urban heat island effect traps and intensifies heat, and days over 95 degrees will be 50 times likelier in Albany, Rochester, Syracuse, and Binghamton by the end of the century, they said.

The lawmakers—Senators Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand, and Reps. Yvette Clarke, Adriano Espaillat, Dan Goldman, Hakeem Jeffries, Timothy Kennedy, George Latimer, John Mannion, Gregory Meeks, Grace Meng, Joseph Morelle, Jerrold Nadler, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, Josh Riley, Patrick Ryan, Tom Suozzi, Paul Tonko, Ritchie Torres, and Nydia Velázquez—said that these disasters have already caused billions in damage to infrastructure, private property, and ecosystems statewide. They made the case that, as these events become stronger or more common, New Yorkers with worsening health conditions will be on the hook for recovery costs from heat waves and sea level rise: storms, wildfires, floods, and drought.

The letter also points out that hotter, more humid ecosystems are increasing tick populations, leading to more cases of Lyme disease and higher healthcare costs, especially on Long Island and in the Hudson Valley. The ocean also acidifies by absorbing carbon dioxide as temperatures go up, damaging coral reefs and shellfish, according to the attorneys general.

The state’s agriculture industries like apple orchards and dairy farms are also in the crosshairs of rising temperatures, and winter recreation industries are also threatened by less snowfall, they said. New York has more ski areas than any other state.

Plus, the legislators said repealing the endangerment finding would undo pollution limits on power plants and fuel operations, which are of “particular importance to the public health of New Yorkers.” Gas-fired plants generated 46% of the electricity in the Empire State in 2023.

Why it matters: Worries about where to charge have long been a hindrance to EV adoption.

Once EV sales resume their natural, organic growth rate — which everyone in the industry expects to happen eventually — charging anxiety will likely be less of an issue.

Driving the news: EVs have been flying off dealer lots lately as consumers rush to take advantage of the expiring $7,500 federal tax credit.

In August, new EV sales hit a record 146,332 units, up almost 18% from a year ago, and accounting for 10% of all new car sales for the month. September looks to be another record, according to Cox Automotive.

Used EVs, eligible for a tax credit of up to $4,000, have also seen strong sales ahead of the deadline.

Inventories are shrinking because of the pull-ahead in demand, and many carmakers have indicated they'll cut EV production for the remainder of the year, further limiting availability.

The upshot: EV sales are widely expected to slow after Sept. 30.

Between the lines: A lull in EV sales could be well-timed because it can take years to get a single charging station up and running.

Local permitting and property acquisition take time, and utilities often need to first make expensive electrical upgrades.

Construction delays are also common.

After a slow start, the rollout of charging infrastructure is finally beginning to pick up steam.

""The flywheel is in motion,"" says GM's head of public charging, William Hotchkiss.

""We've got to make sure we don't lose momentum,"" he tells Axios. ""A potential slowdown in EV sales will allow infrastructure to catch up.""

By the numbers: A seminal 2023 study by the U.S. Department of Energy's National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) estimated the U.S. will need 28 million charging ports by 2030 in order to support 33 million EVs (a ""mid-scenario"" EV adoption rate).

The vast majority of those chargers would be private — Level 1 and 2 ports located at single-family homes, apartments and workplaces.

About 1 million of them would be publicly accessible Level 2 chargers at retail stores, libraries, parking garages and other locations near high-density neighborhoods.

Also needed: 182,000 DC fast-chargers along highways and in metro areas to accommodate EV road trips, ride-share drivers and others in need of a quick recharge.

Where it stands: We've still got a long way to go.

The U.S. currently has about 228,000 public charging ports — less than one-quarter of the number we'll need.

Of those, roughly 62,000 are DC fast-chargers — a third of what's needed.

Caveat: Since EV sales have been slower than expected, those targets aren't particularly urgent.

Today, there are about 5 million EVs on the road in the U.S., per S&P Global Mobility — well short of NREL's assumption of 33 million by 2030.

The DOE lab hopes to update those targets in a future study, NREL researcher Eric Wood tells Axios.

What they're saying: ""Regardless of future EV sales, we have to address the underlying challenge that, as it stands, charging infrastructure lags behind demand,"" Seth Cutler, CEO of Ionna, tells Axios.

Ionna, a joint venture between eight automakers, aims to build 30,000 charging bays by the end of 2030.

What to watch: After a six-month freeze, the Trump administration has resumed a Biden-era federal program to fund the installation of fast chargers along major highways.

The National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) program, while nabbing a lot of attention, accounts for only a small sliver of the nation's future charging infrastructure.

Most chargers are being built via private investment by companies that include gas and convenience stores, retailers like Walmart, as well as automakers hoping to prime the pump for EV sales.

Instead of reviving rebates, Newsom stated that the state would redirect funds toward expanding charging infrastructure.

California’s focus shift

During a San Francisco event on September 19, where he signed six climate-related bills, Newsom outlined the state’s pivot, as noted in an Autoblog report. While reiterating California’s leadership in clean transportation, Newsom emphasized that cap-and-trade revenues would bolster charging investments rather than consumer incentives.

“We can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits. There are billions and billions of dollars through 2045 in the cap-and-trade program that continue to make those infrastructure investments, but not the direct subsidies, that we cannot make up for, that were eliminated under the federal program,” Newsom stated.

California’s EV sector

California accounted for about 27% of all U.S. EV sales in 2024, highlighting the state’s central role in adoption, as per data from the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. Industry watchers have warned that without incentives, momentum could slow, though the success of Tesla’s vehicles like the Model Y suggests that good EVs could see success even without the federal tax credit.

Newsom also criticized Detroit automakers, singling out General Motors and CEO Mary Barra for what he described as “selling out” the state by opposing its 2035 ban on new gasoline vehicle sales. That regulation, known as Advanced Clean Cars II, is expected to cut greenhouse gas emissions by more than 35%, according to the California Air Resources Board.

Tesla (NASDAQ:TSLA) could deliver a stronger-than-expected third quarter, as per Wolfe Research, which stated that the EV maker’s vehicle deliveries could reach between 465,000 and 470,000 units this Q3 2025.

Such results would represent a 22% increase from Q2, topping consensus estimates of 445,000. “Q3 is poised to be a strong quarter,” the firm noted.

U.S. and China demand

In the U.S., Wolfe attributed part of the volume lift to consumers accelerating purchases ahead of the expiration of a $7,500 federal EV tax credit. On the other hand, China deliveries are also trending above prior expectations, with Wolfe estimating 165,000–170,000 deliveries in the region, or about 10,000 more than its earlier forecast, as noted n a Yahoo Finance report.

The firm noted that these figures do not yet include meaningful contributions from the newly launched Model Y L. “We estimate 165-170k deliveries in Q3, or ~10k above our prior est,” Wolfe stated, though these volumes “largely do not reflect the recent launch of the Model Y L.”

Earnings outlook

Wolfe noted that it expects Tesla’s Q3 earnings per share to fall between $0.55 and $0.60, which is above the current consensus of $0.49 per share. The firm forecasts automotive gross margins, excluding regulatory credits, of about 16.5% to 17%.

Looking ahead, Wolfe warned that Q4 could prove more challenging due to U.S. demand being pulled forward by tax incentives. Still, Wolfe suggested that factors like stronger seasonal demand in China and Europe could become tailwinds that could help the company’s volumes in the fourth quarter. The ramp and rollout of the Model Y L and upcoming affordable models could also help bolster the company’s Q4 volumes.

Tesla’s sales momentum in China is expected to rise this month, with Deutsche Bank estimating about 72,000 vehicle deliveries for September 2025.

Deutsche Bank’s estimate represents a 27% increase from August 2025, but is roughly flat compared to the same month last year.

Model Y L launch boosts order flow

Dealer feedback compiled by Deutsche Bank suggests that Tesla China’s new orders in September could reach around 73,000 units, which is roughly up 14% year-over-year, as noted in a CNEV Post report. The increase is attributed in no small part to the Model Y L, a six-seat long-wheelbase variant of the best-selling all-electric crossover that was launched last month.

Deliveries for the new model began earlier this September, with current orders scheduled for deliveries in November, as per Tesla China’s official website. Analysts also noted that the Model Y L could be a key driver of interest, particularly among larger households looking for vehicles that have higher seating capacity.

Tesla China’s insurance registrations

Tesla’s insurance registrations in China reached 46,950 units in the first three weeks of September 2025, pointing to a steady pace of deliveries for the month. For context, Tesla delivered 57,152 vehicles in August 2025, as per data from the China Passenger Car Association (CPCA). That figure represents a decrease of about 10% year-on-year, but an increase of over 40% from July 2025’s 40,617 units.

Deutsche Bank’s September projection, if proven accurate, would mark Tesla’s strongest monthly performance since the summer slowdown. China is still critical to Tesla’s overall delivery outlook heading into Q4, and the best-selling Model Y is still expected to play a central role in the company’s sales in the country.

Elon Musk recently addressed his proposed Tesla 2025 CEO Performance Award on X, highlighting that his concerns are about influence, not personal wealth.

The 2025 CEO Performance Award, worth up to $900 billion in TSLA stock, could make Elon Musk the world’s first trillionaire, provided that he hits incredibly ambitious targets for the electric vehicle maker.

Tesla’s ambitious targets

Musk shared his thoughts in a response to an X post that referenced his compensation package. “It’s not about ‘compensation,’ but about me having enough influence over Tesla to ensure safety if we build millions of robots.

“If I can just get kicked out in the future by activist shareholder advisory firms who don’t even own Tesla shares themselves, I’m not comfortable with that future,” Musk wrote in his post.

Tesla’s new performance award would grant Musk shares as the company grows from today’s $1.1 trillion valuation to an incredible $8.5 trillion within a decade. At that level, Tesla would become the world’s largest company by valuation by a notable margin, eclipsing today’s top companies such as Apple, Nvidia, and Microsoft.

Massive product goals

Elon Musk’s 2025 CEO Performance Award will not be easy to accomplish. To earn his award, Musk would have to lead Tesla an operating profit of $400 billion anually, a substantial increase from today’s $17 billion annually.

Musk’s influence would grow alongside Tesla’s valuation, with his stake rising from 13% to about 25%. Tesla’s board emphasized in its filing that retaining Musk is fundamental to hitting these milestones.

The package extends beyond financials, as it also ties compensation to milestones in Tesla’s core products and emerging technologies. These include the delivery of 20 million vehicles cumulatively, 10 million active Full Self-Driving subscriptions, and the deployment of 1 million robots, and the rollout of 1 million Robotaxis.",https://www.teslarati.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/shell-ev-charging-1000x600.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 13:03:40.323798

His attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion, and environmental justice are shredding support and protections from many angles.","Trump’s roll-backs of environmental justice funding and programs will directly harm communities already bearing the brunt of our country’s pollution.

Across the country, people are made to breathe noxious fumes and drink strange-tasting water that is making them sick. Perhaps it’s the nearby factory spewing pollution into the air, meatpacking plants dumping waste into rivers, or a cluster of oil refineries nearby. Many communities deal with multiple sources of pollution at once and outsized harm from climate disasters, too.

These problems are not distributed equally. Long legacies of discrimination and prejudice have corralled environmental burdens into Black, Brown, Indigenous, immigrant, rural, and low-income communities, bringing devastating illnesses as well.

The Biden administration, while it didn’t do nearly enough to redress those harms, took some historic first steps. But Trump is ruthlessly dismantling every bit of progress possible with cruel, targeted attacks on these environmental justice communities. Make no mistake — Trump’s rollbacks will cost lives.

Environmental Justice Communities Bear the Brunt of Polluting Industries

Dirty industries wreak havoc on our health across the country, and environmental justice communities bear the brunt by far. Folks in the Gulf Coast, for example, sit in the belly of the beast of the fossil fuel industry. Across Texas and Louisiana, this region has been inundated with polluting infrastructure.

In the town of Port Arthur, TX, residents have been forced to the frontlines of toxic pollution. Nearby sits the largest oil refinery in North America, along with two others. The liquefied natural gas and plastic industries are now also booming in the region.

These industries spew millions of pounds of pollutants into air and lungs, including toxic particulates and carcinogens like benzene and ethylene oxide. Port Arthur residents face a cancer risk 190 times higher than what the Environmental Protection Agency deems “acceptable.”

Gulf Coast communities take a double hit — first from the industry’s toxic air pollution and then from hurricanes and storms fueled by fossil fuel-driven climate change. Hurricane Harvey damaged or destroyed more than 80% of homes in Port Arthur and its neighbor, Beaumont.

These attacks on residents’ health and well-being are another chapter in the long story of racism and classism in this country.

Nationwide, kids in communities of color have asthma at seven times the rate of kids in mostly white communities, by one analysis. Environmental justice communities are less likely to have clean, running water or functioning sewage systems.

They’re also at higher risk during all sorts of climate disasters. For example, one study found that from 2004 to 2018, Indigenous people saw the highest rate of heat-related deaths, followed by Black people.

Environmental justice programs and policies were designed to bring relief and resources to these communities. But Trump’s actions will make matters worse for them. More people will get sick and die.

Trump’s Multi-Pronged Attack on Environmental Justice

For decades, environmental justice organizations have fought for the health and environment of their communities. The Biden administration finally started taking heed.

The Justice 40 initiative, for example, put down a marker. It committed to ensuring that 40% of the benefit from federal investment in housing and clean energy go to environmental justice communities that have been historically overburdened with pollution.

Policies like this were passed to reverse discrimination and injustices. But now, environmental justice has come under fire from the Trump administration, as part of its overall attacks on diversity, equity, and inclusion. His claims that environmental justice policies are “discriminatory” are insulting.

Providing federal support to these communities is essential to making amends. It’s a key part of achieving a world in which everyone — no matter their background, ethnicity, or class — has access to clean air, clean water, sustainable food, and a livable future.

Rather than create a brighter future, Trump is dragging us back into a dark past. His attacks on diversity, equity, inclusion, and environmental justice are shredding support and protections from many angles. In just a few months, Trump has kneecapped decades of progress by:

1. Attacking the very foundations of federal action on environmental justice.

In January, Trump struck down an executive order that, for more than 30 years, required agencies to consider how their decisions would affect the health and environment of people of color and low-income communities. This executive order formed the basis for many agency rules written to protect these communities. Now, those rules are more vulnerable to being struck down.

2. Letting polluters that are harming environmental justice communities off the hook.

The Trump administration has shamelessly used its opposition to diversity, equity, and inclusion as cover for letting polluters off the hook. For example, it terminated a Biden-era lawsuit against a plastic plant in Louisiana that connected the plant’s pollution with the elevated cancer risk of nearby majority-Black residents. By dropping the lawsuit, the Trump administration claimed it was fulfilling its aims of dismantling “radical DEI programs.”

3. Firing and reassigning federal workers dedicated to reducing pollution and delivering justice.

In January, the Trump administration issued a memo directing agencies to cut jobs dedicated to environmental justice and diversity, equity, and inclusion. A month later, Trump eliminated the Office of Environmental Justice at the Department of Justice, which supported communities in fighting polluters in court.

In March, he completely shuttered the Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) environmental justice arm and shut down 10 regional offices, impacting low-income rural communities. The staff in these regional offices worked on the ground with local groups and communities to address pollution.

Soon after, Trump’s EPA announced it would take more than 350 additional workers off the job of tackling pollution in environmental justice communities.

4. Rolling back policies that made environmental justice a major priority.

Early on in his presidency, Trump rescinded a suite of Biden’s executive orders that created an unprecedented focus on environmental justice. Among the programs cut was the aforementioned Justice40 initiative.

5. Cancelling funding for every single one of the EPA’s environmental justice grants.

These nearly 800 grants promised funding for projects to monitor, prevent, and clean up pollution in environmental justice communities, among other goals. In June, a group of nonprofits, Tribes, and local governments sued the Trump administration for canceling $3 billion in funding for 350 Environmental and Climate Justice Grant programs.

In particular, Trump has stopped projects that would have

Monitored air pollution in communities from oil refineries, heavy industry, fracking operations, and highways;

Built resilience hubs that would have provided food, educational opportunities, healthcare, electricity, laundry facilities, and shelter to low-income communities during climate disasters;

Installed wastewater systems in majority-Black Alabama communities where folks can’t afford them and must pipe raw sewage onto their lawns;

Planted trees to help clean the air and provide shade through increasingly hot summers (in cities nationwide, communities of color have fewer trees and endure hotter temperatures in heatwaves);

Built infrastructure to deliver clean, safe water to rural Latino communities in California that have long-relied on wells and small systems delivering pesticide-contaminated water;

Provided electric transit and home air quality upgrades to a predominantly Latino community in San Diego plagued with traffic pollution from nearby highways and industry;

Prevented flooding and erosion due to melting permafrost that threatens critical infrastructure for the Native Village of Kipnuk;

and much, much more.

Trump Is Attacking Communities’ Agency

Crucially, many environmental justice policies were designed not only to benefit communities but also to bring them to the table. For decades, our government and corporations have made development decisions while bulldozing over the needs and wishes of residents — from highways that slashed through majority-Black neighborhoods, to factory farms built right beside rural communities.

Taking the lead from grassroots groups and residents is therefore an essential part of environmental justice. Local communities know what’s best for them and should have a say in decisions about their communities and their land.

Notably, this is a key tenet of our bedrock environmental law, the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA). NEPA requires the government to take community input on major projects and has allowed residents to stop polluting projects in their communities.

But Trump is taking an axe to this law for the sake of fast-tracking corporate development and fossil fuel drilling. He has also explicitly directed agencies to stop environmental justice analyses when reviewing new projects under NEPA.

Trump isn’t content with taking away people’s health — he’s going after their agency and local democracy, too.

Oppose Trump’s Cruel Cuts to Environmental Justice!

Trump’s rampage against environmental justice programs will have terrible consequences across the country. Worse, when combined with his other policies, these environmental justice cuts become even crueler.

His Big, Ugly bill will kick millions off Medicaid, make healthcare more expensive, and shut down rural hospitals. At the same time, people will continue getting sick, as the government lets corporate polluters have their way with our air and water.

As with all of his agenda, Trump’s intentions are clear: make life worse for the rest of us, especially our most vulnerable neighbors, while clearing the way for more corporate profits. It’s more important than ever for us to stand with environmental justice groups and communities.

We need to fight these Trump policies that put lives and futures at risk. And we need to stop the industries that have harmed these communities for too long.

James Walkinshaw (VA-11) on Monday joined Protect Our Care Virginia to discuss the ongoing Trump-GOP health care disaster and the urgent need to stop GOP premium hikes by making Affordable Care Act enhanced Premium Tax Credits permanent. Without action from Congress, the enhanced Premium Tax Credits will expire at the end of this year.

Enhanced Premium Tax Credits have helped make health insurance affordable for326,268 Virginians enrolled in coverage through the Affordable Care Act (ACA), and eliminating them would make health care out of reach for too many, forcing Virginians to choose between health care and other basic necessities.

While nearly 9 out of 10 Virginia shoppers qualify for these income-based enhanced Premium Tax Credits (with some paying as little as $10 per month for a plan), insurance companies are seeking to raise premiums for all shoppers as they are anticipating a smaller and sicker pool of people if the credits are allowed to expire. Most of the companies who have agreed to participate in Virginia’s marketplace in 2026 have proposed average rate increases of 20% or higher to account for those who will no longer be able to afford to buy health insurance once they lose their tax credits.

Republicans have already broken their promise to bring down costs for everyday Americans by slashing funding for Medicaid in their Big Ugly Law, and they will continue to drive up costs if they take these tax credits away. Families across the country are already paying the price of the Trump-GOP budget bill and have spoken loudly and clearly that they oppose Republicans’ ongoing assaults on health care.Three rural health clinics in Virginia have already closed as a result of the Big Ugly Law, while six rural hospitals remain at risk of closure. 350,000 Virginians are projected to lose their health care as a result of the health care cuts, but that number can be mitigated with the permanent extension of the enhanced Premium Tax Credits.

“We must stop the upcoming Republican premium hikes,”said Congressman Scott.“Without action from Congress, the enhanced Premium Tax Credits will expire at the end of this year, and the health care costs will increase for more than 326,000 Virginians. Many will face unaffordable premium increases … those that are sick will pay the higher prices. Those that are healthy might drop out, which means that the insurance pool will be sicker and they’ll have to charge higher prices.”

“I was a member of the state Senate when we expanded Medicaid, and I also carried the bill to create the Virginia health care exchange,” said Congresswoman McClellan. “And the reason we did both, just like the reason the Affordable Care Act was passed in the first place, was because we understood that costs go down when the uninsured rate goes down. The more people who have access to health insurance, the more likely they are to get the care they need before it’s too late, or before it’s too expensive …. And yet, with this bill, so many people will not be able to afford health insurance or will lose it all together – over 15 million people – but they’ll still get sick, and instead of going and getting primary care or going when something first feels wrong, they’ll show up in the emergency room when it may be too late, and it’s definitely more expensive to treat, and if they’re uninsured and they can’t pay that bill, the rest of us pay for it.”

“I think one of the benefits that is not discussed enough is the benefit of the exchanges to entrepreneurs and folks who are self-employed,” said Congressman Walkinshaw.“By some estimates, 25% of folks who are on the Affordable Care Act exchanges are self-employed, and for many of them, it’s the existence of the exchanges and the affordability of the insurance on the exchanges that has allowed them to take that leap to start a business. And that’s something I hear my Republican colleagues talk about a lot … they say we should be encouraging entrepreneurship and business creation in this country. Well, if you take away affordable health care on the exchanges, millions of Americans who would like to start their own business will no longer be able to do it. And by the way, some folks who have a small business today who are doing the hardest thing you can do – get a small business off the ground — they’re learning that they might not be able to afford to keep that business going because of the Republican assault on health care.”

“[Republicans] are at it again. They’re coming at our health insurance, and I am one of the millions of Americans that is terrified of opening the mailbox and getting the sheet of paper that says what my premiums will be next year, because as a cancer survivor, I have to pay it,” said Laura Packard of Alexandria. “I cannot go without health insurance. So whatever they charge me, it’s what I have to pay, and if I get no help with paying for it, then I have to decide how I’m going to somehow pay for this health insurance. So millions of people are going to be going through this right now, and lives are at stake. So Republicans in Congress need to do the right thing and extend the tax subsidies now.”

“Many in the hospitality industry like myself rely on these credits to stay healthy and insured,” saidLester Johnson, who owns a restaurant in Richmond. “Before the Affordable Care Act, it was hard for small business owners and self-employed people to get health insurance, but this law has been a much-needed resource to me and my employees. I was able to sign up for a plan, and I have employees who are able to get their insurance through the marketplace as well. Premiums have been affordable for me as well as my staff … We do not want to have to come back and keep fighting this fight every year. So please make these tax credits permanent to give the small businesses and working people one less thing to worry about. Times are already tough, and we cannot afford to lose our health care.”

The initiative will serve residents of the IndyEast Economic Mobility District, which includes the city’s near eastside, southeast and Martindale Brightwood neighborhoods. Participants will receive industry-recognized training, certifications and career placement support designed to connect them to high-demand, living-wage jobs in fields such as energy auditing, solar installation, asbestos and lead abatement, and environmental remediation.

The three-year effort will be coordinated by Southeast Community Services, in partnership with John Boner Neighborhood Centers and the Edna Martin Christian Center. The three organizations will provide wraparound services including career coaching, financial coaching and income supports through the Centers for Working Families model.

The program is designed to serve individuals who face barriers to employment, including those who are underemployed, formerly justice-involved or lack postsecondary education. Organizers aim to enroll 100 residents in the full training and certification program over the next three years.

James Taylor, CEO of John Boner Neighborhood Centers, said the initiative has the potential to change the trajectory of many families in the area.

“KeyBank’s investment in the IndyEast Economic Mobility District is a game-changer for our neighborhoods, connecting residents to sustainable, in-demand careers and strengthening our local economy,” Taylor said. “Together with Southeast Community Services and Edna Martin Christian Center, we are creating pathways to prosperity through the Green Jobs Workforce Initiative. This effort is about more than training — it’s about opportunity and long-term stability for families. By preparing residents for success in the green economy, we are opening doors for individuals who have historically faced barriers to employment, while building a more sustainable future for the neighborhoods we call home.”

Participants who complete the program will leave with valuable credentials, including certifications such as the OSHA 30-hour certificate and the Association of Energy Engineers’ Energy Auditor Certificate. Program leaders have set a goal for at least 85% of enrolled participants to complete the program, with at least 80% earning at least one industry-recognized certification.

To track progress and ensure effectiveness, organizers plan to measure outcomes such as participation rates, program satisfaction and long-term impact on participants. An independent third-party evaluator will also be brought in to assess the program.

Yvonne Harrington, corporate responsibility officer at KeyBank, said the initiative aligns with the company’s dual focus on economic mobility and environmental sustainability.

“At KeyBank, we believe economic mobility and environmental sustainability go hand in hand,” Harrington said. “Our support of the Green Jobs Workforce Initiative reflects our commitment to investing in the communities we serve by helping to create pathways to living-wage careers. This program will equip individuals with the essential skills needed for the green economy, strengthen families and help revitalize neighborhoods.”

The investment comes as demand for green jobs continues to grow in Indiana and across the country. By equipping residents with the skills to meet this demand, program leaders hope to create lasting economic and environmental benefits for Indianapolis communities.

KeyBank’s involvement also reflects its broader commitment to community investment. The company, headquartered in Cleveland, Ohio, is celebrating its bicentennial in 2025. KeyBank is one of the nation’s largest bank-based financial services companies, with assets of approximately $185 billion as of June 30. It operates in 15 states through a network of about 1,000 branches and 1,200 ATMs.

Tennessee remains among the nation’s top four states for highest number of anticipated electric vehicle manufacturing jobs despite slowing industry investments, disappearing tax incentives and federal policy uncertainty, according to a new report on electric transportation in the Southeast.

The state held onto its title as runner-up for the most anticipated EV manufacturing jobs in the southeast region, with 16,262 anticipated jobs compared to top-ranking Georgia’s 26,428.

Tennessee’s place in the rankings is largely due to 5,800 jobs promised by Ford Motor Company and SK On’s BlueOval City and BlueOval SK, an electric vehicle and battery manufacturing plant in rural West Tennessee. In return for the $5.6 billion project, Tennessee offered a $900 million incentive package. While battery production at the new plant is moving forward, mass production of Ford’s next-generation electric pickup truck is now delayed until 2028 due to the company’s shift in focus to smaller, more affordable electric models.

Lengthening timelines and industry pressure to create more affordable vehicles are themes highlighted in the Sept. 10 report, which is the sixth-annual study of transportation electrification in Alabama, Georgia, Florida, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee. Atlas Public Policy, a Washington, D.C.-based data analysis firm, prepared the report for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, a renewable energy advocacy nonprofit.

The rapid injection of EV manufacturing investments coincided with tax incentives passed under former President Joe Biden’s administration, which likely sped up investments that companies already planned to make, Atlas Public Policy founder Nick Nigro said in a webcast following the report’s release.

But tax incentives of up to $7,500 for EV consumers will now sunset on Sept. 30 as part of the Trump administration’s budget reconciliation bill — named the One Big, Beautiful Bill — passed by Congress this summer, adding to market uncertainty.

The report shows continued momentum from southeastern states, where companies have announced an all-time total of $78.8 billion in electric vehicle (EV) manufacturing investments as of June 30. That momentum has slowed considerably, according to the report, with new investments in the southeast region over the last 12 months totaling $4.8 billion, less than a third of the previous year’s $15.2 billion.

The “huge jumps in manufacturing investments” over the last few years when companies began building more domestic-based supply chains were not sustainable, Nigro said.

“There was no doubt there was going to be a natural slowdown … because that’s the normal course of business,” he said. “The question we need to keep in mind as we look ahead is how many of these potential cancellations that are happening now and into the future are because of federal policy, or just because of the normal cycle of business?”

Nigro said it’s too soon to tell.

In the meantime, Tennessee continues to make progress in building out public electric vehicle charging infrastructure, though it still lags behind the charger-per-person rates of the nation and other southeastern states.

Tennessee, like other states, has also seen companies pause or retract investments and planned jobs.

Piedmont Lithium announced in August 2024 that it scrapped plans for an $800 million investment for a lithium hydroxide processing facility in Southeastern Tennessee that would have created around 147 jobs. This is the sole Tennessee cancellation mentioned in the report, which includes data through June.

General Motors announced in September that it would temporarily lay off 700 workers at its Spring Hill assembly plant due to a temporary production slowdown for the Cadillac Lyriq, along with reduced production for its Vistiq EV. Tenneco, an auto parts manufacturer that supplies the GM plant, reported that it would lay off 82 workers in its own Spring Hill facility.

Volkswagen similarly announced that it would furlough around 160 employees and pause production of its electric SUV to align “production volume to market demand,” the Chattanooga Times Free Press reported earlier this month.

What will happen when tax credits sunset? Time will tell.

Nigro said about 80% of EV manufacturing facilities the report tracked in the southeast are already operating in some capacity or undergoing construction. The key question, he said, is whether demand will support full production at these facilities.

Stan Cross, electric transportation policy director with the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, said it’s too early to tell how the market will react to the end of EV consumer tax credits.

“What we do know is that when we look at adoption of electric vehicles, sticker price remains a top barrier for consumers and fleet operators, even though owning an EV is much cheaper over time,” Cross said.

Nigro estimates that less than half of the electric vehicles sold in the last year qualified for the tax credit — which gives incentives for the purchase of vehicles with responsibly sourced components and North American assembly — indicating consumers are willing to pay for electric vehicles without the incentive.

Industry orgs: Budget bill’s electric vehicle tax credit rollback could hamper Tennessee momentum

Energy market analysis firm Benchmark reported in July that about half of the EVs sold in the United States were eligible for the new clean vehicle tax credit in 2025.

But the “Transportation Electrification in the Southeast” report also notes that most of the southeast’s highest-selling models were eligible for the full or partial tax credit in 2025.

“It’s going to make it tougher for some vehicles to be sold,” Nigro said, adding that companies may embrace more aggressive pricing or find other ways to squeeze costs out of production.

A manufacturing tax credit remains in place for batteries, though with tighter restrictions on foreign material sources.

“The Inflation Reduction Act, the Infrastructure Law, and even the (One Big Beautiful Bill Act) signaled to the market that if EVs are going to be purchased by Americans, ideally they’re built with as much domestic content as possible,” Nigro said.

Cross surmised that the sunsetting tax credits may provide a temporary boost to EV sales.

“We’re seeing a real run on EVs right now, as consumers see those tax credits dwindling, and I won’t be surprised if we see record-shattering third quarter sales here in the U.S. as a result,” he said.

Market share grows

Tennessee’s EV sales market share — the percentage of new vehicles purchased that are EVs — came in at 5.4%, a 35% annual growth from last year, according to the report.

This puts Tennessee in the middle of the pack, ranking fourth among the six southeastern states examined by the report. Tennessee’s market share ranks 31st in the nation.

The southeast region logged more than 912,000 cumulative EV sales during the study period, amounting to a market share of above 8%. Tennessee was responsible for 60,434 of those sales.

Charging infrastructure makes progress

Tennessee is ranked fourth in the region for number of electric vehicle chargers per person.

The state saw the lowest rate of growth in publicly accessible rapid EV chargers at 24% — a marked change from holding the highest growth rate of 60% last year.

Tennessee has 830 fast-charging ports and 1,897 slower charging ports, according to the report.

The state’s Fast Charge TN program supported EV charger installation at 35 now-operational charging sites along a 400-mile loop connecting Nashville, Knoxville, Cookeville and Chattanooga. Another 18 sites are under development, and the application period for the program’s second round of funding recently closed.

About 30 people gathered on the first day of fall across from the DeWitt and Manlius solar farms along the Old Erie Canal.

Originally founded by Bill McKibben, an environmental activist, Sun Day was created to demonstrate that clean energy technologies are affordable, reliable and ready to deploy at scale.

“We're not acting enough in this country,” said George Lorefice with Climate Change Awareness and Action (CCAA). “Our federal administration is not promoting it, as a matter of fact, they're knocking it down.”

Starting Jan. 1, 2026, the Trump administration's “Big Beautiful Bill” will eliminate the 30% federal tax credit for homeowners who directly purchase solar systems.

The bill also prompted the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to officially terminate $7 billion in federal funding for the Solar for All program, which was aimed at making solar affordable for low income households across the U.S.

Although funding for the Solar for All program was repealed, Lindsay Speer, with the Central Regional Planning Development Board and as leader of the EnergySmart CNY program, said she is thankful that New York remains committed to reducing its impact on climate change.

“There's still state tax credits for solar, there's still state tax credits for geothermal,” she enumerated, “and [New York keeps] working on the programs to help everybody.”

The passing of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) in 2022, established a 30% federal tax credit for all solar projects until 2033, protecting solar energy development in New York.

From the Solar for All program, New York was meant to receive $250 million in federal funding. Regardless, according to the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the state leads the U.S. on community solar and is on the path to installing 10 gigawatts of distributed solar by 2030.

The two hosts of the local inaugural Sun Day event, the CCAA and DeWitt Advisory Conservation Commission (DACC), drew attention to local renewable energy efforts.

The Town of DeWitt launched its solar farm five years ago and announced at the event that it officially runs 100% of its municipal electricity on solar energy.

“This array was specifically set up to satisfy the municipal electric needs for the town,” Sonia Kragh, member of DACC and chair of the sustainability committee for CCAA, said. “That means all the pumps that run water and sewage, the LED lights, things that run the buildings themselves, and now they've got electric charging stations for their town electric vehicles.”

According to the Town of DeWitt’s website, it is projected to save $70,000 per year on municipal electric energy costs.

“I wanted to shout out what DeWitt is doing to show we've paved the path we have a great sustainability policy and plan that you can follow,” Kragh said.

Following the launch of the DeWitt solar farm, the Town of Manlius launched its own solar array. Instead of supporting the municipal needs, its solar focus is on a community project, directly affecting the people of Manlius.

“The town saves 10% on its electric bill,” Katelyn Kriesel, with the town of Manlius said, “and over the lifetime of the project, the town will save or make over a million dollars.”

Krissel said hundreds of households signed up for the community solar project almost immediately, creating a waitlist.

“It's projects like these all around the country that will make a difference,” Krissel said. “We were so thrilled to be able to do the project successfully and to be a part of the climate solution.”",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/55fae82/2147483647/strip/true/crop/800x420+0+63/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F9c%2F60%2F5d8237354e44aca2edb4a304a9d5%2Fsun-day-9-21-25mnunez.jpeg,N,,2025-09-24 13:03:10.075484

Conclusion: A Defining Moment for U.S. Lithium The potential U.S. government equity stake in Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) marks a pivotal moment for the company and the broader landscape of American critical mineral independence.","In a dramatic turn of events, shares of Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) experienced a significant pre-market surge today, with reports indicating a potential acquisition of an equity stake by the U.S. government. This development underscores the strategic importance of the company's Thacker Pass project in Nevada, heralded as the largest known measured lithium resource globally, and signals a robust commitment from Washington to secure a domestic supply chain for critical minerals essential for the burgeoning electric vehicle (EV) industry.

The news has sent ripples through the financial markets, highlighting the intricate dance between geopolitical strategy, energy transition, and corporate valuation. It positions Lithium Americas at the forefront of the nation's efforts to reduce reliance on foreign lithium sources, particularly amidst ongoing global supply chain vulnerabilities and intense competition for raw materials.

U.S. Government Eyes Equity in LAC: A Strategic Pivot for Critical Minerals

On September 24, 2025, Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) saw its stock price skyrocket by an impressive 68% to 92.51% in pre-market trading, following reports that the Trump administration is actively negotiating for up to a 10% equity stake in the company. This potential government investment is reportedly tied to a reassessment of the existing $2.26 billion loan from the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), initially secured in October 2024 for the construction of processing facilities at the Thacker Pass project. The DOE's review, prompted by evolving market conditions and concerns over competition from cheaper Chinese lithium, has also reportedly pushed General Motors (NYSE: GM) for more binding offtake agreements.

This strategic move by the U.S. government signifies a profound commitment to bolstering domestic critical mineral production. Thacker Pass is not just a mining project; it's a cornerstone of American energy independence, projected to produce over eight times the current U.S. output of lithium carbonate for EV batteries. The project, which commenced major construction in early 2025 with Phase 1 targeted for completion in late 2027, has already attracted substantial private investment, including a $250 million strategic investment from Orion Resource Partners in April 2025 and a $625 million investment from General Motors (NYSE: GM) in December 2024, granting GM a 38% stake and a 20-year offtake agreement for 100% of Phase 1 production. While the stock has seen recent volatility, including a 7.84% downturn on September 23, 2025, due to concerns about increased lithium supply from a Chinese mine, its year-over-year performance shows a 31.76% increase, reflecting underlying investor confidence in its long-term prospects.

How a Government Stake Could Electrify the Market

The potential direct equity involvement of the U.S. government in Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) could have a transformative effect on the broader lithium market and the electric vehicle supply chain. This move de-risks the Thacker Pass project significantly, providing an unparalleled level of political and financial backing that could accelerate its development and operational timeline. For the United States, it represents a monumental step towards securing a reliable, domestic source of lithium, drastically reducing its current heavy reliance on imports, predominantly from Chile and Argentina. This strategic independence is crucial for national security and economic stability in an era defined by geopolitical competition for critical resources.

Companies deeply embedded in the EV ecosystem, particularly those committed to North American supply chains, stand to gain immensely. General Motors (NYSE: GM), already a major stakeholder and offtake partner, would see its investment further solidified and its long-term lithium supply secured, potentially giving it a competitive edge. Other domestic EV manufacturers and battery producers could also benefit from the increased availability of U.S.-sourced lithium, fostering innovation and growth within the American industrial base. Conversely, foreign lithium producers, particularly those in regions currently dominating the supply chain, might face increased competition in the lucrative U.S. market as domestic production ramps up. The long-term impact could also include a degree of price stabilization as a major new supply source comes online, although short-term market dynamics will continue to be influenced by global supply-demand balances.

Broader Implications: A New Era for U.S. Critical Minerals

The U.S. government's potential equity stake in Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) transcends a mere financial transaction; it signals a profound shift in national industrial policy towards a more interventionist approach in critical mineral supply chains. This event fits squarely into a broader global trend where nations are increasingly prioritizing resource security, driven by the accelerating transition to clean energy and the electrification of transportation. The lithium market itself has been a microcosm of this volatility, experiencing dramatic price swings—from all-time highs in 2021-2023 to a steep decline in 2024 due to oversupply, now showing signs of recovery in 2025 with projections of tighter markets by 2026.

This strategic intervention by the U.S. government could set a precedent for future collaborations between public and private sectors in developing other critical mineral projects, potentially sparking a wave of investment and innovation across the domestic mining and processing industries. It also sends a clear message to international competitors, particularly China, about America's resolve to build resilient and independent supply chains. The ripple effects could extend to regulatory frameworks, potentially leading to more streamlined permitting processes for critical mineral projects and increased incentives for domestic production. Historically, government involvement in strategic industries has often accelerated development and ensured national interests are met, and this move with LAC could be seen as a modern-day equivalent, adapting to the demands of the 21st-century energy landscape.

What Readers Should Pay Attention to Next

As the situation unfolds, investors and industry observers should closely monitor several key developments. The immediate focus will be on the finalization of any equity agreement between the U.S. government and Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC), including the specific terms and conditions. This will provide clarity on the extent of government involvement and its implications for LAC's corporate governance and strategic direction. Furthermore, continued progress at the Thacker Pass project remains paramount. Watch for announcements regarding construction milestones, the first draw on the DOE loan (anticipated in Q3 2025), and any updates on the project's timeline and budget.

Beyond company-specific news, the broader lithium market dynamics will continue to influence LAC's performance. Keep an eye on global lithium prices, which are projected to climb in the coming years after a period of decline. Shifts in electric vehicle demand, technological advancements in battery chemistry, and new supply coming online from other regions will all play a role. Finally, any further policy directives or legislative actions from the U.S. government aimed at bolstering critical mineral independence will be crucial, as they could create additional opportunities or challenges for Lithium Americas and the wider industry.

Conclusion: A Defining Moment for U.S. Lithium

The potential U.S. government equity stake in Lithium Americas (NYSE: LAC) marks a pivotal moment for the company and the broader landscape of American critical mineral independence. This strategic move not only validates the immense potential of the Thacker Pass project but also underscores a decisive shift in national policy to secure essential resources for the clean energy transition. While the road ahead will undoubtedly present challenges, including navigating market volatility and ensuring timely project execution, the strong backing from both private investors like General Motors (NYSE: GM) and now potentially the U.S. government positions Lithium Americas for a defining role in shaping the future of the domestic lithium supply chain.

Investors should recognize the dual nature of this opportunity: significant upside potential driven by strategic national interest and a world-class resource, balanced against the inherent risks of large-scale mining development and fluctuating commodity markets. The coming months will be critical as details of the government's involvement emerge and as Thacker Pass continues its journey towards becoming a cornerstone of America's electric future. The success of this venture could serve as a blueprint for future public-private partnerships aimed at strengthening national resource security and accelerating the global shift towards sustainable energy.

Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas from fossil fuel burning, does not directly damage health, but leads to global heating.
However, coal and oil burning for power generation, and the burning of fossil fuels in industrial facilities, pollute the air with particulate matter called PM2.5, which has serious health impacts when breathed in.
Al Gore, a former US vice-president and co-founder of Climate Trace, said there was a clear link between human health and fossil fuel burning.
The particulate air pollution they also create falls downwind into surrounding neighbourhoods and is causing the deaths of 8.7 million people per year,” he said.","Fossil fuel burning is not just damaging the world’s climate; it is also threatening the health of at least 1.6 billion people through the toxic pollutants it produces, data shows.

Carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas from fossil fuel burning, does not directly damage health, but leads to global heating. However, coal and oil burning for power generation, and the burning of fossil fuels in industrial facilities, pollute the air with particulate matter called PM2.5, which has serious health impacts when breathed in.

A new interactive map from Climate Trace, a coalition of academics and analysts that tracks pollution and greenhouse gases, shows that PM2.5 and other toxins are being poured into the air near the homes of about 1.6 billion people. Of these, about 900 million are in the path of “super-emitting” industrial facilities – including power plants, refineries, ports and mines – that deliver outsize doses of toxic air.

The organisation highlighted 10 urban areas particularly badly affected by super-emitters, including Karachi in Pakistan; Guangzhou in China; Seoul in South Korea; and New York in the US, where leaders from around the world are meeting this week for the UN general assembly.

Raising the alarm over air pollution is seen by some in the US as a way to counter Donald Trump’s moves to dismantle work by the federal government aimed at tackling the climate crisis. The US president has shut down federal climate programmes, ordered an end to renewable energy projects, and issued a climate report that scientists called a “mockery”.

At the UN general assembly on Tuesday, he denounced climate science as a “con job”. His words were swiftly refuted by scientists.

But Trump’s government claims to be willing to consider some forms of combating pollution. His environmental adviser Ed Russo gave an address to the climate week hosted by Brazil last month in Rio de Janeiro, before Brazil’s presidency of the Cop30 climate summit this November. Russo referred approvingly to the fight against pollution from waste dumps, landfills and other sources. “The impacts of pollution are the critical problem in all of this,” he said, in a video message. “We have to clean up the messes that we made and stop pollution at its source.”

However, he did not say how the Trump administration would seek to clean up toxins, and environmental groups are concerned at the apparent stripping of protections for clean water and air amid restructuring and rollbacks at the main regulatory body, the US Environmental Protection Agency.

Al Gore, a former US vice-president and co-founder of Climate Trace, said there was a clear link between human health and fossil fuel burning. “Facilities that burn fossil fuels are the overwhelmingly dominant source of heat-trapping pollution that is driving the climate crisis – by using the sky as if it were an open sewer. The particulate air pollution they also create falls downwind into surrounding neighbourhoods and is causing the deaths of 8.7 million people per year,” he said. “Now that we can clearly see how and where people are being exposed to this harmful pollution, our leaders must do something to reduce it.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/d2568ad0eaaf4cd58c4a997db09e5ab51f448630/293_0_2915_2333/master/2915.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=9bd4f93f4071f661986d742a66834aa5",N,,2025-09-24 14:02:49.199920

Thank you Casey, and thank you all who are joining us here today representing this coalition of forward-thinking representatives from 24 states that banded together really to show the world that despite what occurs in Washington — going back to 2017 — we can still band together and have a profound impact and that was really the birth of the Climate Alliance, which I would submit today in this era is more important now than ever before because the attacks are more incessant. And I would also say that, reflecting on what happened yesterday when our president called the climate crisis, “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world” before the UN General Assembly — what we do is we gather and we become even more dug in in our commitment to lead the rest of our country despite the absence of leadership from Washington. So there was a con job — from a con man — and I also would say that he made some reference to we need to let us work together to build a bright, beautiful planet.

So say what you will, we will do our work and we will build that bright, beautiful planet because we are committed. So let's hold him to that. And so now this group working in collaboration is urgently needed. Our democracy depends on this collaboration. No one individual state has the influence to have a real impact on what is happening with emissions and our climate but banded together, the strength of one is what's making the difference. So we are proving the Climate Alliance states are proving you can cut emissions and grow the economy at the same time, which is what naysayers were certain was not possible. And a year ago, the Climate Alliance announced a commitment to train one million new apprentices across its states and territories by 2035.

We are holding to that commitment. We're doing our part in New York, but also today we are really proud to announce that we have achieved a 24 percent reduction in emissions for our 24 member states. That is ahead of schedule. It achieves the goals that we had set out back in — measuring ourselves back to 2005, a long time ago. This was set forth a few years ago, but to be able to achieve this goal of a 24 percent reduction at a time when the numbers were escalated to go down 24 percent — clearly within a range of hitting the target, which was set for 2025, which is 26 percent. These are 2023 numbers. So I have no doubt in my mind that. When we look at the 2025 numbers, we will have more than exceeded our goal of 26 percent. So, that is enormous. We should be proud of that and celebrate that and talk about that back in our home states to know that what they've set out to do was achievable, and we're going to continue building on that success.

So first of all, we build on the momentum. Secondly, we'll innovate new methods of going forward. And then really have to spend way too much energy fighting back the damaging policies out in Washington. This has certainly been a growth year for our lawyers. I can't tell you how many cases that we're involved with to push back on the Trump administration, but certainly anything related to climate, I will continue to devote the resources to do what is necessary.

So let me just give a snapshot of what we're doing here in New York while the federal government refuses to protect us. We will continue to build a healthy and safe future for our people and our planet. And this year I announced a Sustainable Future program, which is the largest single climate investment in New York history. A billion dollar commitment for decarbonization, clean energy and climate resilience. We're putting that money to work in every part of people's lives. At least $50 million will go to Empower Plus to help families transition, building heat pumps and making their homes more energy efficient to help reduce their costs as well as their consumption.

To date, we've already had 5,700 home upgrades and saved millions of dollars for our families and energy costs. We'll put another $15 million to our Clean Green Schools program to make our public schools healthier and more efficient. And for our State University system, we're investing $200 million to help their publicly owned building phase out of fossil fuels and $150 million for our green small buildings program to help upgrade housing as well.

So we also want to focus on emission-free buses, $250 million for that. Vehicle charging stations, expanding our infrastructure at workplaces and apartment buildings, as well as securing another $200 million to accelerate multiple renewable energy projects. That's what we do with the billion dollars in New York. And we're committed to this. And it was bold and it had a big price tag, but the price tag for doing nothing is even greater in our opinion. So this was an investment well worth making.

We're also thinking about how to bolster our energy supplies overall. And we are committed to being very ambitious and on June 23rd this year, I directed our Power Authority for the State to plan the first advanced nuclear plant in a generation, and I'm going to continue that we have access to our Solar for All program as well as, meanwhile in 2027, we're on the cusp of bringing in 20 percent of New York City will be powered by hydroelectric power brought down by Champlain Power Express that I announced during my first climate week when I was a brand new, unexpected Governor back in 2021.

This is something I committed to do, and we're almost done, and this is going to be extraordinary. And again, weaning ourselves off the fossil fuels. And some of you may have seen the news that we had to fight hard to save our offshore wind project that preserves thousands of union jobs. And also, we are on the cusp of completing this — the Empire Wind Project. And we'll be powering over half a million homes in Brooklyn next year.

And so it's still going to happen now because we were able to find the path forward. But I know there's other states, particularly New England, that's under attack. And we're here to stand with you to help thwart those efforts and to show that it is a viable form of power. It is renewable, it is clean. We want to make sure that we continue these investments in offshore wind. And as I said, we'll continue to challenge that in court wherever necessary. And again, I want to make sure we have the workforce. We talk about all this development, all these projects. It's extraordinary, but we have to have people who are trained in the skills that are necessary.

We announced that last year through this alliance, but also NYSERDA awarded $5.1 million to support our offshore wind workforce. We've trained almost a thousand people. We've launched our offshore wind training institute with $20 million, the largest private investment in workforce development of any state, and that is now certified 2,500 workers, which is why I'm going to keep fighting any efforts to shut down offshore wind because now I have the workforce, the investment's been made, the private sector has done their part, and so this is critically important for us to maintain the work that's been done and we hope to continue doing in the future.

We also see climate action advanced manufacturers as partners; we don't have to have a hostile relationship with them. And so we put $300 million towards something called the Power Up Fund to have power ready sites with clean energy to attract companies to New York. It is overwhelmingly successful. People want to go where it's already shovel ready, but also power ready — power ready with the power we want delivered to those sites. And we are holding up our polluters accountable for their grievous mistakes of the past. It's something I'm well familiar with having grown up within line of sight of the Bethlem Steel Plant in Buffalo.

And as a child, I thought the skies were supposed to be orange because that's all I saw was the smoke spilling out of the smoke stacks there. And in Lake Erie, one of the greatest freshwater lakes in the world, absolutely polluted the dead fish everywhere on the beach because they were being killed by the discharges from the plant into the water on a daily basis. So that's where I grew up. So I'm from birth, an environmentalist. In 2024, I signed the Climate Change Super Fund act, shifting the burden of paying for climate change mitigation, off of New Yorkers to the fossil companies themselves.

I know only one other state, I believe Vermont has done that as well. So, of course it's being attacked in court, but what's new? Every time we try to do something ambitious or to stop something bad, it ends up in the courts. And back in 2022, I announced that we had a $4.2 billion environmental bond act to help protect our natural resources.

I just want to say we're doing all this, but we cannot lose sight of the fact that affordability is critically important. I don't think that it was part of the conversation as much as it should have been in the past. It is now front and center on people's minds as the costs of tariffs are being felt, the inflation is not abating, despite the promise that prices were all going to go down on day one, as would utility prices. So we're still waiting for those commitments.

But we're continuing our programs to help people with credits helping pay their bills and with the inflation reduction act rebates, which make energy rebates more accessible. I just want to say this, we just refuse to be derailed by this and we just must hold firm and continue creative ways as we've done to protect the environment individually. I encourage others to look at our success with congestion pricing as well. We're the only state in the nation, the only city in the nation that has undertaken it. We can certainly have the opportunity to explain how it all works, but as much as you want to complain about the traffic this week, it would've been worse.

Since we launched this last January, there have been 17.6 million fewer rides into our targeted zone — our district. And that has resulted in extraordinary reduction in emissions in our city. And we can feel it. People are breathing easier. I know it's going to be a reduction in asthma and a whole lot of other ailments, but it is working and we're so proud of that, and we're using the investments from the dollars raised into investing in our public transportation system, our buses and rail lines. And that's the synergy of all this – it all goes toward a cleaner environment. And we're also fighting alongside California to defend the Clean Air Waiver Act. We're focusing on that, and we're joining other states with the affordable Clean Cars Coalition, advancing environmentally friendly cars.

So lots going on. We're proud of what we're doing, but we never rest on our laurels here in the State of New York. We're always driving ourselves hard. I want to recognize Amanda Lefton, my commissioner of DEC, who has a national reputation already. I and her entire team, and everyone at NYSERDA — I have the smartest, the best, and the brightest.

I'm so proud of those individuals because together we're going to make sure that we lead as a nation and our 24 states spanning together the collective talent around these tables is what's going to continue to set us apart as we even break and smash even more records that we set for ourselves. So thank you very much everyone.",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-09/climate1.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=-419pJiB,N,,2025-09-24 12:04:05.856227

With Brazilian installed hydropower capacity now standing at 110GW, an additional 1.3GW is licensed or under construction.
Meanwhile, ENGIE Brasil Energia has signed an agreement to acquire the 393MW Santo Antônio do Jari Hydropower Plant, located in Amapá and Pará, and the 219MW Cachoeira Caldeirão Hydropower Plant in Amapá.
Ecuador Ecuador has only tapped 7% of its hydropower potential, with its hydropower system currently remaining under pressure due to droughts which have triggered electricity blackouts.
Uruguay In 2024, hydropower accounted for over 50% of Uruguay’s total electricity production which climbed to a record 14.4TWh.","Despite what it calls only ‘a modest’ total capacity addition of 306MW in 2024, the International Hydropower Association (IHA) says hydropower is still a vital component of the South American energy mix. Currently providing approximately 45% of South American electricity demand, thanks to the region’s natural resources such as the Andes mountains and the Amazon basin, there is still vast potential for generation and only 30% of its hydropower potential is being utilised.

In its 2025 World Hydropower Outlook, the IHA outlined some of the challenges facing regional development, such as maintaining grid stability as renewable energy deployment accelerates. In response to this, South America is playing a pioneering role in developing hybrid systems which combine hydro and other renewables to maximise sustainability and efficiency. A leading example of this approach, the IHA says, is the deployment of PV arrays on hydro reservoir surfaces.

However, there are also what the association terms as being ‘reputational challenges’ in the region. Explaining that the industry is responding to these with a strong focus on demonstrating sustainability in such an ecologically sensitive environment, IHA gives the example of Brazil’s 198MW Mascarenhas plant which was recently awarded gold certification under its Hydropower Sustainability Standard, following on from Brazil’s 3.75GW Jirau plant which also achieved gold certification in 2023. In addition, Colombia’s 2.45GW Ituango and 19.9MW Chorreritas projects were awarded silver certification.

Pumped storage remains largely untapped in Latin America, but a 2024 IADB report highlights its potential to boost renewable integration as ageing hydro plants modernise. The two-stage study identifies 179 possible sites across 11 countries and lays out plans for a pilot project in Pisagua, Tarapacá, Chile, providing 640MW with 12 hours of storage. The pilot uses two 4.5Mm3 reservoirs, four 160MW Francis turbines, and two 220kV lines. The US$570 million project would be constructed over 48 months at a cost of US$32/MWh.

Argentina

Severe droughts since 2024 have critically impaired Argentinian hydropower generation. It declined by 15% compared to 2023, with a further 34% drop in January 2025 due to extremely low river inflows. And although this led to power cuts and higher electricity costs, the IHA says the Argentinian hydropower sector is undergoing major growth.

Modernising ageing facilities has been a priority but several large-scale projects are also nearing completion with new developments planned. Projects include the 1310MW Santa Cruz hydroelectric plant, slated for completion by 2026, and the 950MW Condor Cli Dam set for commissioning by 2027. Still in permitting stages, the 871MW Chihuido project is expected online by 2029.

As a whole though, Argentina has still only harnessed 20% of its hydropower potential. The Inter-American Development Bank recently identified 23 potential pumped storage projects with average installed capacities of 414.5MW.

Bolivia

Described as ‘growing significantly’, Bolivia’s hydropower sector continues to move forward with major projects. The 3000MW Rio Madera hydropower project should start on a feasibility study and environmental licensing soon, with possible commissioning by 2031. In addition, the 1.16TWh Ivirizu complex, and the first stage of the 203MW Miguillas hydroelectric plant, are both expected to be finalised this year.

Brazil

A severe dry spell in late 2024 reduced Brazil’s hydropower output to a three-year low, with hydropower falling to a 50% share of the energy mix during September. Anticipation of low water flows in the future has been a limiting factor in the development of new sites, according to the IHA, and in 2024 only 56MW from 11 new hydropower projects was added to the country’s total generating capacity.

With Brazilian installed hydropower capacity now standing at 110GW, an additional 1.3GW is licensed or under construction. There are currently 32 advanced-stage projects totalling 442MW and 60 licensed projects awaiting construction.

Czech energy company ENERGO-PRO also recently agreed to purchase the 350MW Baixo Iguaçu hydropower plant in the state of Paraná. Commissioned in 2019, the plant plays a critical role in regulating the flow of the Iguaçu Falls, one of the world’s largest waterfall systems. It produces clean, renewable energy sufficient to power one million Brazilians, covering 8% of Paraná state’s annual consumption. The power plant was built between 2014 and 2019 with a total investment of €500 million. Its concession runs until 2049.

Meanwhile, ENGIE Brasil Energia has signed an agreement to acquire the 393MW Santo Antônio do Jari Hydropower Plant, located in Amapá and Pará, and the 219MW Cachoeira Caldeirão Hydropower Plant in Amapá.

Chile

Having realised approximately 53% of its estimated 16GW hydropower potential, Chile is described as exhibiting significant potential for small and micro run-of-river projects and pumped storage. Although the country’s installed generating capacity has ‘grown spectacularly in recent years’, the IHA admits hydropower has only played a relatively small role in this.

However, in 2024, four projects added 157.7MW to Chile’s hydropower capacity. These were:

Los Cóndores (150MW).

Pasada Piedras Negras (3MW).

La Con anza (2.6MW).

Nueva Ampliación PMGD Las Flores (2.1MW).

Four more projects, with a combined investment of US$677 million, are also under construction with the 52MW Los Lagos run-of-river project also recently receiving approval.

Colombia

Hydropower, with an installed capacity of 13207MW, accounts for nearly 64% of the Colombia’s total energy generation. Although construction of the country’s largest hydropower project, the 2400MW run-of-river Ituango scheme, is well under way and expected to reach full capacity by 2027, elsewhere hydropower development is described as lagging. Just two projects were completed in 2024 – the 10.5MW TZ II and the 2MW Alejandría. Two major projects, Porvenir II (352MW) and Miel II (120MW), have been approved and the IHA believes these can help stimulate future growth for the Colombian hydropower sector.

Digital transformation can be viewed as a powerful innovation driver in energy transition efforts. However, according to a new study, there remains a notable gap in research addressing comprehensive, large-scale digital transformation projects in hydropower. EG Gabon et al say that very few existing studies have covered the scope of digitalising a significant proportion of an entire nation’s hydropower infrastructure. In addition they believe few works have delved into the depth and complexity of digital solution architectures tailored for large-scale hydropower plants, with even fewer studies exploring the direct impact of these strategies on national energy policies and the integration of renewable energy sources.

In their research, EG Gabon et al say they address such a critical gap by presenting a real-world, large-scale case study of the digital transformation of Colombia’s hydropower sector. The investigation discusses in detail the digital transformation strategy for the hydropower plants of one of the major players in the Colombian generation market, detailing the automation concept for each individual unit and the integrated architecture for all the hydropower generation systems.

Enel Colombia is one of the largest power generation companies in the Colombian electricity market. Its digital transformation involves the digitalisation of 27 hydroelectric generating units and four pumping stations distributed over 12 plants. These include the:

276MW Paraíso.

324MW Guaca.

19.4MW Charquito.

56.8MW Tequendama.

35MW Salto II.

1MW Limonar.

18MW Laguneta.

150MW Darío Valencia.

1250MW Guavio.

•10MW Guavio menor.

200MW Quimbo.

540MW Betania.

Ecuador

Ecuador has only tapped 7% of its hydropower potential, with its hydropower system currently remaining under pressure due to droughts which have triggered electricity blackouts. The IHA says that with 72% of the country’s power generation dependent on water, the government is turning to solar projects to add resilience.

Government initiatives have been designed to help Ecuador meet its long-term goal of sourcing 80% of its electricity from renewable sources and encourage greater private sector participation. Key projects include two new run-of-river plants, which will add approximately 150MW, and the 3600MW Zamora G8 project which is now in final feasibility stages, with the 254MW Toachi-Pilatón complex nearing completion.

Guyana

Guyana has revived its flagship 165MW Amaila Falls hydropower project after years of delays and failed attempts. IHA says Amaila is central to Guyana’s low carbon strategy, with expectations it will supply more than 50% of the nation’s electricity, reducing dependence on oil. However, key hurdles including financing challenges, indigenous consultation, and environmental concerns remain ahead of the targeted 2029 commissioning date.

Peru

Peru has harnessed 8% of its hydropower potential of 69.45GW. Recent policy initiatives seek to accelerate concessions and consent processes, and shorten environmental review timelines. Six projects totalling 664MW will enter commercial operation between 2025 and 2027. These include the 209.3MW San Gabán III which is located in Carabaya province, Puno. Designed to generate approximately 1.25TWh annually, it will bolster supply to Peru’s southern grid and support the mining sector. In addition, construction of four small hydropower projects is more than 25% complete – CH Santa Lorenza (19MW), CH Anashironi (20MW), Centauro I (12.5MW),.

Engineering and consulting firm AFRY has been selected by Electroperú to oversee the modernisation and life extension of the country’s Santiago Antúnez de Mayolo and Restitución hydropower plants. The project aims to upgrade systems and equipment at both facilities to maintain operational continuity and improve reliability.

Electroperú S.A., Peru’s state-owned energy provider, operates the Mantaro Hydroelectric Complex, which includes the 798MW Santiago Antúnez de Mayolo plant and the 210MW Restitución plant in the Andes. Built in 1973, these plants are essential to the country’s electricity generation.

The modernisation effort, which began in May 2024, will last nearly three years. It includes replacing ageing equipment and upgrading auxiliary systems to extend their operational life, along with training programmes to ensure ongoing safety and reliability. AFRY’s role covers contract review, risk analysis, technical coordination, quality assessment, and supervision of factory and on-site testing. The firm aims to ensure that the project meets the highest technical and safety standards.

Uruguay

In 2024, hydropower accounted for over 50% of Uruguay’s total electricity production which climbed to a record 14.4TWh. Work also began on the modernisation of the Rincón de Baygorria hydroelectric plant during 2024, with plans to increase installed capacity to 120MW. The project is managed by Andritz in consortium with SACEEM.

Venezuela

Venezuela’s hydropower sector has been struggling with declining capacity due to economic challenges and structural neglect of key infrastructure, such as the 10,200MW Guri Dam and the Caroní River cascade. So recent efforts have been focused on restoring existing facilities, such as the reactivation of the General José Antonio Páez hydroelectric complex in Barinas, adding 120MW to the grid. In December 2024, the Latin American Development Bank also authorised a US$380 million loan to help improve the efficiency and extend the operational life of the country’s Simón Bolívar plant.

Revising water treaties: impact on hydropower

Formalised by treaties in 1906 and 1944 between Mexico and the US entered the two nations into an agreement to regulate the upper part of the Rio Grande basin. However, after more than 100 years, things have changed. Because although the priorities of the two sharing countries and conditions in the region have changed significantly since the 1940s, interpretation of the 1944 Treaty has not sufficiently evolved to meet these challenges, according to new research by Sanchez et al in Water International.

The Rio Grande basin has since made it to the list of the most endangered basins in the world, with studies showing its natural flow has been reduced by at least 80% annually. And with more persistent droughts, erratic rainfall and increased heat likely to be the norm going forwards, increasing water scarcity has raised’ legal and constitutional questions’ not only over the supposed ownership of water, but over priorities for water uses and users. Indeed, conditions are described as being particularly bad for Mexico. Three times since 1994 it has had to delay water deliveries until the following five-year cycle because it had fallen into water ‘debt’ with the US.

A more suitable approach could see the Treaty evolving into a more adaptable and beneficial mechanism for sharing the waters of the Rio Grande under the current uncertain and water-scarce conditions, which are expected to prevail into the future. Committing to delivering fixed amounts of water, the authors stress, simply does not make sense in a basin that cannot provide additional water in response to expected future growth. Ultimately, the two countries must recognise that the system needs both more flexibility and greater reliability in the amount and timing of water deliveries to both countries.

This will require a major change in the way both countries manage water resources in the border region and will require time and accountability from federal and state governments in both countries. Mexico, as the treaty prescribes, shoulders the greater burden for ensuring reliable water deliveries to Texas.

“At every political level things have changed,” Sanchez et al state. “The treaty cannot bring or create more water; climate change is reducing water availability on both sides of the border; existing practices and uses cannot continue without significant changes in the extant lax governance systems; and with the model of intensive and extensive agriculture, little will be accomplished without cooperation”.

According to the authors, both countries need to acknowledge that in its current form the Treaty is inadequate and needs to evolve to meet the changing needs of the Lower Rio Grande basin. There needs to be mutual commitment to developing an adaptive framework that flexibly accounts for unpredictable climatic changes, as well as growing populations and shifting economic demands. In addition, the involvement of stakeholders representing diverse interests – including from agriculture, industry, non-governmental organizations, municipal and state governments, and academia – is critical for achieving more effective and balanced negotiations over transboundary waters.

QSBS Family offices have increasingly invested in private equity and made direct investments in closely held businesses.","President Donald Trump on July 4, 2025, signed into law H.R.1, commonly referred to as the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBB). (For a detailed analysis of the bill, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Trump Signs the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,"" July 3, 2025.) Notably, the OBBB makes comprehensive changes to the U.S. Tax Code, including provisions relevant to single-family offices.

Executive Summary

There are five provisions of the OBBB with particular impact on single-family offices:

The OBBB provides for ""permanent"" repeal of Internal Revenue Code (Code) Section 212 miscellaneous itemized expenses for investment expenses, meaning that certain ultra-high-net-worth (UHNW) taxpayers could continue to benefit from a family office structured as a profit-motivated trade or business able to deduct family office, investment advisory and related expenses under Code Section 162.

The OBBB permanently increases the federal estate, gift, and Generation-Skipping Transfer (GST) tax exemption to $15 million per person (or $30 million for a married couple) indexed for inflation, expanding wealth transfer planning opportunities for UHNW families and their family offices.

Charitable deductions are limited to amounts exceeding 0.5 percent of adjusted gross income (AGI) for individuals and 1 percent for C corporations, which may prompt family offices to consider pooling larger charitable contributions to surpass these thresholds. The bill also extends higher AGI limits on deductibility, including the 60 percent deductibility limitation for cash contributions to public charities.

The OBBB raises the state and local tax (SALT) deduction cap to $40,000 for joint filers ($20,000 for separate filers) from 2025 through 2029 and continues to permit the pass-through entity (PTE) tax workaround, enabling family offices with pooled investment partnerships to further reduce state-level tax exposure.

The OBBB significantly expands qualified small business stock (QSBS) tax benefits for family offices by reducing the minimum holding period to three years with phased-in exclusion percentages, increasing the qualifying C corporation asset limit to $75 million and raising the capital gains exemption cap to $15 million, thereby enhancing the attractiveness of investing in qualified small businesses.

Deductibility of Expenses

Since 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) has eliminated miscellaneous itemized deductions (MIDs) including some most valuable to family offices such as deductions for investment fees, legal and tax preparation fees, and other similar expenses incurred for the production of income - these deductions were formerly allowed under Code Section 212. The loss of this valuable category of deductions motivated many family offices to employ a modified hedge fund structure for the family office and its clients. In structuring single-family offices in part to enable deductibility of investment advisory and similar expenses borne by the family office, these families were buoyed by the U.S. Tax Court's 2017 decision in Lender Management v. Commissioner, which involved the management company of the family that popularized off-the-shelf bagels. Other family offices, such as Lender Management, had implemented hedge-fund style structures before the advent of the TCJA thereby avoiding alternative minimum tax complications and the 2 percent floor limitations of Code Section 67(a). Meanwhile, some families waited, perhaps believing that the TCJA would sunset on Dec. 31, 2025 thereby restoring prior deductions.

The OBBB poked a hole through the dough of those awaiting revival of investment-related MIDs. The bill ""permanently"" repealed such deductions, and families on the sidelines should now evaluate adopting a family office structure similar to that in the Lender case. Holland & Knight often works with UHNW clients and their family office advisors to establish a management company for family integration and to address the loss of deductibility for investment expense. The family office can engage multiple generations and branches of a family to create or expand pooled investment vehicles and other family office clients. The management company provides investment advisory and other services to these family office clients in exchange for compensation. When family clients are appropriately organized and the family office operates as a trade or business, it is possible for the overall effect to resemble (or improve upon) the pre-TCJA miscellaneous itemized deduction regime.

Increased Federal Estate, Gift and Generation-Skipping Transfer Tax Exemption

The TCJA doubled the federal estate, gift and generation-skipping transfer (GST) tax exemption (i.e., transfer tax exemption) for each individual. With applicable inflation adjustments, the current exemption is $13.99 million per individual, reduced by prior taxable gifts. However, under the TCJA, these exemptions were scheduled to sunset to approximately $7 million per person after Dec. 31, 2025.

The OBBB permanently sets the base-level transfer tax exemption at $15 million per person (or $30 million for a married couple) effective Jan. 1, 2026, and adjusted annually for inflation. The OBBB resolves the uncertainty of the prior law and provides enhanced wealth transfer planning opportunities for UHNW taxpayers and their family offices.

Family office advisors are well advised to consider such sophisticated planning opportunities on a generational basis to facilitate the efficient transfer of dynastic wealth. The enhanced exemptions may also factor into the transition of management and ownership of the family office, ensuring the structure can facilitate not only the transition of wealth between generations, but also serve as an effective vehicle to educate younger generations on a family's investment, wealth transition, and charitable planning initiatives and goals.

Charitable Planning

Family offices frequently serve as advisors to family charitable foundations. They also commonly provide broader advice to the family members they serve with respect to charitable planning involving public charities, including donor-advised funds.

The OBBB modifies the availability of charitable deductions that will be relevant to and impact family office clients. Effective Jan. 1, 2026, individual taxpayers who itemize their deductions are permitted a charitable deduction only to the extent the charitable contribution exceeds 0.5 percent of the taxpayer's AGI. Other rules apply to C corporations.

Family offices and family office advisors may wish to advise their family office clients to consider larger, pooled charitable contributions – potentially aggregating multiple anticipated charitable contributions into a single year – to exceed the applicable 0.5 percent threshold. Though the new deductibility floor may not be welcome news, the extension of higher deductibility limitations should have a broader impact for UHNW clients. (For additional details, see Holland & Knight's previous alert, ""Impact of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act on Tax-Exempt Organizations,"" Aug. 12, 2025.)

SALT Deduction and Planning

To the ire of many taxpayers, the TCJA capped the deduction for SALT at $10,000 per year. The OBBB increases the SALT deduction for tax years 2025 through 2029 to $40,000 for married couples filing jointly or $20,000 per year for separate filers.

In response to the TCJA's SALT cap, many taxpayers adopted a PTE tax workaround. Under this strategy, a pass-through entity elected to pay state income taxes at the entity level, as opposed to passing those taxes through to the owners. The owners were then permitted to claim credits to offset their individual income taxes.

The PTE tax workaround is a strategy adopted by Holland & Knight family office clients where those clients consist of multiple pooled investment vehicles taxed as partnerships for federal income tax purposes. Importantly, the OBBB does not restrict the ability of pass-through entities to fully adopt and implement this strategy. As a result, family offices with one or more separate, pooled investment partnerships can leverage this strategy and the increased SALT deduction to substantially decrease the exposure of the various family members to state-level taxes without an offsetting federal deduction.

QSBS

Family offices have increasingly invested in private equity and made direct investments in closely held businesses. When these private equity and/or direct investment opportunities involve QSBS under Code Section 1202, family offices have seen substantial tax-free gains on their initial investments.

Family offices will welcome the significant expansion of QSBS planning opportunities enacted by the OBBB. For QSBS acquired after July 4, 2025, the OBBB made the following substantial, taxpayer-favorable modifications to the QSBS regime:

a reduction in the minimum holding period requirement from five years to three years, with a phased-in exclusion percentage of 50 percent (for a three-year holding period), 75 percent (for a four-year holding period) and 100 percent (for a holding period of five or more years)

an increase in the maximum aggregate gross asset value for a qualifying C corporation issuer from $50 million to $75 million, indexed for inflation

an increase in the single-issuer flat cap on capital gains subject to exemption from $10 million to $15 million, indexed for inflation

The OBBB's material modifications to the QSBS regime substantially increase the value of investing in qualified small businesses. The tax benefits under the QSBS rules have always been significant for those who are patient and careful enough to pursue them. OBBB will now expand and increase these benefits. (For a broader analysis of the QSBS modifications in Code Section 1202 resulting from the OBBB, see Holland & Knight's previous alerts, ""A Look at the Tax Implications of Gifting Qualified Small Business Stock,"" Aug. 28, 2025, and ""A Look at Transfers of Section 1202 Qualified Small Business Stock,"" July 18, 2025.)

Conclusion

The OBBB declined to reinstate investment-related miscellaneous itemized deductions. This hurdle should motivate family offices to employ management company incentive structures to recoup these lost tax benefits. Family offices should also utilize the extended and expanded tax benefits for UHNW taxpayers, including SALT deduction caps, historically high AGI limits for charitable donations and increased QSBS exclusions.

Reports state that global investment topped $110 billion, thanks to over 500 projects all around the globe. Hydrogen plays an integral role in the global decarbonization efforts. Everything from cars to electricity can make use of hydrogen, with some companies like Hyundai placing a considerable amount of faith in the sector.

The Hydrogen Council’s inaugural Global H2 Compass report delivers some good news for the sector

The global standing of hydrogen is on the rise. The world is acutely aware of the need to decarbonize, especially in the energy sector. The H2 Compass reports that the sector has averaged a 50% year-over-year committed investment growth rate. Since 2020, there have been more than 1,700 H2 projects announced globally, while roughly 50 projects have been publicly canceled in the past 18 months.

The Hydrogen Council has praised the innovation and advancements that the sector has made in the past few years, and stated that it believes that reliance on hydrogen will only grow as time passes.

“The industry has made strong progress over the past five years, demonstrating its ability to innovate and scale. The Global H2 Compass report shows we are now at a pivotal juncture: accelerating market creation and securing binding offtake agreements must become the priority to ensure today’s projects deliver real impact. Achieving this will require stronger collaboration between business and government to build the frameworks and partnerships essential for progress. By aligning our efforts, we can unlock the full potential of H2 to meet the challenges ahead.” – Sanjiv Lamba, CEO of Linde and Co-Chair of the Hydrogen Council

China leads the growth in the hydrogen sector, with North America coming in second

What the industry needs is committed investment. And the heaviest energy consumers have made significant moves in the hydrogen sector. China leads the way with $33 billion of committed investments. North America comes in second with $23 billion, and lastly, Europe ranks third in committed investment with $19 billion.

A major player in the usage of hydrogen comes from South Korea. Hyundai has led the automotive industry in its embrace of hydrogen. The company has made several series of models that use hydrogen as the main fuel source. We have yet to realize the full potential that hydrogen has locked away.

“The Global H2 Compass sends a strong message: our industry has entered the next chapter of build-out, moving from ambition to delivery. With more than 500 projects advancing past FID and investment commitments now exceeding $110 B, a $35 B increase from last year, we are seeing tangible proof of progress. This milestone also reminds us of the work ahead. To sustain this momentum and fully unlock H2’s potential, consistent policy support and effective execution are essential in accelerating a clean, resilient and secure energy future.” – Jaehoon Chang, Vice-Chair of Hyundai Motor Group and Co-Chair of the Hydrogen Council

Hydrogen will continue to play a crucial role in the global decarbonization efforts

We are fully aware of the disastrous effect our reliance on fossil fuels has had on the planet. Several environmental disasters have emerged as a result of our proclivity for fossil fuels. The government leaders of the world have taken significant steps to alleviate the pressure being put on our planet, thanks to the energy demands that we have. The Europeans have made huge investments in the hydrogen sector, along with the ever-innovative Chinese. However, what role will hydrogen play in the United States as time passes?

The initiative brings together more than 20 partners to support public and private sector organizations with innovative solutions and financing.

The Accelerating Resilient Infrastructure Initiative is designed to rapidly scope, finance and deploy resilient energy infrastructure, such as microgrids, while federal incentives remain available. Federal incentives are still available for clean energy projects, but the clock is running out, so timely planning is essential.

The initiative aims to help communities reduce reliance on the centralized grid, strengthen energy resilience and support sustainability by scaling distributed energy resources (DERs), including solar panels, battery energy storage, geothermal heat pumps and EV charging infrastructure.

Participants in the initiative include: Microsoft; infrastructure providers AlphaStruxure, AZZO, Celsius Energy, CDM Smith EVerged, Mainspring Energy, Pisgah Energy, Sprocket Power, Sunrock Distributed Generation, Sustainability Partners, Unison Energy, Verdant Microgrid and Viridi; consulting firms Arcadis, Baringa, Viridi Edge and Zurich Resilience Solutions; electrical distributor Graybar; and the nonprofit Resilient Cities Network.

“Communities are under increasing pressure to maintain reliable, affordable power in the face of aging infrastructure, extreme weather, rising demand and evolving cyber-threats,” said Jana Gerber, North American President of Microgrids for Schneider Electric. “Power outages cost the US economy an estimated $150 billion each year, so the need for resilient energy infrastructure has never been more urgent.”

Examples of resilient energy systems already being deployed include:

AlphaStruxure microgrids at two bus depots in Montgomery County, Maryland, which will eventually support some 270 electric buses.

This more modest growth indicates a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening, Wood Mackenzie said.
Interestingly, Wood Mackenzie found VPP offtakes were the largest where utility data center commitments were the largest.
But doing so could limit private capital and aggregator access to the DER market, Wood Mackenzie said.
“In other words,” Wood Mackenzie said, “they would likely get behind the [distributed capacity procurement] model without utility ownership.”","The virtual power plant (VPP) market broadened more than it deepened over the last year, found Wood Mackenzie’s annual North American virtual power plant market report.

Company deployments, unique offtakers, and programs monetized each grew over 33% year-over-year. This reflects pull from new flexibility buyers as well as push from new VPP players, many who are filling new roles in the value chain.

“An ‘independent distributed power producer’ business model has emerged, whose thesis is that energy arbitrage and grid service revenue can finance an electricity retailer’s third-party-owned storage offering,” Wood Mackenzie said.

At the same time, overall VPP capacity grew 13.7%. This more modest growth indicates a market that is broadening faster than it is deepening, Wood Mackenzie said.

“Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie.

Enrollment caps on utility programs, capacity accreditation reforms in power markets, such as the migration to effective load carrying capability, and market barriers to small customers have limited capacity growth in existing programs, according to Wood Mackenzie.

Interestingly, Wood Mackenzie found VPP offtakes were the largest where utility data center commitments were the largest. California, Texas, New York and Massachusetts are the leading states, comprising 37% of all VPP deployments. However, the regions with the greatest utility commitments to data center capacity, PJM and ERCOT, were also found to have the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“This drives home the opportunity for utilities and even hyperscalers themselves to procure new VPP capacity to offset data center coincident peak demand, enabling faster grid connection,” Wood Mackenzie said. “In this way homeowners and business owners might actually earn revenue from the connection of new data centers, offsetting potential bill increases.”

Wood Mackenzie said that while hardwire providers are understandably enthusiastic about utilities as a new sales channel, the majority of other VPP companies do not support utilities rate basing DER.

But doing so could limit private capital and aggregator access to the DER market, Wood Mackenzie said. “There is far more enthusiasm for utilities integrating DER into system planning and operations, specifying where such resources are needed, but letting the market supply them, via customer programs and competitive solicitations.”

Doing so will enable the market to find the lowest-cost solution and drive innovation across the whole value chain, from program marketing to cross-technology optimization.

VPP critics of utility ownership see a utility monopoly of capital deployment choking off private capital and aggregator access from the DER market. According to Wood Mackenzie, the critics would rather customers and third-parties own assets and utilities procure grid services from them through customer bring-your-own-device programs, procurement contracts and flexibility markets.

What would you say are the most significant contributing factors to the unprecedented growth and transformation of the battery supply chain currently?
There’s been speculation about the long-term impact of tariffs on the supply chain.
How do you think supply chain resiliency will be defined years from now?
Steinberg: Certainly for this administration, supply chain resilience is America doing things itself.","The United States’ shifting administrative landscape continues to impact the global supply chain, creating challenges across markets, investment, trade, and policy. Uncertainty in Washington, D.C., and global investment hubs has led to market fluctuations in goods such as minerals and battery technologies, reshaping relationships between the US and its international partners, particularly amid growing competition with China.

Ben Steinberg, Executive Vice President and Co-Chair of the Critical Infrastructure Practice at Venn Strategies, will lead a plenary session at the Battery Show North America 2025 in Detroit, MI, titled “Leaders’ Roundtable: Industry and Policy Insights on Building a Resilient Battery Supply Chain for the Transportation and Energy Sectors.” The session will explore innovation growth, the policy’s role in supply chain resilience, and fostering partnerships. Ahead of his session, Battery Technology had the opportunity to interview him, and Steinberg shared insights on the future of US supply chain policy and the factors shaping resilience in the battery industry.

What would you say are the most significant contributing factors to the unprecedented growth and transformation of the battery supply chain currently?

Ben Steinberg, Executive Vice President and Co-Chair of the Critical Infrastructure Practice at Venn Strategies: We still have electric vehicle (EV) batteries being produced in key regions around the country and globally. You can't shy away from the fact that transportation electrification is a huge driving force and where we're headed as a global society.

You also have other downstream sectors, including grid storage—energy storage solutions paired with renewable energy—as well as dispatchable power for applications such as data centers that power artificial intelligence (AI) or industrial facilities like manufacturing and logistics centers. Finally, we’re seeing a further need for the electrified warfighter, whether it be soldier wearable, shipboard, or via drones. This is certainly playing out on the battlefield in Ukraine, and we will also see NATO alliance countries increasing their spending on similar technology in the coming years. Between transportation, electrification on the grid, the industrial market, and defense, we have a lot of growth opportunities for batteries.

There’s been speculation about the long-term impact of tariffs on the supply chain. What is the reality of the situation today?

Steinberg: I think it's a huge concern. I certainly want to see the US succeed, but in order for people to produce in this country, we need to bring in talent, machines, and resources to be able to do the work. I'm one of the first people out there to say we need homegrown industries, and we need to be as self-sufficient as possible. But our country can't do everything.

If you're going to build a mine and do that in a sophisticated way with, for example, autonomous underground machines that can do the mining in the safest, most effective, and efficient way, those pieces of equipment are likely to be built only in other countries. We shouldn't penalize our mining industry for going out and getting that equipment to do the project in a cost-effective, safe manner.

The US faces tough choices regarding trade deficits, revenue, and unfair trade practices, while aiming to support domestic manufacturing. A key challenge is China's dominance in global resources, processing them, and selling technology at below-market prices.

The question is, what are we going to do in relation to tariffs and that relationship? And how do we use trade negotiations with others, even our allies, to influence their relationships with China? Ideally, we have a system that lessens the burden of working in the U.S. with our allies and ratchets up tariffs on those where we do not align.

How well is the industry adapting to policy changes stemming from the new administration, and what impact has it had on the supply chain?

Steinberg: The train of thought here is the president has declared an energy emergency, and he's tied critical minerals to it. Critical minerals also include derivative products, which include batteries, EVs, semiconductor chips, and rare earth magnets.

You have to follow that train of thought to get to a conversation on batteries. It is an upstream, supply-side policy focus. And what industry needs to work on with Washington is that these minerals or materials need to go into something, like advanced technology, to have a thriving, productive society.

I think there's also a wariness about whether or not we have the ability to be self-sufficient and do mineral and battery production work without burning through money while China is out there underselling products to take over the entire market.

On the other hand, there are opportunities for folks to engage on battery-related priorities with the government. For instance, we are seeing the Department of Energy open up some of the stalled minerals and battery projects from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law, and new funding opportunities are opening up for mineral processing associated with the battery industry.

Certainly, we already worked really hard with Congress this year on the writing of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which protects tax credits for the battery industry through production credits (45X) and investment credits for deployment (48E, 45Y). Final guidance for those credits will likely come out on those early to mid-next year.""

US President Donald Trump holds up a chart while speaking during a “Make America Wealthy Again” trade announcement event in the Rose Garden at the White House on April 2, 2025 in Washington, DC. Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images.

There's a big opportunity here, and we're right on the cusp of being able to seize it. But there is work to do from the industry standpoint to make sure that the government understands why the work is so important, that industry can really deliver on the promise of making batteries at home, and works with the government to seek the best opportunities.

The other area where I think there's an opportunity to succeed is in these trade deals with countries such as Japan, which has offered to, as part of their trade deal, put $550 billion into the country. There's a real opportunity to work with partners like that. Folks should be thinking about that, because Japan has a lot to offer in the battery arena.

I think about South Korea as well. Unfortunately, we've had a big issue with the LG Energy Solution/Hyundai raid recently. I think there needs to be a lot of work done on diplomacy on that front to fix those issues because they too are such a critical part of the American competitiveness story.

What are examples of innovations today that are impacting supply chain resiliency?

Steinberg: The key is building processing technologies at scale in the US. That is the bedrock. That's where the slim margins are. There's a lot of hesitancy among chemical companies and material processors to set up shop here and know that they'll have battery producers and other large original equipment manufacturers to buy the product over the long term and at scale.

We have a lot of work to do from a financial standpoint and a policy standpoint to set up battery material processing facilities in the U.S. That is the biggest linchpin that the industry should be focused on in my opinion – those large partnerships.

Accelerating innovation in the battery sector is crucial, especially for startups struggling to enter large manufacturers' supply chains, which currently takes years. The goal is to consistently reduce qualification timelines to one year, fostering greater innovation and learning from China's advancements. It's not to say that the large companies are not doing it - it's that there is an opportunity to bring even more innovation into the system and to shorten those timelines.

How do you think supply chain resiliency will be defined years from now?

Steinberg: Certainly for this administration, supply chain resilience is America doing things itself. However, it also involves strong partnerships with our allies, enabling us to leverage each other's resources, expertise, and workforce.

Supply chain resilience requires long-term policies recognizing batteries as vital to the U.S. economy and national security, alongside government and industry investments to drive reliable programs and projects. Strong public-private and international partnerships are essential to leverage financial and natural resources, fostering collective resilience and effective collaboration with allies.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/bltbef56277f04a9d0a/650c1c89d9781a832a970fda/Burrel_20Feature_20Fig.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-24 12:03:57.513021

Attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia, meanwhile, are co-leading a 26-state coalition that submitted an 82-page letter in support of repealing the endangerment finding, stating it “was built on shaky ground — legally and scientifically.”

Dive Insight:

The EPA on July 29 proposed rescinding federal authority to regulate greenhouse gas emissions, kicking off a formal rulemaking process with a period for stakeholders to comment before the agency finalizes and publishes the proposed rule. Virtual public hearings were held Aug. 19-22, and written comments were due Monday. More than 300,000 comments were filed.

The EPA said rescinding the finding would “save Americans $54 billion in costs annually through the repeal of all greenhouse gas standards” and “give power back to the states to make their own decisions” about greenhouse gas regulations.

In its 225-page letter opposing the repeal, the coalition of attorneys general and cities and counties “describes the harms that the States and Local Governments are daily experiencing and that will be exacerbated if EPA finalizes the Proposal.”The letter argues that rescinding the endangerment finding would violate Supreme Court precedent and “disproportionately affect certain vulnerable groups and communities with environmental justice concerns.”

“We will continue to take action against dangerous federal actions that disregard scientific evidence,” said Chicago Mayor Brandon Johnson, one of the letter’s signatories, in an emailed statement. “The importance of upholding this long-held commitment is underscored by the plain truth that the effects of climate change are felt most acutely by working people and Black and Brown communities.”

“New York City is no stranger to the devastating effects of natural disasters,” New York Mayor Eric Adams, who also signed the letter, said in a statement. “With more extreme weather events hitting the five boroughs more often, for our safety and to protect our economy, we must be prepared for the effects of climate change, including by putting in place stronger federal regulations of greenhouse gases.”

West Virginia Gov. Patrick Morrisey said in a statement Aug. 1 that the endangerment finding “represents quintessential federal overreach and was never borne out by the law.” President Donald Trump and EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin are “reining in this overreach so states such as West Virginia can unleash American energy and compete successfully against China,” Morrisey said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/YBKwsv9prlTkZB2t9UEkiizKRBxvZ5W0CPcSiE1BifI/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjI5OTgyODkyLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-24 12:05:04.012600

C40 Cities X Ramboll Foundation

Yesterday evening, C40 Co-Chair and Freetown Mayor Aki-Sawyerr, C40 Cities Executive Director Mark Watts and Søren Nielsen of the Ramboll Foundation met to celebrate C40 Cities’ strategic partnership with the Ramboll Foundation.

Ramboll’s unrestricted funding to C40 Cities is an example of great leadership in the sector in the current political climate and a real vote of confidence in resilient cities where communities and nature thrive.

This new strategic partnership builds on our long-standing relationship with the Ramboll Group. The collaboration will help cities embed resilience and climate adaptation into long-term planning, governance and policy.

Climate finance

Mayor of Phoenix and C40 Cities Steering Committee member Kate Gallego joined The Climate Group Hub Live for the panel ‘Betting on a Breakthrough – Where Should the Smart Money Go Now?’. Joined by The Economist, RMI, Amalgamated Bank and BCG, Mayor Gallego underlined the role of cities in directing investment.

Cities are where climate risks hit hardest, but they’re also where so much innovation starts – from transit to infrastructure.

Kate Gallego, Mayor of Phoenix

Cities are already investing in adaptation and resilience, but they cannot do it alone. Achieving global climate goals means directing significantly more public and private finance toward city-led solutions that protect people, create jobs, and reduce long-term risk.

The future of clean transport

Mete Coban, Deputy Mayor of London and C40 Board Member, joined a vital conversation on the future of clean transport in cities.

Coban highlighted the tangible progress London has made, particularly in expanding electric vehicle access and rethinking transport systems at a local level. But he also acknowledged the steep road ahead and the urgent need for bold, coordinated policymaking to drive further change.

He called for faster action from national governments, more support for local authorities, and a sharper focus on equity to ensure the transition benefits everyone.

As cities around the world grapple with similar challenges, the message is clear: the clean transport revolution is underway, but breaking down the final barriers will require bold leadership, cross-sector collaboration, and a commitment to long-term, systemic change.

Tackling climate disinformation

At the Solutions Dialogue on Information Integrity. C40’s Director of Political Strategy and Campaigns, Donna Hume, addressed the tide of disinformation that threatens climate action.

The event showcased best practices of tackling disinformation, evidence-based policy interventions, and explored how to accelerate the implementation of initiatives that align with the goals of the Paris Agreement.

Discussions on disinformation and information integrity will continue at the Secretary-General’s Special High-level Event on Climate Action, building momentum and support for this crucial topic, leading into COP30.

He said that electric vehicles can be charged overnight and can go up to five days without a recharge.
The Porter Town Council has yet to decide what they will do.","More than three years after the town of Porter and 25 other Northwest Indiana communities were awarded a federal grant to pay for electric-powered pickup trucks and charging stations, the project is ready to go forward.

That was the message Ryan Lisek, program director of Drive Clean Indiana, delivered to the Porter Town Council Tuesday. Lisek came to the council meeting to answer questions about the project.

The $4 million grant was awarded in May 2022, which would enable municipalities in Porter and Lake counties to obtain electric trucks and charging stations. The source of the federal dollars was the $1.2 trillion Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act, which then-President Joe Biden signed on Nov. 5, 2021. One of the stated goals was to address climate change.

The grant money was originally going to be coordinated through the city of Lake Station, the lead applicant. Lisek said that has changed so that the federal money, held by the Indiana Department of Transportation, will be distributed by the Northern Indiana Regional Planning Commission. Each community would have a separate contract to buy the vehicles.

Lisek said NIRPC’s board is scheduled to approve the arrangement at its December meeting. The communities could begin buying the electric-powered trucks during the first quarter of 2026.

Porter Council President Laura Madigan, D-Ward 1, asked Lisek if there is a possibility that the federal government will suddenly claw back the money.

The way the program works is, the town would pay up front for the vehicles, then be reimbursed for up to 80% of the cost. Madigan said her concern is that the town could purchase a vehicle, and the federal government would suddenly take back the money that had been allocated.

“There is a high likelihood that will not happen,” Lisek said. “However, things have been very different this year.”

Lisek was referring to the change in philosophy on electric vehicles with the Trump administration and budget cuts made by the federal Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE).

Councilman James Burge, I-Ward 4, also wondered about the long-term because the Trump administration’s policies have not been as friendly toward electric vehicles compared to the Biden administration.

“It was a big day when Elon (Musk) and Trump broke up,” Lisek said. Musk founded Tesla, a leading electric vehicle producer.

Lisek said he still believes there is a future for electric vehicles. He noted that Ford and Chevrolet continue to be committed to producing the vehicles.

If Porter were to follow through, the grant would provide $33,280 per vehicle. Porter was interested in buying Ford F-150 Lightning pickup trucks. Porter wanted to purchase four trucks, so the grant would pay $133,120, with the town having to come up with $74,880.

The town was also looking to install two charging stations. The grant would pay 80% of the charging station’s $80,000 cost, Lisek said.

Lisek said that the town, at no cost, could receive Tesla charging stations that could be hooked up at a location that would have Wi-Fi, Lisek said.

Council members also asked if the electric pickup trucks would be suitable for police and fire departments.

Lisek said that Bargersville, south of Indianapolis, has a fleet of 14 Teslas and they have saved $500,000 in fuel costs over the past few years. He said that electric vehicles can be charged overnight and can go up to five days without a recharge.

The Porter Town Council has yet to decide what they will do. Town officials at the last council meeting said if they went forward with buying the vehicles, they would buy fewer of them.

In other business, Porter Police Chief Dan Dickey announced that the Police Commission has selected Sgt. Tom Blythe as the next assistant police chief.

The appointment will take effect after Oct. 31, when the current Assistant Police Chief Jason Casbon retires.

Blythe joined the department in 2021. He received honors from the Federal Railroad Administration and Indiana Operation Lifesaver for his actions on Aug. 1, 2021, when he talked a despondent man who was lying down on the tracks at Beam Street into getting up moments before an oncoming train would have run him over.

Last month, the GHG Protocol dropped a bombshell on clean energy markets. Through a blog post and meeting minutes, we learned that the GHGP Independent Standards Board, or ISB, had voted to disregard the recommendation of its experts, walk back expectations previously set publicly, and prioritize optics over impact.

This explosive development relates to the GHGP’s revision process for Scope 2 accounting that governs how organizations calculate the emissions associated with electricity use and clean energy purchases.

And before you dismiss this concern as the realm of wonkish energy nerds, know this: In the U.S. alone, carbon accounting has supported the development of over $150 billion of clean energy infrastructure. Changes to the GHGP Scope 2 Protocol will absolutely shape how much clean energy infrastructure we build in the decade ahead — for better or for worse.

GHGP thumbs its nose at emissions experts and the public

There were two major decisions ahead of the ISB for a vote: whether to advance hourly matching as a mandate for inventory accounting, and whether to advance an impact accounting metric in parallel. Prior to the ISB vote, nearly 40% of the expert Technical Working Group, or TWG, that is tasked with developing the technical standards voted against hourly matching as a mandate, while 74% of TWG members voted to advance impact accounting in parallel as a critical, complementary methodology.

Despite the widespread TWG support, the ISB voted not to advance impact accounting to the public comment period in parallel with hourly matching, while all but a single dissenting ISB member voted to advance the plan to mandate hourly matching.

Some have argued that the ISB didn’t kill impact accounting, but merely sent it on a different path. This is nonsense. The public notes show the ISB prefers not to allow impact accounting for corporate target-setting of net emissions — which would render it functionally useless — and has delayed its public consultation, placing it on an uncertain timeline no longer in parallel with hourly matching. It also stated a need for an increasingly rigorous additionality test, raising doubts about real-world feasibility. So, while the ISB did not explicitly kill impact accounting, they did vote to mortally wound it.

So what happened? How did GHGP’s revision process take such a late, wrong turn? And why do I care? Why should you care?

Why the world — not just Scope 2 — needs impact accounting

The world needs voluntary corporate action that leads to the fastest emissions reductions possible. To that end, we need a viable and useful impact accounting option under the GHG Protocol to maintain and expand the accessibility of voluntary clean energy procurement, and to maximize the real-world emissions impact of those actions.

It’s widely accepted that consequential accounting (aka impact accounting) is the best metric available to incentivize high-impact investment in new projects. That’s because — as its name implies — it focuses on measuring the system-level impact of energy consumption and clean energy procurement over simply allocating existing emissions to consumers of power.

Impact accounting calculates two fundamental numbers: the emission impacts caused by an organization’s electricity consumption, and the emission impacts caused by an organization’s procured clean energy generation. As soon as you embrace that basic premise, you empower and incentivize organizations to site and operate their consumption to minimize the negative impact of their consumption, and to site and operate their clean energy procurement to maximize the positive impact.

Mandated hourly matching’s costs outweigh the benefits

Hourly matching has its merits toward certain goals under specific conditions. It has the potential to yield a more rigorous attributional inventory. It can create an incentive for clean firm generation, such as geothermal and nuclear. And at very high matching percentages (i.e., >90% hourly matching), it can achieve greater avoided emissions as compared to the current status quo of annual matching.

But that’s about where the benefits stop and the long list of problems begins.

Hourly matching incentivizes more renewable energy where clean energy is already abundant (e.g., Global North power grids where large corporations concentrate their loads) at the expense of where that investment is most needed and most valuable.

Hourly matching can unintentionally incentivize poor grid citizenship, per McKinsey, when entities prioritize self-centric reporting over system-level needs. Hourly matching not only allows, but incentivizes procurement of RECs from existing clean, firm projects, such as legacy hydro and nuclear over investment in new infrastructure.

Operationally, hourly matching is “absolutely impossible” for many distributed and variable load profiles. Hourly matching is expensive: analysis from experts such as TCR find a significant cost premium. And while many organizations have signaled a willingness to pay premiums to increase their impact, few have shown the same appetite to pay a premium for accounting benefits alone.

Given all those challenges, mandating location and hourly matching is expected to be destructive to voluntary demand, as has been pointed out repeatedly by NGOs and a variety of trade groups, including both the buyers and the sellers of clean energy.

Lastly, experts from Carnegie Mellon, Cornell, Johns Hopkins, Stanford, Minnesota, Texas and many others agree that hourly matching’s on-paper benefits “rely on simplified assumptions that do not reflect the economic or physical realities of project development or grid operations.” Harvard’s renowned power market expert Bill Hogan was more blunt: “24x7 matching of individual generation and load is not workable.”

Read More in Generation

A chorus of experts and stakeholders has been sounding the alarm on this issue with increasing urgency. Beyond the sources above, those shouting include non-profits (GHG Institute, RMI), academics (MIT, University of Cologne), consultants (E3, Green Strategies), startups (Ever.Green, Clearloop) and individual experts (Jigar Shah).

Despite all these voices, the GHGP appears to be caving to a vocal minority of hourly matching advocates focused on ensuring their procurement preference becomes a requirement for the entire voluntary market.

It’s not too late for GHGP to course correct

The lure of hourly matching is that it fights against a trope common among clean energy antagonists: How can companies claim to be powered 100% by renewable energy when the wind doesn’t always blow and the sun doesn’t always shine?

My response to that? Carbon doesn’t care if it’s emitted at night in California or during the day in Virginia: it warms the planet all the same. The focus of the GHGP should not be on backing usage claims about what power a company is consuming — something impossible to prove given grid dynamics — but to measure carbon emissions as accurately as possible.

So, if you wake up in the morning passionate about allocating blame for existing emissions, then you should applaud the ISB’s current trajectory. But if instead you care, as I do, about accelerating the development of valuable clean energy infrastructure and advancing our fight against climate change, then please join me in advocating for an about-face for the GHGP’s current trajectory.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/7B-SosXhekOVysfaYuAGUSfYGVQc42L3Gp4Wb2zRvZA/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xMzYwMjQxNzg2LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-09-24 14:02:54.246519

In April of 2025, the company kick-started work at the Greenville PV Module Factory (Phase I). The factory produces Gamma series of monofacial modules and Vega series of bifacial modules. Both the products are based on passivated emitter rear contact (PERC) technology.

The factory is now equipped with three module production lines. This, the company insists, will contribute toward meeting “the growing demand for domestically produced solar products”.

“The addition of a third production line marks another important milestone in our Greenville journey,” said Marco Marquez, the General Manager of the Greenville factory. “It further enhances our ability to serve our customers with reliable, US-made PV modules while creating high-quality local jobs.”

$400 Million Investment

Boviet Solar has sought to expand cell manufacturing capacity in tandem with its module manufacturing capacity, and in August completed exterior construction work on a cell manufacturing facility at the Greenville site. The cell facility is expected to begin commercial operation in the second half of 2026, and the factory’s cell and module components represent a USD 400 million investment.

Along with Boviet Solar, ES Foundry has made significant progress in establishing its cell manufacturing facility in the US, beginning production at its South Carolina plant in February. The company is prioritising PERC cell technology, which CEO Alex Zhu recently described as more “proven and reliable” than tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon) cells. Although TOPCon cells boast higher efficiency, they have been entangled in several patent disputes between manufacturers throughout this year.

The outcomes rarely had any discernible impact and often looked like recycled trash. Much of it was, at best, what McDonough and Braungart refer to as “down-cycling” – stopping off as something else on its way to landfill (2003, p.59).

Shifts in Sustainable Design Education

Today, many sustainable design programs exist within schools of architecture, focusing on building adaptation and reuse. After all, many buildings long outlive the purpose for which they were built (Hollis, 2009. p.9). Other sustainable design programs around the world have a focus on “transformation” and societal shift, often aligned with the UN’s 17 sustainability goals encompassing zero hunger, quality education and clean water.

While science is vital in giving us a grasp of the facts, the climate crisis is every bit a cultural crisis. Those of us in the arts and humanities have an equally vital role to play. Sustainability is interdisciplinary, period.

Sustainable cities and civic infrastructure

Environmental stewardship

Students approach these through systems intervention and strategic narratives.

Complex Challenges in Sustainability

The challenges within sustainability and the climate crisis are incredibly complex, made up of a myriad of wicked problems within convoluted systems. Often, one well-intended intervention can lead to further problems. For example, plastic bag bans can advance reuse, but often lead to an extreme excess of heavier reusable bags. Waste diversion strategies require an interrogation of the entire system.

In the case of soda cans, the process begins with the extraction of bauxite ore from the ground, through the shipping, processing, shipping again, fabrication, sale, consumption, and its eventual return to the production cycle. This includes looking at ancillary processes like applying ink to the outside of the can, lining the inside with a film of acrylic or polyester, crating the cans, wrapping them in polythene, displaying in shops, not to mention the complexities of manufacturing sugary effervescent drinks that fill them.

The key is making the linear circular and reducing the amount of materials and energy used along the way, but it also begs the question: in what other ways could we quench our thirst?

Detroit as a Living Laboratory

For hands-on experience, Detroit is the perfect place to learn about sustainability, with powerful initiatives from both the ground up and the top down. There are many grassroots organizations and NGOs addressing food waste, urban farming, composting, clothing, building reuse and material salvage, climate justice, clean drinking water, clean rivers, green ways, green spaces, and energy reduction, to name a few.

The City of Detroit has a robust sustainability office and is in the process of finalizing its waste diversion strategy. The State of Michigan has proactive measures for ambitious sustainability goals, which it showcases annually at the Michigan Healthy Climate conference. CCS has an incredible community and industry network with whom we partner for experiential learning.

The program is transformational for its students and those with whom they work.

“We’re doing the exact opposite of what the U.S. is doing, which, by the way, I find concerning and problematic,” he said in an interview in New York City. He described the actions of the Trump administration on climate as “basically checking out.”

But other big economies, he said, are continuing to step up their targets for reducing their emissions of planet-warming greenhouse gases. That will be put to the test on Wednesday in New York City, where the United Nations plans to host a climate summit at which 118 countries are expected to announce their 2035 emissions-reductions targets under the Paris climate accord.

That session could be a bit awkward for the European Union, given that its lawmakers haven’t yet finalized the E.U.’s 2035 climate targets. China is expected to announce its targets, which will be closely watched given the scale of China’s current emissions, but also its rapid embrace of solar, wind and battery manufacturing and its desire to pivot a significant part of its economy to clean-energy technologies.

In a speech on Tuesday to the U.N. General Assembly, Mr. Trump spent a portion of his speech dismissing the dangers of climate change and lashing out at wind turbines, environmentalists and allies around the world.

The United States has said it will withdraw from the Paris accord, so it is not expected to participate in the U.N. climate summit this week or announce emissions-reductions targets of its own.

Mr. Hoekstra brushed off the E.U.’s delay in issuing its new climate targets as a feature of Europe’s democratic setup. The European Union has tentatively agreed to reduce its emissions in the range of 66 percent to 72 percent by 2035, compared with 1990 levels, and Mr. Hoekstra said the terms would be finalized by the time the international climate talks known as COP30 begin in Brazil in early November.

“That is what we call democracy,” he said. “And 10 out of 10 times, I would argue that such a system and such an approach is by far the better and the superior” system to one that “lacks the ambition that the world needs, and that doesn’t have democratic legitimacy.”

The San Diego-based company announced it will offload a 45% stake in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to a consortium led by private equity group KKR and the Canada Pension Plan Investment Board. The deal, valuing the business at $31.7 billion, is expected to close in mid-2026 and marks one of the largest transactions in the US energy sector this year.

Sempra will remain a minority investor alongside the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority but says the sale will free up funds for regulated utility operations in California and Texas. Chief Executive Officer of Sempra, Jeffrey W. Martin, called the deal “a major step towards reshaping Sempra as a leading US utility growth company”.

The timing of the divestment coincides with a final investment decision on Port Arthur LNG Phase 2 in Texas. Backed by global investors including Blackstone, Apollo and Goldman Sachs, the $14 billion project will add two new liquefaction units, effectively doubling the site’s export capacity. Construction is due to begin soon, with operations targeted for 2030 and 2031.

For local communities, the LNG expansion is expected to generate thousands of construction jobs and long-term operational roles, as well as cementing Port Arthur’s role in US energy exports. The project also strengthens America’s position as the world’s top LNG supplier, a role that has grown increasingly important amid global energy insecurity.

Analysts say the twin announcements reflect a balancing act: Sempra is narrowing its business to focus on the steadier returns of utilities while still holding a stake in high-growth global gas markets. Proceeds from the sale will support Sempra’s $48 billion capital programme for 2025–2029 without raising customer bills through new equity financing.

Regulators may want to consider pairing with researchers to design the best wording for similar enforcement letters.","For regulators with dwindling enforcement resources, convincing businesses to comply with rules is only becoming more challenging. Yet, regulators still have options.

Harvard Business School Professor Michael Toffel and fellow researchers teamed with the US

(EPA) to test which messages about lead-paint violation penalties increased compliance among California contractors. The article “Sending a Message: An Empirical Assessment of Responses to Punitive and Non-punitive Compliance Messaging Strategies” finds that the threat of the stick is more powerful than the reward of the carrot, challenging conventional wisdom on cooperative enforcement strategies.

In partnership with the EPA’s Region IX office, the researchers tracked some 20,000 enforcement letters sent under the agency’s Renovation, Repair, and Painting Rule (RRP). The rule, issued in 2008, requires renovation contractors working on buildings built before 1978 to be EPA Lead-Safe-Certified. The researchers find that a carefully crafted message emphasizing the risk of inspection or certification checks yielded nearly twice as many certifications as the least effective letter, even when the probability of being caught remains low.

The findings challenge conventional wisdom and offer a cost-effective tool for agencies operating under resource constraints, say the authors. “When you bring up threats of penalties together with the heightened possibility of inspection, all of a sudden, some people take it more seriously,” says Toffel, the Senator John Heinz Professor of Environmental Management.

He coauthored the paper, forthcoming in the journal Ecology Law Quarterly, with Jodi L. Short, the Mary Kay Kane Distinguished Professor of Law at UC Law, San Francisco; Elizabeth A. Keenan, a professor at Dartmouth College’s Tuck School of Business; and Melissa Ouellet, a data scientist at the University of Potsdam’s Hasso Plattner Institute in Germany.

When agencies and academics partner

The challenges to enforcement are significant. Estimates suggest that there are over half-a-million remodeling businesses in the United States, but the agency inspects less than 0.5 percent of them annually. The renovation contractor market ranges from publicly traded multinational companies to day laborers, making it difficult to create an enforcement strategy that reaches everyone.

The EPA’s California enforcement team turned to Short to help design a field experiment that would test several alternative enforcement letters to California contractors to determine which version was most effective in prompting the contractors to get certified. Short put together the team of researchers, including Toffel, to help craft four different messages.

Four kinds of letters for 20,000 contractors

A sample list of 20,000 contractors who ultimately received letters was culled from almost 185,000 names in the California Department of Consumer Affairs’ Contractors State License Board database and EPA data that included expired certifications.

Mailed in January and February of 2023, letters fell into four categories. Each letter was sent to 5,000 contractors; an additional 5,000 contractors who served as the control group received no letter.

All four versions of the letter provided information about the program, including potential penalty amounts and compliance assistance resources. The Informational (baseline) letter stopped there, and the other three letters added additional messaging as described above. It turns out that the prospect of getting caught proved to be more effective than an information notice that included the threat of fines, a plea on moral grounds, or a carrot-based approach that dangled inclusion on a list of certified contractors recommended by

.

“It’s the probability that you'll be detected, the possibility that you'll get caught, that gained traction,” Short says. “That seemed to be enough to move the needle for some contractors.”

Deterrence is a powerful tool

Another important finding: the deterrence letter was most successful with never-before-certified contractors—boosting compliance by about 50%. For that group, 3.3% of letter recipients got certified, whereas the informational letter yielded 2.2% new certifications. Interestingly, the positive incentives letter was much less effective, prompting only 1.5% of the never-before-certified contractors to get certified.

Contractors whose certification had expired responded best to the informational letter, with 10% re-upping certification. The deterrence letter was close behind at 9.6%. “It's an important insight that you can actually do worse than simply providing information. That’s a little counterintuitive,” Short notes.

The “moral” incentive letter, for instance, which led to certification by only 7.6% of the expirees who received it, may have resulted in a backlash, the authors write.

“Maybe it's so obvious that contractors were offended when they got a letter that said ‘you have to protect the children.’ And they may have thought ‘Duh, that's what I'm doing.’ It's hard to know just from the data that we have, because we did not talk to individual contractors about their reactions to the letters” Short says. “We can only speculate. But it does suggest that using moral messaging, particularly for things that might be morally obvious, can backfire.”

Implications for regulators

Even when regulatory enforcement resources are tight, the mere perception of heightened enforcement can be effective, the authors suggest. Contractors who know that enforcement probability is low may have been lulled into thinking they’d fallen off the agency’s radar, the authors write, perhaps producing an “outsized deterrent effect” when they learned that they are visible to the regulator.

Regulators may want to consider pairing with researchers to design the best wording for similar enforcement letters. In the EPA’s case, the agency got many contractors to follow the lead-safe rule with little cost, and running the experiment cost very little as the agency was already planning to send letters.

Experiments can help regulators be more productive in achieving their goals, Toffel says, “as much as 50% more, in this research project.” While such approaches don’t require academic support, a researcher’s insight can’t hurt.

“We're going to do research anyway,” Toffel says. “Many of us aim to do research that can have real-world impact, such as helping managers craft more effective messages. This research project enables regulators to get more out of whatever amount of resources they have to invest in enforcement and inspection actions.”

They’re aiming to break ground in 2026 and kick off operations by 2029. What sets this project apart is its use of autothermal reforming combined with carbon capture and sequestration from 1PointFive, designed to trap more than 95% of CO₂ emissions. With an annual capacity of 1.4 million metric tons, Blue Point is poised to satisfy surging demand for clean ammonia—whether as a next-gen fuel or a greener fertilizer—while creating over 100 direct jobs and upwards of 300 indirect roles. CF Industries will handle long-term operations and maintenance, drawing on decades of expertise running the nearby Donaldsonville Complex and a skilled Louisiana workforce.

Strategic & Regional Impact

Louisiana has long been kingpin in the global ammonia scene, and this investment cements that crown while pushing the state into the spotlight for next-generation fuels. For JERA and Mitsui, a reliable pipeline of low-carbon ammonia ticks big boxes for Japan’s energy security and climate pledges. The plan taps into Louisiana’s plentiful feedstock, deep-water ports and efficient export routes—driving down shipping expenses and the carbon footprint of transported ammonia. In doing so, Blue Point not only underscores the U.S. stance in the budding clean ammonia market but also beckons fresh renewable energy dollars to the region, giving local GDP a healthy boost. Throw in looming carbon border adjustments, ESG-linked offtake deals and evolving trade rules, and you’ve got a game-changer for industrial decarbonization on a global scale.

Technical Snapshot

At the heart of Blue Point is autothermal reforming (ATR), where natural gas meets oxygen and steam to whip up a hydrogen-rich syngas. Then comes the magic: a state-of-the-art CCS system that captures over 95% of the CO₂. Engineers have tweaked the process to recover heat and cut energy losses, which is critical given how energy-hungry ammonia production can be. Once captured, the CO₂ gets compressed, piped and permanently tucked away in geological formations courtesy of 1PointFive. The design is modular too, meaning CF Industries could replicate or scale it at other sites—a blueprint for broader industrial decarbonization.

Historical Context

Ascension Parish sits smack in Louisiana’s famous “Chemical Corridor”—or “Cancer Alley,” as locals sometimes call it. Since the 1950s and ’60s, fertilizer and petrochemical plants, including CF Industries’ own Donaldsonville Complex, have keyed off cheap feedstocks along the Mississippi. But community memories run deep: leaks like the 2013 ammonia release at Donaldsonville still fuel calls for cleaner operations. Over the decades, nearby universities and tech schools have cranked out generations of chemical pros. Now, project leaders are in talks to expand scholarships and apprenticeships, making sure Blue Point has a steady stream of homegrown talent.

Policy & Financing

Even though the Inflation Reduction Act doesn’t single out ammonia, its tax credits for carbon sequestration and low-carbon hydrogen feedstock are a big win for Blue Point’s bottom line. Louisiana’s economic development agencies sweetened the pot with property tax breaks, workforce training grants and revolving loan funds. By sharing upfront costs between public and private players, they’ve lowered the project’s weighted average cost of capital. The result? A more attractive levelized cost of ammonia and a faster path to ROI—key factors that ultimately sealed the investment decision.

Partnership Structure & Execution

The joint venture’s equity split mirrors each partner’s strengths and contributions. CF Industries leads day-to-day operations and maintenance, leveraging its decades of know-how at Donaldsonville. Meanwhile, JERA and Mitsui bring deep pockets and global market reach. CF’s extra $550 million investment secures dedicated storage, loading docks and pipeline tie-ins, ensuring a smooth startup and robust O&M. While exact equity percentages are under wraps, the shares are structured so CF Industries’ operational role and JERA/Mitsui’s offtake guarantees all line up neatly.

Export & Global Relevance

With 1.4 million metric tons of annual capacity, Blue Point is tailor-made for exports. Louisiana’s deep-water ports and inland network make shipping clean ammonia to Asia and Europe a breeze. Japanese utilities see ammonia as a hydrogen carrier that can back up renewables, and direct shipping lanes from the Gulf Coast slash midstream handling costs. Plus, competitive freight rates—up to 15% below global averages—could position U.S. ammonia as the go-to, lower-carbon feedstock for fertilizer makers and marine fuel blenders. European refiners have already asked about trial shipments, adding diversity to the offtake lineup.

Economic & Job Creation

Blue Point isn’t just big on emissions cuts—it’s a local economic engine. We’re talking 103 high-wage permanent jobs plus another 311 in construction, logistics and service roles. Beyond payroll, the project inks contracts with local steel shops, mechanical firms and haulers, cranking up the multiplier effect. Once up and running, Blue Point could pump around $50 million a year into local tax coffers—boosting Ascension Parish’s finances and fueling vital public services.

Community & Stakeholder Engagement

Outreach kicked off early, with partners pledging open-book emissions reporting. Community groups have long pushed back on industrial growth over air quality and health concerns. Blue Point’s reply? Top-tier CCS, 24/7 leak detection systems and regular emergency drills. They’ve also agreed to fund independent air-monitoring stations and back local health programs to tackle pollution legacies. But they know the real work is ongoing dialogue and robust third-party oversight to keep that social license in good standing.

Environmental Considerations

Sure, CCS slashes CO₂ streams, but stacking new plants in an already dense industrial zone comes with trade-offs. Critics warn it might mask upstream methane leaks tied to natural gas. The project’s environmental impact statement dives deep—modeling potential CO₂ migration, assessing seismic risks of storage sites and laying out worst-case scenarios. Third-party verifiers will audit CCS performance, while the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality and EPA will keep a close eye on permits. Balancing cleaner ammonia production with local air quality remains a hot topic.

Key Takeaways

This $4 billion investment will bring Blue Point online by 2029, churning out 1.4 million metric tons of low-carbon ammonia annually.

Advanced autothermal reforming and CCS by 1PointFive aim to capture over 95% of CO₂ emissions, showcasing scalable carbon capture and sequestration.

Over 100 permanent and 311 indirect jobs—plus a $550 million ancillary infrastructure boost—will supercharge the regional economy.

Federal and state incentives help lower the levelized cost of ammonia, speeding up the project’s ROI.

Higher education is indeed a national treasure — a model for excellence that is emulated across the globe.

His disdain for DEI in higher education appears to be a driver for his attacks on higher education.","The Sept. 30 deadline to avoid a government shutdown and fund the government through the 2026 fiscal year has both Republicans and Democrats scrambling.

Continuing resolutions have become far too common. The White House pushed for a four-month continuing resolution, which was mostly ignored. The House voted for a seven-week continuing resolution, which was subsequently voted down in the Senate. All such efforts do nothing more than “kick the can down the road” and delay hard decisions.

Given the forecasted deficits resulting from the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act,” financial waste is something that our nation can ill afford. With more than $37 trillion of accumulated government debt, independent of who owns such debt, the fiscal time bomb continues to tick, with budget hawks remaining as the lone voices expressing any concern.

If there is any hope that our nation will be able to climb out of its current fiscal quagmire, money spent by the government should have some positive return on investment. Of course, this does not mean that every expenditure must provide an immediate positive payback; expenditures related to healthcare and national security, for instance, are necessary investments in the well-being of the country. What it does mean is that across a swath of the population, the nation should be better for spending taxpayer dollars.

Examples of such investments in the past are ubiquitous.

In 1956, President Eisenhower signed legislation that created the interstate highway system. This investment has benefited every person who has traveled on our nation’s road transportation system. The economic benefits of this investment have been immeasurable. Not only did the construction of the system create jobs, many companies built systems around it, including hotels, restaurants and shopping venues. This investment continues to pay dividends across the economy.

The same holds true with the national airspace system, which the Federal Aviation Administration oversees. Ensuring safe and reliable air travel creates economic value that a large swath of the population benefits from. That is why not making the necessary investments to upgrade and enhance the air traffic control system are ill-conceived, risking a lost trust in what is a national benefit for most people.

Another investment that enjoys a positive return on investment is higher education. An educated population creates wealth. It has facilitated our digital economy, encouraged entrepreneurship and permitted our service economy to grow at a pace that produced a $293 billion trade surplus in 2024, with nearly 20 percent of this due to international education. College training will continue to be required for many new jobs created in the future. Higher education is indeed a national treasure — a model for excellence that is emulated across the globe.

At the same time, attacks on higher education are suppressing their freedoms and effectiveness. Given that education produced a $50 billion trade surplus in 2023, cutting the very industry that provides a positive return on investment is nonsensical.

The president may be measuring return on investment based on his ideological likes and dislikes. His disdain for DEI in higher education appears to be a driver for his attacks on higher education. Moreover, his style in negotiating “deals” with countries on tariffs gives each of them the motivation to flatter his ego and appease his every whim.

Then there is the cost of servicing the accumulated government debt. Uncertainty surrounding the president’s on again, off again, changes in tariff rates created uncertainty in the economy, pushing the Federal Reserve to keep interest rates steady, rather than dropping them as the president wanted. A slowing economy prompted the recent one-quarter point drop in the Federal Reserve benchmark interest rate, the first such rate decrease in nine months. Note that each one-point drop in interest rates would save the government no less than $6 billion in monthly debt service payments just on short-term debt alone.

In an era with out-of-control government spending, persistent budget deficits and a Congress whose actions seem only to serve to help them get reelected and retain their own power, something has to give. Spending more because it is easy is not a sustainable path forward.

This time around, lawmakers have their hands full to avoid a government shutdown. History suggests that some compromise will be reached at the 11th hour, though some believe this time may be different. Recall that the most recent government shutdown occurred during the first Trump administration. It remains to be seen whether history will repeat itself.

When DOGE was created to root out government waste, it needed look no further than how Congress funds the government. As someone who spent time in the federal government, continuing resolutions and the threat of a government shutdown create more financial waste than anything the 2.3 million federal employees can ever imagine squandering on their own.

In an ideal world, a simple concept like return on investment should be the foundation for how the government sets and funds budget priorities. With ubiquitous government dysfunction in Washington today, however, continuing resolutions that dodge difficult decisions and steer clear of reasonable compromises continue to be the path taken, all paid for by taxpayers.

New York’s $1 billion Sustainable Future Program is a critical step toward a healthier and more equitable future, lowering energy costs for families and creating thousands of good jobs.
We look forward to continued collaboration with Governor Hochul to advance these critical programs,” Climate Jobs NY Executive Director Esther Rosario said, “Governor Hochul’s Sustainable Future Program is a transformative investment in New York’s clean energy future.
That’s why we applaud today’s announcement allocating dedicated funding for medium- and heavy-duty truck charging in New York State.","Governor Hochul today, while participating in the U.S Climate Alliance’s roundtable, announced the next steps for her landmark $1 billion Sustainable Future Program to accelerate capital projects in New York's transition to a cleaner, greener future. This historic investment will create good-paying jobs, lower energy costs for New Yorkers, and slash harmful emissions in the face of federal rollbacks.

“New York is a national leader in climate action, and we're proving that we can build a thriving green economy while protecting our planet,” Governor Hochul said. “While others may retreat, we are doubling down. The $1 billion investment from our Sustainable Future Program will directly benefit New Yorkers by making our homes more energy-efficient, our schools healthier, and our communities more resilient. We are creating jobs, improving public health, and ensuring a just and affordable transition for every community.”

The $1 billion Sustainable Future Program, announced in this year’s State of the State, is the largest climate investment in New York’s history. Today’s announcement allocates funding to key areas of the state's climate plan to help make the transition more affordable for all New Yorkers.

Empowering New Yorkers with Energy Efficiency

$50 million will be allocated to the EmPower+ program to provide low- and moderate-income residents with no-cost home energy assessments and energy efficiency upgrades. NYSERDA will focus this funding on heat pump installations, a key technology for reducing reliance on fossil fuels in residential heating and cooling.

Greening Our Schools

$50 million will be used to help under-resourced public schools across the state decarbonize their building portfolios. This investment will improve indoor air quality for students and staff and reduce the schools’ carbon footprint.

Investing in Thermal Energy Networks

$200 million is dedicated to expanding thermal energy networks, which use a system of pipes to share heating and cooling resources among multiple buildings. This funding will support projects at municipal and State-owned buildings, and will specifically include several projects within the State University of New York (SUNY) system:

SUNY Purchase: $50 million to design and construct the first phase of a thermal energy network and establish a framework for future geothermal systems on campus.

State University of New York at Buffalo: $68 million to design and build energy hubs and thermal energy networks, phasing out fossil fuel-based systems and replacing them with on-site electrical systems.

State University of New York at Stony Brook: $22 million to design and construct thermal energy systems at two buildings on campus.

New York State Energy Research and Development Authority President and CEO Doreen M. Harris said, “Governor Hochul has made clear her commitment to supporting generational investments like the Sustainable Future Program to foster an improved quality of life for all New Yorkers. Cleaning the air we breathe while lowering energy costs by advancing renewable energy projects, zero-emission transportation options and energy efficient building upgrades provides communities across the state with a critical foundation for a sustainable future.”

New York State Department of Environmental Conservation Commissioner Amanda Lefton said, “Governor Hochul is making nation-leading investments to meaningfully fight climate change and make a future truly sustainable in New York. This landmark $1 billion Sustainable Future Program is supporting New York’s transition to an affordable and accessible green future that will offer relief for homeowners, create clean energy jobs, and reduce pollution statewide.”

New York Power Authority President and CEO Justin E. Driscoll said, “The Power Authority is advancing the largest portfolio of utility-scale, clean energy generation in decades, and the Sustainable Future Program will help us move viable projects to fruition. When we build projects, alone or in partnership, we must consider capital costs, long-term maintenance, fuels costs and financing. The Governor’s investment in renewable projects from the sustainability fund will enable us to be shovel-ready sooner on priority projects.”

New York State Homes and Community Renewal Commissioner RuthAnne Visnauskas said, “The critical investments being made through the Sustainable Future Program will deliver the best of both worlds – it will develop important pathways to long-term sustainability and will make New York more affordable for the residents and businesses here today. At HCR, we’re excited the $150 million allocated to create the Green Small Buildings Program will allow eligible homeowners and renters to benefit from new heating systems that improve efficiency and reduce energy costs. We thank Governor Hochul for her continued efforts to combat climate change by championing programs that will ensure a greener future for all of New York State.”

SUNY Chancellor John B. King Jr. said, “SUNY remains committed to helping Governor Hochul achieve the state’s climate goals, and thanks to her investment we will be able to transition the State University of New York at Buffalo, SUNY Purchase, and the State University of New York at Stony Brook to more efficient and sustainable energy sources. This funding will help SUNY meet its goal of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions and ensure students will have a brighter, more sustainable future.”

New York State AFL-CIO President Mario Cilento said, “We support Governor Hochul’s commitment to accelerating the State’s clean energy goals, a move that not only creates good-paying jobs and lowers energy costs but also significantly benefits hardworking New Yorkers. As we transition to a greener economy, we must invest in our workforce, particularly by ensuring that New York's clean energy and climate projects are built, operated, maintained, repaired, and manufactured by workers who earn good wages and enjoy the benefits and protections guaranteed by union contracts.”

New York State Building Trades President Gary LaBarbera said, “If New York is going to successfully establish a strong green economy that equips us to meet our climate and energy goals, we must ensure we are creating good paying union careers that will give more hardworking people the opportunity to pursue the middle class and reinvest in their communities. Investments like the Sustainable Future Fund, which embeds apprenticeship programs, project labor agreements, and prevailing wage requirements into projects at the core of the state's clean energy transition, are crucial to these efforts. We applaud Governor Hochul for continuing to push forward these initiatives that bolster our sustainable future and improve the lives of countless New Yorkers, including our tradesmen and tradeswomen.”

New York Director for the Building Decarbonization Coalition Lisa Dix said, “Governor Hochul is showing how states can lead by example. New York’s $1 billion Sustainable Future Program is a critical step toward a healthier and more equitable future, lowering energy costs for families and creating thousands of good jobs. The Building Decarbonization Coalition strongly supports funding for Thermal Energy Networks, weatherization, heat pumps, and the EmPower+ program, which will cut emissions and expand access to clean energy. We look forward to continued collaboration with Governor Hochul to advance these critical programs,”

Climate Jobs NY Executive Director Esther Rosario said, “Governor Hochul’s Sustainable Future Program is a transformative investment in New York’s clean energy future. These resources will cut emissions, create good union jobs, and lower energy costs for families. From Thermal Energy Networks to expanded NYPA renewable energy funding and support for EmPower+, these investments move us closer to a healthier, more affordable, and more resilient New York. We thank Governor Hochul for her leadership at a time when clean energy investments are under attack, and for advancing a bold vision for our state’s future.”

New York League of Conservation Voters Julie Tighe said, “While the federal government retreats from its commitments, New York is stepping up by investing in clean air, good-paying jobs, and healthier communities. From heat pumps in our homes to clean rides for kids, from boosting renewables and funding cutting edge thermal energy networks, the Sustainable Future Fund delivers real, bold action for New Yorkers. We applaud Governor Hochul for showing the country what strong state leadership looks like.”

Evergreen Action Vice President for States Justin Balik said, “In the face of federal retrenchment, it’s clear that we’ll be looking to states for leadership on solving our most pressing challenges. These investments will lower costs and cut pollution, delivering tangible and meaningful benefits to New Yorkers across the state. This move by Governor Hochul sets a strong foundation to build on going forward.”

Trucking Association of New York President Kendra Hems said, “The trucking industry is fully committed to sustainability. From adopting low sulfur diesel, to meeting and exceeding EPA emission standards, to investing in cleaner fuels like CNG and renewable diesel, our industry has consistently championed initiatives that reduce emissions and improve air quality. Incorporating electric trucks in the applications where they make the most sense is an important step forward. But to make electrification successful, we need our government partners to invest in the infrastructure that will support it. That’s why we applaud today’s announcement allocating dedicated funding for medium- and heavy-duty truck charging in New York State. This investment represents a critical milestone toward building a cleaner, more efficient freight system while ensuring the reliability our economy depends on.”

Assemblymember Didi Barrett said “When we established the Sustainable Futures Fund in the budget, it was with a recognition that New York State must provide the resources necessary to help people, communities, schools and not for profits across the state lower their carbon footprint. I am pleased that the Sustainable Futures Fund will include support for the essential EmPower+ Program, which has helped thousands of New Yorkers decarbonize their homes, as well as critical funding to decarbonize our schools, expand thermal energy networks, and accelerate renewable energy projects.”",https://www.governor.ny.gov/sites/default/files/styles/cover_image_660x400_/public/2025-09/climate1.jpg?h=b5f6a62e&itok=-419pJiB,N,,2025-09-24 11:02:49.511988

This year’s summit arrives on the heels of the third-hottest summer ever recorded in the northern hemisphere (surpassed only by 2023 and 2024) and a season defined by extreme weather disasters that made the climate crisis impossible to ignore.

The Palisades Fire tore through Los Angeles, leveling homes in affluent communities where the impacts of climate change had typically felt more abstract and remote. More people died from wildfire smoke in the US last year than from car crashes. Across the country, unprecedented flooding devastated towns from Asheville, North Carolina, where entire communities lost their homes and businesses, to Camp Mystic in Hunt, Texas, where 20 young campers and seven adults tragically perished.

Despite mounting human suffering and the nation’s top scientists sounding the alarm on the health impacts of climate change with new studies, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Administrator Lee Zeldin, is now moving to dismantle the very foundation of U.S. climate policy. He proposes eliminating the EPA’s Endangerment Finding — a cornerstone ruling that recognizes greenhouse gases as a threat to public health and gives the agency the authority to limit pollution from vehicles and power plants. Zeldin’s move flies in the face of science, law, and basic morality

United in Action

This is why EARTHDAY.ORG joined with the Climate Action Campaign (CAC), and dozens of allied organizations to deliver over 225,000 public comments to the EPA, in person, urging them to uphold the Endangerment Finding. On September 17, we gathered at the U.S. Capitol for a press conference that underscored just how high the stakes are.

In a room filled with journalists and climate advocates, eight members of Congress—from Maine to Texas—spoke candidly about how climate change is already harming Americans of every background, through rising seas, collapsing fisheries, emerging diseases, and worsening wildfires.

Senator Ed Markey, of Massachusetts, warned that repealing the Endangerment Finding would eliminate regulations that “will kill jobs, cause families to shell out more for gasoline, and hurt our kids with asthma attacks.”

Representative Chellie Pingree, of Maine, spoke to the collapse of her state’s fishing economy and the spread of climate-driven diseases: “It impacts our lives every single day. It’s impacting our economy and our livelihood.”

Rejecting the influence of corporate profiteers, Senator Alex Padilla, of California, reaffirmed his commitment to constituents: “We refuse to allow corporations to speak louder than our kids and our neighbors. We’re seeing industry profits rise while communities burn down. And we’ll keep speaking out. We’ll keep standing up to what we know is wrong, because too many lives and future generations depend on it.“

The most powerful testimony, however, came from children. One girl declared, “Kids want the EPA to protect our health and future. Our generation is expected to live through three times as many climate disasters as our grandparents, and we’re already living through them.”

An impassioned boy pleaded, “To every adult listening today who cares about children now and our lives in the future, we are asking you to please protect the Endangerment Finding and our future.” Their words were a reminder that climate change is not an abstract threat. It is impacting the lives of real people, in real time.

Delivering Public Outcry

After the press conference, we carried box after box of public comments to the EPA headquarters. Though the agency has recently weakened many avenues for public input, we refuse to let these voices go unheard, even if we have to deliver their comments by hand.

As we set the boxes down in the EPA’s lobby, recently adorned with an austere presidential portrait, it was a good moment to reflect on everything we had heard at the Capitol from both seasoned elected leaders and young activists alike. Every person who spoke did so because they or their communities had already suffered loss because of climate change. Their message was clear: denying the causes, reality and dangers of climate change is not just a policy failure, it is an act of harm that results in destroyed homes, lost livelihoods, and shattered futures. If the Endangerment Finding is repealed, lives will be lost.

All of this unfolds on the eve of Climate Week NYC, beginning September 21. These global summits have often been criticized as inaccessible and toothless, more about speeches than solutions. But with the Endangerment Finding under direct attack, it is no longer enough for leaders to merely acknowledge the climate crisis.

The EPA is doing everything it can to deny the terrible costs of climate change, and we need the participants of Climate Week to help set the record straight. They must speak up and act, and they must do so with the same urgency that millions of families already feel in their lungs, their wallets, and their communities.",https://www.earthday.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/240224_uscapitol-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 11:04:14.928467

After the OBBB was signed into law, Isshu Kikuma, energy storage analyst at BloombergNEF (BNEF), while speaking with ESN, provided some insight into why energy storage may have retained the Investment Tax Credit (ITC).
Fermi America is looking to build out energy storage, solar, natural gas, and nuclear power at a private grid in Amarillo, Texas.
However, as Starrs and Reams noted during the RE+ panel, focusing solely on the reliability of renewables, without being completely swayed by the administration’s whims, could be a viable approach.","Further actions by the US president include declaring a national energy emergency, vowing to fill the country’s strategic oil reserves, and reinforcing his promise to “drill, baby, drill”. He intends to boost fossil fuel production in Alaska and export natural gas.

Significant changes have also occurred at the Department of Energy’s (DOE) Loan Programs Office (LPO). Under the Biden administration, Jigar Shah headed the LPO, which regularly announced loans and investments for a wide array of renewable energy projects.

Recent activity from the LPO has focused on restarting the Palisades Nuclear Plant in Michigan.

On 16 September, the office announced the release of a sixth loan to support the plant’s restart, disbursing around US$156 million of the up to US$1.52 billion loan guarantee. To date, this total is still less than half of the guarantee, with US$491 million disbursed.

The shifts in policy have come with shifts in messaging, with the administration often citing threats to national security from “foreign controlled energy sources,” and in turn, creating a “National Energy Dominance Council”.

Isaiah Menning, External Affairs Director at American Conservation Coalition, highlighted, “The animating force (for Conservatives) right now is what serves the American interest. Everyone knows that America First is what President Trump is going for.”

Menning also stated that the party’s main objections to renewables are reliability and dependence on foreign countries.

Heather Reams, President and CEO of Citizens for Responsible Energy Solutions (CRES), said the way to address these concerns is to focus on lowering energy costs and highlighting American innovation.

“That is really going to be compelling for Republican members of Congress: It’s solutions-oriented, we’re innovating, we’re shoring up supply chains, we’re ensuring there’s a healthy balance, and we’re driving costs down.”

Tom Starrs, Vice President for government and public affairs at EDP Renewables, shared how EDP is changing its tactics in an attempt to appeal to “rural” communities.

Starrs said the company realised “we can’t have a developer, a guy with, you know, long hair and an earring walking into a hearing room in a rural community in the Midwest, and expecting him to have any credibility.”

“We decided a couple of years ago to hire someone from that local community for every project we have advancing through the development cycle.”

“The perfect examples are a family man, or the guy who runs the local chamber, or the owner of a local diner where all the old white guys go for morning coffee and chat. It doesn’t really matter who it is, as long as they have credibility within the community.”

The panel members then addressed a question from the audience about how to counter misinformation about renewables.

This is a topic that Kevin Smith, CEO of Arevon Energy, recently spoke to ESN Premium about, saying: “Our philosophy is to engage early and often with town officials, fire departments, and the local community. Some developers try to proceed quietly, hoping not to attract attention, but this approach can lead to misinformation spreading in the community. We prefer to be upfront.”

Starrs emphasised that these conversations come down to highlighting the economic advantages of BESS, solar, and other renewables. He said, “We have to fight, we have to combat this information with actual good information.”

Reams pointed out the support that Republicans currently have for these projects, using a recent study from CRES as an example.

“Our organisation just put out a poll, which found that solar enjoys 80 to 90% of support from Republicans, so nothing’s changed with voters.”

A change to renewables’ messaging

A point emphasised throughout the panel was how to frame solar, particularly as a technology that serves “American interests” and “American energy dominance.”

This messaging has been proving successful for energy storage.

After the OBBB was signed into law, Isshu Kikuma, energy storage analyst at BloombergNEF (BNEF), while speaking with ESN, provided some insight into why energy storage may have retained the Investment Tax Credit (ITC).

“I think that’s because the current administration focuses on reliability quite a lot. Right now, they don’t talk much about decarbonisation or the energy transition, but I think they do care about reliability. To maintain reliability, dispatchable power sources, or power sources with flexibility, are definitely key for the power grid. I think that’s why they’re keeping the support for energy storage, as well as other technologies like geothermal and nuclear.”

Peak Energy president and CCO, Cameron Dales, spoke with ESN about the state of the US battery storage industry after the signing of the Budget Reconciliation Act into law. This conversation also gave insight into the changes in the positioning of BESS technology.

Dales said, “In the end, from a national security perspective, it’s one of a handful of really critical technologies that there’s a bipartisan consensus that we need to control our own destiny, and the ability to store energy is one of the critical needs in the economy.”

Recently, some of this messaging has been taken a step further, such as with Fermi America, co-founded by former US Energy Secretary Rick Perry. Fermi America is looking to build out energy storage, solar, natural gas, and nuclear power at a private grid in Amarillo, Texas.

When announcing this project, Fermi highlighted comments from US Congressman Ronny Jackson, stating, “This strategic investment and key innovative partnership between Fermi America and the Texas Tech University System is expected to establish the world’s largest energy-driven data centre, placing America firmly at the forefront of the global AI race against the Chinese Communist Party.”

It is undoubtedly vital to develop a secure supply chain for BESS, solar, wind and other renewables in the US and to stimulate American manufacturing, creating jobs and meeting our growing energy demands.

However, as Starrs and Reams noted during the RE+ panel, focusing solely on the reliability of renewables, without being completely swayed by the administration’s whims, could be a viable approach.

Starrs and Reams noted that no action has been taken to build out transmission infrastructure for data centres, leaving the grid vulnerable in the near future.

Reams said, “I think that we need to hold the administration and other federal policy committees accountable for the lack of investment in transmission infrastructure and other regulations.”

Starrs continued, “Republicans are already blaming us for the overnight price hikes in cities, and they have a history of criticising us in the clean energy sector, attacking the Democratic party for major grid outages during thunderstorms. So, I think we need to be more effective in both defence and offence in our advocacy strategy.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/Screenshot-2025-02-03-102535.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 12:05:35.310698

New Energy Risk (“NER”), a specialist in technology performance insurance with more than a decade of experience underwriting complex technology projects, today announced its first tax credit insurance transaction.

In partnership with the Tax Insurance brokerage group at Alliant Insurance Services (“Alliant”), NER has bound its first tax credit insurance policy in support of a utility-scale solar project in Texas. The facility will provide clean electricity capacity to support a large data center, part of a growing number of renewable energy projects designed to meet the burgeoning power needs of U.S. data centers while aligning with corporate clean-energy directives.

“We are extremely pleased to announce our first participation in a tax credit insurance transaction. This success reflects months of dedicated effort and a logical extension of NER’s capabilities in supporting the clean energy industry,” said George Schulz, CEO of NER. “We appreciate Alliant for their leadership on this transaction and our insurance partners for their continued support of NER’s work to deliver innovative, large-scale performance insurance solutions for breakthrough technologies.”

“Alliant is pleased to welcome NER into the tax insurance market and extends our sincere appreciation for the valuable support they provided to both our firm and our client,” said Dan Schoenberg, Executive Vice President of Alliant Mergers & Acquisitions. “We look forward to strengthening our collaboration with NER and their insurance partners in the years ahead.”

With this transaction, NER plans to deliver much-needed capacity to the tax credit insurance market by combining its tax and technology underwriting expertise to offer comprehensive insurance solutions that address the technology-related risk elements of tax credit transactions, particularly those involving Section 45 and Section 48 credits.

Tax credits have long been a cornerstone of clean energy development. The Inflation Reduction Act of 2022 enhanced their role by enabling transferability of credits and significantly expanding the pool of capital for renewable energy projects – creating greater demand for insurance to support these transactions. In 2025, the One Big Beautiful Bill Act introduced sweeping changes but ultimately preserved tax credits as a mechanism for financing critical infrastructure, albeit with shorter timelines for certain renewable energy projects.

“With the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, as well as subsequent IRS guidance, administrative uncertainty surrounding the transition tax credit landscape has eased. In the coming years, tax credits will remain available to finance a wide range of clean energy solutions, including emerging technologies,” said Kevin Broich, Executive Underwriter for Tax at NER. “NER is building a platform to support the rapidly expanding demand for insurance and the need to demonstrate and scale innovative technology solutions.”

This transaction extends NER’s role as a trusted partner to clean energy developers and financiers, demonstrating the company’s ability to combine technology performance expertise with innovative risk-transfer solutions. By applying its underwriting platform to the tax credit market, NER is furthering its mission to enable investment in breakthrough technologies and accelerate the clean energy transition.

Climate change is real.
“Since taking office, Trump has politicised not only climate science but also other observable, empirical truths, notably in public health.
He does not in any way acknowledge the huge issue of climate change.
There were over 600 extreme weather events last year with over 150 being unprecedented, meaning they would not have occurred without human caused climate change – fact.","Climate scientists comment on comments made by President Trump about climate change at the UN conference.

Prof Corinne Le Quere FRS, Professor of Climate Change Science, University of East Anglia (UEA), said:

“Mr Trump is endangering the lives and wellbeing of Americans and people around the world by wrongly denying the realities of climate change. We should be working together to protect people and businesses by limiting climate change as much as possible and adapting to reduce its widespread impacts.”

Prof Kevin Anderson, Professor of Energy and Climate Change at the Tyndall Centre, said:

“The President’s views on climate change should be afforded the same weight as his now-infamous advice to Americans to inject disinfectant as a cure for Covid. In both cases, the suggestion is detached from science, detached from reality, and dangerous if taken seriously. The only real difference is that while the disinfectant comment was quickly mocked and discarded, his climate pronouncements continue to be repeated as if they carry credibility. They don’t.”

Prof Chris Rapley, Department of Earth Sciences, University College London, said:

“Should we be surprised? History and human psychology say no. The question is, does it matter? To which the answer is unfortunately “Yes” – but perhaps not as much as we may fear. Presidents and their entourage come and go. But the economics of energy production are ineluctable. And the climate system is indifferent”.

Dr Matthew Jones, Senior Research Associate in the School of Environmental Sciences, University of East Anglia (UEA), said:

“Trump’s pathetic culture war against all forms of science does nothing to help humanity secure a safe and liveable planet for future generations.”

Dr Karsten Haustein, Climate Scientist, Leipzig University, said:

“Just another stunt pulled from the authoritarian playbook. Distorting the truth so that people lose their sense of reality entirely. Extremely dangerous mass manipulation and demagoguery. Three simple facts: The Earth is round. Climate change is real. Trump and his cronies are a scam. It needs to be said over and over again.”

Dr Injy Johnstone, Research Associate in Net Zero Aligned Offsetting at the University of Oxford, said:

“Trump is correct in one thing: climate change is a scam in the sense that it is the result of listening to con men who have let it get out of hand for so long for their own benefit at the expense of slowing down solutions that are good for people, planet and profit.”

Dr Anupama Sen, Head of Policy Engagement at the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment, University of Oxford, said:

“We stand at a critical moment in history where countries and citizens can make a choice between placing our trust in science and reason – which have underpinned centuries of human progress, including in medicine, technology and more recently in AI – or fall prey to rhetoric, misinformation and division. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that climate change is already happening, does not bow to political cycles, and rewards economies and countries which choose to believe in science, with record investments in green energy, better living standards, and eventually, better energy security.”

Dr Chloe Brimicombe, Climate scientist and public engagement manager, Royal Meteorological Society (RMetS), said:

“Controversially Trump is not wrong that scientists did think 100 years ago that the climate was cooling. Does this mean climate change is a con? No, but if you think about it, it’s difficult to visualise so I guess it is our job to meet someone at what they understand and this is where modelling has it’s real limits. So, here are the facts. Extreme weather is increasingly costing countries money and lives and investing in sustainable energy and technology and helping communities against weather impacts within one’s own country, supports national jobs and makes good business sense and really for a leader I can see why that’d matter.”

Alexis McGivern, Head of Stakeholder Engagement, Oxford Net Zero, said:

“Trump’s comments are deliberately inflammatory, part of a broader and sustained attack on independent experts and the observable realities of science.

“Make no mistake: Trump and his advisors know that climate change is not a hoax. Undermining confidence in experts is simply politically expedient, serving to consolidate power of their increasingly authoritarian regime.

“But this is not simply a rejection of science, or the headline-splash of calling climate experts “stupid people”. The deeper question is who is benefitting (especially financially) from denying evidence while advancing policies like “drill, baby, drill”. The latest Production Gap report shows, again, that the United States still plans to produce far more fossil fuels than is compatible with a 1.5°C world.

“Since taking office, Trump has politicised not only climate science but also other observable, empirical truths, notably in public health. In every case, the gains in money and power flow upward, while those least responsible for climate change remain the first and hardest hit.”

Prof Hannah Cloke, Professor of Hydrology, University of Reading, said:

“My jaw just hit the floor. Donald Trump can predict what he likes, and believe what he likes, but his rhetoric cannot change the laws of physics. The “stupid people” have shown how human activity and fossil fuels are heating up our planet, with impacts on societies and ecosystems everywhere in the world.”

Prof Eric Wolff, Chair of the Royal Society’s Biodiversity, Environment and Climate Committee, said:

“Climate change is real – the burning of fossil fuels and other human activities is resulting in fundamental changes to our planet. It is increasing the risk of extreme weather, warming the ocean and causing ice caps to melt resulting in sea level rise, and threatening ecosystems, lives and livelihoods across the world.

“That is the conclusion of rigorously tested and reviewed scientific evidence, built up over decades. To suggest it is a ‘con job’ is flying in the face both of what we can observe, and of physics.”

Prof Pierre Friedlingstein FRS, Chair in Mathematical Modelling of Climate Systems, University of Exeter, said:

“To quote Upton Sinclair, it is difficult to get a man to understand something when his salary depends upon his not understanding it.”

Prof Keith Shine FRS, Regius Professor of Meteorology and Climate Science at the University of Reading, said:

“It’s a real tragedy that a US President can be so poorly informed on how climate is changing and why climate is changing.”

Prof Hayley Fowler, Director of the Centre of Climate and Environmental Resilience and Royal Society Faraday Discovery Fellow, Newcastle University, said:

“The fossil fuel industry and President Trump are perpetrating the biggest con job in the world: the denial of anthropogenic climate warming. The evidence is everywhere and overwhelming. Record shattering heatwaves, flood events and hurricanes are causing colossal economic damages that will continue to increase until we significantly reduce our greenhouse gas emissions. This is a scientific fact, one that has been suppressed by the fossil fuel industry for decades as they concentrate on profits.”

Prof Dann Mitchell, University of Bristol, and Lead of the UK Climate Change Risk Assessment (Health and Wellbeing), said:

“World leading scientific analysis shows that thousands of heat-related deaths will be avoidable during extreme heatwaves in major US cities, if we can keep global carbon emissions consistent with the Paris Agreement climate goals. For a president to show such disregard for the health of his own citizens is nothing short of reckless.”

Bob Ward, policy and communications director at the Grantham Research Institute on Climate Change and the Environment at the London School of Economics and Political Science, said:

“Donald Trump’s daft outburst about climate change at the United Nations is perfectly consistent with his other bogus beliefs, such as Tylenol causes autism, you can treat Covid by injecting disinfectant, and US tariffs are paid by exporters. All these myths will potentially cause harm to the American people if they believe them. He is truly the President that the Enlightenment left behind.”

Prof Mark Maslin, Pro-Vice Provost of the UCL Climate Crisis Grand Challenge, said:

“Much of what Trump said at the UN was factually incorrect, deeply misleading and simply wrong. He does not in any way acknowledge the huge issue of climate change. 2024 was the warmest year ever recorded – fact. There were over 600 extreme weather events last year with over 150 being unprecedented, meaning they would not have occurred without human caused climate change – fact. So here’s an analysis of what Trump said and why it is factually wrong.

“■ Trump: Green energy is expensive … Reality: Renewables have gotten cheaper. Renewable energy is often significantly cheaper than fossil fuels, with over 90% of new renewable projects now costing less than new fossil fuel alternatives, largely due to rapid price declines in solar and wind technologies since 2010. For instance, new solar projects can be around £41/MWh, compared to approximately £114/MWh for new gas power stations, making new renewables a much cheaper option for electricity generation. https://www.iea.org/news/rapid-rollout-of-clean-technologies-makes-energy-cheaper-not-more-costly

“■ Trump: Clean Beautiful Coal Reality: UN report says 8 million premature death due to air pollution but new figures are higher – closer to 10 M a year due to particulate matters from the burning of fossil fuels so there is no “clean” beautiful coal https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0013935121000487

“■ Trump: UN said in the year 2000 there is global warming and there will be catastrophic consequences – they were wrong so that’s why they change the term to climate change – i think a simple definition of the difference between the two terms will be good. Reality: US$2 trillion in economic losses from ~4,000 extreme weather events. In just the last two full years (2022–2023), damages were ~US$451 billion https://iccwbo.org/news-publications/policies-reports/new-report-extreme-weather-events-cost-economy-2-trillion-over-the-last-decade/https://www.theguardian.com/business/2024/nov/11/extreme-weather-cost-2tn-globally-over-past-decade-report-finds

“■ Trump suggested that green energy ‘scam’ is not helping the economy. Reality: Clean energy added ~USD 320 billion to the global economy in 2023. That was about 10% of global GDP growth in that year. https://www.iea.org/commentaries/clean-energy-is-boosting-economic-growth https://www.iea.org/commentaries/clean-energy-is-boosting-economic-growth About 3.5 million Americans already working in renewable energy and growth in clean energy employment is more than twice the rate of the overall U.S. labour market. Also projects that the global market for renewable energy technologies could be worth at least USD 23 trillion by 2030, which implies big opportunities https://www.energy.gov/eere/job-creation-and-economic-growth#:~:text=Funding%20energy%20innovations%20creates%20well,U.S.%20labor%20market%20in%202023.

Prof. Pete Smith FRS, Professor of Soils & Global Change at the University of Aberdeen, said:

“Trump has no knowledge of science and is not qualified to judge what is or is not robust science. His comments on climate change, like his pronouncements on vaccines and links between painkillers and autism, are arrogant and ignorant in equal measure.”

Prof Martin Siegert, Professor of Geosciences and Deputy VC, University of Exeter, said:

“The greatest con-job is not the rock-solid decades-old fully-tested science that proves fossil-fuel burning causes global heating, dirty air and nature loss, but rather the illogical ignorant antiscientific denial of it.”

Prof Joeri Rogelj, Director of Research, Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, said:

“Dismissing climate change is as grotesque as it is wrong. Refusing to believe in thermometers will not make the warming go away. The evidence — measured, observed and understood — is clear: human activities are heating the planet, and ignoring that reality only leaves societies more exposed and less prepared.”

Prof David Viner, IPCC author and expert reviewer, said:

“Trump has just awarded all climate scientists their greatest badge of honour, fantastic. This superbly ignorant statement of Trump endorses all of the work of the climate science and wider scientific community.”

Prof Richard Allan, Professor of Climate Science, University of Reading, said:

“Although Trump thinks he’s really good at predicting things, evidence is needed to back up these empty claims and the science has been clear for a very long time that the climate is warming up, it is primarily caused by burning fossil fuels and without massively building upon the ongoing collaborative and innovative action to curb greenhouse gas emissions the world will be a much more dangerous and unpleasant place to live in.”

Prof Ed Hawkins, National Centre for Atmospheric Science, University of Reading, said:

“We have known since the 1930s that burning fossil fuels is warming the climate. We are already seeing the consequences with rising sea levels, hotter heatwaves and heavier rainfall. The risks increase with every bit of further warming and the world will regret not acting faster to reduce carbon emissions.”

Prof Bill McGuire, Professor Emeritus of Geophysical & Climate Hazards at UCL, and author of Hothouse Earth: an Inhabitant’s Guide, said:

“The greatest con job perpetrated in the world isn’t climate change, it is Trump. The staggering ignorance he displays of the science isn’t a surprise, as it mirrors a comparable lack of understanding of many of the critical issues of our time.

“The truth is that climate breakdown, driven by global heating caused by human activities, is unequivocal. Not only this, but the temperature of our world has never climbed this rapidly across the entire geological record. We are heading for climate catastrophe, and the United States is set to be one of the hardest hit countries. In the decades to come, its people will rue the anti-climate actions of this rogue president”.

Prof Bill Collins, Professor of Climate Processes, University of Reading, said:

“The science of climate change has given us useful predictions that have been found to have be extremely farsighted. Predictions from 50 years ago of the level of global warming seen today have been uncannily accurate in forecasting the 1 degree rise over that period. This is in complete contrast to anecdotes of ice ages.”

Prof. Andrew Turner, Lead Author of the IPCC 6th Assessment Report and Programme Lead for Climate & Global Change at the National Centre for Atmospheric Science, said:

“The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has been assessing the science related to climate change over six assessment cycles (now entering its 7th), producing six comprehensive reports authored by the world’s leading scientists. As in all IPCC reports, 6th Assessment Report (released in 2021) has its headline outcomes (known as the Summary for Policymakers) agreed meticulously by all contributing governments. This includes the USA.

“A key outcome is that worsening climate impacts, caused by humanity’s emissions of greenhouse gases, are now detectable all across the world. The impacts, including extreme rainfall, flooding and droughts, and sea-level rise, will continue to worsen with every additional fraction of a degree of global warming in the future.

“The IPCC is tasked with making an assessment that is not policy-relevant, but not policy-prescriptive. As such, unless we urgently reach net-zero emissions, climate impacts will cause worsening economic damage and deaths, with a cost that exceeds taking action now.

“President Trump may not like the message, but fortunately good science does not rely on beliefs or ideologies, and that message will not disappear however much politicians continue to look the other way, with fingers in their ears.”

Dr Chris Huntingford of the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology, said:

“All those involved in climate change research begin with the premise that climate is not changing, the so-called “null hypothesis”. Only after rigorous data analysis and conducting extremely careful physics-led simulations do we consider the “alternative hypothesis” that change is occurring. Unfortunately, as hard as we try to prove otherwise, almost every data stream aligns with calculations indicating the alternative hypothesis: the world is warming in response to greenhouse gas emissions.”

Prof John Marsham, Professor of Atmospheric Science, University of Leeds, said:

“Even the fossil-fuel industry’s own reports from as far back as the 1980s show the reality of man-made climate change, with one report warning “Civilisation could prove a fragile thing”. Nevertheless, the industry has long sought to delay climate action and of course funds the Republican party. If under Trump the USA doesn’t invest in renewables, it doesn’t just delay the action we need – it allows other countries to get ahead and profit from the renewables revolution that is providing cheap secure energy, and jobs, but is an existential threat to profits from fossil fuels.”

Now, they’ve got a big new tool kit to pull from.

Last week, the interagency nonprofit Northeast States for Coordinated Air Use Management, or NESCAUM, released an 80-page action plan laying out key strategies to turbocharge heat-pump deployment. Individual states are already putting many of these tactics to the test.

California, Colorado, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Rhode Island, and the District of Columbia together committed to ambitious heat-pump adoption goals last year. Washington state joined the pact last week. Their targets: By 2030, heat pumps will make up 65% of the sales of residential heating, air conditioning, and water heating equipment. By 2040, that percentage is to climb to 90%.

The goals are essential for addressing climate change. Buildings are directly responsible for 13% of U.S. carbon emissions, in part due to the fossil fuels burned on-site to heat indoor air and water. All-electric heat pumps can do those jobs running on clean power.

The NESCAUM action plan comes as the Trump administration clings tenaciously to fossil fuels. In recent months, the federal government has rolled back energy-efficiency standards for appliances, imposed chaotic tariffs that are raising costs for consumers, and put an early expiration date on the $2,000 federal tax credit that helps homeowners afford heat pumps.

Despite these headwinds, the report shows that ​“states are still finding creative ways to move forward,” said Emily Levin, policy and program director for NESCAUM.

HVAC heat pumps are routinely two to four times as efficient as gas furnaces, capable of heating and cooling interiors using the same physics that refrigerators employ to chill your cucumbers. Heat-pump water heaters work the same way and are three to five times as efficient as gas water heaters. By eschewing fossil fuels, these technologies improve air quality and typically save people money over the long term, even if, on average, they cost significantly more up-front than conventional heating systems. (At least one startup, though, is trying to change that.)

Heat pumps are slowly catching on. In the U.S., the units outsold gas furnaces by their biggest-ever margin last year, but their share of the market is still modest. Citing data from the Air-Conditioning, Heating, and Refrigeration Institute, a trade association, Levin said that in 2021, heat pumps accounted for about 25% of the combined shipments of gas furnaces, heat pumps, and air conditioners, the three largest reported HVAC categories. In 2024, they’d risen to about 32%.

“No matter how you look at it, there are still a lot of gas furnaces being sold, there are still a lot of one-way central air-conditioners being sold — all of which could really become heat pumps,” Levin said.

Produced in consultation with state agencies, environmental justice organizations, and technical and policy experts, the NESCAUM report lays out a diverse set of more than 50 strategies — both carrots and sticks — covering equity and workforce investments, obligations to reduce carbon, building standards, and utility regulation. A wide range of decision-makers, often in collaboration, can pull these levers — from utility regulators to governor’s offices, state legislatures, and energy, environment, labor, and economic development agencies. Here are six recommendations from the report that stand out.

Make heat pumps more accessible to lower-income and renter households. A number of barriers need to be overcome to make heat pumps available to these groups, who often struggle to afford the appliances or lack the autonomy to install them. For example, contractors can’t put heat pumps in homes with hazards like mold, lead, asbestos, and rotten beams, but the process to address these problems can itself cost tens of thousands of dollars. Philadelphia’s Built to Last program coordinates aid to carry out these necessary pre-electrification repairs. On the other side of the country, California is launching a program this fall to install heat pumps in qualifying low- and moderate-income homes — for free. Notably, owners of low-income multifamily buildings can also use the program to upgrade their tenants’ heating systems, but they must agree to keep rent from increasing more than 3% per year for up to 10 years after the project.

Set an all-electric standard for new buildings. States have the ability to establish the minimum health, safety, and energy standards that developers must adhere to. New York recently became the first state to require that most new buildings be electric only, making heat pumps the default heating appliances. The rules withstood a legal challenge in July and take effect on Dec. 31.

Use building performance standards to encourage heat pumps in existing structures. Such standards require building owners to meet specific annual limits on energy use or carbon emissions and bring them down over time, or face penalties. Several states and cities have already developed these rules. Maryland, for one, stipulates that owners of most edifices 35,000 square feet or greater must report their CO2 emissions starting this year, hit standards by 2030, and fully ditch fossil-fueled appliances by 2040.

Leverage emissions rules that improve air quality and protect public health. For example, in 2023, the San Francisco Bay Area air district, home to more than 7 million people, set landmark rules requiring that new residential water and space heaters don’t spew health-harming nitrogen oxides, starting in 2027 and 2029, respectively. Heat pumps fit the bill. Switching to the tech nationwide could avert more than 2,600 premature deaths annually, according to electrification advocacy nonprofit Rewiring America.

Push utilities to deliver clean heat.States can require utilities to slash emissions and electrify buildings. For example, in 2021, Colorado adopted a first-in-the-nation clean-heat law doing just that. Lawmakers also mandated that utilities file their implementation plans for approval. In 2024, regulators greenlit a $440 million proposal from Xcel Energy, the state’s largest utility, which included electrifying 200,000 homes with heat pumps by 2030. Maryland is developing a similar standard.

Reform electricity rates so that they incentivize zero-emissions heating. Households with heat pumps tend to use more electricity than other customers, which means they pay disproportionately for fixed costs to maintain the grid on their energy bills. Utilities can correct that imbalance with adjusted rates. For example, Massachusetts has required its three major electric utilities to offer discounted winter electricity rates to households with heat pumps. Elizabeth Mahony, commissioner of the state’s Department of Energy Resources, said she expects the new rates to save heat-pump owners on average $540 per year.

NESCAUM’s Levin stressed that the report is ​“a menu — not a recipe.” Each state will need to consider its own goals and constraints to pick the approaches that fit it best, she added.

Still, ​“I see [heat-pump electricity] rates as one of the areas that’s most promising,” Levin said. Massachusetts’ reforms ​“are really going to change their customer economics to make it more attractive to switch to a heat pump.”

When done right, rate design also avoids the need for states to find new funding. ​“You’re not raising costs on anybody, you’re only reducing costs,” Levin said. At a time when households are seeing energy prices rise faster than inflation, the tactic could have widespread political appeal, she noted.

NESCAUM plans to check back in with states and report out on their progress each year, Levin said. ​“The cool thing about our work is that we bring states together to learn from one another,” she added. ​“Part of making this transition happen more rapidly is lifting up the things that are really working well.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Heat-pumps-in-Hudson.jpeg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=6f532340c5f215b5a9dff71118c28685,N,,2025-09-24 12:04:22.543369

Oklo is one of the 10 advanced reactor firms chosen by the U.S. Department of Energy to be a part of its Reactor Pilot Program. The DOE pilot seeks to fast-track small modular reactor (SMR) development, pushing the projects to reach criticality by next July 4.

Aurora-INL is one of the three projects awarded to Oklo under the program, with two awarded directly to Oklo and one awarded to its subsidiary, Atomic Alchemy.

“Oklo Inc.'s Aurora powerhouse will deliver clean, affordable, and reliable American energy to power a new generation of intelligence manufacturing across the country,” said U.S. Secretary of the Interior, Doug Burgum, in a statement. “As advancements in artificial intelligence drive up electricity demands, projects like this are critical to ensuring the United States can meet that need and remain at the forefront of the global AI arms race.”

Kietwit Corp.’s Nuclear Solutions subsidiary is the lead design, procurement and construction contractor on the Aurora Powerhouse project at the KNL. The Aurora is a planned sodium-cooled fast reactor which will use metal fuel. Its design builds on the Experimental Breeder Reactor II site which was operated in Idaho for 30 years until 1994.

TIME magazine named Oklo's Aurora Powerhouse as one of its 100 Best Inventions of 2023.

Other SMR nuclear firms selected for the DOE pilot include Aalo Atomics, Antares Nuclear Inc., Atomic Alchemy Inc., Deep Fission Inc., Last Energy Inc., Natura Resources LLC, Radiant Industries Inc., Terrestrial Energy Inc., and Valar Atomics Inc.

Those selected firms are encouraged and empowered to seek private funding critical to research and development of next-generation reactor technologies.

TC Energy will focus on ramping up US investments to meet soaring power demand despite signals Canada is showing a more energy-friendly stance.

“The returns we can earn in the United States are significantly more attractive than they are in Canada,” Chief Executive Officer and President Francois Poirier said in an interview during the 2025 Concordia Annual Summit in New York. “I expect that the US will continue to be where we’ll invest.”

The pipeline company is seeking to tap into a push by US President Donald Trump, who recently signed executive orders aimed at boosting artificial intelligence development in the US by loosening regulations and expanding energy supplies for data centers, amid a broader desire for US energy dominance.

TC Energy recently announced plans to invest $8.5 billion into US energy infrastructure projects planned over the next five years. Poirier also pointed to Mexico as a priority for new investment.

Bottom lines up front

Roughly 42 percent of Africa’s population lacks reliable access to electricity at home.

Using Africa’s sizeable untapped gas reserves to help electrify the continent is reasonable and fair, despite the need to cut emissions.

Electrifying the rest of the continent at the lowest possible climate cost within the next decade calls for renewables in most cases, and new gas-fired power plants in countries with gas and low electrification rates.

Limited access to electricity has long constrained both quality of life and economic growth across much of Africa. About 42 percent of the continent’s population still lives in homes without any access to national grids, mini-grids, or even standalone renewable systems. With 19 percent of the world’s population, Africa accounts for just 3.1 percent of global electricity demand. Indeed, the majority of people without access to electricity live in sub-Saharan Africa. This depresses living standards and stymies commercial and industrial development across the continent.

Average annual electricity consumption in Africa (excluding South Africa) was just 180 kilowatt-hours (kWh) in 2021, compared with 6,500 kWh in Europe and 13,000 kWh in the United States. Most people in sub-Saharan Africa consume less electricity in a year than an average US fridge. Power supplies in the region are not only inadequate, they are often unreliable, with outages a feature of life from Nigeria to South Africa. Sub-Saharan Africa also has the lowest per capita gas consumption of any region, at less than one-quarter of the global average, and accounts for just 4 percent of global gas demand.

According to the United Nations’ Sustainable Development Goal 7, UN member states committed to achieving “access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all” by 2030. This target will not be reached by that date as the current pace of progress is nowhere near fast enough to connect 600 million African people in the next five years. Still, a growing number of African governments are pushing for universal access to electricity for their countries, and helping them succeed should be a global priority.

It is critical to tackle this challenge now while electrification efforts are being stepped up and over half the African population has access to electricity at home for the first time. Moreover, a significant increase in power generation will be needed to achieve universal electrification at a time of massive demographic growth. The United Nations forecasts that the population of sub-Saharan Africa will grow from 1.3 billion at present to 2.2 billion by 2054 and 3.3 billion by 2100. Power demand will expand even further with the adoption of electric vehicles and construction of new data centers.

It is technically possible to rapidly increase African electrification rates through renewables backed up with battery energy storage systems (BESS), hydroelectric schemes, and geothermal power (where available). Yet change on such a scale would require massive global investment that is not a realistic prospect in the foreseeable future, particularly given the recent drastic cuts to international aid budgets by some western governments.

Africa’s untapped and associated gas reserves can provide part of the solution by supporting renewable energy in boosting electrification rates. Although gas-fired generation is typically more expensive than solar, it delivers the baseload, round-the-clock capacity needed to fuel a rapid increase in intermittent renewable energy production. What’s more, there is a substantial amount of gas expertise in Africa, as gas is the continent’s primary source of electricity, accounting for 43 percent of production in 2024.

In response to the climate crisis, fossil fuel output will taper down, but some production will continue for many years. Emissions from gas-fired plants are at least half as high as those from coal, making gas a driver of climate change. Yet the African continent accounts for such a small proportion of global per capita emissions that new gas projects on the continent would be fair and justified where they would have a demonstrable impact on living standards and where failing to develop them would act as a brake on electrification efforts. Moreover, as this report will demonstrate, gas appears to be either a necessary or commercially viable option only in specific African countries.

Gas-to-power projects carry high upfront investment costs but are often easier to finance when attached to big export projects. The United States and Qatar, in particular, are investing heavily in new liquefied natural gas (LNG) production capacity to satisfy global demand, but European gas markets are keen to secure new sources of supply to displace piped Russian gas, and many Asian countries are switching from coal to gas-fired generation. As a result, there is scope for both new African LNG plants and pipelines under the Mediterranean Sea that could support power production in much of West Africa, while also generating export revenues for Nigeria.

Securing financing for African gas projects will be a crucial challenge, especially in light of the high capital costs for operating projects on the continent and investors’ reluctance to fund hydrocarbon schemes in recent years. However, the new African Energy Bank and the Trump administration’s support for oil and gas investment could make a considerable difference. US Secretary of Energy Chris Wright said in March that the United States would partner with African governments and companies to support the development of projects using natural gas and other energy technologies, including by providing capital. Indeed, the Trump administration acted quickly to approve $4.7 billion in funding from US Export-Import Bank for TotalEnergies’ Mozambique LNG scheme.

This report will set out why it is reasonable for Africa to develop its own gas reserves to drive electrification, explain how gas can fit into a broader energy transition on the continent, examine which countries would benefit from developing gas projects, and discuss the relationship between gas exports and local consumption. It will conclude with recommendations for how all stakeholders can utilize the continent’s natural gas resources to promote electrification at the lowest possible climate cost.

What role should natural gas play in Africa’s energy transition?

Most African countries account for a tiny proportion of global emissions but desperately need improved power supplies

Developing new gas-fired power plants in Africa to boost living standards and promote industrial growth would help the continent achieve a just energy transition. While effort should be made to rein in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions in Africa as elsewhere, the energy transition burden of each country should be based on its absolute per capita emissions rather than year-on-year changes in its emissions. The world’s poorest countries, including most African states, have played a very small role in driving climate change, and Africa is responsible for just 3.7 percent of carbon emissions from burning fossil fuels—a far lower per capita share than any other region. Per capita carbon emissions in 2021 stood at 1.04 metric tons/year in Africa, four times less than the global average of 4.69 metric tons/year and far lower than the US average of 14 metric tons/year.

New African gas-fired power projects should be developed where they can help speed up much-needed electrification, particularly as new fossil fuel projects continue to be developed elsewhere. The United States plans to ramp up domestic oil production, while China began construction of 94.5 gigawatts (GW) of new coal-fired power plants last year. By contrast, South Africa—which has the biggest installed generating capacity on the continent—has a total generation capacity of just 63.4 gigawatts.

In the United States, after years of negligible new gas-fired capacity, developers are building a string of gas plants, leaving some to wait up to seven years for delivery of gas turbines. A single Texas power company, NRG Energy, said on May 12 that it plans to acquire 13 GW of gas-fired generation capacity —seven times the total generating capacity of Uganda.

It was anticipated that a series of planned terminals would boost US liquefied natural gas (LNG) export capacity from 90 million metric tons per annum (mtpa) to 200 mtpa even before President Trump lifted the ban on new projects. New gas-fired plants are also being developed in Europe, with 20 GW of new capacity planned in Germany by 2030. It is therefore difficult to expect African countries to refrain from developing projects when the big polluters are failing to do so.

Asking low-emitting, energy-poor countries to forgo gas development while wealthier countries continue to expand their production capacity is hypocritical. According to the World Economic Forum in 2020, tripling African power production using gas-fired plants would only add 1 percent to global emissions.

Per capita emissions in most African countries are “lower than what is compatible with a 1.5C degree world, so even if they grow substantially, the continent would not exceed its fair share of emissions,” wrote a leading researcher on the need to assess Africa’s energy transition strategies on a country-by-country basis.

It is possible to integrate more natural gas within a broadly low emissions power sector

It is difficult to overstate the energy poverty of most of sub-Saharan Africa. With some notable exceptions, particularly in South Africa and North Africa, most of the continent has constrained access to reliable power supplies. It is easy to argue that this energy poverty should be overcome by focusing entirely on clean energy. The continent could leapfrog gas use and expensive gas infrastructure, in favor of moving straight to green technologies, in the same way that it has in large part bypassed landline technology in favor of mobile telecommunications. Solar should certainly be the centerpiece of power strategies in most African countries, considering the continent represents 60 percent of the world’s solar potential, and yet it produced just 4 percent of all solar power in 2024.

Africa also has attractive wind resources, although in more limited areas that include South Africa, Morocco, and Egypt. Geothermal energy is another very attractive contribution to any generation mix: It is a renewable source of energy that provides baseload energy because it is “always on.” However, it is available in only a few African countries, mainly along the line of the Great Rift Valley and most notably in Kenya.

BESS can store solar energy and then release it into grids for two to four hours to cover evening peak demand. Long duration energy storage (LDES) projects hold the promise of stabilizing longer-term fluctuations in intermittent power production.

Immediate and substantial investment is needed in these technologies, but they alone cannot achieve 100 percent electrification in many African countries in the near future. Solar power, for instance, may be cheaper than gas-fired capacity per unit of energy and will become even cheaper over time, but it does not produce power outside of daylight hours.

The BESS sector is at an early stage of development in Africa, as costs remain high and expertise low. As for LDES, the only commercially viable technology today is pumped storage hydro, which involves moving water between two reservoirs at different levels: The water is released downhill to drive turbines to generate electricity when it is most needed and then pumped back uphill during lower-cost periods when other technologies are productive. Pumped hydro storage helps to balance grids but is a net consumer of electricity and is technically feasible in only specific geographical areas.

A comprehensive rollout of BESS and LDES should make 100 percent clean energy in Africa possible one day, but most African countries will need a greater baseload power capacity to balance out intermittent sources of power production for a long time to come. Consequently, in the interim, they must be allowed to develop gas-fired generation capacity.

Key power sector terms:

Baseload technologies operate 24/7 except when they are undergoing maintenance. These include oil, coal, and gas-fired projects, geothermal power plants, and hydroelectric schemes, although output falls during periods of prolonged drought.

Intermittent technologies produce variable amounts of power: Solar power plants produce electricity only during the day and wind farms when the wind blows.

Battery energy storage systems (BESS) store surplus power, usually from solar projects during the daytime, to release it into the grid when needed, often in the evening.

Back-up power projects help maintain supplies when other forms of generation are lacking. These can include BESS, small-scale diesel generators, and even some gas-fired technologies that can be used only when required. However, building an expensive gas-fired plant for occasional use only is not commercially attractive without additional system payments. These payments are allocated to generators to reward them for being available to support the grid, in addition to each kilowatthour of actual electricity they produce, particularly during periods of peak demand.

More gas can complement the rollout of low emissions technologies. Developing new gas-to-power projects alongside renewables could help drive access to electricity in many African countries over the next decade. The renewables sector has taken off in a small number of African countries, led by South Africa, Egypt, and Morocco, with large projects currently in development elsewhere on the continent. Yet gas and renewables should not be viewed as an either-or choice: gas-fired projects can be paired with renewable energy and large hydro to provide grids with reliable power where renewable energy penetration is increasing.

Gas-fired plants could be used as back-up for solar and wind power, but this secondary role risks making construction commercially unviable in most markets. Financing is only likely to be secured for gas projects that provide baseload capacity; still, these plants could be downgraded to back-up in the longer term.

Replacing back-up diesel generators with gas-fired capacity offers the added benefit of reducing GHG emissions. At present, millions of African homes and businesses rely on diesel generators to provide electricity when their national grids fail to meet demand. These generators produce 74.14 kilograms of CO2 per million British thermal units (Btu) compared to 52.91 kilograms for gas-fired capacity.

Fossil fuel power plants, whether gas, coal, or oil-fired, currently provide 75 percent of all electricity in Africa, with 25 percent coming from clean energy (7 percent from solar and wind and most of the remainder from hydro). And yet, 54 percent of new capacity added between 2020 and 2025 was clean energy. Coal-fired power plants are the second biggest power-generation technology in Africa (after gas), but the picture is skewed because of its dominant role in South Africa, which hosts 84 percent of African coal-fired capacity. Africa’s coal consumption has remained flat over the past two decades, and little new coal-fired capacity is planned, as highly polluting coal is increasingly overlooked.

Hydro schemes provide round-the-clock electricity but are devastated by droughts and generally not classified as renewable energy projects because of the impact on local communities, flora, and fauna during construction and flooding.

Building a diverse generation mix is a strategic method of balancing out variations in power production. As a result, new gas sector investment should not be made at the expense of renewable energy investment and must be seen as one element of a generally low emissions generation mix.

The benefits of technological diversity, including natural gas, can be amplified by greater cross-border power integration. For example, building high-capacity transmission lines to connect neighboring national grids allows electricity to be moved from areas of surplus capacity to areas of shortage. This helps each area focus on its strengths and even out variations in production. Similarly, a prolonged drought in one country may not affect hydro reservoirs in other countries, while gas-fired plants can stabilize power supplies over a wider area. There is already evidence of cross-border efforts, with power pools­ (where neighboring states share power production to some extent) at various stages of development in Southern, East, and West Africa.

Increased gas use in Africa has many potential benefits

Improving access to electricity, including via gas-fired power plants, will help boost living standards and drive economic growth in Africa, especially for the poorest half of the population that currently lacks any access at all. Consider the enormous benefits of having electricity: Even very small amounts enable children to do their homework in countries where it is dark by 7:00 p.m., medicines to be safely stored at the necessary temperatures, and electronic devices to be charged.

Restricted access to electricity and natural gas hampers efforts to attract manufacturing and industrial investment. Rising labor costs are driving manufacturing offshoring from China to Southeast and South Asia but not yet to Africa, partly because the continent lacks adequate infrastructure. Even if the electrification of industrial processes using renewables is likely in the long term, relying on gas produces lower emissions than coal in industrial processes such as steel and aluminium smelting.

Natural gas is important in the production of nitrogen-based fertilizers, both as a source of energy and as a direct input. At present, African fertilizer production is inadequate to satisfy national and continental market demand at prices farmers can afford, with average use in the sub-Saharan region less than 20 kg/hectare, compared to the global average of 135 kg/hectare.

Gas use can also yield important environmental benefits. In South Africa, unlike most other countries, synthetic fuels provide the bulk of its liquid fuel needs, with most synthetic fuel produced from coal but some from natural gas. Switching more of this production from coal to gas would cut emissions.

Using gas for cooking, often in the form of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG), can substitute for kerosene and biomass (such as wood fuel), which contribute to 3.2 million annual deaths from household air pollution and accidents worldwide. Biomass use also drives deforestation and reduces an environment’s ability to absorb carbon. In 2022, 970 million Africans, or 67 percent of the continent’s population, lacked access to clean energy for cooking.

Switching to gas from coal improves air quality. Although natural gas produces roughly 50 percent of the GHG emissions of coal plants, it has other environmental benefits, particularly in terms of lower air pollution. Gas produces virtually no sulfur dioxide emissions or fine particulate matter, whereasparticulate matter from coal use results in 42,000 deaths a year in South Africa.

Improved access to electricity, including from gas-fired plants, would support some climate change mitigation strategies, including water desalination plants, air conditioning, cold storage, and the concrete and steel used in resilient infrastructure. Finally, in the longer term, gas sector pipelines could be converted to transport green hydrogen—produced using renewable energy—to offer continued use by tapping a lower-emissions energy resource compared to natural gas.

On both climate and economic grounds, commercial outlets for gas that is currently flared are needed. Non-associated gas on hydrocarbon fields is only produced in order to be used, but gas is also associated with oil and other hydrocarbons, such as natural gas liquids, where it can be commercially marketed, reinjected to aid oil production, or flared to dispose of it. Flaring creates emissions without any commercial benefit and releases more than 350 million tons of CO2 worldwide, more than Egypt’s total emissions in 2023.

In addition to ending gas flaring, the global warming impact of gas projects can be minimized by reducing methane leakage during LNG transport and through carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS). CCUS involves storing carbon from gas-fired power plants and industrial facilities underground, or using it in commercial projects, including in synthetic fuel production.

The commercial rollout of CCUS is only starting to take off worldwide, and it will likely be many years, if ever, before its use is prevalent in Africa. All CCUS options require increased energy use, additional equipment, and state support on early-stage projects.

The ideal generation mix varies greatly among African countries

Decisions relating to the role of natural gas should be made on a country-by-country basis. Because conditions are not uniform across the continent, there is no single approach that should be implemented in all markets.

Some African countries have already launched universal electrification programs. Kenya’s push to hit the 2030 SDG 7 target is discussed later, while twelve countries, including Democratic Republic of Congo (DR Congo) and Nigeria, published detailed plans in January 2025 to connect more people to their respective grids. Yet the best route to achieving full connectivity varies from country to country.

Each country’s energy transition must be feasible within the context of its economy, geography, and natural resources. Rather than offer “unhelpful generalisations,” the international community must “embrace and support nuance and country-specific analysis,” as Youba Sokona, author and vice chair of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, said in 2022.

If universal, reliable electrification can be achieved in the medium term without recourse to natural gas, then new gas-fired plants should be avoided given their relatively high life-cycle emissions. However, countries with relatively low electrification rates and significant gas reserves should be encouraged and supported in building gas-to-power projects.

Angola, Cameroon, Congo-Brazzaville, Mauritania, Mozambique, Nigeria, and Tanzania would all fall into this category. Gas-fired plants would be particularly useful in Nigeria, Angola, Gabon, and Congo-Brazzaville because they flare large amounts of gas. It would also apply to West African countries that can reap the benefits of the coastal gas pipeline between Nigeria and Morocco, which has been proposed to remedy the generally low electrification rates across the region.

Nigeria has enough gas to reach 100 percent electrification—hopefully in conjunction with more rapid renewables development—but gas industry growth has been hampered by attacks on gas infrastructure and low regulated domestic prices.

Algeria has achieved 100 percent electrification but could divert gas that is currently flared to provide additional generation capacity.

Flaring is a problem in Libya and Egypt as well, but financing new power plants in conflict-torn Libya would be difficult, while Egypt is struggling to balance gas exports with domestic requirements. Countries with existing upstream gas operations already have the infrastructure and expertise in place to support new gas-to-power projects. Investment there should focus on transmission connections between gas fields, power plants, and other industrial offtakers or buyers.

Ahead of the 27th Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP27), hosted by Egypt in 2022, academics from fifty institutions, including many in Africa, produced a paper calling on the Global North to stop thinking of the continent as a “homogenous collective” with similar energy needs and a common route to net zero. The research, published in Nature Energy, compared the situation in four African countries: Burkina Faso, Ethiopia, Mozambique, and South Africa. The researchers offered the following recommendations for balancing electrification with climate concerns in those countries:

Burkina Faso should opt for a combination of solar and diesel projects. The country has a limited power grid, high power costs, and restricted access to finance, so smaller-scale, local solar and diesel projects are favored in addition to improved cross-border transmission connections, rather than building expensive gas import infrastructure. With an electrification rate of just 20 percent, the country needs to focus on cheap and quick solutions.

Ethiopia can continue to rely on large hydro, having built 5,250 MW of dam projects over the past decade, with another 12,000 MW in the development pipeline. The hydro sector now provides 90 percent of its electricity and can be complemented by growing solar and wind power investment. Ethiopia can also use hydro schemes as batteries to compensate for variation in intermittent power production, so gas is unlikely to play a role here.

Mozambique should develop gas reserves for domestic supply alongside LNG projects to provide the baseload capacity needed to balance intermittent renewables production and increase the electrification rate from the current 44 percent. Providing that security challenges in the far northeast of the country are overcome, Mozambique is set to become one of the world’s biggest emerging LNG exporters, so dedicating a small proportion of gas for power and fertilizer production could significantly boost living standards. The government is backing new gas-fired capacity while banking on off-grid solar for rural electrification.

South Africa should combine solar and wind projects with BESS because it would be cheaper and faster than building gas-to-power plants to move away from king coal. The country already has one of the most developed renewables sectors on the continent and is currently developing its first utility-scale BESS projects.

It might be expected that South Africa would be an ideal candidate for gas sector investment. Coal provides 81.6 percent of its generation mix, so switching coal for gas would substantially cut emissions. South Africa produced 394 million metric tons of carbon from all fuel combustion in 2022, the most on the continent, 1.2 percent of the global total and a 40 percent increase over 2021. Fuel combustion emissions come from thermal power generation and internal combustion engine vehicles, with coal plants accounting for 83 percent.

Previously developed South African gas-fired power plants have suffered from lack of gas feedstock, and domestic gas reserves are limited, so efforts to reduce emissions have focused on renewables. Power utility Eskom plans to build a 3,000 MW gas-fired power plant near Richards Bay backed by an LNG import terminal by 2030, with a smaller terminal planned for Ngqura. Yet, import projects have fallen through in the past, and gas is unlikely to play a big role in South Africa.

Research by the International Institute for Sustainable Development (IISD) in 2022 concluded that gas will not be needed for South African power sector within the next decade—in part because solar and wind power was 57 percent cheaper than gas-fired plants and short lead times for developing solar projects make them an attractive response to the country’s ongoing power supply crisis. South Africa also has 2,832 MW of pumped storage capacity out of national capacity of 63.4 GW to act as LDES. The IISD also found that coal-fired plants can provide back-up capacity in the medium term, while three-hour BESS facilities are 30 percent cheaper than simple cycle gas plants—the most suitable gas plants in this instance—for covering peak demand.

Still, gas imports could play a growing role in South Africa’s synthetic fuels industry. Sasol, a South African producer of synthetic fuels, currently uses 185 petajoules (PJ) of gas a year, of which 160 PJ/yr is imported by pipeline from southern Mozambique. As these fields become exhausted, alternative sources of gas are needed, including recent discoveries of domestic gas.

Kenya, like South Africa, is a country where gas-fired plants are unnecessary, and it is on track to achieve universal electrification by 2030, with the electrification rate rising from 37 percent in 2013 to 79 percent in 2023. Geothermal, hydro, wind, and solar power accounts for 90 percent of power production, with geothermal and hydro plants providing baseload capacity. Kenya’s 985 MW geothermal capacity is the fifth highest in the world. Plans to build coastal Kenyan gas-fired plants are intermittently proposed and shelved but such projects are optional rather than essential.

Should Africa focus on gas exports or intra-African demand?

More new gas reserves have recently been found in Africa than anywhere else in the world

Africa accounts for just 6.46 percent of global gas output, producing 265 billion cubic meters (bcm) in 2023, of which 115 bcm were exported out of the continent. This compares with global production of 4,100 bcm. Four countries—Algeria, Egypt, Libya, and Nigeria—account for 80 percent of Africa’s output. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that African demand will grow by an average of 3 percent per year, reaching 187 to 246 bcm by 2030 and up to 437 bcm by 2050.

Roughly 40 percent of natural gas discovered worldwide between 2015 and 2024 was in Africa, mainly in Mauritania, Mozambique, Namibia, Senegal, and Tanzania. Namibia is the latest country in Africa to join the list, with Shell and TotalEnergies making big offshore oil and gas finds. Routine gas flaring is banned under Namibian law, so the gas will either have to be reinjected or commercially marketed. With 246 bcm identified to date, the government of Namibia aims to implement a common gas plan across all fields, including for local power generation and petrochemical production.

African gas is used on the continent for cooking and synthetic fuel production and in various industrial processes but mostly for power generation. The share of gas-fired capacity in the African generation mix has steadily increased from 20.82 percent in 2000 to 43.13 percent in 2024. In many cases, gas-fired power plants are connected to gas fields by dedicated pipelines, but Algeria, Egypt, South Africa, and Nigeria all have more comprehensive distribution networks that are capable of supplying gas to a high number of different customers, large and small. Oil and gas companies need long-term offtake supply contracts with local utilities to invest in downstream gas operations, but signing ten- or twenty-year contracts is a huge commitment for those utilities. Energy subsidies and regulated prices help reduce prices for consumers but deter investment. According to the International Gas Union, about 55 percent of Africa’s natural gas consumption is sold at prices below the cost of supply as governments try to make gas and power more affordable for consumers.

Financing for electrification is currently far from sufficient

Developing gas-to-power projects and associated gas transmission and power grid capacity is expensive. According to the IEA, Africa must double its annual power investment to $200 billion by 2030 to achieve universal electrification while meeting climate change pledges.

African governments and utilities have limited access to financing for new gas and power projects, while capital costs for African projects are often up to three times those in other countries, so the sector urgently needs access to external sources of low-cost finance. Foreign investment is therefore key, whether from commercial investors, the multilaterals, development finance institutions (DFIs), or donors.

Gas-to-power projects in less wealthy countries may not generate enough income to justify construction. Moreover, long-term gas contracts can lock African power utilities into relatively high-cost thermal power at a time when solar energy costs are falling in the region with the best solar resources on the planet.

Environmental, social, and economic risk assessments need to be thorough because of the risk of asset stranding in what are mostly small markets. Although Mozambique and Senegal have large gas reserves to develop for exports, both countries are burdened by a high cost of capital and national debt—and low levels of experience in the sector—so they could be outcompeted by lower-cost exporters.

Financing from the multilaterals and international banks for African oil and gas projects has become scarcer because of climate concerns, but a new source of funding was launched in June 2025. African Export-Import Bank (Afreximbank) and the Africa Petroleum Producers’ Organization set up the African Energy Bank with initial capital of $5 billion, although it was established to support the entire hydrocarbons sector rather than specifically gas-to-power projects.

Egypt has focused on gas

International engineering companies are prepared to develop large gas-fired plants in Africa under sufficiently attractive terms of investment. In 2018, Siemens and Egyptian partners Orascom Construction and Elsewedy Electric completed the world’s three biggest combined cycle gas-fired plants: Beni Suef, Burullus, and New Capital, which provided a total of 14.4 GW out of national capacity of 59 GW in 2022.

Alongside a contract to build six power substations and other transmission infrastructure, they were built for the Egyptian Electricity Holding Company, which estimates that they save the country more than $1 billion a year. Siemens’s involvement was crucial to financing as it was able to secure loan agreements from two export credit agencies, Germany’s Euler Hermes and Italy’s SACE, to underpin loans from more than thirty international banks.

African gas exporters favor LNG

The majority of Africa’s gas markets are small and fragmented and have relatively low regulated prices, so it is no surprise that exports drive most investment. Gas can be exported from Africa by pipeline or as LNG, which involves cooling gas to a concentrated, liquid state for sea transport. Such projects require the construction of expensive liquefaction plants in producing countries and regasification facilities in destination markets, but they are generally considered cheaper than piping gas over very long distances. They are also the most flexible form of export, as producers are not tied to specific export markets.

Algeria and Libya both export gas to Europe via subsea pipelines, while both—along with countries further south—also ship LNG. Nigeria, Equatorial Guinea, and Angola have traditional onshore LNG plants, but Africa has become a global center of floating LNG (FLNG) development, which entails placing LNG production vessels on offshore gas reserves.

FLNG projects are smaller than their onshore counterparts, but they avoid onshore security difficulties, can be moved to other locations if required, and enable the development of gas reserves that might be flared. Projects are already operating in Congo-Brazzaville, Mozambique, Senegal/Mauritania, and Cameroon. Eni is developing a second FLNG project offshore Congo-Brazzaville and planning a second project in Mozambique, while the UTM Offshore FLNG project is being planned for Nigeria’s deepwater Yoho field, where it would use gas that is currently flared.

A huge onshore project designed to host production for two different consortia has been partially built in northern Mozambique. Work was suspended in 2021 following militant attacks, but TotalEnergies and the other developers plan to restart work this year. Equinor and Shell hope to finalize arrangements on a huge project in southeastern Tanzania. Africa already contributes almost 10 percent of the global LNG supply, but if both of these projects are completed, it will make the southern Tanzania/northern Mozambique region a global engine of LNG production.

With global gas demand rising, US and Qatari LNG production is accelerating, with 350 bcm expected to be added to the world’s 2024 output of 670 bcm by 2030. The scope for African LNG projects beyond those already underway, therefore, may be limited. As with gas-to-power projects, export schemes—whether piped or LNG plants—could stall because of lack of market capacity.

Piping Nigerian gas to Europe could benefit most of West Africa

In addition to their cost, long-distance, cross-border pipelines are difficult to develop due to the number of stakeholders involved—from the supplying to transit and receiving countries. At present, the most high-profile proposed projects in Africa are two rival schemes to pipe gas from the Niger Delta to Algeria and Morocco for onward transportation to Europe. These projects, however, are taking very different routes.

The Trans-Saharan Gas Pipeline (TSGP), under discussion since 2022, would run 4,000 km through Niger to Algeria. Backed by two state-owned oil companies, the Nigerian National Petroleum Company and Algeria’s Sonatrach, it would have capacity of up to 30 bcm per year. Although the project would connect big reserves with huge markets, the core challenge will be security in the face of a range of armed groups operating across the Sahel. Similar security concerns have deterred construction of the proposed Turkmenistan-India pipeline through Afghanistan and Pakistan since the 1990s.

Nevertheless, efforts are ongoing, with Penspen energy consultants agreeing to update a feasibility study into the TSGP in 2025, nineteen years after completing its initial study. The desire of European nations to end their long-term reliance on Russian gas may make development more likely this time around.

The rival Africa-Atlantic Gas Pipeline (AAGP) would run around the West African coast and enable onshore connections to eleven countries between Nigeria and Morocco: Benin, Togo, Ghana, Cote d’Ivoire, Liberia, Sierra Leone, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Senegal, Gambia, and Mauritania. Gas could be supplied to all of the transit countries as well as European customers.

The challenge with AAGP will be reaching sales and transit agreements with so many countries—not to mention security issues, including on the final stretch through contested Western Sahara. Like the TSGP, this 6,000-km project would have a 30 bcm/year capacity. The governments of Morocco and Nigeria plan to form a special company to drive project development.

Abuja and the project developers must guarantee that supplies to the Nigerian market are not curtailed and ensure that gas is ring-fenced for domestic use at commercially viable prices. If the AAGP succeeds in providing gas feedstock to the eleven transit countries, this could make it the most important piece of infrastructure on the entire continent.

Gas exports can aid rather than block local consumption

Many question whether gas export projects divert production from African markets or help make domestic supply commercially viable. The answer largely comes down to the political will of host governments to demand that developers consider local as well as export needs. The oil and gas companies that develop LNG projects are attracted by export revenues and deterred from domestic markets by their often limited size and low regulated prices.

African governments, of course, are keen to see LNG projects developed. The planned Tanzanian and Mozambican schemes promise the biggest ever single investments into each country, delivering benefits in terms of taxes and royalties to job creation, but it is critical to ring-fence a portion of production for local distribution.

Choosing to export gas or use it for local supply is not a binary decision. The domestic requirements will be small in relation to export volumes and can help drive domestic power generation. Ensuring that gas production benefits local communities can also foster a sense of social and resource justice. For instance, developing LNG projects in northern Mozambique while leaving most locals without access to electricity would be neither just nor sensible given the region’s militant insurgency.

Several governments, including Nigeria, Tanzania, and Senegal, already require that some gas from export-focused projects be set aside for the domestic market. For instance, the Nigerian Upstream Petroleum Regulatory Commission has the ability to force upstream producers to supply the local market.”

Occasionally, there is tension between export obligations and domestic supplies, even when the government is committed to both. Following new gas field discoveries, for example, Egypt’s government has been eager to supply the country’s LNG industry while satisfying growing domestic demand, including from the power sector. However, in response to rising domestic consumption, it has been forced to periodically block LNG production and rely on Israeli gas imports, dealing a blow to export revenues and triggering political criticism at home.

Recommendations

The drive for electrification will continue in at least some African countries with or without increased global support. The whole of North Africa has achieved close to universal electrification, while Kenya and Ghana are among the countries making significant progress toward that goal. For countries making less progress, there is much that can be done to help speed up the process, including by supporting gas sector development where needed. The following principles should guide the development of the continent’s natural gas resources to promote electrification at the lowest possible climate cost:

Climate responsibility should be based on absolute per capita emissions, not on change over time. Apart from South Africa, Africa accounts for a tiny proportion of global GHG emissions.

The goal of achieving universal electrification should be at the core of energy transition strategies. Leaving hundreds of millions of Africans without access to electricity on climate grounds—when the rest of the world’s GHG emissions are so much higher than Africa’s—should not be acceptable.

The primary focus of financing should be on renewable energy development, not least on grounds of cost per kWh. Given its relatively high life-cycle emissions, new gas-fired capacity should be avoided if universal, reliable electrification can be achieved in the medium term without it. However, countries with low electrification rates and access to gas should be backed in building gas-to-power projects—along with projects that rely heavily on gas that is currently flared.

The views of each country’s residents must be taken into account. They understand what it means to use kerosene and biomass fuel and to lack access to electricity.

In terms of electrification, renewables and gas-fired power plants should be seen as complementary rather than competing. Gas-fired capacity can provide baseload capacity to support increased renewables’ penetration, while solar microgrid and standalone residential systems can supply off-grid rural areas.

Pathways to clean energy systems should be considered on a country-by-country basis.

The governments of industrialized countries

Governments in North America, Europe, the Gulf States, and East Asia, among other areas, need to step up support for the African energy transition, mainly in renewables but also in gas-fired capacity where appropriate. This would boost living standards on the continent while minimizing emissions, create stronger African trading partners, and improve political and security stability in the wider world.

The International Partners Group formed at COP26 in 2021 was conceived as the primary mechanism for providing the necessary international financing for the energy transition in developing countries. As part of their efforts, the group would create Just Energy Transition Partnerships (JETPs) between investors and host governments, but only four JETPs have been forged to date: with Indonesia ($20 billion), Senegal ($2.6 billion), South Africa ($11.6 billion), and Vietnam ($15.5 billion). The United States pulled out of the program, and additional JETPs are now considered unlikely.

Still, the objective of coordinating development finance institutions (DFIs), the private sector, host governments, multilateral development banks, and philanthropists to work together on the issue is a sound one. New “country platforms”—where host communities have greater agency and more of the funding is provided as direct grants—are being attempted instead, but it is vital that gas remains part of the equation where conditions require it. Whatever arrangement or vehicle is used, comprehensive financing mechanisms must be put in place as soon as possible.

The United States has drastically cut its aid budget, but other countries can continue to contribute, either through their development budgets, DFIs (such as British International Investment [BII] and the German Investment Corporation), or sovereign wealth funds (SWFs). BII, for instance, is committed to improving energy access in Africa, and although it curtailed almost all investment in fossil fuels in 2020, it remains open to financing gas-fired projects where they support human development needs. It should be more explicit in specifying progress toward universal electrification among these needs, and other DFIs should follow suit.

The European Union has various mechanisms for supporting African development, principal among them is NDICI-Global Europe, which aims to improve living conditions and political stability including through investment in the energy transition in coordination with EU member states and institutions. While the organization currently does not finance gas-fired projects, it should do so where gas-fired capacity is the best route to electrification.

Sovereign wealth funds and export credit agencies

Gulf governments and their SWFs are active investors in African development, with the United Arab Emirates committed to co-financing the $25 billion Africa-Atlantic Gas Pipeline from Nigeria to Morocco alongside the European Investment Bank, the Islamic Development Bank, and the OPEC Fund. The central project will export Nigerian gas to Europe, but the Gulf States and other members of the consortium could also help to finance spur pipeline connections to the West African transit states and gas-fired power plants in those countries.

Norway’s Government Pension Fund Global, one of the world’s biggest SWFs and which derives most of its income from the country’s oil and gas industry, is another potential investor. It has halted investment in coal projects but continues to invest heavily in hydrocarbons, as well as African renewable energy, and seeks to promote economic development through its investments. However, it does not appear at present to invest in African gas-fired power plants. Drawing on Norway’s expertise in the gas sector, the fund could further many of its interests by supporting such projects, and its actions and strategies are often followed by other institutional investors.

Despite sizable cuts to the US aid budget, the world’s biggest economy can still play a major role. US Export-Import Bank (EXIM) recently approved a $4.7 billion loan for TotalEnergies’ Mozambique LNG project that will help attract pension and institutional funds “to support upstream gas development and associated infrastructure.” Such investment could be combined with support for Mozambican gas-fired power projects. Because EXIM’s support for the LNG project was rooted in helping US workers and businesses involved in the scheme, it might be inclined to participate in power projects developed by US firms.

The current US government is in favor of wider oil and gas development, so African gas-to-power projects may be able to benefit from US organizations with federal connections. There could also be a pathway to develop gas-fired power plants and other gas projects in exchange for access to critical minerals in infrastructure-for-resources deals. This could be a valuable negotiating tool with mining-rich DR Congo, for instance, where Chinese companies have largely failed to develop promised infrastructural projects. DR Congo has neighboring states with gas reserves both to its north and south, including in Cabinda.

Apart from EXIM, other export credit agencies have played a crucial role in financing African gas-to-power projects. Euler Hermes and SACE were key to developing Siemens’ three gas-fired power plants in Egypt, and their counterparts across the world could play a similarly vital role.

African governments and regional organizations

African governments, the African Union (AU), and the continent’s regional economic communities are key players in driving electrification, including gas-fired power. The AU and regional communities have a particular role in promoting cooperation between different states. Above all, they should support cross-border power transmission integration to help neighboring countries balance out variations in power production, thereby allowing gas-fired plants to supply a larger pool of customers and support more intermittent power production.

The Southern African Power Pool has been operating since 1995, but progress has been slow in other regions, especially with respect to making the West African Power Pool (WAPP) a reality. Nigerian and Ghanaian gas could help supply energy across the region, either piped gas feedstock or electricity via cross-border power interconnectors. Political mistrust and a lack of investment have held back development of the WAPP, while the project clings to its grand vision of many cross-border, high-capacity transmission links. However, transmission integration is more likely to happen by following a step-by-step process than by imposing an overarching plan from above.

The Economic Community of West African States, which oversees the WAPP, also needs to encourage neighboring governments, power utilities, and regulators to cooperate on the technical aspects of integration, such as permitting, regulatory capacity building, and grid operation. It is difficult to trade power across borders when neighboring countries have different electricity standards that make it burdensome to secure project permit approvals.

Academic institutions, think tanks, and research organizations

At present there is very little detailed, specific research on the best energy transition strategy for individual African countries. While more than 150 research groups model the German energy system and propose long-term pathways, there are often none taking the same approach to individual African countries, even those with large gas reserves, such as Mozambique and Senegal. Much more country-specific research is needed, including to assess whether falling renewables and battery storage costs could leave gas-fired assets stranded.

Research is also needed on where gas-fired generation could support renewables and where it would block them. There is a real risk that gas investments could crowd out renewables by locking up infrastructure and capital. Detailed research on the intersection of technology and economics, along the lines of studies conducted by National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) and the Pacific Northwest National Laboratory (PNNL) in the United States, would be beneficial. These organizations focus on the US energy sector, but it would be helpful if they and their peers were to dedicate a small portion of their research efforts to energy-poor countries, not least because of the learnings they would gain for their own markets.

Conclusion

Difficult choices are called for when two worthwhile causes come into conflict with each other. With the United Nations estimating that the world is on course for an average temperature rise of 3.1C by the end of this century, it is incumbent on the international community to step up efforts to mitigate climate change. These efforts must include phasing out the vast majority of coal and oil and probably even natural gas projects.

Yet, to more fairly distribute the remaining emissions, developing new gas-fired power plants in Africa should be a top priority. Requiring African countries to abstain from gas development when more prosperous countries are forging ahead could easily appear to be climate colonialism.

Implementing these recommendations to allow gas to be a minor but significant part of Africa’s electrification efforts would yield big improvements in living standards in some of the poorest countries in the world. There would be clear benefits for the people of Africa but also for the wider world through economic development and increased stability.

KS: One of the things I’ve learned working in the climate field is that people come from many different backgrounds, and that is a strength. Health is often the most resonant lens for talking about climate, because ultimately, we care about this issue because of how it affects the well-being of the people we love.

Our changing climate touches every part of life: it can disrupt a child’s education, delay cancer treatments, make cities too hot to be livable, or compromise access to safe drinking water. And this burden is always borne inequitably, with its impacts being thrust upon those who have less power to push for change. I view my role at Kresge as a connector, clarifying how climate affects every sector, highlighting the implications for health and equity, and helping to advance a more resilient and just future.

KM: What interests and passions do you bring to your work?

KS: In addition to my interest in public health and climate change, I’m passionate about meditation and mindfulness, and try to weave them into daily life. That doesn’t necessarily mean the type of meditation you might be imagining now—sitting formally somewhere quiet—though sometimes it can look like that. But it’s also things like showing up fully in conversations without thinking about my next meeting, brushing my teeth without multitasking, or pausing for a breath before responding to something that bothers me. I have been reflecting on the idea that “calm is a form of resistance,” and I think that applies both personally and professionally. In a world that constantly demands my attention, there is something radical about choosing where my attention goes, rather than having it chosen for me. (If the phrase “attention economy” doesn’t mean anything to you, this is your sign to dig into the concept.)

KM: What do you see as the most urgent need(s) when it comes to improving the health and well-being of people and communities?

KS: Where do I begin! One of the most urgent needs I see is rebuilding social cohesion and a sense of shared responsibility. We saw this during COVID and continue to see it with climate change, where our willingness to prioritize the collective good is fragile at best. In my mind, that willingness of shared responsibility extends to other structural factors that shape daily life, such as access to reliable public transportation, affordable housing, safe water, and clean air. Without them, it becomes easier to retreat into individual solutions and harder to imagine what we owe one another. Strengthening the systems that connect us, and the trust that holds them together, feels essential to improving both health and community resilience.

KM: What is a good book that you’ve read recently that you’d recommend?

KS: I recently read Stuck: How the Privileged and the Propertied Broke the Engine of American Opportunity by Yoni Appelbaum, and I’ve been thinking about it a lot. Appelbaum argues that America’s historic “engine of opportunity,” which is the ability to move for better jobs, cheaper housing, or reinvention, has broken down. The book examines how zoning was employed to segregate communities and how even seemingly progressive policies now limit mobility by reducing housing supply and exacerbating inequality. While not a perfect book, I found it a valuable history that has me thinking about how zoning shapes daily life and opportunity. As our team continues to deepen its understanding of climate mobility and migration in cities, I expect it to be a book I will keep coming back to.

Related: UTA powers domestic magnetic manufacturing

To help explain the impact of this partnership, The University of Texas at Arlington’s J. Ping Liu, professor of physics and a leading researcher in rare-earth materials, shared his insights. Dr. Liu has collaborated with MP Materials on projects supported by the U.S. Department of Energy and has worked with company leaders on research and workforce initiatives at UT Arlington.

Why is this deal between Apple and MP Materials significant?

Liu: It’s significant because it underscores how vital strong magnets are for electronics, clean energy and other high-tech applications in our daily life and national security. In addition, it also demonstrates that for high-tech businesses to succeed at scale, they need broad support—from both industry partners and government. The Apple partnership, along with MP Materials’ agreement with the Department of Defense, provides critical momentum for expanding U.S. magnet production.

Why are rare-earth magnets so important in today’s technology?

Liu: Rare-earth magnets are critical because of their unique electronic structures. The 4f electrons in rare-earth elements are the origin of everything: They give the magnets high coercivity, which makes it possible to create devices that are smaller, lighter but more powerful. Think about a smartphone: It now does much more work than a desktop computer could do 20 years ago. That leap in capability is tied directly to the development of advanced materials, particularly advanced semiconductors and strong rare-earth magnets.

Could this reduce U.S. dependence on China for rare-earth materials?

Liu: MP Materials is unique because it operates the full supply chain, from processing ores at its Mountain Pass mine in California to, now, manufacturing magnets in Fort Worth. If the company can produce magnets at scale and at competitive cost, the U.S. will be far less dependent on imports—especially from China, which currently dominates global supply. The Apple and DOD deals are important steps toward reaching that goal.

What does this mean for Fort Worth’s economy?

Liu: As I have learned, MP Materials chose Fort Worth carefully, recognizing the region’s strengths for high-tech manufacturing. The new facility will boost the local economy through job creation and enhanced manufacturing capacity. This area also benefits from local strong research in physics, chemistry and materials science. MP Materials leaders visited my UTA laboratory in 2022, where they were welcome by our University leadership. That visit led to a sponsored grant and a joint research project from the Department of Energy. These kinds of collaborations highlight how North Texas can become a hub for advanced materials research and production.

How does building a domestic rare-earth supply chain connect to broader national security and sustainability goals?

Liu: I have worked in the U.S. in magnets research for 30 years. In my view, our current shortage in rare-earth supply is caused by the shortage in workforce training (education) and fundamental research in magnetic materials. Look at the facts here: The U.S. has the resources (rare-earth deposition), why does it have the supply-chain problem now? I have witnessed the monotonous reduction of research activities in this area in the U.S. in the past 20 years caused by research funding cuts, which are essentially cuts to the most important supply chains: education and research supply chains. Recall the Manhattan Project, a great time for strong national security in U.S. history—the government invested in scientific research substantially and attracted foreign scientists. Now we can only see this kind of story in the movies. It is clear to me that building strong U.S. education and research supply chains is about more than creating jobs or advancing technology; it’s also a matter of national security and sustainability.

That’s because starting Oct. 1, the state’s Clean Air Vehicle Decal Program — which gave drivers of EVs and other clean cars access to HOV lanes — will come to an end. Even though California legislators passed legislation extending carpool lane access through 2027, the program also requires federal authorization, which the Trump administration denied.

The federal Department of Transportation issued a statement to Reuters earlier this summer, saying that the U.S. Congress opted not to extend the deadline in 2021, when the Democratic party had the majority. However, the Trump administration, with a Republican-controlled House, had the opportunity to extend the program this year and chose not to, despite advocacy efforts by elected officials in California, Arizona and other states.

This is the latest blow to zero-emission, or green-vehicle, incentive programs under Trump. In July, President Donald Trump signed legislation that ended tax credits of up to $7,500 for people buying or leasing a new electric car and up to $4,000 for those purchasing a used EV. Those incentives also end on Sept. 30. In order to continue selling their stock of EVs and other zero-emission cars, some car dealerships still offer rebate programs offered by state governments or by the manufacturers themselves. California no longer has a state rebate program.

“People are disappointed but it’s not really stopping anyone from getting an electric car,” said a sales representative at the Volkswagen of Oakland car dealership on Broadway, who asked not to be named because he was not authorized to speak on the record. “It now puts them on par with gas vehicles.”

In the Bay Area, the loss of the zero-emission sticker program could increase traffic on already congested roadways, including on the Bay Bridge, which is the main artery into San Francisco from Berkeley.

According to a California Highway Patrol statement to a Los Angeles TV station, drivers will have a two-month grace period before getting cited for violations.

‘A Trump traffic jam’

“A Trump traffic jam is on its way to California and other states – all because Republicans in Congress decided to let a wildly successful bipartisan program expire,” Newsom said in a statement last week. Newsom last year signed a bipartisan state bill, AB 2678, to extend the program. He also signed an executive order in June reiterating the state’s commitment to reducing emissions from cars.

A state report released in August in response to the executive order cited access to carpool lanes as a key factor encouraging people to buy electric vehicles.

“Access to HOV lanes is a well-established, non-monetary incentive that is a critical element in purchasing decisions made by consumers in areas of the state with high congestion,” the report reads.

California was one of 13 states that offered the program.

The Electric Vehicle Association said in a statement that the U.S. needed “every tool available” to speed up the transition to CO2-free cars and noted that oil and gas companies still received “billions in subsidies every year.”

“It’s worth asking why a zero-emission incentive is being cut,” Elaine Borseth, an association board member, said.

We reached out to the U.S. Department of Transportation about whether it would provide any new guidance for commuters who used to the sticker program. They did not immediately respond.

Residents of Berkeley and other East Bay cities are already dreading the change.

Some have taken to Nextdoor to complain about the impending change while others are figuring out how to get friends or colleagues who use the same route to ride share in order to retain access to the HOV lanes.

In anticipation of the zero-emission-sticker loss, East Bay residents came together in Oakland a few weeks ago to restart the casual carpool program at a location near Lake Merritt. The leader of that effort, Camille Bermudez, told us she hoped that the loss of the stickers would lead to more people taking the chance on the revived system.

Bermudez said the return of casual carpool is going great and that many commuters were “excited to have this back as an option to replace their HOV sticker.”

“We’ve had a few people tell us that it’s now their go-to commute method,” she said. “We’d still love to see more participation and ridership.”",https://i0.wp.com/newspack-berkeleyside-cityside.s3.amazonaws.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/20240831_D7_EG_022-scaled-1.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-24 10:00:25.262069

The 1.5 GW wind farm will supply green electricity to over 1 million households at a competitive price.

Download the Press Release

Paris, September 24, 2025 – The consortium formed by TotalEnergies and RWE has been selected by the Ministry in charge of Industry and Energy as the winner of the Centre Manche 2 (AO8) offshore wind tender. The consortium will be responsible for designing, developing, building, and operating a 1.5 gigawatt (GW) offshore wind farm off the coast of Normandy.

The Largest Renewable Project Ever Developed in France

Located more than 40 km off the coast of Normandy, this will be the largest renewable energy project ever developed in France. Once built, it will generate approximately 6 TWh per year and supply green electricity to the equivalent of over 1 million French households. The electricity will be sold at a competitive price of €66/MWh, as set by the tender.

TotalEnergies will be the operator of the project, relying on its expertise in offshore wind and the management of large-scale marine energy projects. The Company will continue the necessary studies to reach a final investment decision by early 2029. Electricity production is expected to begin in 2033, in line with RTE’s grid connection schedule.

“We are very proud to have won this tender for the construction of the largest renewable energy park in France to date. It embodies Total’s transformation into TotalEnergies in France. This project will be the largest investment made by TotalEnergies in France in decades and reflects our Company’s deep commitment to our country. As a long-standing player in Normandy, we are determined to mobilize our expertise to ensure this project is an industrial success while securing its acceptance by the region. We will work to support the local industrial ecosystem, which has already developed skills through the first offshore wind projects currently being installed. Finally, this project strengthens our development in green electricity production to offer competitive prices to our French customers”, said Patrick Pouyanné, Chairman and CEO of TotalEnergies.

As part of a strategic review of its investments, RWE has expressed the wish to exit the consortium, subject to French authorities’ approval. In any case, TotalEnergies will pursue the project, assuming all the commitments of the consortium, and will propose to bring a new partner into the project.

A €4.5 billion investment that will benefit the Normandy region and the European industry

The project is expected to represent a €4.5 billion investment and generate significant economic benefits for the Normandy region. Up to 2,500 people will be employed during the three years of construction, and TotalEnergies has committed to offering 500,000 hours of work to apprentices and individuals in professional reintegration. TotalEnergies also plans to engage the local economic ecosystem, which has already developed expertise in offshore wind.

The project will also benefit the European industry, as TotalEnergies intends to source primarily from European suppliers, particularly for wind turbines and electrical cables.

TotalEnergies will ensure the proper integration of the project into the region

In the coming months, a dedicated TotalEnergies team, based in Normandy, will continue the consultation work with local and regional stakeholders that began during the tender phase. It will ensure the proper integration of the project into the Normandy region, especially its coexistence with commercial fishing.

TotalEnergies will also implement crowdfunding financing that will allow local residents and authorities in the Normandy region to invest in the project and directly contribute to the energy transition of their territory. Additionally, TotalEnergies will fund a €10 million territorial fund to support initiatives in training, education, and culture in Normandy.

On environmental matters, TotalEnergies will allocate €45 million to measures aimed at avoiding, reducing, and offsetting the project’s impacts; as well as €15 million to a biodiversity promotion fund in Normandy.

Finally, TotalEnergies has committed to making this project exemplary in terms of recycling offshore wind farm components, with recycling, reuse, or repurposing rates of blades, towers, and nacelles equal to or greater than 95%, and 100% of generator magnets being recycled or reused.

TotalEnergies in France: a historic territorial presence

A leading economic player rooted in France for over a century, TotalEnergies continues to invest in the country to contribute to energy security and the supply of fuels, gas, and electricity across the territory.

Since 2020, while transforming its energy offer, TotalEnergies has invested more than €8 billion in France, nearly half of which has supported the energy transition of its assets and for its customers. With a renewable portfolio of 660 wind, solar, hydro, and battery storage plants, TotalEnergies meets the electricity needs of the equivalent of 1.8 million people in France, ranking among the top three renewable electricity providers in the country with over 2 GW of installed capacity. TotalEnergies supplies electricity and gas to 4.2 million residential and business customers.

Controlling their energy supply will enhance reliability and give companies greater certainty that their electricity demands will be met.","The Washington Times first published this piece.

Ohio’s sweeping energy policy reforms have taken a bold, market-based turn that state and federal policymakers would be wise to follow. Evolving from Rust Belt factories to a high-tech haven, Ohio has seen the technological future, and it needs energy — reliable, affordable energy — and a lot of it.

Electricity demand was relatively flat for the first 20 years of the millennium, but artificial intelligence, supercomputing, cryptocurrencies, advanced technology manufacturing, and expanded digital services requiring massive new data centers have changed everything. Energy demand has spiked. Energy grids are stressed. Regional power companies can charge record prices. Consumers are left with the choice of paying the increasing rates or turning off the lights.

In Europe, when energy demand exceeded supply, central planners chose to decrease demand by tapping the brakes on economic growth while closing operating power plants. Electricity prices skyrocketed. Germans today pay 10 times what many Americans pay for power, their manufactured goods cost more to make and more to buy, and their less-competitive economy suffers. These higher energy prices, along with overly stringent regulatory regimes, have crippled Europe’s technology sector, leaving it reliant on American companies for computing, data storage and AI.

Ohio has taken a more sensible economic approach. Instead of artificially reducing demand by making energy even more expensive, policymakers in Columbus have taken steps to increase energy supply.

Ohio House Bill 15 set the stage for the state’s energy production to move from a government-regulated monopoly to a market-based competitive field. Taking many of the recommendations made by The Buckeye Institute and Americans for Prosperity-Ohio, the legislation abandons overrestrictive mandates, ends government subsidies, and cuts the bureaucracy that hinders growth and has hampered new energy production for decades.

The law requires the Ohio Power Siting Board to make decisions within 45 days of application, expediting a confusing process that too often takes months or even years to complete. Ohio’s 45-day rule is an overdue fix that will help keep vital energy projects on schedule and out of bureaucratic limbo.

Faster project approvals mean more power to meet surging demand sooner. That means lower production costs and more competitive prices for manufacturers, data centers and computing firms that need reliable, around-the-clock electricity.

The bill also encourages “behind-the-meter” power generation, allowing companies to build new power sources to supply their plants directly. Controlling their energy supply will enhance reliability and give companies greater certainty that their electricity demands will be met.

Ohio has also killed expensive, inefficient government subsidies to utility companies, including notorious taxpayer bailouts for the Ohio Valley Electric Corp. that have cost consumers more than $600 million since 2017 and would have cost another $100 million annually for the foreseeable future. Republicans in Washington just eliminated similar subsidies at the federal level, and for good reason. Taxpayers should not be subsidizing utilities even as they pay record prices for electricity. Removing government subsidies for politically favored companies levels the playing field and encourages genuine competition and innovation in the energy sector.

Finally, Ohio House Bill 15 bars utilities from adding “bill riders” that surprise consumers with unexpected fees. It also replaces outdated electric security plans, which are rate structures that allow utilities to charge hidden fees. Market rate offers are more transparent and competitive pricing systems that let consumers make more informed decisions when choosing electricity suppliers. By aligning default utility rates with the wholesale energy market, market rate offers require utilities to price competitively and encourage them to be more efficient and offer consumers more affordable energy rates.

Ohio has set a standard that other states can and should adopt. States have different energy structures, some more market-based than others, but any state, even those with highly regulated energy monopolies, can benefit from following Ohio’s example.

Ohio’s approach will help deliver less expensive, more reliable energy by increasing supply through competition and deregulation rather than stifling demand with artificially higher prices. Looking to balance grid stability, affordability and innovation, Ohio has rightly eschewed politically motivated mandates, prodded regulators to act efficiently, and prioritized consumers’ concerns over entrenched special interests. That message resonates across economic sectors and will attract new-economy firms looking for reliable energy with transparent, affordable pricing.

States looking to remain economically competitive in an increasingly digital and global market should follow Ohio’s lead or risk suffering Europe’s fate and falling further behind.

Determined to avoid a repeat, Indiana has been cranking fake crowd noise at practice, forcing the offense to communicate under constant pressure.
It’s loud and obnoxious and it rings your ears,” Coogan said of the artificial crowd noise.
For him, it comes down to mental preparation.
As the Hoosiers prepare for one of their toughest road schedules in recent memory, their center’s discipline and edge will be crucial.","It’s Week 5 of the college football season, and the Hoosiers are gearing up for their first road test of 2025: a trip to Iowa City. Fresh off their rout of Illinois, Indiana now has to reset quickly and brace for a hostile environment in their second conference game of the season. Kinnick Stadium is notorious for its volume, and this weekend the crowd will be determined to throw Indiana’s offense off balance. That’s where offensive lineman Pat Coogan says preparation becomes non-negotiable.

“It’s a challenge for sure—there’s no doubt about it,” Coogan said Tuesday. “But you got to prepare for it. You got to prepare for it every single day leading up to it. You can’t just turn it on and on Friday expect to be good. You got to prepare for it, and you got to make sure everyone’s tuned into the cadences and all the little things that sometimes you can gloss over when you’re [playing] at home. But now it’s going to be a bigger challenge. So, you got to prepare for it and make sure everyone’s on the same page.”

The have already learned how damaging a hostile crowd can be. Against reigning national champion Ohio State in 2024, Indiana held firm early, but once mistakes started piling up, the noise grew deafening, and the offense never recovered. A similar story played out in South Bend during the College Football Playoff opener. Even though head coach Curt Cignetti downplayed Notre Dame’s crowd earlier this week, the Hoosiers still struggled to find rhythm.

Determined to avoid a repeat, Indiana has been cranking fake crowd noise at practice, forcing the offense to communicate under constant pressure.

“It’s loud. It’s loud and obnoxious and it rings your ears,” Coogan said of the artificial crowd noise. “We had it on for the whole two hours or however long we were out there today. There’re no breaks or anything because there’s not going to be any breaks on Saturday. So, it’s good preparation for us.”

Annoying or not, the constant noise should help sharpen Indiana’s focus—especially for younger players or transfers still adjusting to high-pressure atmospheres. For Coogan, though, this isn’t new territory.

Before joining Indiana, he played in 30 games with 26 career starts at Notre Dame, giving him plenty of experience in intimidating environments. As a freshman, he ran onto the field against Virginia Tech with “Enter Sandman” shaking the stadium. He’s lined up in Top-15 showdowns, like Duke in 2023, and battled through the Fighting Irish’s playoff run that included a national championship appearance. Coogan has seen—and heard—it all. For him, it comes down to mental preparation.

“It’s more of a mental expectation, you really have to get yourself ready for it,” Coogan explained. “You have to know what to listen to and what not to listen to. It’s reps, you got to just put yourself in that environment and practice and go through all the mechanics and all the reps of it, it’s not going to get easier, per se, but you put yourself in that mental state, with anything you prepare for, as you go through the reps, it helps.”

Indiana is fortunate to have Coogan anchoring Curt Cignetti’s offensive line. His toughness, experience, and poise under pressure make him an ideal leader in the trenches. As the Hoosiers prepare for one of their toughest road schedules in recent memory, their center’s discipline and edge will be crucial.",https://i0.wp.com/hoosierhuddle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/USATSI_27016759.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 18:03:28.560082

BII’s investment in the initiative’s debt-focussed vehicle, H2R Amplify, will improve energy access for more than 50 million people and mitigate over 3 million tonnes of CO₂e.

It qualifies under the 2X Challenge with the commitment to promote gender equality in the energy sector and expand economic opportunities for women as consumers and employees.

British International Investment (BII), the UK’s development finance institution and impact investor, has announced a $20 million commitment to Acumen’s Hardest-to-Reach (H2R) Initiative. Through the initiative’s debt-focussed vehicle, H2R Amplify, our investment will help expand access to affordable, reliable, and clean energy in frontier economies in Africa – where nearly 600 million people still lack access to electricity and women bear the disproportionate burden of energy poverty.

As part of H2R’s dual-vehicle structure, H2R Amplify will deploy innovative financing to established off-grid solar companies in the most underserved countries in sub-Saharan Africa, accelerating energy access where national electrification rates range from just 59 to as low as 12 per cent. It will offer impact-linked loans and receivables backed financing to help solar companies manage working capital as they scale. H2R Catalyze, the initiative’s patient capital arm, has raised $57 million since 2023 and is already investing in early-stage companies.

H2R Amplify, which was originally developed by Acumen with UK research and innovation support via the Transforming Energy Access (TEA) platform, has now has secured $123 million in commitments at first close. It is structured to attract commercial investment by offering risk protection and enhanced returns through a tiered blended financing model. By offering this blend of financing, it delivers a scalable model that helps solar companies expand into and grow within lower-income countries that are currently underserved or overlooked by traditional investors.

With BII’s support, H2R Amplify is expected to reach more than 50 million individuals, including 40 million gaining first-time access to clean energy products. It is also expected to mitigate over 3 million tonnes of CO₂e by displacing highly polluting fuels such as kerosene.

H2R Amplify is 2X Challenge-qualified, reflecting a strong commitment to advancing gender equality including through increased opportunities for women customers and employees in the off-grid solar sector. Acumen will further support this commitment through Gender Action Plans at portfolio companies and gender-focused technical assistance, to help improve gender inclusive practices and the collection of gender data to track progress.

This investment underscores BII’s commitment to addressing economic inequality and catalysing private sector growth in Africa’s most fragile and underserved regions which often struggle to attract commercial capital. This is further demonstrated through the Africa Resilience Investment Accelerator (ARIA), a platform created by BII to work with development partners to de-risk investments and unlock opportunities in fragile and conflict-affected countries.

Rachel Kyte, UK Special Representative for Climate said: “Being able to access reliable and affordable electricity transforms lives. The UK is working with African leaders, African entrepreneurs, and the energy and finance communities to realise the goal of universal access by 2030. With the support of the UK and other donors Acumen’s Fund will extend clean power to more than 50 million people – unlocking prosperity and driving forward the green energy transition across Africa.”

Chris Chijiutomi, MD and Head of Africa at BII, commented: “With nearly 600 million people in Africa still lacking access to energy, we’re focussed on investing in inclusive energy solutions, to close this gap. This partnership reflects BII’s commitment to backing investments in the most challenging markets, where our capital can have the greatest impact. We also recognise that women bear the disproportionate burden of energy poverty and so we’re pleased that H2R Amplify will seek to create economic opportunities for women through its off-grid solar investments.”

Jacqueline Novogratz, Founder and CEO of Acumen, added: “BII’s partnership reflects a shared commitment to solving energy poverty in the hardest-to-reach markets. By expanding access to clean energy for millions of households and businesses, this initiative holds the promise to provide resilience, agency and dignity, along with light and power. BII’s investment shows how public and private institutions can mobilise the right kind of capital to build markets that endure and unlock human potential.”

Over three days, four parallel South America focused events – Intersolar, ees, Power2Drive and Eletrotec+EM-Power, brought together 600 exhibitors, with over 3,000 professionals participating in their respective conferences and workshops. Amid the challenges facing the Brazilian and international photovoltaic market, the event was marked by innovation, the launch of products and services capable of connecting industry solutions, knowledge sharing and professional development, as well as strategic networking focused on partnerships and business opportunities.

Florian Wessendorf, Executive Director of Solar Promotion International, the international organizer of the event, commented: “The success of another edition of The smarter E South America demonstrates its importance for all aspects of the renewable energy industry. By offering a comprehensive program encompassing business, knowledge and technology, the event has become a strategic asset for professionals and companies committed to the energy transition. This is evident in the expansion of the trade show floor space, with ees South America, for example, expanding its footprint by almost 40%.” The Electrotec+EM-Power and Power2Drive South America fairs also saw booth space increases of 13% and 5%, respectively. Aiming to meet market growth and demand in the South and Northeast regions, the organizers are also holding the Intersolar Summit Brasil Sul this year in Porto Alegre, from October 28th to 29th, and the Intersolar Brasil Nordeste in Fortaleza, from April 28th to 29th, 2026, both focusing on solar energy.

ABSOLAR CEO Rodrigo Sauaia, emphasized that the photovoltaic sector’s evolution has been driven by a series of factors, such as the creation of a solid legal and regulatory framework, public and fiscal policies aligned with technology and societal demand, greater access to credit for project financing and advances in legal stability, commenting: “These achievements have benefited from ABSOLAR’s solid contribution to governments and industry players and allowed this emerging source to compete equally with established sources. Photovoltaic solar energy accounted for 81% of all renewable energy capacity added globally in 2024. In Brazil, the sector has created more than 1.8 million green jobs since 2012, and over R$270 billion has been invested in the country during this period.” According to Sauaia, the expansion of data centers, artificial intelligence, electromobility, green hydrogen and, especially, energy storage, should further expand the role of solar energy in the energy transition and decarbonization of economic activities.

Felipe Leme, technical manager at Jinko Solar, emphasized the importance of The smarter E South America for his company’s business. “Intersolar is the leading photovoltaic energy event in Latin America, a special opportunity to showcase our technology, showcase new products and highlight the advantages of our company. It’s an opportunity to connect not only with our current partners, such as developers and distributors, but also with integrators, to share a little more technical knowledge about the modules and batteries we’ve been showcasing here.”

Giulia Di Sipio, marketing manager for the Americas at Fox ESS, added: “Participating in Intersolar South America elevates our brand. This year, the booth was packed the entire time. Visitors have been very engaged and more interested in the topic, especially energy storage, which is our focus. We even displayed some real-life installed products at the booth so people could see them up close.”

Rafael Cunha, consultant for the Power2Drive South America conference and COO of Move, emphasized the robustness of the second edition of the fair and conference focused on electromobility, a rapidly expanding sector in Brazil, which already boasts over 14,000 charging stations. “Electric mobility is undoubtedly one of the most transformative topics of our time. In Brazil, we are still facing a growing market that demands caution, planning and, above all, quality information. In this context, the event plays a fundamental role by bringing together knowledge, international best practices, and the necessary discussions to enable us to grow in a healthy and sustainable manner. Throughout the fair’s history, we have seen an increase in the number of solar energy companies and many other charging solutions, in addition to the exhibition of electric cars. This generates and arouses a lot of curiosity among people. Move will definitely be back at The smarter E South America next year.”

João Cunha, consultant for the Eletrotec+EM-Power South America conference, highlighted the integration of the opening of the parallel conferences and also the increased number of paper submissions. “The quality of the material was excellent. This is essential for the training of the participants.”

Take the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5: it debuted with a sticker close to $62,000, but after 8,000 miles and less than 12 months on the road, at least one is selling for around $37,000.
An Audi e-Tron GT supercar that cost about $124,000 just three years ago is now offered at $52,000.
“If you’re sub-200 miles as your new starting range, they don’t hold their value very well,” he said.
But the federal credits go away at the end of month, which could cause electric car prices to inch upward.","The deals on used electric vehicles right now are shocking.

In 2017, a brand-new Nissan Leaf carried a price tag of about $35,000; today, that same car is yours for less than $6,500. This story repeats across the market. A Hyundai Kona that rolled off the showroom floor in 2021 for more than $43,000 has fallen below $16,000. Even newer models aren’t spared from this kind of depreciation. Take the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5: it debuted with a sticker close to $62,000, but after 8,000 miles and less than 12 months on the road, at least one is selling for around $37,000. The drops are even starker in the luxury segment. An Audi e-Tron GT supercar that cost about $124,000 just three years ago is now offered at $52,000. All of this is before government incentives that could bring costs even lower.

In August, plummeting prices sparked a 59 percent year-over-year surge in used EV sales, according to the research firm Cox Automotive. But the trend also begs the question whether even well-priced used EVs are a bad investment in an asset that will continue to depreciate at an alarming rate. Experts say that depends on the car, and on how the buyer would use it.

“I would buy one now,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. In August, used electric cars typically cost about $900 more than similar gas-powered ones, she added, which is the lowest gap on record. It’s a premium that is likely easily made up in gas savings and far lower maintenance costs because an EV won’t need, say, oil changes. “There’s a really strong value proposition to buying a used EV,” Valdez Streaty said.

But even a deep discount may not be enough for some people to shake off their earlier experiences, or perceptions, about electric cars, said John Helveston, an engineer and professor at George Washington University who studies technology adoption. As he put it, “If you bought a used Leaf even a few years ago, your experience was likely not great.”

That’s because until recently, batteries often deteriorated rapidly, which led to untenable driving ranges and often regrettable purchases. But Helveston said the landscape has changed dramatically, with a trend toward more efficient technologies and bigger packs that don’t degrade as fast. Still, most warranties only kick in once the capacity has fallen below 70 percent. So, Helveston said, the car’s original range remains critical and is one of the best indications of how quickly it might depreciate.

“If you’re sub-200 miles as your new starting range, they don’t hold their value very well,” he said. Conversely, that’s why Teslas — with ranges in the 300- or 400-mile realm — have historically depreciated considerably more slowly.

Although research by Helveston and others has shown that EVs depreciate much more quickly than gas-powered vehicles in the first two to three years, the good news is that after that the rates of decline converge and all cars lose value at a similar pace.

Incentives are another factor to consider. Right now an income-qualified buyer can get up to $4,000 federal tax credit on a used EV costing under $25,000 or as much as $7,500 for a new one. Many states, municipalities, and utilities offer rebates as well. But the federal credits go away at the end of month, which could cause electric car prices to inch upward. On the other hand, a loophole in those incentives led to a glut of leased electric vehicles — more than a million of which are set to hit the used market within the next few years, which could exert downward pressure on prices. It’s unclear how all those elements will interact.

“There’s no crystal ball on this,” said Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at the website CarGurus, via e-mail. “But given recent trends, we don’t expect to see the price volatility in used EVs that we’ve seen in the past.”

The bad news is that shopping for used EVs can be a bit of black box.

“With a gas car, between age and mileage you know a lot about that car. In the EV, people have no clue,” said Helveston. Battery health, he explained, is more linked to how the car was used than its age or mileage. If, for example, an owner only used super-fast Level 3 chargers, the battery would take much more of a beating than someone who primarily charged in their garage. Plus, even with recent improvements in battery tech, it’s still hard to predict exactly how a battery will perform five or 10 years out.

“There is this huge gap of information and because of that there’s a hesitance to buy it,” said Helveston. There are, however, some things people can do to mitigate those concerns. The first is to ask the dealer or seller to charge a car to 100 percent capacity before the test drive. Then compare the range on the dashboard to the manufacturer’s stated figure when the car was new. That should provide a rough approximation of remaining battery capacity. After a few years, the pack should retain 90 to 95 percent of its rating.

Valdez Streaty said that it’s not uncommon for dealers to either not have or not know how to access battery health information, though that process may become more standardized in coming years. In the meantime, she said, the used car auction that Cox operates — Manheim — rates batteries on a scale of 1 to 100. It’s the largest auction network in North America and is used by many dealers, which may be able to pass along any information they receive about the battery.

“Definitely you want something that’s going to be above 80 percent,” she said.

The other option is to ignore range or depreciation and buy the cheapest car possible and drive it into the ground.

The agreement marks a key milestone as Vanguard Renewables scales renewable natural gas (RNG) infrastructure to help states like Minnesota meet their clean energy goals.

CenterPoint Energy will purchase RNG produced at a new anaerobic digestion facility in Meeker County, co-located on a historic dairy and crop farm and integrated into CenterPoint's existing natural gas infrastructure. The system serves 930,000 customers across Minnesota.

Processing up to 290 tons of food and beverage waste daily, the facility will generate approximately 270,000 MMBtu of RNG annually. The project will create up to 100 construction jobs and 10 permanent operational roles, supporting local economic development and expanding access to regionally produced clean energy.

""This agreement with CenterPoint Energy reflects our shared commitment to deploying clean energy solutions that benefit the environment and local communities,"" said Michael O'Laughlin, CEO at Vanguard Renewables. ""It also represents a deeper investment in the Midwest, where we are bringing our circular model to life by harnessing the power of waste to build local infrastructure, support multigenerational farmers, and significantly reduce greenhouse gas emissions.""

RNG is rapidly emerging as one of the most practical and scalable tools for strengthening U.S. energy independence while transforming waste into a valuable resource. Vanguard Renewables produces RNG by processing unavoidable food waste from manufacturers and retailers with farm-based organics like manure through anaerobic digestion. The captured methane is upgraded to pipeline-quality gas, while byproducts are returned to the farm to support regenerative agriculture.

With over a decade of experience and more than a million tons of waste diverted from landfills, Vanguard Renewables is uniquely positioned to accelerate the deployment of regionally produced RNG. The company's national expansion strategy includes a pipeline of more than 30 projects slated for development by 2028.

""At CenterPoint Energy, we're excited to invest in innovative efforts that help lower emissions and advance Minnesota's energy future, such as Vanguard Renewables' new anaerobic digestion facility,"" said Brad Steber, Vice President, Minnesota Gas at CenterPoint Energy. ""By adding regionally produced RNG to our distribution system, we can provide our customers with a lower-carbon energy source that continues to deliver the safe, reliable service they expect. We look forward to helping grow the RNG industry, create clean energy from waste, and support our regional economies.""

This project is part of CenterPoint Energy's innovation plan, approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission under the state's Natural Gas Innovation Act. The plan includes a diverse set of pilot projects aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions and expanding decarbonization efforts for Minnesota customers.

The new facility will be Vanguard Renewables' third in the Midwest, joining an operational site in Eden and another under construction in River Falls, both in Wisconsin.

According to the “2025 North America Virtual Power Plant Market Report,” virtual power plants reached 37.5 GW of behind-the-meter flexible capacity over the past year. Total capacity grew 13.7 percent last year, while the number of company deployments, unique offtakers, and market and utility programs monetized jumped more than 33 percent.

“Utility program caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie, said.

Also, the report said that the share of VPP wholesale market capacity from residential customers increased to 10.2 percent from 8.8 percent in 2024. California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are the leading states, representing 37 percent of VPP deployments. In addition, the PJM and ERCOT regions have the greatest utility commitments to data center capacity and the most disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“While data centers are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

The top twenty-five VPP offtakers procured over 100 MW each this year, while over half of all offtakers increased the number of deployments under them by at least 30 percent, year-over-year. Also, an independent distributed power producer business model has emerged.

“This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third party-owned resources,” Hertz-Shargel said. “Meanwhile, there is broad consensus among experienced wholesale market participants that FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and will not have a significant impact on market access.”",https://dailyenergyinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/shutterstock_1710160621.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 08:59:50.235467

Doing so will help create good American jobs while ensuring our manufacturers have reliable access to these important materials.”

The project’s technical approach is multifaceted, and includes a working group of experts from government, including the Air Force Research Lab, industry, including Exothermics, Kratos SRE and Materials Research & Design (MR&D), and academia to pursue technology advancements to scale initiatives, such as solid-state ceramic batteries, as well as to onshore and scale technologies associated with carbon fiber, a critical pre-cursor material for defense-related protection systems often comprised of ceramic matrix composites (CMCs) that are in severely limited supply within the United States.

“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said.
Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report their votes to state regulators.
Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted.
Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility.","The organization that manages the electric grid for all or part of 13 states, including Maryland, has moved too slowly in response to skyrocketing energy demand and consumers are paying for it, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro said Monday.

Speaking at a conference of energy industry leaders and regulators in Philadelphia, Shapiro said PJM Interconnection must make changes, including giving states a bigger role in its governance, or the commonwealth could leave the consortium.

“We need to be thinking about consumers and their costs, something that PJM, I think, doesn’t really spend a whole lot of time focused on,” Shapiro told reporters Monday after delivering opening remarks at the event.

He said governors from each PJM state share concerns about the Valley Forge-based organization’s backlog of new energy projects awaiting approval while peak energy consumption is expected to increase by 20% in the next decade, according to PJM’s forecast. Much of that demand will come from data centers that house the computing power for artificial intelligence.

“We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects. We’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” Shapiro said.

Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin, who spoke via video, said overhauling the state’s power policy was among his first calls for action after taking office in 2022. Youngkin, a Republican, said his administration predicted demand would grow faster than PJM’s forecast.

“Indeed, instead of unlocking investment and fast tracking critical projects, PJM has instead been responsible for bottlenecks and delays that crush jobs, drive up utility bills and leave families and businesses hurting,” he said. “This is a crisis of not having enough power, and it is a crisis in confidence.”

Youngkin said Virginia lawmakers are working on legislation that would allow the state to reassess whether its utilities should remain part of PJM.

“This doesn’t mean that we are walking away, but it does mean that collectively, we recognize we need to represent and protect our ratepayers, and that means sending a clear, unified signal that PJM must modernize,” he said.

PJM was founded in Philadelphia nearly a century ago when three electricity utilities connected their independent grids to share resources and improve reliability. With more than 1,000 stakeholder members, it now ensures the flow of power to utilities in all or parts of 13 states from New Jersey to Illinois and the New York border to North Carolina.

It is overseen by a board of governors through a consensus-based issue resolution process in which member organizations and stakeholders have weighted votes on issues that will go before the board. These include state consumer advocate organizations, like Pennsylvania’s Public Utilities Commission, but the states themselves have no direct input.

The board’s decisions are ultimately subject to approval by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

While PJM’s stakeholder process and meetings are open to the public with agendas and minutes posted on its website, members of the public are required to register for an account to watch meetings virtually. And while the outcome of votes is public, critics have compared it to a black box, because how stakeholders vote on questions is secret.

Lawmakers in several states have proposed laws requiring PJM members to report their votes to state regulators. They include a bill introduced by Pennsylvania state Rep. Chris Rabb (D-Philadelphia), which passed in the House in July and awaits action in the Senate.

“Utility companies operating in our regional power grid that determine the electric bills, environmental and public health of 65 million people should never be allowed to vote in secret,” Rabb said. “Such decisions must be publicly disclosed. End of story.”

PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is set to step down at the end of this year, said he’s proud of the reliability that PJM has provided through a series of unusual events during his tenure, including record peak demands, a pandemic, geomagnetic storms and the collapse of the Francis Scott Key Bridge in Baltimore, which threatened a major transmission line.

Asthana said criticism of PJM’s interconnection queue, in which 63,000 megawatts of power projects await review for permission to connect to the grid, is not warranted.

“There’s a lot of mythology and a lot of things that are said about our interconnection queue,” he said, noting that number is down from 200,000 megawatts when the organization implemented reforms in 2023. PJM also notes that it has cleared tens of thousands of megawatts worth of projects that have failed to come online for reasons outside of its control, including site acquisition, permitting and supply chain problems.

PJM has also worked proactively with members to prioritize important projects, such as restarting Constellation Energy’s former Three Mile Island nuclear power plant, now renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center, and redeveloping Homer City, one of the nation’s largest coal power plants, into the nation’s largest natural gas-burning power stations. Both projects will power data centers.

Experts who spoke during panels at the conference agreed with Shapiro, Youngkin and New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy, who also spoke via video, that PJM is not serving consumers well.

“You’ve got 67 million people who are very concerned, and again, consumers are called voters, and that makes the politicians concerned,” said former FERC Chairman Mark Christie. Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements were recommended by a bipartisan panel of PJM-state governors to fill vacancies on the board, but neither was ultimately nominated.

“PJM should be reimagined in the governance sense,” Christie said, adding that he wouldn’t interfere with the technical aspects of operating the grid. “The policymaking things that PJM does in their political policy, if it’s going to be a regional government for the grid, people who are elected will have a much bigger role in that.”

Vincent Duane, a former senior vice president and general counsel at PJM, said changes need to go deeper than simply giving elected officials a bigger role.

Maryland Democratic leaders tout electricity refund, keep grid operator in the hot seat

“​​I’m going to be blunt and unpopular when I say that PJM has become ungovernable,” Duane said “Adding seats to an already crowded banquet table with 1,000 parliamentarians with vastly different interests, I think, is going to ultimately leave states feeling disappointed with the outcomes.”

What’s missing is more purposeful and deliberate decision making from a strong executive branch in the organization that is accountable to state utility regulators, he said.

Duane later added that as general counsel, PJM board members often asked him to whom they had a fiduciary responsibility. He said he had trouble answering the question. To say the responsibility was to the marketplace or membership was unsatisfactory.

“Until we can get a good answer to that question, it’s premature to start talking about process and voting structures,” Duane said.

Maryland State Del. Lorig Charkoudian (D-Montgomery) said the question of fiduciary duty is an important one for the success of policies that elected officials create.

“The vast majority of the stakeholders know who their fiduciary duty is to, and it is to their shareholders,” Charkoudian said, adding that for ratepayers that amounts to a wealth transfer to the market participants who are writing the rules.

“You could go example after example after example, where that is the case,” she said. “And that is why it’s untenable to continue at this moment with this governance structure.”",https://marylandmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/IMG_5474-1024x768-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 08:00:10.606394

It can be life-threatening and lead to hundreds or even thousands of dollars in losses.

Unfortunately, research out of Texas A&M discovered that the country is shockingly vulnerable to grid outages — and some states are more at risk than others.

What's happening?

EnergySage spotlighted Texas A&M's report in a recent article examining how installing solar panels with battery storage can give homeowners a leg up during grid outages on households without a backup power source or those dependent on gasoline generators.

As an independent, objective expert in the nuances of the rooftop solar industry, EnergySage offers free tools for consumers to obtain easy-to-compare solar installation quotes.

Texas A&M's findings reveal why an increasing number of homeowners are preparing for weather-induced grid outages with the assistance of EnergySage.

The university reported that power outages have risen by 20% since 2019. Texas, California, and Louisiana, respectively, accounted for the most major power outages between 2000 and 2023, according to a Power System Vulnerability Index created using over 179 million data points.

Why is this important?

As EnergySage explains, power outages aren't just dangerous for people who rely on medical equipment needing refrigeration or electricity. During an outage, the average family loses $200 in groceries because of spoilage, and they may need to shell out upward of $25,000 on hotel stays, damaged electronics, and other repairs in the event of water-related property damage.

Dr. Ali Mostafavi, the director of the Urban Resilience AI Lab that used machine learning to develop the vulnerability index, said in the Texas A&M release that the grid failure situation was more dire than they originally suspected.

""We knew that the state of power system vulnerability nationwide is exacerbating. But the magnitude of that was shocking, and greater than we hypothesized,"" Dr. Mostafavi said.

What can be done about this?

Installing solar panels and pairing them with battery storage won't only boost your family's ability to manage whatever climate-related event comes its way.

Along with upgrading to energy-efficient technology, solar and battery storage will also help you significantly reduce your energy bills while slashing dirty fuel-produced heat-trapping pollution responsible for warming the climate and subsequently supercharging extreme weather.

Whether used for everyday power or as a backup energy source, solar panels also improve comfort and peace of mind because they're quieter than gas generators and don't introduce the risk of carbon monoxide poisoning.

On average, EnergySage's free services save homeowners $10,000 on solar installations. Now is also the time to connect with EnergySage to maximize your savings, as solar projects must be underway by Dec. 31 to qualify for federal tax incentives. Its state-by-state mapping tool can help you discover which area-specific savings may also be available.

Without interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar.” The ‘Reshoring Solar Module Manufacturing to Europe’ report offers a cost gap analysis and policy impact simulation, which finds that producing a solar module in Europe with EU-made solar cells costs around 10.3 €ct/Wp more than producing the same module in China.
The report recommends: Establishing an EU-level output-based support scheme for solar manufacturing, combining grants, loans, and de-risking instruments to cover both CAPEX and OPEX.
It is now up to the Member States to implement these provisions as of 2026.
But its success depends on how Member States implement the non-price criteria in renewable energy auctions.","Solar installations that support supply chain resilience can be competitive with imports from China with the right policy support, a new report from SolarPower Europe and Fraunhofer ISE reveals.

Walburga Hemetsberger, CEO at SolarPower Europe (she/her) said: “This new report underlines that, with the right policies, Europe can competitively deliver 30 GW of solar manufacturing by 2030, creating thousands of local jobs, and building a resilient, innovative solar supply chain that keeps economic value here at home. To meet 2030 goal, the EU and Member States must act swiftly. Without interventions, Europe risks losing remaining industrial and technological capabilities in solar.”

The ‘Reshoring Solar Module Manufacturing to Europe’ report offers a cost gap analysis and policy impact simulation, which finds that producing a solar module in Europe with EU-made solar cells costs around 10.3 €ct/Wp more than producing the same module in China.

The gap stems from higher costs in equipment (+40%), building and facility (+110%), labour (+280%), and material costs (+50%). As a result, such utility solar installations cost about 60.8 €ct/Wp compared to 50.0 €ct/Wp for a Chinese system, translating into a Levelised Cost of Electricity (LCOE) that is 14.5% higher for European-made modules. This gives a hopeful indication that already, EU-made products fall within the 15% limit of additional costs under Net-Zero Industry Act auction rules.

However, the report notes a significant cost difference (2.2 to 5.8 €ct/Wp) between NZIA compliant EU-made and NZIA compliant non-EU-made modules. The Net-Zero Industry Act’s resilience criteria can therefore diversify module supply chains and boost imports from elsewhere in the world, but without more policy measures, reshoring EU production may not be achieved.

Crucially, the report reveals that the cost gap between European made and Chinese imported solar can be further reduced to below 10% with the right mix of policies, such as combining CAPEX and OPEX schemes, both for solar manufacturers and project developers, with output-based support (e.g. successful models have existed in the US (IRA) and India (PLI schemes), and assuming solar factories reaching 3-5 GW capacity.

The report notes that industry support needs range from €1.4 – €5.2 billion annually to reach the 30 GW target for European solar manufacturing for 2030, with up to 39% of costs being recovered through macroeconomic benefits (up to 2,700 jobs and €66.4 million in annual tax and social revenues per GWp/a).

The report recommends:

Establishing an EU-level output-based support scheme for solar manufacturing, combining grants, loans, and de-risking instruments to cover both CAPEX and OPEX.

Implementing NZIA policy schemes across Member States, including “Made-in-EU” bonus points in rooftop support and public procurement programmes.

Notes

The Net-Zero Industry Act: The European Commission adopted the Net-Zero Industry Act (NZIA) Secondary Legislation on 23 May 2025, establishing the rules for Member States on how to incorporate non-price criteria into renewable energy auctions. This follows the adoption of the Net-Zero Industry Act in June 2024. It is now up to the Member States to implement these provisions as of 2026. The NZIA offers a historic opportunity to reshore clean tech manufacturing in Europe. But its success depends on how Member States implement the non-price criteria in renewable energy auctions. As per the law, Member States are to apply non-price criteria (NPCs) to at least 30% of the auctioned volume per year, or 6 GW annually. These NPCs should account for 15% to 30% of the overall evaluation criteria, with some flexibility allowed in cases where associated costs exceed 15%. Resilience under Art. 26 NZIA is defined as not from the dominant source of supply.",https://strategicenergy.eu/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/TRINASOLAR.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 08:00:15.529219

Playing a key role in the stability of the European continent, existing interconnectors need to be secured from sabotage, and new projects need to be planned and deployed, especially in regions with the highest risk of technical or political incidents, such as the Iberian Peninsula and Eastern Europe.

Three blackouts in the EU were avoided or managed thanks to European interconnectors in the last 5 years.

Ukraine and Moldova would’ve faced severe power loss due to Russia’s aggression, if not for cross-border electricity exchange with EU neighbours.

55% of Europe’s power system has limited electricity import options, increasing the risk of blackouts. Spain, Ireland and Finland are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents.

Nine recent cases of Baltic Sea infrastructure sabotage show the need to protect Europe’s interconnection infrastructure.

Interconnectors help stabilise or restart grids after faults

Several examples show how interconnectors helped stabilise grids during incidents that could have otherwise had much more severe consequences.

European interconnectors made recent grid stress events less severe

While European power systems maintain excellent reliability standards, multiple events in the past have put grids to a test. In those moments, interconnectors played a key role in stabilising the power systems and preventing widespread power cuts, or restarting the system if a blackout did occur.

Prevention: interconnectors helped avoid two potential blackouts in Poland

On 17th May 2021, a human error led to the malfunction of a high-voltage substation in Poland – Rogowiec. The substation feeds power from the largest power plant in the country – Bełchatów, into the Polish grid. The incident suddenly disconnected around 3.5 GW of capacity from the system and led to a 158 mHz frequency drop, just shy of the 200 mHz buffer that would put the system in an emergency state.

The Continental Europe Synchronous Area absorbed the frequency deviation by ramping up flows from neighbouring countries. These flows instantly reached 4.5 GW – 2.3 GW more than allowed. Significant load appeared on power lines in Western Poland – 5 lines were operating at above 100% capacity, two of them above 120%, posing a risk of overloading. These violations were resolved by the Polish and German transmission system operators (TSOs), who limited flows and restored the frequency to nominal value within 30 minutes.

Immediately after the incident, the Polish TSO requested emergency support from neighbouring countries to rebuild capacity reserves. Interconnectors were initially essential to prevent further frequency drops, the tripping of generators and cascading failures. Then they became key to rebuilding the system’s reserves while the grid malfunction was being removed.

Another stressful event happened in Poland on 22nd June 2020, when heavy rainfall damaged coal supply lines. This, along with several other random failures, led to a record unplanned generation loss of 5.7 GW, equivalent to a quarter of that day’s peak demand. The event wasn’t as sudden as the one in 2021, and the frequency was not disrupted, so the incident didn’t require a formal investigation.

However, the Polish TSO had to request emergency imports from neighbouring countries and deployed almost all coal plants available in “cold reserve” – plants used only in emergency situations. If interconnectors hadn’t provided 3 GW of power, a blackout would have been a real possibility. Only around 2 GW of coal and pumped-storage capacity was left in the system, meaning 1 GW of demand could not have been balanced, leading to voluntary or forced reductions.

Stability: interconnectors filled France’s generation gap throughout 2022

France has recently faced major generation gaps due to nuclear plant outages. Historically, the country was the biggest exporter of electricity in Europe. However, in 2022, the total electricity generation dropped from 550 TWh in 2021 to 468 TWh – a decrease of 15%. Flows switched from net exports of 42 TWh in 2021 to net imports of 17 TWh. Peak imports reached 11 GW – 75% of the total interconnector capacity. In certain moments, imports covered up to 17% of the country’s peak electricity demand. While French nuclear has rebounded since 2022, the fleet still experiences outages, especially during heatwaves. In those moments interconnectors continue filling the capacity gaps, reducing price spikes as well.

Recovery: interconnectors restarted the Iberian grid after the blackout

On 28th April 2025, Spain and Portugal were hit by the largest blackout in Europe’s modern history, leaving around 60 million people without electricity for hours. Multiple causes led to the incident, and a final report by the European Network of Transmission System Operators for Electricity (ENTSO-E) is due in October 2025.

What is already certain is that, after the blackout, interconnectors were essential in restarting the Iberian power system. Just 10 minutes after the blackout, the first France-Spain power line was reenergised, soon joined by the interconnector with Morocco and other connections with France. With the help of hydro and gas units, a full restoration was achieved in Spain around 4 AM on 29th April, around 16 hours after the incident.

The Iberian Peninsula is more vulnerable to blackout risks than other European countries due to limited connections to the continental grid. Following the blackout, Spain and Portugal urged the EU to back new interconnector projects, citing stronger links as essential to preventing future disruptions.

The 2021 blackout in Texas offers a stark warning of what can happen if connectivity isn’t sufficient. In February 2021, severe cold weather left more than 4.5 million people without power for several days, causing 250 deaths. With peak demand above 70 GW but just 1 GW of interconnection, the state was unable to stabilise frequency deviations or replace the 34 GW of missing capacity through imports, leading to a quick collapse. Restarting the system after the blackout was difficult as well – with fossil gas generators rendered unavailable, interconnectors could not be used to resynchronise the system, as was the case after the Iberian blackout. This is why exploring additional interconnection was one of the recommendations of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission that analysed the blackout.

This ratio varies from 12% in Poland, to almost 200% in Latvia – a country that has relatively small domestic demand, but supports electricity transits between Central Europe, the Baltics and the Nordics. However, there is no guarantee that imports from neighbours will be available instantly and at full capacity. That is why diversification is key: the more neighbours a country is connected to, the higher the chance that cross-border support can be provided on short notice.

Summing the peak electricity demand of countries with three or fewer import directions and an import potential ratio of 25% or lower, up to 55% of Europe’s power system can be considered at risk due to limited emergency import options. Three countries – Spain, Ireland and Finland – are particularly exposed, with very little support available from neighbours in case of grid incidents.

Interconnectors provide security in times of uncertainty and war

Being essential for Europe during Russia’s aggression, interconnectors have also become targets of sabotage.

Interconnectors helped when power systems were attacked

Interconnectors have a key role in stabilising power systems after a fault. But the past three years have also highlighted their other security feature – delivering stable electricity even during war.

Keeping the grid alive during Russia’s attacks on Ukraine’s infrastructure

Before 2022, Ukraine’s power system was connected to the Russian and Belarusian ones. On the day of the full-scale invasion, Ukraine requested an emergency synchronisation with the European power system. This was achieved in a record time of just 3 weeks. This proved to be a critical security move since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine included multiple attacks on energy infrastructure.

By May 2024, about 70% of Ukraine’s thermal generation capacity was either occupied or damaged, compromising the country’s ability to meet domestic demand. Fortunately, up to 2.4 GW of import capacity was available for Ukraine – equivalent to 20% of the peak demand – including emergency response schemes by neighbouring grid operators.

Thanks to interconnectors, during the most severe attacks on Ukraine’s energy infrastructure in 2024, Ukraine imported over 800 GWh of electricity a month, though a capacity gap still remained, leading to local power cuts. Imports totalled 4 TWh in 2024, a striking shift from Ukraine’s historical role as an exporter of around 2 TWh of electricity a year in pre-war 2020 and 2021.

Stabilising Moldova ahead of parliamentary elections

Similarly to Ukraine, Moldova’s power system used to be synchronised with Russia and Belarus. In 2022 it also went through an emergency synchronisation process, using interconnectors with Romania – which again proved to be an effective security move. On 31st December 2024, Russia stopped supplying gas to Moldova’s largest power plant, in an effort to destabilise the country ahead of parliamentary elections. Moldova was forced to source up to 62% of electricity demand from Romania.

Fortunately, thanks to grid investments, Moldova’s energy security will soon be strengthened. A new interconnection, Vulcanesti – Chisinau, is due to be deployed by the end of 2025, providing up to 80-90% of Moldova’s peak demand in emergency situations and ensuring independence from Russia. Two other interconnectors are being constructed, Balti-Suceava, due in 2027, and Straseni-Gutinas, due in 2030, allowing for the full integration of Moldova with the European power grid.

Shielding Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia from Russia’s energy blackmail

Once reliant on Russia’s power grid, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia were fully synchronised with Europe’s grid and decoupled from Russia on 9th February 2025. The Baltic Synchronisation was one of the EU’s biggest grid projects, receiving 1.2 billion EUR of support from the Connecting Europe Facility. The decoupling of Baltic States from Russia was made possible thanks to new cross-border connections between Poland and Lithuania (LitPol Link), and between Estonia and Latvia, as well as existing connections between Estonia and Finland (EstLink and EstLink 2), and Lithuania and Sweden (NordBalt). To further strengthen the energy security of the Baltics, a new interconnector between Lithuania and Poland is being planned: HarmonyLink, due in 2030.

Infrastructure sabotage is now a key threat

Because interconnections play a key role in Europe’s security, they’ve recently come under attack. Since 2022, nine incidents of infrastructure damage have been recorded in the Baltic Sea.

These include five cases of communication cable disruption, and damage done to the Nord Stream and Balticconnector gas pipelines and the EstLink 2 power cable. The damage done to the EstLink 2 interconnector by a Russian shadow-fleet vessel decreased Estonia’s electricity import capacity by 27% just two months before the full decoupling of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania from the Russian power grid.

Baltic Sea energy infrastructure is not the only one at risk. In April 2025, Russian hackers disrupted the operations of a Norwegian hydropower facility. In September 2025, over the span of just two days, a train carrying liquified gas exploded near Vilnius, high-voltage lines were disrupted in an arson attack, causing a partial blackout in Berlin, 19 Russian drones breached Polish airspace and Israel carried out attacks in Qatar – one of Europe’s key gas suppliers.

Since the start of the war in 2022, Russia-attributed hackers have targeted energy companies all across Europe, and globally, the frequency of cyberattacks on energy utilities has doubled since 2021, according to the International Energy Agency.

Energy supply is critical not only for civilian life, but also for military response, and energy infrastructure remains a major target, as shown by examples from Ukraine and Russia’s hybrid warfare campaign in Europe.

Europe’s interconnectors need boosting and securing

Interconnectors are key in guaranteeing grid resilience, energy security and, more broadly, Europe’s safety. To continue providing stability against grid failures or geopolitical threats, two sets of actions need to be taken: the expansion of interconnector capacity and better security of existing infrastructure.

The upcoming European Grid Package presents a timely opportunity to strengthen political commitment around both areas.

European interconnection capacity is expected to almost double between 2024 and 2040, or even triple if all currently planned projects were delivered on time. Priority should be given to areas with limited connectivity and high exposure to potential disruption – such as the Iberian Peninsula, Eastern Europe and Finland.

However, strategic investments will only happen with strong political commitment and cross-border collaboration. Worryingly, Poland, the EU’s fifth largest electricity market, has almost no interconnection expansion projects planned, despite recent near-blackout incidents and a high risk of sabotage. Yet, the country could benefit from new projects in the region: the Baltic Energy Hub and an Eastern European transmission highway that would secure Eastern Europe from Russia, and also enable the full integration of Ukraine, Moldova and the Western Balkans with the European power system.

Existing infrastructure needs to be secured as well. The European Commission recently proposed an Action Plan on Cable Security and a Hybrid Toolbox addressing hybrid warfare. Denmark is researching underwater drones that could capture and immobilise hostile underwater vehicles, NATO established a Critical Undersea Infrastructure teams in the UK and Belgium, and already deployed at least 20 drone boats in the Baltic Sea. But these reactive measures must be coupled with coordinated planning and permitting to accelerate grid investments – as more interconnections, lines and substations make the system more resilient if one of the elements is attacked.

In the case of cross-border and offshore projects, this requires more active steering by the European Commission, facilitating regional collaboration and mediating between governments and financing institutions such as EIB and EBRD. Grid enhancing technologies, including digital solutions, should be incentivised in EU funding, enhancing monitoring, maintenance and recovery of grid assets. Supply chain security is essential as well, with a priority for “made in Europe” components and digital systems.

Finally, in both grid expansion and protection, collaboration and coordination is critical, given the group of stakeholders ranges from grid operators, through the EU, governments and financial institutions, to NATO and different branches of the military.",https://ember-energy.org/app/uploads/2024/11/5-03-Transmission-power-lines-Unknown.png,N,,2025-09-24 11:03:57.888280

In a time of global economic uncertainty – you can be certain about Australia.","Thank you all for being here this afternoon.

I thank our hosts Macquarie, a great Australian success story.

Among many distinguished guests, I acknowledge our Ambassador, Kevin Rudd and Australia’s Consul-General to New York, Heather Ridout.

When I had the privilege of serving in Kevin’s Cabinet as Minister for Infrastructure, we asked Heather to join the board of a new body we were establishing: Infrastructure Australia.

Its mission was to look beyond the short-term thinking that can sometimes capture planning and investment – and identify true, nation-building projects that would drive growth and boost productivity in our cities and regions.

The outstanding quality that Heather brought to that role is the same one she brings to her work here in the United States: a grasp of Australia’s true potential and ways to unlock it.

This is what today is all about.

For decades, the United States of America has been the proving ground for Australian entrepreneurs, innovators and creatives.

In tech, in finance, in medical research and the arts, Australians have taken the view that if you can make it here, you can make it anywhere.

And because this country’s founding spirit owes so much to people chasing their dreams and believing in themselves, because Americans are so generous with their enthusiasm, their mentoring and their support network, and because Americans know a game-changing idea or a world-leading product when they see one, so many Australians have achieved extraordinary success here.

Our cultures complement each other - both our similarities and our points of difference.

Our people have a knack for bringing out the best in each other.

Which is why skills and ideas and insights travel back the other way.

In tech and start-ups, in agriculture and medical science and resources.

And investment flows both ways as well.

Some of the biggest names in America, are expanding their footprint in Australia.

Google, Microsoft and Amazon in digital infrastructure, cloud computing and quantum.

Pfizer, Baxter Healthcare and Cardinal Health in medical manufacturing.

Chevron, Exxon.

Lockheed Martin and Anduril.

Along with your biggest investment and private equity funds.

All of this is a success story, worth celebrating.

All of it proves the enduring and evolving strength of our two countries’ economic co-operation.

I’m here today because I want us to add a new dimension to our partnership.

American capital and Australian manufacturing are a natural fit.

And if we move now, we can make them an unbeatable combination.

We can put our investment partnership at the centre of a defining global opportunity.

The world’s shift to clean energy represents the biggest change since the industrial revolution.

We are looking at ever increasing global demand for clean energy and the technology that generates and stores it.

And if you started with a blank piece of paper and wrote down every asset and resource you would need to thrive in that economic environment, at the end of it, you would hold in your hand a list of Australia’s strengths.

A mining sector that leads the world in innovation.

Along with the iron ore, copper and coal that have built and powered our region’s prosperity.

We are also the world’s largest producer of lithium.

We have the largest global reserves of zinc and nickel.

And we are home to some of most valuable deposits of critical minerals on earth, just about the whole periodic table.

Including the light and heavy rare earths essential for high-tech manufacturing and defence, the digital economy, artificial intelligence, data centres and clean energy.

And I should note – these are just the deposits that we know about.

The experts at GeoScience Australia are still mapping our continent, they classify 80 per cent of it, under-explored.

Our resources are more than what’s our under our soil or seabed.

Australia is the sunniest continent on earth.

And we have the space that makes it possible to co-locate extraction, refining, processing and manufacturing.

To build an entire, secure supply chain, end to end - and power it with clean energy.

And as energy and emissions and transport become more significant factors in the cost of production, compared to the cost of labour.

And as the alignment of economic and security interests becomes increasingly important.

Our Government sees this as an opportunity to create a new source of comparative advantage.

To make more things in Australia.

High-skill workers, making high-value products – with lower production costs and greater certainty.

Australia has the skilled and productive workforce to make this happen.

A world-class university and training sector, with a proud track record of innovation and research.

We have the capability – and we have the capital.

Our system of universal compulsory superannuation, means Australian funds continue to grow and invest.

Over the next decade, total investment in the US from Australian pension funds is expected to more than double.

That will mean more than $1 trillion invested here in the decade to 2035.

These same funds are investing in the drivers of growth in the Australian economy: infrastructure, energy, start-ups and private capital.

Investing in Australia is about what we have – and where we are.

Because when you build your business in Australia, you are building a platform and a presence in the fastest-growing region of the world in human history.

Our relationship with our region runs deeper than proximity.

We are more than neighbours, we’re partners.

Our bilateral – and multilateral – trade agreements give us priority access to every market in our region.

We are deepening our business to business engagement with India and South East Asia, on track to be the third and fourth largest economies in the world by the 2040s.

And Australia’s multicultural society, our diaspora communities and our status as an education and tourism destination means we are able to call on bonds of family and friendship with every nation in our region, indeed the world.

Australia knows the benefits of free and fair trade.

And our economy is geared for international investment, and for decades has been shaped by it.

We welcome it, we value it.

We know the vital role it plays in our national growth and success.

This why, in our first term, our Government streamlined the investment review process.

Making it work better – and faster - for parties that Australia knows and trusts.

We’re building on this with a new focus on clearing away unnecessary barriers to major projects – and accelerating approvals.

So that investment flows into generating new energy, exploring new opportunities and creating good jobs.

Every investment decision begins with a review of the fundamentals.

And Australia’s fundamentals are as good as anywhere in the world.

Low inflation, low unemployment, accelerating growth.

A Triple-A credit rating from all three agencies.

And we sit close to the top of every global ladder for the integrity of our legal and financial system, the security of transactions, timeliness of payments, smart use of technology.

Now, any Australian trade official can give you a compelling and detailed presentation on the strength of those fundamentals.

I’m here as Australia’s Prime Minister to make it clear that our Government isn’t resting on this record.

We’re not waiting for the world to come to us.

We’re going above and beyond.

Our Future Made in Australia Agenda invests in the full life-cycle of projects: upfront capital, innovation and research – and production incentives.

Including new production tax credits for processed critical minerals and renewable hydrogen.

Our plan facilitates new investment in battery and solar supply chains.

And in innovation, from green iron, aluminium and steel to low carbon fuels.

This fits together with our $15 billion National Reconstruction Fund.

Providing loans, guarantees and equity to help commercial projects, including value-adding in resources and renewable energy technology.

All of this is reinforced by our commitment to reducing emissions.

Our targets for 2030 and 2035 have us on track for Net Zero by 2050.

This provides certainty for business to build for the long term.

Put simply, our Government’s plan for a Future Made in Australia, is a ready-made opportunity for investment from America.

And we want to give you every chance to see that for yourself.

Which is why in November, our Minister for Energy, Chris Bowen and our Minister for Industry, Tim Ayres will be hosting an Investor Forum in Australia.

We see that as a focal point for working through the detail and getting deals done.

With targeted and tailored action - from fast-tracking approvals to direct incentives.

As I’ve made clear today, Australia is blessed with an abundance of natural resources.

For investors, we are also home to the most valuable of resources: trust.

Trust that has been earned and built, over generations.

You know who we are – and what doing business with us means.

You can trust in our laws and governance.

You can invest with confidence in our institutions.

The company added the third manufacturing line to enhance its ability to meet the U.S.’s growing demand for domestically produced solar products.
The Greenville manufacturing facility’s first phase commenced operations in April this year.
“The Greenville manufacturing hub is central to Boviet Solar’s U.S. growth strategy,” said Sienna Cen, President at Boviet Solar USA.
The U.S. added 8.6 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity in the first quarter of 2025, bringing the total to 51 GW.","Vietnam-based solar cell and module manufacturer, Boviet Solar Technology, has added a third module manufacturing production line at its facility in Greenville, North Carolina, in the U.S., expanding its production capacity from 2 GW to 3 GW.

The company added the third manufacturing line to enhance its ability to meet the U.S.’s growing demand for domestically produced solar products.

The Greenville manufacturing facility’s first phase commenced operations in April this year. It produces Boviet Solar’s Gamma series monofacial and Vega series bifacial solar modules. The company had announced its investment of $249 million for the facility in April last year.

In August, Boviet Solar completed the exterior construction of its Greenville facility’s second phase, which is expected to begin mass production in 2026.

“The Greenville manufacturing hub is central to Boviet Solar’s U.S. growth strategy,” said Sienna Cen, President at Boviet Solar USA. “By investing in both photovoltaic cell and module production in North Carolina, we are strengthening supply chain resilience, delivering reliable ‘Made-in-USA’ solar products, and creating lasting economic impact for the region.

The company said the Greenville facilities represent over $400 million in total capital.

Founded in 2013 in Vietnam, Boviet Solar is a subsidiary company of Boway Alloy. The company specializes in mono PERC, TOPCon cells, and various monofacial and bifacial module series. It has offices in the U.S., Germany, and China.

The U.S. added 8.6 GW of solar module manufacturing capacity in the first quarter of 2025, bringing the total to 51 GW. Further expansions could raise capacity to 88 GW by year-end, though many announced projects are not yet under construction.

In April this year, the U.S. Department of Commerce announced its final determinations in the anti-dumping and countervailing duty investigations concerning crystalline silicon photovoltaic cells and modules imported from Cambodia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Vietnam.

These findings confirmed that exporters from the four nations sold solar cells in the U.S. at less than fair value and that producers in these countries benefited from subsidies, some of which originated from a third country—China.",https://d382rz2cea0pah.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/Standard-Mercom-89.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 12:05:55.226698

Experts expect the new-to-market Forester Hybrid and Crosstrek Hybrid to be even more impactful for the market.
""The Forester Hybrid and new Crosstrek Hybrid target a growing market of compact SUV shoppers seeking electrification in their vehicles now — and more in the future.
In addition to Solterra, Forester Hybrid and Crosstrek Hybrid, 2026 will welcome Trailseeker and Uncharted battery-powered SUVs to the Subaru lineup.
It's also the quickest Subaru we've ever sold in the U.S."" The Subaru Solterra and Forester Hybrid are on sale now.","After years of being behind the competition, Subaru's North American business is getting a fuel efficiency injection, buoyed by a number of hybrids and battery-powered vehicles it has coming to market this year and next.

The addition of the vehicles to the company's portfolio is notably one of the last remaining areas of its business that Subaru is greening. ""Subaru owners have always been eco-conscious and look for adventure outdoors with a deep respect for nature and the environment. Following our owners, in 2004, Subaru opened the first zero-landfill automotive manufacturing facility in the U.S., in Lafayette, Indiana,"" Alan Bethke, senior vice president of marketing at Subaru of America, Inc., exclusively told Newsweek.

Bethke noted several milestones in the company's sustainability endeavors: ""In 2015, we launched Subaru Loves the Earth and worked with our partners at the National Parks Foundation to reduce the amount of waste sent to landfills across our national parks. Most recently, we partnered with the Arbor Day Foundation to donate 100,000 trees in 2025, bringing the total number of trees donated by Subaru and our retailers to more than 1.1 million.""

The greening efforts don't stop there. ""We are consistently improving our environmental impact in manufacturing, vehicle efficiency, sustainability, and preservation of natural spaces. We've also publicly dedicated ourselves to more electrification in our lineup, which includes hybrids and EVs. We are proud of the progress we've made so far, but Subaru and our retailers are always looking for ways to continue our Subaru Love Promise,"" he said.

Subaru debuted its first battery-electric vehicle, the Solterra crossover, in 2021 at the LA Auto Show. Just over 31,000 examples of the model, which shares most of its bodywork and technology with the Toyota BZ4X, have been sold. This year, at the New York International Auto Show, Subaru showed off a facelifted version of the vehicle, which has been improved repeatedly during its lifecycle.

""Since its launch, Solterra has consistently improved year over year, with meaningful updates and improvements that our owners have requested. Those include improved cold-weather charging performance, improved interior ergonomics, and more. We've heard a lot from our Solterra owners about those features and what they expect from their EV ownership experience,"" Bethke said.

The SUV has gotten even better this year. ""For the 2026 model year, we're proud to offer additional driving range, faster charging, standard NACS charging port, more power, a larger touchscreen, dual wireless cell phone chargers, and battery pre-conditioning for even faster charging in cold weather, which are great product improvements consumers are sure to love,"" he shared.

While automakers are putting off and/or cancelling vehicles that only run on electrons, given high development costs and a weak market, Subaru is confident in the direction it is headed. The marketing head shared some insights: ""Subaru customers are known for taking their vehicles off the beaten path and beyond. Our internal research shows that many of our owners are still very interested in making their next new car purchase an EV, so offering an all-electric powertrain with our iconic Subaru shape, legendary capability, and all-wheel-drive performance makes sense for those shoppers.""

Experts expect the new-to-market Forester Hybrid and Crosstrek Hybrid to be even more impactful for the market. They reach customers at a pivotal time in the vehicle electrification story for the U.S. Consumers are more interested in the powertrain variant than ever. Forty-five percent say they are very or somewhat likely to seriously consider purchasing a hybrid the next time they buy a vehicle, a June 2025 Pew Research Center report found.

""The Forester Hybrid and new Crosstrek Hybrid target a growing market of compact SUV shoppers seeking electrification in their vehicles now — and more in the future. But offering a hybrid powertrain only isn't enough. We wanted to ensure that hybrid powertrains in the Forester and Crosstrek will perform like a Subaru should. That means to us that those models are every bit as capable as their non-hybrid counterparts, but also efficient, safe, comfortable, and reliable. With the capability of Subaru Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive standard, Crosstrek Hybrid delivers 597 miles of range while Forester Hybrid delivers 581 miles of range,"" Bethke said.

In addition to Solterra, Forester Hybrid and Crosstrek Hybrid, 2026 will welcome Trailseeker and Uncharted battery-powered SUVs to the Subaru lineup. The Uncharted is smaller, matching up in size with the Toyota C-HR. The Trailseeker model is more like the company's Outback wagon.

Bethke is quick to point out that Trailseeker and Uncharted are not designed to be compromises for Subaru customers. ""Trailseeker brings an all-electric powertrain to a familiar shape for Subaru owners and fans. There's more Subaru DNA than just what you see in the sheet metal,"" he explained.

""In addition to Symmetrical All-Wheel Drive and 8.3 inches of ground clearance, the Trailseeker offers more usable cargo space and ample room for passengers with up to 3,500 pounds of towing capacity and standard roof rails. It's also the quickest Subaru we've ever sold in the U.S.""

The Subaru Solterra and Forester Hybrid are on sale now. Crosstrek Hybrid reaches dealers soon, with Trailseeker and Uncharted arriving in 2026.",https://d.newsweek.com/en/full/2723510/2026-subaru-trailseeker.png,N,,2025-09-24 11:05:17.440190
,North Carolina American Energy ,2025-09-24 10:15:15+00:00,Grist,Trump raised $8 million for Hurricane Helene survivors. Where did it all go? - Grist.org,Katie Myers,,,,,https://grist.org/accountability/trump-raised-8-million-for-helene-survivors-where-did-it-all-go/,"It raised $130 million in the wake of Helene, and hundreds of millions more for other disasters this year alone.
North Carolina-based Samaritan’s Purse received $5.2 million, which its representatives said went toward Helene aid but did not elaborate when asked.
In many cases, faith-based disaster relief groups coordinate with local churches, which serve as ready-made response hubs.
“Private aid organizations were really concerned with separating the deserving poor from the undeserving poor,” Greene, who is from Helene-impacted Mitchell County, North Carolina, said.
While Samaritan’s Purse is a disaster relief group that Smith trusts, a linked group, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, is registered as a church.","On a dusty, warm day last October, nearly a month after Hurricane Helene tore across the southeastern United States, Donald Trump stood behind a podium in Swannanoa, North Carolina, to pledge funding and support to survivors of the disaster.

“In the wake of this horrible storm, many Americans in this region felt helpless and abandoned, and left behind by their government,” Trump, still a presidential candidate at the time, said. “And yet in North Carolina’s hour of desperation, the American people answer the call much more so than your federal government.”

Trump was present to, among other things, deliver an update on a GoFundMe set up by his presidential campaign for those impacted by Helene. In three short weeks, the drive had raised $7.7 million from the pockets of ordinary Americans, prominent Republican political operatives, and some of the country’s most influential and wealthiest families.

“My prayers and encouragement goes out to all the victims,” one donor commented on the fundraiser’s public wall roughly a year ago. “I hope you know that we all love you.”

It wasn’t until a few days after money had begun to come in that the crowdfunding effort announced where the contributions were going: Mtn2Sea Ministries, Water Mission, Samaritan’s Purse, and the Clinch Foundation. On October 21, an additional recipient, Sweetwater Mission, was added. Four of the five organizations are faith-based Christian charities. Most of them have close ties to Trump or to prominent supporters of his.

Though political candidates have used GoFundMe to cover campaign costs, campaign finance and philanthropy experts told The Associated Press in October that a presidential candidate had never before used the platform in this way.

GoFundMe has become a central artery of immediate relief for disaster survivors. It raised $130 million in the wake of Helene, and hundreds of millions more for other disasters this year alone. But for all the good it does, critics have long lamented its layers of financial opaqueness. As a private platform, GoFundMe is not subject to public records requests. Anyone can set up a fundraiser, and although the site has an accountability team and lets users flag fraud, scams still happen — including those exploiting disaster victims. The platform has exploded in popularity and raised $30 billion since 2010, with significant growth in the last five years. Still, its lack of a more specific annual fundraising breakdown has prompted calls for further data transparency. The nonprofit’s annual report breaks down how much was raised for individuals and nonprofits, total number of donors, and average donation amounts, among other statistics. It also highlights certain large fundraising moments, such as Helene. But it doesn’t break down total donations by category, nor does it discuss how many campaigns hit their targets or delivered on their promises.

GoFundMe isn’t the only crowdfunding platform out there, either. There’s Kickstarter, Indiegogo, Fundable, Donorbox, and others, though many work better for small businesses and nonprofits; GoFundMe was ranked by one site as the best for personal fundraisers. Other charities and funding organizations support specific populations, like Baby2Baby, which allows donors to give to parents with young infants, or Direct Relief, which provides medical aid.

A year after Helene, what exactly Trump’s GoFundMe campaign paid for remains unclear. Grist reached out to the recipient organizations asking how much they received, and how it was spent. Several responded to an initial email and offered vague explanations, but none except Mtn2Sea Ministries responded to follow-ups for a more specific breakdown of related expenditures.

Mtn2Sea Ministries, based in St. Simon’s Island, Georgia, publicly announced and provided Grist a clear breakdown of its portion of the funds, which it used to buy $25,000 in gift cards for rural communities in Clinch County.

North Carolina-based Samaritan’s Purse received $5.2 million, which its representatives said went toward Helene aid but did not elaborate when asked. South Carolina-based Water Mission would not say how much it received, though it has published updates on its website about its work supporting communities after Helene. Sweetwater Mission, located near Atlanta, did not respond at all to the request. Grist could find no record of a “Clinch Foundation,” as the GoFundMe page called it, though it could be referring to the Clinch Memorial Foundation, in Homerville, Georgia. That group did not respond to Grist’s request for comment. GoFundMe also refused to clarify or confirm.

Trump has repeatedly used Helene as a political signal over the past year: It is time to overhaul American disaster relief, he has argued, by shrinking the role of the federal government in preparedness and recovery. If that vision comes to pass, GoFundMe and private entities like these evangelical nonprofits may play a larger role in disaster recovery, making the pathways of disaster aid harder than ever to track. Some historians and philanthropy experts warn it also may make such work — while potentially more expansive — less equitable in terms of who receives help.

Some of the recipients appear to have friendly relationships with Trump, Trump’s political supporters, or prominent Republicans. The GoFundMe campaign’s top donor is Kelly Loeffler, a former U.S. senator from Georgia, who joined Women for Trump at a Sweetwater Mission donation event in the wake of Helene. Trump later named Loeffler to lead the Small Business Administration. She did not respond to a request for comment about her $500,000 donation. The board of Water Mission, a clean water charity, is studded with prominent Christian business owners, some of whom are large Republican donors (for instance, a member of the Cathy family, which owns the restaurant chain Chick-Fil-A).

The crowdfunding campaign’s biggest recipient, Samaritan’s Purse, is run by Franklin Graham, son of famed evangelical leader Billy Graham and a strong, if complex, Trump ally. Graham traveled with Trump to survey storm damage in Georgia last September, less than a week after Helene. He then delivered the invocation at Trump’s inauguration ceremony in January, celebrating the election results with the words, “Look what God has done. We praise him and give him glory.” Four days later, he accompanied Trump on another visit to Swannanoa.

Darren Grem is a historian at the University of Mississippi who studies the ties between the political right, the business world, and American evangelism. To him, the relationships underpinning the GoFundMe campaign reflect a deep-seated political ethic that ties conservative evangelical leaders and right-wing politics together when disaster strikes. “The goal is assuaging suffering to save individuals, not fix systems,” Grem said. In the short term, disaster response is quick and expansive, with faith-based organizations fanning across disaster-impacted regions to repair homes, replace cars, and deliver truckloads of donations. In many cases, faith-based disaster relief groups coordinate with local churches, which serve as ready-made response hubs.

Humanitarian disaster aid is key to the missions of the organizations that received the GoFundMe donations — and all contributed to the recovery after Helene. If the Clinch Foundation is indeed associated with Clinch Memorial Hospital, that organization fed and housed Helene survivors. Mtn2Sea’s aid benefited some of Georgia’s hardest-hit communities. Water Mission provided water purification packets and large containers of potable water to recipients like Asheville City Schools and a church in Vilas, North Carolina (neither responded to requests for comment).

“As a Christian nonprofit organization, we believe we are called by God to serve others, and we remain steadfast in this mission, committed to carrying it out with love, excellence, and integrity while maintaining political neutrality,” Water Mission told Grist by email.

Samaritan’s Purse spokesperson Mark Barber said its $5.2 million share went into the $90-million pot the organization spent on Helene. The group, based in Boone, North Carolina, has embedded itself deeply in hurricane response and has by its own count built about 300 homes and distributed 163 campers. It has also replaced over 200 vehicles, provided household items to more than 2,700 people, and again, by its count, saved 173 souls.

Grist contacted several Helene survivors who were helped by Samaritan’s Purse, but only one responded. This person declined an interview, noting that while she disagreed with the nonprofit’s conservative values, it was building her a home and she didn’t want to upset anyone.

Grist also reached out to Meredith O’Rourke, who served as the national finance director for Trump’s presidential campaign and who set up the GoFundMe, to ask why it chose these charities. She did not respond. We also contacted the fundraiser’s top donors — Ultimate Fighting Championship President and CEO Dana White, billionaire real estate investors and Trump megadonors Steve and Andrea Wynn, New York real estate investor and current Trump Middle East envoy Steve Witkoff — to ask if they had heard how the funds were spent, and why they chose to donate to the GoFundMe rather than, or in addition to, tax-deductible charities. None responded.

But the choices aren’t mysterious to experts who’ve studied the ongoing relationship between the far right and evangelical philanthropy. Both favor smaller government and individual giving over tax-based public relief, said Alison Greene, a religious historian at Emory University.

Before the sweeping economic, social, and political reforms of Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s New Deal, which were created to dig the United States out of the Great Depression, three-quarters of disaster relief went through private charities, most of which were faith-based, she said.

“Private aid organizations were really concerned with separating the deserving poor from the undeserving poor,” Greene, who is from Helene-impacted Mitchell County, North Carolina, said. The Great Depression cut so massive a swath of misery that support for federal relief ballooned. Some faith leaders and right-wing politicians opposed that, and continue to. Billy Graham, father of Samaritan’s Purse, was outspokenly among them, as are his descendants.

“Folks like Franklin Graham,” Greene added, “have this narrative that the state destroyed the work of the church.”

Despite Graham’s opposition to state disaster relief funding, his organization has received hundreds of millions of dollars from USAID and the State Department since 2016. The future of this federal funding — about 5 percent of the organization’s budget — remains uncertain, however, after USAID was more or less dismantled.

Grem, of the University of Mississippi, said the faith-based relief community’s alliance with Republican political actors has continued to advantage all involved.

“Evangelicals perfected the art of that deal long before anyone considered Donald Trump a viable political means or end,” Grem said.

First Amendment protections allow religious groups to sidestep federal oversight. Sometimes, Grem said, that’s a strength. “Such groups can quickly mobilize to provide immediate aid,” he said. Evangelical organizations also appear more culturally familiar to some of the communities they serve, and their speed is appealing to disaster survivors who just want a return to normalcy.

Without external checks and requirements, though, “they may misjudge local needs, duplicate efforts, or overlook or short-hop services,” Grem added. “The very same shortcomings often get criticized in bureaucracies like FEMA.” Long-term planning doesn’t really factor in, Grem added. Unlike the Federal Emergency Management Agency, religious charities’ work focuses on immediate needs and rebuilding houses, not long-term disaster risk and mitigation.

Though FEMA can be picky in disbursing aid, it must abide by federal civil rights law; private charities do not. Samaritan’s Purse and other religious charities have publicly opposed gay marriage and abortion. So have members of the Cathy family, who sit on the boards of many similar charities. It’s led some Helene victims to worry they might face differential treatment or judgment, or avoid seeking aid from such groups. Renters and undocumented immigrants are chronically overlooked by both public and private relief efforts.

To top it off, cash flow can be tricky in ministry groups — and things get more complicated with unusual circumstances like this GoFundMe. Warren Cole Smith, who directs the Christian aid transparency watchdog Ministry Watch, supports evangelical disaster relief but worries about the potential for financial mismanagement a GoFundMe presents.

“There are many ways to evade transparency and accountability,” he said, adding that some groups avoid filing required 990 tax forms by registering as a church even when they don’t operate like one. While Samaritan’s Purse is a disaster relief group that Smith trusts, a linked group, the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, is registered as a church. Franklin Graham runs both organizations, which often deploy together into humanitarian missions.

“We think using a GoFundMe campaign in this way is not a good idea,” Smith said. “If President Trump had simply recommended these organizations, that way the organizations themselves would be direct recipients of the money … [and] individual donors could make up their own minds about which campaigns to support.”

GoFundMe, for its part, told Grist that the fundraising campaign was verified by its trust-and-safety team, a process that requires drives to “be clear who the organizer is, as well as the person, business, or charity they are raising funds for, the organizer’s relationship to the recipient of the funds, and how the funds will be used,” the organization said. If the team feels information is missing, they put the fundraiser on hold.

Since then, FEMA, though diminished, continues to make a point of opening grant opportunities to faith-based organizations and knocking down political barriers to religious influence.

The Helene campaign is closed, but some previously scheduled monthly donations continued to roll in as of July, and new donors were contributing in May. It is unclear where this new money is going, given that the last official spending update came 11 months ago. GoFundMe representatives assured Grist that the funds have all been distributed to the listed recipients.

Among the donors with messages of support was western North Carolina resident Stacie Johnson, who gave the GoFundMe $5, begging the campaign to notice her family’s plight — her father had lost his home and had no flood insurance. The same day Trump’s drive launched, on September 30, 2024, she had started a campaign for her father. But while Trump’s GoFundMe coffers grew, Johnson’s fundraiser brought in only an eighth of what her family needed. Johnson did not respond to a request for comment.

“I am curious when this money will be distributed,” Johnson wrote on the Trump drive’s page. She detailed her father’s situation before adding, “I pray that someone will see fit to help him rebuild very soon. There’s no other way than kind-hearted souls’ donations at this point.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/trump-gofundme-helene.jpg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-09-24 06:59:13.498610

The U.S. LNG exports will benefit from growing global demand, WoodMac reckons.
U.S. Natural Gas Producers Win Big in Any Scenario The coming global LNG glut could reduce profits for U.S. exporters in the medium term, but the rise in export capacity is set to raise domestic U.S. natural gas prices.
Natural gas producers will have demand for their output coming from both increased domestic gas-fired power and rising LNG exports.
But the LNG industry could become a direct competitor of data centers for the U.S. gas supply.","The U.S. LNG export boom could soon face challenges by the end of the decade, both at home and on the international market.

Huge export capacity additions, mostly in the United States and Qatar, are set to tip the global LNG market into an oversupply as soon as next year, depressing prices and eating into the profit margins of the U.S. LNG exporters.

Domestically, the LNG export industry will have to increasingly compete with rising demand for gas for power generation in the United States, where natural gas is expected to meet part of the new power demand created by data centers and the onshoring of manufacturing activity.

Supply Boom

This year, American LNG developers began approving new project investments as soon as the Trump Administration lifted the pause on new LNG projects that was enacted by the Biden Administration.

So far this year, Australia’s Woodside has announced the FID for the Louisiana LNG project and plans to start production in 2029. U.S. LNG exporter Venture Global in July took FID and successfully closed the $15.1 billion project financing for the first phase of the company’s third project, CP2 LNG (CP2), together with the associated CP Express Pipeline. And top U.S. exporter Cheniere has made a positive FID for the Corpus Christi Midscale Trains 8 & 9 and Debottlenecking Project. Upon completion of CCL Midscale Trains 8 & 9, and together with expected debottlenecking and CCL Stage 3, the Corpus Christi LNG terminal is expected to exceed 30 million tonnes per annum (mtpa) in total liquefaction capacity later this decade.

Several other projects are expected to take FID this year and in the coming years, amid a growing pipeline of proposals.

“The more US LNG capacity that takes FID, the bigger the oversupply and longer and deeper the price drop could be,” analysts at Wood Mackenzie said earlier this month.

By 2030, supply from the top two LNG exporters, the U.S. and Qatar, will surge as several U.S. projects are set to start operations and Qatar’s biggest-ever LNG expansion will be completed by 2027.

Year to date, newly sanctioned U.S. capacity accounted for 95% of all FIDs, with Argentina the only other country to have a project reached FID, according to estimates by the International Energy Agency (IEA).

Between 2025 and 2030, a total of almost 300 billion cubic meters per year of new LNG export capacity is expected to come online from projects that have already reached FID and/or are under construction, per the IEA.

The agency noted that “This represents the largest capacity wave in any comparable period in the history of LNG markets” and excludes Russia’s heavily sanctioned Arctic LNG 2 project, which has started shipping fuel to China on vessels blacklisted by the U.S. and Europe.

With all the new supply coming on stream, the global market will tip from fairly balanced this year to an oversupply of almost 50 bcm next year, and a four-times larger glut of 200 bcm in 2030, according to LSEG estimates cited by Reuters energy columnist Ron Bousso.

Despite emerging risks such as price declines amid an expected global LNG oversupply toward the end of the decade, “US LNG is still one of the hottest investments in energy,” WoodMac’s analysts noted.

The U.S. LNG exports will benefit from growing global demand, WoodMac reckons. Moreover, U.S. LNG contracts will remain commercially attractive to offtakers on a long-term basis, while a growing number of investors want a slice of America’s LNG, which is broadening access to a deepening pool of capital, according to the energy consultancy.

The case for increased LNG exports remains solid—ample supply from U.S. domestic shale gas production, growing need for U.S. LNG, especially in Europe looking to ditch Russian gas by January 2027, and a ‘drill, baby, drill’ policy of the U.S. Administration supporting increased domestic oil and gas output and overseas exports.

U.S. Natural Gas Producers Win Big in Any Scenario

The coming global LNG glut could reduce profits for U.S. exporters in the medium term, but the rise in export capacity is set to raise domestic U.S. natural gas prices. The Henry Hub natural gas spot price will rise from an average of $2.91 per million British thermal units (MMBtu) in August to $3.70/MMBtu in the fourth quarter and $4.30/MMBtu next year, reflecting relatively flat natural gas production amid rising exports, the EIA forecasts.

The higher prices are likely to incentivize U.S. domestic gas production, which will be needed not only to feed LNG exports, but also additional gas-fired power generation amid rising power demand, due to the AI boom.

Natural gas producers will have demand for their output coming from both increased domestic gas-fired power and rising LNG exports. But the LNG industry could become a direct competitor of data centers for the U.S. gas supply.

Louisiana-Pacific Investment Narrative Recap

To remain confident in Louisiana-Pacific today, a shareholder must believe in the long-term growth of U.S. home construction, remodeling, and the continued conversion from legacy materials to engineered wood. The recent slide in Louisiana-Pacific’s share price and negative analyst sentiment could elevate concerns about sustained softness in near-term earnings, making volume growth in Siding and OSB the most important catalyst, while persistent demand weakness in housing remains the core risk. If these trends persist, shareholder value could be pressured, though the scale of the impact is closely tied to the housing market’s direction.

Among company announcements, the August 2025 Q2 results stand out as the most relevant, showing revenue and earnings declines over the prior year alongside reduced net profit margins. These results directly underscore why the upcoming earnings report is being closely watched, since ongoing margin compression could influence both analyst expectations and sentiment, potentially shaping how investors judge the company’s ability to weather current headwinds and capitalize on catalysts tied to product innovation and new housing activity.

By contrast, what investors may underestimate is just how much sustained weakness in U.S. housing starts...

Louisiana-Pacific's outlook anticipates $3.3 billion in revenue and $435.7 million in earnings by 2028. This is based on a projected annual revenue growth rate of 4.6% and an earnings increase of $137.7 million from current earnings of $298.0 million.

During a Grand Rapids Committee of the Whole meeting Tuesday morning, city commissioners signaled their support for the city to put out a request for proposals to pre-qualified vendors. Work has been ongoing by city officials to “streamline the project” at the former Butterworth landfill and pre-qualify 10 vendors that could take part in the development, Grand Rapids Assistant City Manager Doug Matthews said during the meeting.

The city owns about 140 acres of the 180-acre capped landfill located along the Grand River and just east of I-196. The proposed solar development would be constructed on 6 to 10 acres of the city’s property at the Butterworth landfill to be developed into solar infrastructure that would produce up to 2 megawatts of power.

“That provides all the power that we need for about 100 facilities that are connected to the primary circuit during the day,” Matthews said.

Federal clean energy tax credits the project could capture are phasing out at the end of 2026 under the massive budget reconciliation bill that Congress approved and Trump signed on July 4. Under current guidance, projects that begin construction before July 4, 2026 would have four years to be completed and still capture the tax credits, Matthews said.

“If they are started after July 4, they have to be completed before the end of 2027, so clearly we would like to take advantage of the four-year window and not the 18-month window if we can,” Matthews said.

With the city commission’s support, the city now plans to put out its RFP for the project by the end of this month. The goal is to start turning dirt at the landfill site in June 2026, Matthews said.

“We know that those tax credits for solar are in a difficult spot right now,” Matthews said. “It’s part of the reason we’re talking about this now. … The RFP responses will provide us with detail on what the potential cost impacts, or net savings might be, and we’ll factor that into our calculations in terms of our decisions to move (forward).”

Grand Rapids Mayor David LaGrand voiced support for the solar project at the meeting. LaGrand also asked if the city could potentially add a second phase to the plans and increase the scope of the solar array.

Matthews said expanding the project so an additional phase could still leverage the federal solar tax incentives is “certainly something that we can broach.”

As of last year, the city was considering up to three solar installations on the Butterworth landfill property. In addition to the 2 MW array to power city operations, officials were angling for federal and state funding for projects that serve low-income residents as well as Vicinity Energy’s downtown steam plant. The status of that funding is unclear, particularly as the Trump administration cut off a Biden-era Inflation Reduction Act solar program meant to benefit low-income residents.

Meanwhile, infrastructure work to prepare for the 2 MW project has been ongoing, including several primary circuit segment installations. As well, the city accepted a $3 million grant agreement from the Michigan Department of Environment, Great Lakes, and Energy on Sept. 9 to support infrastructure work on the project.

Because of the cap on the landfill site and the condition of the property, the solar panels would have to be ballasted, which means they would be installed into concrete blocks, which is more expensive and requires more engineering, Matthews said. This was one of the reasons they went through the pre-qualification process to make sure they had a pool of vendors that could perform that type of installation, Matthews added.

If completed, the solar project would operate under a power purchase agreement, where the city would purchase the power at an agreed upon price over the expected life of the project. The developer would build and maintain the infrastructure and the city owns the land, he said.

The landfill closed in the 1970s after it was used for dumping industrial waste, leading the property to be classified as a superfund site in 1986. It was deemed fully remediated in 2000 by the EPA, which assessed the site and found it could be used for park space, parking or solar infrastructure.

Given that the EPA’s own assessment of the site recommended solar as a potential use, Matthews said the city doesn’t anticipate many roadblocks in the approval process, which would require future approvals from the EPA and a Butterworth Site Group. The group includes representation from the city as well as several private companies.

The former landfill site also includes additional space for other potential uses, including parking and park development, Matthews said. The city has been in discussions with the Grand Rapids-Kent County Convention/Arena Authority and John Ball Zoo for potentially using part of the site for surface parking for employees of the zoo and Acrisure Amphitheater, Matthews said.

“We know that has been a particular issue for those working in the service industry is the affordability of parking and working downtown and being able to get to their places for work safely,” Matthews said.

The city commission could consider a parking agreement ahead of the grand opening of the Acrisure Amphitheater in May 2026, with the first confirmed act at the venue set for May 30, 2026.

Residential solar installations increased in Pennsylvania in 2022 and 2023, according to the most recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association.","This article originally appeared on Inside Climate News, a nonprofit, non-partisan news organization that covers climate, energy and the environment. This the second in a series about rising electricity prices in Pennsylvania. Read the first story here.

In the steep hills above the Schuylkill River, across the street from a famous cheesesteak place and at the end of a quiet block, sits a typical Philadelphia rowhouse: narrow brick, front porch, fig trees growing in the yard. From the sidewalk, there’s nothing to distinguish this house from its neighbors. But there’s a tiny clue that something is a little different: a sticker on the electric meter with a Solarize Philly logo.

The owner, Liz Robinson, is the current executive director at the Philadelphia Solar Energy Association, a volunteer-based nonprofit that works to increase solar adoption in Pennsylvania. She’s been involved in renewable energy policy in the city and on the state level for decades. Almost 10 years ago, Robinson had solar panels installed on the roof of this house, which she bought as a rental property.

In 2010, then-Gov. Ed Rendell boasted about this Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard, calling it “one of the most ambitious of its kind in America” and praising Pennsylvania as “a national leader in the field of alternative energy.” Since 2006, Rendell said, the state had made “remarkable progress,” citing growth in wind and solar generation.

“The Rendell administration did a lot of work to bring manufacturing into the state,” said Laurie Mazer, co-founder of Formation Energy, a Philadelphia-based solar developer. “There really was this moment where Pennsylvania was well ahead of the curve.”

But even as Rendell touted the state’s investment in renewable energy, the landscape was changing. In 2004, the same year the state enacted the AEPS law, drilling began on the first gas well in Pennsylvania to use hydraulic fracturing.

The fracking boom birthed a new way of thinking about energy. By 2013, in a speech about climate change, President Barack Obama was hailing natural gas as a “transition fuel that can power our economy with less carbon pollution,” phrasing that was popular in messaging on natural gas at the time. It was a “bridge” from dirty coal to cleaner renewables, a temporary solution that would lower emissions and secure energy independence.

Fifteen years later, that bridge extends endlessly into Pennsylvania’s future, with no glimpse of the other side in sight.

Natural gas production is still rising in the United States, and 60 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity generation now comes from natural gas. It’s so tied to electricity in some Pennsylvanians’ minds that they can’t imagine how the state could run without it. State Sen. Camera Bartolotta, a Republican who represents a heavily fracked district in the southwest, appears on a billboard on the turnpike with this message: “No fossil fuels, no electricity. Wake up America!”

Only 4 percent of Pennsylvania’s electricity comes from renewable energy. Since 2015, that number has only increased by one percentage point, even as states such as Texas, Kansas, Iowa, South Dakota and Maine saw significant gains in renewables.

Pennsylvania now ranks second to last in the country when it comes to the percentage of its electricity generated by renewables, and in 2024, the state ranked 49th for renewable energy growth in the U.S. For utility-level solar, Pennsylvania ranked 41st, supplying just over 1 percent of the state’s electricity. For residential solar systems like Robinson’s, a separate metric from utility-level power generation, Pennsylvania is a middling 26th.

Pennsylvania’s reliance on gas is one of the problems at the root of the state’s soaring electric bills, experts say, because it means local consumers pay more whenever global gas prices go up.

In Texas, the only state that produces more gas than Pennsylvania, renewable energy’s share of the electric market has grown from 12 percent in 2015 to 34 percent in 2024. And residential electricity rates in Texas are about 20 percent lower than Pennsylvania’s, according to June federal figures.

Electricity prices in Pennsylvania continued to rise in 2025, following a sharp increase over the last few years that has hit Pennsylvania households hard. One reason for the most recent surge: data centers and the stress they are likely to put on the grid. New data centers are expected to drive soaring increases in electricity demand over the next five years, according to forecasts from Pennsylvania’s Public Utility Commission. To power them, investors want to build even more natural gas power plants.

“We have become over-reliant on gas as a transitional fuel, and we continue to argue that it’s a transition, yet we are not transitioning,” said Elizabeth Marx, the executive director at the Pennsylvania Utility Law Project. “We continue to build out our delivery system for gas, and we are locking ratepayers in to pay for that system for 30 more years.”

“Clean Energy Now”

Robinson traces the origins of Pennsylvania’s failed promise as a leader in renewables to one big shift over the past 15 years.

“The change in the Republican Party is really the story here,” she said.

When she first started working in the field, moderate Republicans in Philadelphia’s collar counties were passionate advocates for conservation initiatives and open-minded about ideas like green energy. As Tea Party candidates and increasing polarization pushed this older generation of Republicans out of office, the legislature became more partisan, more contentious and less willing to compromise.

At the same time, fracking gained ground in Pennsylvania, and natural gas companies poured money into Harrisburg, both through campaign contributions and lobbying. One example: the American Petroleum Institute, an industry trade group, spent more on lobbying in Pennsylvania than in any other state in 2022, according to a Public Accountability Initiative analysis. “There’s a tremendous ownership of politicians that goes on in Pennsylvania by the gas industry,” Robinson said.

The resulting gridlock is particularly acute when it comes to energy issues. Anything that seems to threaten the dominance of natural gas is politically doomed. From the state’s contested membership in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative to updating the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard to legalizing community solar, efforts to make real policy changes at the state level have met with resistance.

“It surprises me, in this day and age, how many climate deniers you have in the legislature. There’s this almost visceral disdain for solar and wind,” said Rep. Greg Vitali, a Democrat from suburban Delaware County who has served in the state legislature for more than 30 years and is considered an environmental leader at the capitol. “It goes beyond an intellectual disagreement.”

Vitali, the chair of the House Environmental & Natural Resource Protection Committee, said there was effective negotiation and “give and take” when the Alternative Energy Portfolio Standard passed in 2004. That isn’t happening now.

One component of Democratic Gov. Josh Shapiro’s Lightning Plan for energy reform is a bill to allow community solar, where customers can buy shares in a solar project even if they can’t host panels on their own roofs. The bill passed the Democrat-controlled House in May, but it’s now stuck in the Senate, where Republicans maintain a narrow majority. Republicans have controlled the Pennsylvania Senate since 1994.

Elowyn Corby, the mid-Atlantic regional director at Vote Solar, an affordable-solar advocacy group, said this state of affairs on renewables doesn’t reflect the feelings of the public. “It’s less about what Pennsylvanians want, because we’ve seen time and time again that when asked, Pennsylvanians like renewable energy. Pennsylvanians love solar,” she said.

The state legislature’s paralysis has effectively ceded leadership of energy policy to other forces, said Mazer, the solar developer. “We haven’t played as much of a role as we could have in deciding what our energy future looks like,” she said.

There’s another kind of energy gridlock at PJM Interconnection, the company that manages the electricity grid in all or parts of 13 states and Washington, D.C. When it comes to Pennsylvania’s emphasis on natural gas generation, PJM is a significant part of the problem, said David Masur, the executive director at PennEnvironment, an environmental organization in Pennsylvania that has closely tracked the state’s lagging investment in renewable energy.

“There’s just hundreds of projects in the queue, and something like 98 percent of them are renewables,” he said.

PennEnvironment estimated that PJM’s backlog of unapproved electricity projects could cost Pennsylvanians $12.5 billion in just one year. In January, after filing a complaint against PJM, Shapiro settled with the operator to stop a rate hike that could have tripled energy prices for Pennsylvanians.

If the system were working the way it’s supposed to, more solar and wind projects would have been coming online as their costs drop compared to gas. Instead, PJM’s delays have created a bottleneck.

“New competition is being blocked by this outmoded, vastly delayed interconnection system,” Corby said. “New energy is not able to come online quickly enough to keep our bills down. PJM needs to move a lot more things through the queue a lot more quickly.”

In a statement to Inside Climate News, a spokesperson for PJM, Jeffrey Shields, said the company has reformed its interconnection process, processing 140 gigawatts of capacity since 2023, with 63 more due to be processed in 2025 and 2026. PJM blames the slowdown on permitting and supply chain backlogs, “none of which are related to PJM,” and nationwide trends that are beyond the company’s control.

“Electricity supply is decreasing while demand is increasing, primarily from data centers, not only in PJM but across the country,” Shields said.

On a rainy day in May, protestors stood in front of PJM’s headquarters outside Philadelphia. Dressed in rain slickers and clutching umbrellas, the protestors held hand-painted signs reading, “Clean Energy Now” and “PJM, lower our electric bills. Connect clean energy.”

As cars zoomed behind him, state Rep. Chris Rabb spoke to the protesters and members of the press about his bill to increase transparency in PJM’s decision-making. Rabb, a Democrat, said he believed his bill could attract bipartisan support, a rare feat in Pennsylvania’s split legislature.

“The reason I think this might have some legs is because so many of our constituents—rural, urban, suburban—are struggling to pay their utility bills. And it’s only going to get worse if PJM continues to operate in this fashion,” he said. “I think it can garner some Republican votes, because they have ratepayers, too, who are not happy about the coming hikes. People are going to be mad as hell, right? They’re going to wonder who to blame.”

Powering the future

Data centers built to power electricity-hungry artificial intelligence technology are projected to consume enormous quantities of power, and in Pennsylvania, gas producers see an opportunity to keep extending the “bridge.”

At Republican U.S. Sen. Dave McCormick’s Energy and Innovation Summit in Pittsburgh in July, $90 billion in data center deals between tech companies and natural gas and pipeline companies were announced. These investments could lock in gas as the state’s primary electricity generator for another generation.

EQT, a natural gas company headquartered in Pittsburgh, said it would become a partner in a plan to convert the old coal-fired Homer City Generating Station into a 3,200-acre artificial intelligence campus with the country’s largest gas-fired power plant.

“This agreement ensures long-term energy security for the data center campus, while demonstrating our commitment to powering the future with Pennsylvania gas,” Corey Hessen, one of the leaders of the Homer City project, said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the costs of drilling for gas are going up. “There’s a slowing of production growth happening here in the United States, and the so-called shale revolution is in the later innings,” said Trey Cowan, an oil and gas energy analyst at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis. “It’s getting more and more expensive to drill.”

It’s also getting more expensive to build natural gas power plants, said Sean O’Leary, senior researcher in energy and petrochemicals at the Ohio River Valley Institute: “The cost of building a gas-fired power plant has gone up by about two-and-a-half times.”

That could pose problems if all of the gas power plants that PJM thinks it will need to meet growing demand over the next decade are built. Trump’s massive tariffs on steel are likely to further inflate costs, said Christopher Doleman, an LNG and gas specialist at the Institute for Energy Economics and Financial Analysis.

And the premise that the bridge was originally built on—that natural gas made sense as a transition to renewables because it emitted fewer greenhouse gases than other fossil fuels—turns out to be far more complicated than the politicians of the 2010s claimed.

Although it’s true that burning natural gas emits fewer greenhouse gases than coal, evidence is growing that its production and transport damages the earth’s atmosphere more than previously thought. Methane is a far more potent driver of global warming than carbon dioxide.

Despite all that, both Corby and Robinson see reasons for hope. One of them is residential solar systems like Robinson’s, which are small enough to bypass the clogged PJM queue.

“It can come online incredibly quickly. It also takes much less time to build,” Corby said. “That’s a really intuitive and easy place to look, where we would see the results quickly.”

More Pennsylvanians are clamoring to install solar panels of their own, especially as electricity prices go up. Residential solar installations increased in Pennsylvania in 2022 and 2023, according to the most recent data from the Solar Energy Industries Association. George Otto, a retiree in State College, said he decided to do so after years of watching Pennsylvania politicians fail to make progress on environmental or climate issues.

“It’s like pushing a rope to get those guys to move on any of this stuff. And so I figured, if we’re not going to be able to do it through them, then each of us can do what we can within our sphere of influence,” he said. “Now I’m happy to provide an example for others to look at and say, ‘Hey, this can work here.’” In addition to reducing his carbon footprint, Otto now pays nothing for electricity.

Pennsylvania has the potential to catch up on renewables, but it needs the political will. Even incremental shifts in power could do that, Robinson said. “Having the House be led by Democrats, even a one-seat majority, has made a world of difference,” she said. “If we can win the Senate, I think that changes everything.”

Corby is heartened by the state’s not-so-distant successes with renewable energy. “It’s important that we remember Pennsylvania’s ability to do good things on energy has not been exclusively on the side of fossil fuels,” she said.

“The question now is, as energy affordability and supply issues become increasingly pressing, will we let ourselves be bogged down by that history or enabled by it to lead again?”

For his part, Vitali has continued to introduce bills that could change the state’s trajectory, even if they have little chance of becoming law.

“There’s a quote I used to have [on] my desk. It said, ‘A leader should be a dealer in hope.’ I don’t feel very hopeful now,” he said. “But we try every day.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-96/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/250903_robinson_529-1024x6771758705287.jpg?h=16013371&itok=CAenGr0F,N,,2025-09-24 05:58:51.576060

Image for illustrative purposes

North America: North America’s virtual power plant (VPP) market reached a total operational capacity of 37.5 GW in 2024, marking a 13.7 % year-on-year increase, according to new data from Wood Mackenzie.

The consultancy’s 2025 North American virtual power plant market report highlights that VPP capacity grew from 33 GW in 2023 to 37.5 GW in 2024. At the same time, the number of active deployments rose sharply, from 1,459 to 1,940 – a 33 % increase. Analysts say the faster rise in the number of deployments compared to overall capacity reflects a market that has broadened rather than deepened.

“Utility programme caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge at Wood Mackenzie.

The report notes that the share of VPP capacity from residential customers increased from 8.8 % in 2023 to 10.2 % in 2024. This indicates that despite regulatory barriers to small-scale power generation, interest among households is rising.

Hertz-Shargel added that while data centres are a major driver of new load, “there is an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility.”

Looking ahead, Wood Mackenzie points to regulatory pushback as a key obstacle, with utilities’ rate basing practices seen as limiting investment in distributed energy resources.

1 to build natural gas plants throughout the country that will provide data centers with off-grid power.
""It's a pretty exciting time for natural gas,"" Expand Energy Corporation CEO Domenic Dell'Osso said on the producer's most recent earnings call.","The energy demand from data centers is expected to double by 2028, according to the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory. But the US power grid, full of aging infrastructure, years-long connection queues, and decades of stagnant industrial development, is largely unequipped to handle that demand today.

Much of the answer may lie in ""off-grid"" power, in which data centers get energy directly from their own sources instead of waiting years to be plugged into the grid.

And natural gas is positioned to meet a large share of this demand.

""We're focused on directly powering data center facilities so that they don't have to wait for these multiyear grid expansions that, unfortunately, is what it takes in the United States,"" Chad Zamarin, CEO of pipeline operator Williams Companies, said at a conference in August.

Shares of Expand Energy (EXE), the country's largest natural gas producer, are up more than 24% over the past year. Shares of fellow producers EQT Corporation (EQT) and Range Resources (RRC) are up more than 40% and more than 13%, respectively, while Williams Companies (WMB) is up more than 32%.

Off-grid power can come from a variety of sources.

In March 2024, Talen Energy (TLN) agreed to provide AWS (AMZN) with more than 1.9 gigawatts of energy from its nuclear Susquehanna Steam Electric Station to power a data center next to the plant. And other Big Tech players have promised to find renewable energy sources, like nuclear or solar power, for their AI ambitions.

But these projects can take decades to take on line, whereas a natural gas plant can take around five years, according to Morgan Stanley. And some of these plants are already on line.

""Any market in the United States that has any significant renewables, the only reason why it works is because we've got natural gas capacity that picks up the slack when the sun sets and the wind slows down,"" Williams Companies' chief Zamarin said at a conference in September.

And natural gas is already abundant in the US, cleaner than coal, and cheaper and faster to develop than nuclear power.

In February, natural gas producer Energy Transfer (ET) signed an agreement with the data center operator CloudBurst to provide 1.2 gigawatts of off-grid power for a data center outside San Marcos, Texas. In September, asset manager Blackstone (BX) purchased a natural gas plant in Pennsylvania for more than $1 billion in a bet on future demand.

The world's biggest tech companies are also looking to broker deals for natural gas. In December 2024, Meta (META) began work on a more than 2,000-acre site in Richland Parish, Louisiana, where it will spend $10 billion on a massive data center.

In late August, the Louisiana Public Service Commission approved construction plans for three new natural gas turbines that will help to provide the more than two gigawatts of power the data center is expected to consume.

""Recently announced large-scale power and AI or other data center supply deals, both in and out of basin, speak to the fundamental tailwinds to the gas macro,"" said Range Resources finance chief Mark Scucchi on a recent earnings call.

The world's biggest energy companies are also planning for a potential natural gas boom. In January, oil and gas major Chevron (CVX) announced a partnership with the investment firm Engine No. 1 to build natural gas plants throughout the country that will provide data centers with off-grid power.

""It's a pretty exciting time for natural gas,"" Expand Energy Corporation CEO Domenic Dell'Osso said on the producer's most recent earnings call.

""You have people recognizing the value that gas plays in the economy, the efficiency that gas creates for the growth in power demand, which is all tied to our growing economy, fueled by the innovation associated with AI.""

By shifting XC60 production to South Carolina, Volvo aims to better serve the American market while boosting factory utilization.
With a new hybrid model on the horizon and XC60 production beginning in 2026, the company is positioning its U.S. plant as a cornerstone of its North American strategy.
Celebrating 70 years in the American market, Volvo has already sold more than five million cars in the United States.","The Ridgeville plant, which broke ground in 2015, has become an important piece of Volvo's global production network alongside its factories in Europe and China. Since its opening, Volvo has invested around $1.3 billion in the site, equipping it with advanced capabilities for multiple platforms, technologies, and models.

Today, the plant has an installed capacity of 150,000 vehicles per year and already produces the fully electric Volvo EX90 SUV as well as the Polestar 3. Volvo's decision to add a new hybrid model reflects its strategy of tailoring vehicles to meet regional demands.

While the company has been pushing forward with electrification through models like the EX30 and EX90, it recognizes that hybrid technology remains important to U.S. customers. The upcoming hybrid, described as a ""next-generation"" model, is expected to be an SUV, given Volvo's recent move away from sedans and traditional wagons in the American market.

The Volvo XC60 joins in

Before the hybrid arrives, Volvo will begin producing the XC60 mid-size SUV in Ridgeville starting in late 2026. The XC60 has long been a top seller for the company, with over 27,000 units sold in the U.S. in the first eight months of 2025, which represents nearly 20 percent more than during the same period in 2024. By shifting XC60 production to South Carolina, Volvo aims to better serve the American market while boosting factory utilization. The 2026 version of the XC60 has already been refreshed with styling updates such as a redesigned grille, new wheels, and an updated 11.2-inch touchscreen.

Adding the XC60 to the U.S. production line will help balance supply and demand more effectively and ensure faster delivery to American customers.

Volvo executives see the Charleston-area plant as central to their future growth in the region. ""The Charleston plant is foundational to our strategic growth plan for the U.S.,"" said Luis Rezende, president of Volvo Cars Americas.

South Carolina officials welcomed the announcement, pointing to the state's growing reputation in the automotive sector. Governor Henry McMaster praised the decision, saying it ""highlights the strength of our workforce and the confidence the world's top companies have in our state.""

Volvo's long-term goal is to fully utilize Ridgeville's production capacity while balancing global electrification goals with regional preferences. With a new hybrid model on the horizon and XC60 production beginning in 2026, the company is positioning its U.S. plant as a cornerstone of its North American strategy.

Celebrating 70 years in the American market, Volvo has already sold more than five million cars in the United States. The expansion in South Carolina shows its intention to build millions more, offering U.S. drivers a mix of electric and hybrid options in the years ahead.",https://s1.cdn.autoevolution.com/images/news/volvo-will-build-a-hybrid-model-in-the-us-invests-in-the-south-carolina-car-plant-258026_1.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 11:05:54.357691

Naperville’s contract with its longtime power supplier IMEA expires in 2035, but the agency wants to extend its contract with the city and other municipalities until 2055.
Should the city enter into a new contract with the agency, the RFP will allow the city to identify potential clean energy vendors to supplement energy from IMEA.
Proposals from potential clean energy vendors are due by Oct. 29.
“The objective of this solicitation is to secure a reliable, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable energy supply that aligns with Naperville’s commitment to transitioning to clean energy,” the city document states.","Naperville is soliciting bids from potential clean energy vendors as it continues to negotiate a new energy contract with the Illinois Municipal Electric Agency.

The request for proposals (RFP)comes about a month after the council voted to allow city staff to negotiate with IMEA on a number of key contract points, many of which revolve around lowering Naperville’s carbon footprint. One of the provisions would allow the city to seek bids for non-fossil fuel energy options.

Naperville’s contract with its longtime power supplier IMEA expires in 2035, but the agency wants to extend its contract with the city and other municipalities until 2055. Critics say IMEA is too reliant on electricity produced by coal.

The current contract does not allow the city to procure energy from other sources, but IMEA members who sign a new 20-year agreement with the nonprofit joint action agency can utilize a Member Directed Resource (MDR) allocation to procure a percentage of their energy needs from a renewable or cleaner energy source, according to a city document on the RFP.

“If Naperville enters into the new contract with IMEA that begins in 2035, it is anticipated that the IMEA Board of Directors will consider including existing nuclear within the definition of MDR and would authorize Naperville to amend its existing contract so as to begin utilizing MDR as soon as January 1, 2026,” according to the document.

Should the city enter into a new contract with the agency, the RFP will allow the city to identify potential clean energy vendors to supplement energy from IMEA. Some of the eligible options include nuclear, wind, solar, hydro and geothermal energy sources.

As for capacity and delivery requirements, energy delivery must start no later than June 1, 2026. The city wants to pay only for capacity and energy delivered, among other conditions.

Proposals from potential clean energy vendors are due by Oct. 29.

“The objective of this solicitation is to secure a reliable, cost-effective and environmentally sustainable energy supply that aligns with Naperville’s commitment to transitioning to clean energy,” the city document states.

It is currently unknown whether Naperville has received any bids. City spokesperson Linda LaCloche said the city does not share information during an open RFP process to ensure “bids, proposals and related preparatory materials remain confidential until the process concludes.”

At the Sept. 16 council meeting, Naperville’s electric utility director Brian Groth said IMEA is evaluating the city’s contract proposal.

“We provided some sample language to IMEA. They are still reviewing it,” Groth, who also serves as vice chairman of IMEA’s board of directors, said. “We expect them, over the next few weeks, to come back with their concepts, their ideas, their feedback on what we provided them, which was language based off the nine tenants approved by council on the 19th.”

As of Sept. 22, the city did not have an update on the status of its negotiations with IMEA, LaCloche said.

High-purity CO2 for the food industry as an additional source of income

Prototype for the Flexpower Plus solution from Landmark, Rolls-Royce and ASCO

Rolls-Royce, energy services provider Landmark and carbon dioxide specialist ASCO have teamed up to commission a 10-megawatt gas engine power plant with a carbon capture system in the United Kingdom. Located in Worksop in the East Midlands region, the first tankers carrying purified and liquefied CO2 have already been picked up from the site for use in the food industry to carbonate beverages such as beer and lemonade.

The CO2 is extracted from the exhaust gases of the mtu gas engines - captured by a recovery system - processed, and liquefied. The plant will capture up to 30,000 tons of CO2 per year. The power plant feeds electricity into the grid for around 10,000 households and helps to ensure its stability. The heat produced by the combined heat and power mtu plants will be used both for carbon capture processes and to supply heat to households in the surrounding area.

“Flexible carbon capture gas engine power plants are an important technology for ensuring a stable decentralized energy supply while reducing CO2 emissions” explained Michael Stipa, Senior Vice President Business Development and Product Management Stationary Power Solutions at Rolls-Royce Power Systems. “This plant in Worksop is a great example of the future of sustainable energy and of a successful partnership between technology companies that want to make a difference.”

Rolls-Royce has supplied six highly efficient combined heat and power plants based on mtu Series 4000 L64FNER gas engines for the power plant in Worksop and will ensure the reliable operation of the plant for ten years under a maintenance contract.

ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. is responsible for the carbon capturing and processing plant and ensures the production of high-purity carbon dioxide. The UK-based power generation company Landmark Power Holdings Ltd. has developed and will operate the power plant.

The project is a joint venture with Victory Hill, a specialized investment company for sustainable energy infrastructure.

The Worksop facility is the first project under the FLEXPOWER PLUS™ concept developed by Landmark Power Holdings, which is designed for flexible power generation using mtu gas engines with improved energy efficiency and ASCO CO2 recovery technology. The partnership focuses on the development and distribution of scalable containerized solutions for clean power and heat generation that integrate carbon recovery technologies. With these solutions in line with the Rolls-Royce strategy the company helps its customers to reduce emissions, conserve resources and remain competitive.

“The captured CO2 is an additional source of revenue and a valuable resource for various industries, including food products, synthetic fuels, sustainable aviation fuels (SAF), and more,” said Ralph Spring, Managing Director of ASCO Carbon Dioxide Ltd. “Carbon capture is one of the key technologies for the energy transition and will play an even more central role in the coming years as CO2 emission taxes rise, regulatory requirements increase, and mandatory net-zero climate targets come into force.”

A bunch of automakers have announced plans to stop shipping or drastically cut back on EV shipments to the US (Honda, Mercedes, others). So yes, the ones remaining might lower their prices, but you'll have much less choice, and much less financing offers.

The hidden part is that the CAFE penalties are also disappearing and that's going to have weird effects on the market. Automaker fleets have to meet minimum mpg goals, so selling EVs boosts those figures up so that they can sell gas guzzlers that bring the numbers down. So let's say the target MPG for 2025 is 40mpg for example, if you sell an EV with 100mpge and a gas guzzler at 20mpg, then your fleet mpg would be 33.3MPG, and then you pay Tesla ~$2000 for 133 credit units and you're up to the 40MPG fleet compliance amount.

If you didn't sell the EV at all, and paid Tesla only, and sold that 20mpg car, you'd have to buy 20k credits, or $3000. But the problem is that if all the manufacturers do this, Tesla only has so many credits, so the math isn't simply 'oh, well then just pay the extra $1000 rather than taking a $10k loss on an EV'. If all the manufacturers did this, not only would Tesla run out of credits, but also the price would go through the roof.

It's hard to put a precise dollar number on it, but this offsetting is a huge benefit to some manufacturers like Ford that pretty much only sell gas guzzlers (outside the Mach E and the Maverick). There is no longer an incentive for manufacturers to produce these EVs to lower their fleet mpg.

I think this might actually be the bigger story. Between the two effects, it's not unreasonable that manufacturers might lose the $7500 as well as let's say a $10k benefit per EV for CAFE compliance, and that would hugely sway the decision making on something like a $50-70k Ford Mustang Mach E for example.

I think we might very quickly see that new choices are going to dwindle real fast.",,N,,2025-09-24 04:58:29.569346

For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.",https://media.whas11.com/assets/CCT/images/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71/20241126T221110/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 03:00:29.330905

The energy market observers, this latest speech confirms the Trump administration's commitment to put traditional energy at the center of its energy policy.
For clean energy proponents, the message is a clear and concerning one.","In his sprawling address to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Donald Trump attacked both climate change initiatives and clean energy. He called into question the scientific consensus on the topic and the economic viability of clean energy programs. The speech marks one of his most forceful rejections of climate policy since returning to office.

Trump called climate change “the greatest con job ever perpetrated on the world,” declaring that many predictions by the UN and other international bodies were wrong, made “by stupid people that have cost their country’s fortunes and given those same countries no chance for success.” He derided renewable energy as ineffective, expensive, and a financial drag, calling it a “joke”.

The President zeroed in on Europe and wind turbines in particular, claiming the continent was being “devastated by energy and immigration”. He described windmills as “pathetic and so bad, so expensive to operate” before referring to them as ""the most expensive energy ever conceived.""

His rhetoric stood in sharp contrast with international trends and the UN’s broader stance on clean energy. Secretary-General António Guterres, among others, has repeatedly urged nations to accelerate investment in renewables. Meanwhile, wind and solar power are becoming more cost-competitive and are major drivers of new electricity generation worldwide.

Critics say Trump’s claims about renewable energy are misleading. Independent fact-checkers note that while renewable energy infrastructure does require upfront capital, long-term costs have been declining, and many regions have already seen meaningful returns and emissions reductions. They also point out that calling climate science predictions “stupid” and describing green energy as a conspiracy ignores the mounting empirical evidence of climate change and its impacts.

From an oil and fossil fuel perspective, Trump’s speech underscores a clear policy orientation: to re-prioritize traditional sources such as oil, gas, coal, and even nuclear power over clean energy.

Clean energy stocks and ETFs traded lower following the speech, reflecting concern about regulatory and policy headwinds. For countries leaning heavily toward green energy, the warning from the U.S. may add political uncertainty, especially in sectors where technology, subsidies, and regulatory support are key.

The energy market observers, this latest speech confirms the Trump administration's commitment to put traditional energy at the center of its energy policy. For clean energy proponents, the message is a clear and concerning one.

Momentum for nuclear recycling has soared in recent months, driven by explicit federal policy shifts, including the May 2025 executive orders.","Advanced nuclear technology firm Oklo has broken ground on its inaugural 75-MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor at an Idaho National Laboratory (INL) site. The project—one of three awarded to the company under the Department of Energy’s (DOE’s) newly established Reactor Pilot Program—is targeting operations between late 2027 and early 2028, though that timeline is contingent on regulatory approvals and construction progress.

Oklo on Sept. 22 celebrated groundbreaking for its INL project—which it now calls “Aurora-INL”—noting the milestone stems from a concerted effort spanning five years. “We have been working with the Department of Energy and the Idaho National Laboratory since 2019 to bring this plant into existence, and this marks a new chapter of building. We are excited for this, and for many more to come,” said Jacob DeWitte, CEO and co-founder of Oklo.

The milestone follows Oklo’s Sept. 5 announcement that it will design, build, and operate America’s first privately funded nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. As part of that effort, the company is also exploring a pioneering collaboration with the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) to recycle the federal utility’s used fuel inventory. If realized, that initiative could mark the first time a U.S. utility has pursued recycling its own spent fuel into new clean electricity.

Aurora-INL—Oklo’s First Commercial Reactor—Breaks Ground

Santa Clara, California–headquartered Oklo’s efforts are embedded in its vertically integrated approach, which includes advanced nuclear power generation through its Aurora powerhouses—a 50 MWe to 75-MWe liquid metal-cooled, metal-fueled fast reactor technology—fuel recycling, and radioisotope production. The company has recently reported gains toward first commercial deployments across all three business segments.

Construction activities at its first commercial reactor project—Aurora-INL—follow substantial preconstruction work, including site mobilization, early procurement, and groundwork, and are ongoing, set under a master services agreement with Kiewit, its lead constructor.

The Aurora-INL features a 50-75 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor that builds directly on the design and operating heritage of the Experimental Breeder Reactor II (EBR-II), which operated successfully at the same Idaho site from 1964 to 1994. The powerhouse will use liquid metal sodium coolant and metallic fuel in a fast neutron spectrum design that enables inherent and passive safety features to significantly reduce the number of safety-grade systems required compared to traditional light water reactors, Oklo has said.

The design philosophy, notably, allows the reactor to utilize a diverse fuel portfolio including fresh high-assay low-enriched uranium (HALEU), downblended government stockpiles of uranium and plutonium-based materials that don’t require enrichment, and eventually recycled nuclear fuel. Oklo has said the reactor leverages over 400 reactor-years of proven liquid metal fast reactor operating history worldwide.

While the Aurora-INL is effectively Oklo’s first build, the company has also noted that the project will focus on cost efficiency and speed of deployment through strategic supply chain choices. “Roughly 70% of our powerhouse components are sourced from non-nuclear supply chains, industrials, energy and chemicals, for example,” said DeWitte during the company’s second-quarter earnings call on Aug. 11. “These sectors offer mature, scalable manufacturing capabilities that we can tap into today at lower cost and with shorter lead times than traditional nuclear fabrication.”

Oklo has structured the project around “standardized shippable components like the reactor module, steam generators, and power conversion system” to “simplify installation, support parallel builds and minimize on-site construction complexity,” while designing for “inherent and passive safety” to reduce “the number of safety-grade systems” and “streamline procurement,” DeWitte said. He pointed to the company’s “preferred supply agreement with Siemens Energy” as “a great example of this strategy in action,” noting that Oklo continues to expand the supplier ecosystem “with more partnerships to come as those deals reach commercial readiness.” The company has also tapped engineering giant Kiewit under “a master services agreement” covering “the full scope of design, procurement and construction for the Aurora-INL project,” he said.

Several more reactor projects could follow. Oklo recently broadened its 14-GW pipeline with a partnership with Liberty Energy to launch an integrated gas-to-nuclear power solution, a Notice of Intent to Award from the U.S. Air Force for the first advanced fission deployment at a military installation, and agreements with Vertiv to co-develop data-center power and cooling systems, as well as with Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power to explore global project development.

The Regulatory Road

So far, Oklo has made substantial regulatory progress across multiple fronts, including to complete Phase 1 of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission’s (NRC’s) readiness assessment for Aurora-INL’s combined license application (COL) under Part 52. Unlike the traditional Part 50 approach that involves two steps: the filing and approval of a construction permit followed by the filing and approval of an operating license, the company is pursuing Part 52 licensing because it “enables greater deployment speed and repeatability for companies like Oklo that plan to design, construct, and operate their own facilities,” with “the first combined license application serv[ing] as a reference, which can then be reused to reduce the scope of subsequent applications,” the company says in a regulatory dashboard on its website.

“Oklo is pioneering this approach in the advanced nuclear industry: it remains the only advanced reactor company to submit a combined license application and the first to have that application accepted for review,” it notes.

In August, however, the DOE selected the company for three projects of 11 selected under its new Reactor Pilot Program—two awarded directly to Oklo and one to its radioisotope arm, Atomic Alchemy—which seek to reach criticality of at least three advanced reactor concepts outside national laboratories by July 4, 2026.

A key facet of the program is that it allows private developers to build and operate reactors using DOE-issued permits rather than NRC licenses. The program leverages the DOE’s authority under the Atomic Energy Act to exempt reactors built “under contract with and for the account of” the department from traditional NRC licensing requirements.

DeWitte in August noted that President Trump’s May 2025 executive orders are “setting the stage for completely different licensing pathways” where “there is a path potentially to having a regulatory review done under the DOE, build the plant, turn it on,” which could “accelerate timelines considerably” as an alternative to the traditional NRC route. For Oklo’s Aurora-INL project, that aspect potentially creates optionality while the company continues pursuing its NRC combined license strategy.

Notably, the NRC recently revised its Nuclear Energy Innovation and Modernization Act (NEIMA) milestones to align with the 12- and 18-month periods cited in Executive Order 14300 (Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission), establishing 18 months for all reactor licenses under Part 52. (The measure, which took effect on May 23, also set various 12-month targets for license amendments, renewals, and other regulatory activities.)

In tandem, the company is also progressing on the Aurora-INL Fuel Fabrication Facility (A3F), which is currently funneling through the DOE’s safety analysis process—including completion of its conceptual safety design and ongoing development of the preliminary safety analysis. The facility will fabricate fuel for Oklo’s Aurora-INL powerhouse, which requires high-assay, low-enriched uranium (HALEU). Oklo plans to source five metric tons of HALEU from the former EBR-II reactor.

“The project is expected to create approximately 370 jobs during construction and 70–80 long-term, highly skilled roles to operate the powerhouse and A3F,” Oklo noted on Monday.

Oklo Unveils Nation’s First Private Nuclear Fuel Recycling Facility, Eyes TVA Used Fuel Partnership

The Aurora-INL groundbreaking, meanwhile, comes on the heels of Oklo’s plans unveiled on Sept. 5 to design, build, and operate America’s first privately funded nuclear fuel recycling facility in Oak Ridge, Tennessee. The company said the initial phase of that facility had secured $1.68 billion in investment, which would bolster its construction and potentially position it to begin producing fuel in the early 2030s.

Earlier this month, Oklo also noted it is in early discussions with the federal corporation TVA to recycle the utility’s used nuclear fuel at the new facility, while also exploring potential power sales from future Aurora powerhouses into TVA’s service territory. If realized, the collaboration could mark “the first time a U.S. utility has explored recycling its used fuel into clean electricity using modern electrochemical processes, turning a legacy liability into a resource while creating a secure fuel supply for the future,” Oklo said.

The Tennessee nuclear fuel recycling facility, which is slated to mark the first commercial-scale deployment of electrochemical recycling technology in the U.S., will “recover usable fuel material from used nuclear fuel and fabricate it into fuel for advanced reactors,” including fast reactors like Oklo’s Aurora powerhouses. “This process can reduce waste volumes for more economical, clean, and efficient disposal pathways,” the company said.

Oklo has made some gains in demonstrating its pyroprocessing technology, including a successful end-to-end recycling process with Argonne National Laboratory in July 2024. Essentially, Oklo’s pyroprocessing process will involve converting spent nuclear fuel (SNF) from light water reactors (which is in the form of ceramic oxide) to a metallic form. The initial preparation step removes the oxygen and prepares the fuel for the electrochemical separation. The metallic spent fuel is then placed in the molten salt environment, to which an electrical current is applied. The electrorefining process selectively separates the different components of the spent fuel, including the uranium, transuranic elements (such as plutonium and minor actinides), and fission products, including a range of radioisotopes.

In tandem, Oklo has been investigating the potential to harvest the valuable radioisotopes through its strategic subsidiary, Idaho-based Atomic Alchemy. Atomic Alchemy—also a selection under the DOE’s Reactor Pilot Program—has already begun site characterization work on a commercial isotope production facility at INL and has submitted a materials license application to the NRC for its demonstration facility, which will produce revenue-generating isotopes as an early step toward commercial operations. The subsidiary is also developing the Versatile Isotope Production Reactor (Viper), which it says is designed as a cost-effective approach to radioisotope production. DeWitte has compared the technology to “a Ford F-150 version of a reactor that does the job” rather than “a custom Formula 1 race car.” It will allow the company to “make neutrons more cheaply than maybe anything else to irradiate these materials and produce them,” he said.

A Turning Point for U.S. Nuclear Fuel Recycling?

The launch of the Tennessee facility signals a major shift for the U.S. nuclear policy and industry, which has grappled with an impasse on SNF disposal alongside a looming shortage of HALEU fuel needed for advanced reactors. According to the DOE, over 95,000 metric tons of SNF are safely stored across 79 sites in over 30 states.

As POWER recently reported, while nuclear fuel recycling is not new, previous efforts to establish nuclear fuel recycling in the U.S., dating back to the 1960s and 1970s, faltered owing to regulatory, political, and economic hurdles and suffered a setback when President Carter indefinitely deferred commercial reprocessing in 1977. Momentum for nuclear recycling has soared in recent months, driven by explicit federal policy shifts, including the May 2025 executive orders.

At the same time, recycling prospects are looking more attractive, underpinned by soaring demand for HALEU from advanced reactors, billions in private-sector investment in new demonstration plants, technological advances that cut recycling costs and enhance proliferation resistance, and active NRC engagement on regulatory pathways. Generally, recycling prospects are also riding on a reframing of SNF as a high-value resource capable of supplying vast energy while slashing waste volumes are collectively driving nuclear fuel recycling forward in the U.S.

U.S. Spent Nuclear Fuel Reprocessing May Be Making a Comeback—Here’s Why. A look at the history, economics, and evolving strategies shaping reprocessing efforts in the U.S.

In August, DeWitte noted that recycling offers a “massive reserve of material” since “used fuel is effectively 90-plus percent unused fuel. “ When combined with Oklo’s fast reactor technology, it enables “a very cost-transformative” approach where “the actual fuel produced from recycling will be a much lower cost than fresh fuel, like considerably less,” he said. Government stockpiles of downblended uranium and plutonium-based materials alone “could be made into fuel for more than 3 GW of powerhouses” without requiring additional enrichment, he said.

“Fuel is one of the most important inputs for advanced nuclear, and it’s one of the areas where Oklo has built a significant strategic advantage,” he explained. “Our design enables a differentiated fuel strategy built around three complementary sources: access to government stockpiles, commercial supply partnerships, and long-term recycling capabilities. This approach provides greater flexibility, cost control, and resilience than traditional fuel models.”

While the DOE in 2019 awarded the company 5 metric tons of HALEU for its first INL powerhouse, “we’re uniquely positioned to utilize additional government fuel stockpiles made available under recent executive orders, including enriched uranium and plutonium-based materials that don’t require further enrichment,” DeWitte said. “These stockpiles, effectively waste materials that would otherwise be destined for costly disposal programs can instead be turned into a productive asset for clean energy by Oklo.”

Second, Oklo is “working with enrichers such as Centrus and Hexium to meet both near-term and long-term commercial HALEU needs,” DeWitte said. The company has a signed memorandum of understanding with Centrus, which is “currently the only domestic producer of HALEU,” to supply Oklo powerhouses for early deployment. At the same time, Oklo is collaborating with Hexium to explore a laser-based enrichment method—atomic vapor laser isotope separation (AVLIS)—that DeWitte said “has the potential to significantly change cost curves” and enable “lower cost scalable production over time.” He also noted that advances in laser technology over the past 30 to 40 years make this “an interesting time now for this” approach, which could deliver “significant improvements in efficiency, cost, and operational characteristics” compared to centrifuge enrichment.

And third, “Our fast reactors can use recovered nuclear material from both today’s nuclear fleet and future advanced reactors, positioning us to recycle fuel over time and build a vertically integrated long-term supply model,” he said. “Together, these efforts form a comprehensive and resilient fuel strategy, one that supports near-term deployment, while building long-term supply independence.”",https://www.powermag.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/oklo-snow-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 04:59:36.200306

Hulac,,,,,https://www.njspotlightnews.org/2025/09/trump-moves-to-gut-us-power-to-regulate-greenhouse-gases/,"WASHINGTON — Cutting against overwhelming scientific evidence, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate the legal foundation that empowers the U.S. government to regulate greenhouses gases, which warm Earth to a perilous degree.
The agency this week closed the public comment period for the proposal, which is not finalized and will likely face legal challenges in federal court.
In a separate request, all 11 Democratic members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation urged EPA to drop its “dangerous” proposal request.
If the legal authority is revoked, federal administrations would be blocked from using that law to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.
“It is clear that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, both now and in the future.","WASHINGTON — Cutting against overwhelming scientific evidence, the Trump administration is trying to eliminate the legal foundation that empowers the U.S. government to regulate greenhouses gases, which warm Earth to a perilous degree.

The Environmental Protection Agency this summer moved to revoke its own authority to regulate the six primary heat-trapping gases, including carbon dioxide and methane, a highly potent gas that seeps from natural gas infrastructure. The agency this week closed the public comment period for the proposal, which is not finalized and will likely face legal challenges in federal court.

This attempt is the first time the EPA has tried to roll back the authority, called the “endangerment finding,” since its establishment in 2009 after

“For over a decade, the EPA has acknowledged that greenhouse gases are irreparably warming our climate and harm our communities,” New Jersey Attorney General Matt Platkin said Monday. “We will fight this dangerous action and protect our communities.”

Platkin and 22 other attorneys general, plus cities and counties, submitted a letter Monday to EPA, arguing the agency’s move is illegal and built on bad science.

In a separate request, all 11 Democratic members of New Jersey’s congressional delegation urged EPA to drop its “dangerous” proposal

request.

A repeal of the 2009 legal authority, which allows EPA to regulate emissions under the Clean Air Act, would deal a punishing and expansive blow to federal efforts to limit emissions from power plants, automobiles and industrial sources of carbon pollution.

Under presidential administrations of former presidents Barack Obama and Joe Biden, the EPA invoked the finding, saying that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and could be regulated under the Clean Air Act, to limit emissions from vehicles, power plants and industrial sites.

If the legal authority is revoked, federal administrations would be blocked from using that law to regulate greenhouse gas emissions.

“Repealing the endangerment finding would go against science and EPA’s core mission to protect public health and the environment,” Callie Sharp, an attorney with the Environmental Law and Policy Center, a nonpartisan environmental law group, told EPA officials in August at a hearing.

“It is clear that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare, both now and in the future. Those dangers will worsen if the EPA chooses to destroy its own policy tools to meaningfully address climate change,” the Democratic lawmakers said, noting New Jersey’s exposure to extreme flooding due to sea-level rise.

“New Jerseyans know all too well the devastating impacts of the worsening climate crisis to our cities, coastlines, and communities,” said Rep. Frank Pallone (D-6th), while Rep. Rob Menendez (D-8th) said EPA should “reverse course on this dangerous proposal” and recommit to doing the important, science-based work that the American people rely on, protecting all of us from worsening natural disasters, extreme heat, and floods.”

Both men sit on the House Energy and Commerce Committee, which has EPA jurisdiction. Rep. Tom Kean Jr. (R-7th) is also a committee member.

On Sept. 17, the National Academics of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine released a study that found the scientific proof that humans are placing current and future life at risk by burning fossil fuels — the core scientific fact of climate change — is rock solid.

“This study was undertaken with the ultimate aim of informing the EPA, following its call for public comments, as it considers the status of the endangerment finding,” said Shirley Tilghman, professor of molecular biology and public affairs, emeritus, and former president, Princeton University, and chair of the committee that wrote the report.

When he announced in July the move to attempt to rescind the finding, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin, a former Republican congressman from Long Island, called the decision “the largest deregulatory action in the history of the United States.”

“With this proposal, the Trump EPA is proposing to end sixteen years of uncertainty for automakers and American consumers,” Zeldin said in July as he announced the proposal at an Indiana car dealership.

President Donald Trump has for years cast doubt on established climate science, and his administration has proposed deep budget cuts for the EPA, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and NASA — 55%, 27% and 24%, respectively. Together, those departments perform some of the world’s most advanced climate science.

The Trump administration and Republican allies in Congress have taken a series of steps to weaken climate programs and pollution regulation, including allowing two New Jersey medical plants to pollute more, scores of industrial sites to release more hazardous air pollutants and to block New Jersey vehicle rules.

To bolster its case to end the 2009 holding, the result of a 2007 ruling from the Supreme Court that forced the U.S. to regulate carbon dioxide and other pollutants, the Trump administration has leaned on a recent Energy Department report that found human climate change is “less damaging economically than commonly believed.”

Energy Secretary Chris Wright, an executive from the hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, industry — a section of the oil and gas business — picked the authors of that report, which dozens of scientists debunked.

In their rebuttal, more than 85 scientists, including Pamela McElwee of Rutgers University, said “key assertions – including claims of no trends in extreme weather and the supposed broad benefits of carbon dioxide—are either misleading or fundamentally incorrect.”

“As someone who works on biodiversity and ecosystems, a glaring omission of the report is the complete absence of any review of the data indicating our natural world is rapidly changing in response to climate change,” McElwee said in a statement. “Rising temperatures and more frequent extreme events like marine heat waves, among other impacts, are changing where species live, their population sizes, and when they hibernate or migrate.”",https://www.njspotlightnews.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/123/2021/04/Chimney-pollution-smog-climate-change-greenhouse-gas.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 00:58:34.279351

All this signals that ASEAN might no longer be the sole preferred target market for Chinese green technology investments.
As a result, nations looking to attract Chinese green technology manufacturing capital need to appeal to those motivations.","In 2024, clean energy investments contributed approximately USD 1.9 trillion or around 10% to China’s GDP, with the sector growing three times faster than the Chinese economy overall. Furthermore, the leading investor in clean energy worldwide is now providing an opportunity for other countries to also capitalise on the economic growth opportunities of the energy transition by scaling up overseas investments in green manufacturing.

In a first-of-its-kind database that tracks the amount of green foreign manufacturing investments originating from China, researchers from the Net Zero Policy Lab (NZIPL) have found that, thanks to China’s green manufacturing boom, economies from around the world are entering the clean technology industry or advancing up the value chain. For developing nations in the Global South, in particular, this presents a significant opportunity to boost their economies, support their climate commitments and ensure access to affordable and innovative green technologies.

China’s Booming Green Manufacturing Industry Has Brought Investments to Over 50 Countries Across All Regions

According to the new China Low Carbon Technology FDI Database, “China’s Green Leap Outward: The rapid scale-up of overseas Chinese clean-tech manufacturing investments,” since 2022 alone, China’s overseas investments in sectors like solar, wind, batteries, EVs and green hydrogen have surged past USD 227 billion. Importantly, these investments have been allocated to 54 countries across every major region.

NZIPL’s database, which features 461 green technology manufacturing projects announced between 2011 and the first half of 2025, finds that investments have started surging more significantly in the past three years. Over 80% of all projects (387) have been launched since 2022. Last year saw a record 165 announced projects, with Chinese firms committing more than USD 210 billion (the high-end estimate reaches nearly USD 250 billion), or approximately 88% of total disclosed capital.

Interestingly, the database reveals that, in each year since 2022, the pledged investment exceeded the total amount committed over the entire previous decade. The researchers describe the surge of overseas green manufacturing investment as “unprecedented”.

In terms of recipient sectors, the analysis reveals that while solar dominated pre-COVID, since 2021, capital has fanned out to battery materials, full battery plants, EVs, charging equipment, wind and early-stage green hydrogen.

According to the database, over 75% of the green technology projects financed by China are in the Global South or emerging markets, with ASEAN countries home to most of them. Europe remains the key market for downstream battery investments. Other findings include the Middle East and North Africa (MENA) region’s 20% jump in new projects registered in 2024.

China’s accelerated clean energy transition has long been reshaping the global energy and green technology landscapes, dramatically reducing green technology costs and accelerating their uptake in other countries. As a result, Ember forecasts that China’s fossil fuel consumption is about to peak and begin falling, triggering a global decline.

“China has opened the door to a new energy future by building electro-technologies at a vast scale, slashing costs and raising the ceiling of possibility,” notes Sam Butler-Sloss, research manager at Ember. “The consequences reach far beyond its borders, enabling the emerging market energy leapfrog and swinging global fossil fuel demand from unrelenting growth to the brink of structural decline.”

ASEAN as China’s Sustainable Manufacturing Investment Hotspot

NZIPL’s database reveals that investments in solar have dominated, with over USD 57 billion allocated to 135 overseas projects. ASEAN remains the key focus market, receiving the bulk of this capital. Indonesia tops the lists for the most projects and most capital attracted by a wide margin. Vietnam, Malaysia, and Thailand are also among the top five countries with the most projects.

Battery-materials manufacturing is also rapidly growing, and, with 2025 deals included, the total will surpass USD 62 billion, making it the largest single slice of China’s overseas green technology investments. ASEAN nations again dominate, with Indonesia attracting the majority of the investments due to its critical nickel and cobalt reserves.

Regarding EV manufacturing, ASEAN and Europe attract the most significant shares of Chinese capital. NZIPL’s analysis finds that the former remains the top choice due to the lower costs and preferential access to regional markets, while investments in Europe are intended to scale local capacity and meet soaring EV demand across the bloc in compliance with rules of origin.

Regarding wind, Central Asia hosts the most projects, while India also continues to draw Chinese capital.

ASEAN’s Dominance Not a Given with Other Regions Catching Up

According to NZIPL’s database, the ASEAN region has consistently been the primary destination for Chinese overseas green technology manufacturing investments, accounting for approximately half of all projects before 2024. The analysis identifies several reasons for this sustained dominance, including ASEAN’s strategic role as both a manufacturing hub and proximity to Chinese supply chains, its role as a gateway for re-exports and the local business environment, which is familiar to Chinese investors.

However, while ASEAN countries have enjoyed consistent and steady growth in Chinese green technology investments, NZIPL’s findings indicate that the tide might be turning.

In 2024, ASEAN’s share in project counts dropped to its lowest level, mainly due to growth seen across other regions. For example, the researchers identify MENA as the most notable emerging hotspot, with the number of projects there surging from almost none in 2021 to over 20% of total investments in 2024, amounting to nearly USD 50 billion.

All this signals that ASEAN might no longer be the sole preferred target market for Chinese green technology investments. Among the reasons is China’s willingness to seek diversification in the geographic distribution of its capital, as evidenced by the fact that countries in Central Asia and the Caucasus region recorded their first China-backed green technology manufacturing projects in 2024.

Another reason why other regions are quickly making ground and gaining popularity among Chinese investors is their expanding green industrial policies and strategic positioning, as the case of MENA proves.

According to the researchers, a combination of factors drives the discrepancies in project allocation across different markets, including the election of US President Donald Trump and investors’ worries about facing secondary sanctions and tighter rules of origin, tariff concerns, geopolitical tensions and differences in industrial focus.

What ASEAN Can Do to Retain Its Position as the Top Destination For Chinese Green Technology Manufacturing Investments

After analysing early 2025 data, NZIPL unveils a cooling trend in China’s overseas build-out. Despite an expected uptick in the latter half of the year, the researchers note that the overall trend signals consolidation rather than acceleration. Diving into country-specific insights reveals that, while early hotspots like Indonesia continue to enjoy a steady influx of new projects, markets like Vietnam and Thailand are seeing a drop in recent announcements.

According to the report’s authors, three main reasons drive China’s investment motivations — access to host country markets, access to third-country markets and access to raw materials. As a result, nations looking to attract Chinese green technology manufacturing capital need to appeal to those motivations. In the case of ASEAN, the key to continuing to build on its role as the dominating region for Chinese green technology manufacturing investments is in retaining its attractiveness as an export-oriented production base and further improving its FDI openness to remain a step ahead of emerging new hotspots and competitive markets like MENA. This can become possible through a series of steps, including addressing regulatory and permitting issues to ease project development and attract projects that have faced cancellations in other markets due to burdensome procedures.

In the case of Vietnam, Malaysia and Thailand, which host a high number of projects with overall low investment figures (mainly solar), there is an opportunity to open up alleys for manufacturing other green technologies with higher capital intensity. This is crucial since Europe and the US, which historically have been attracting high-value projects, are now seeing capital steering toward other markets such as Latam, Central Asia and MENA.

According to NZIPL, useful measures for governments receiving Chinese FDI also include introducing incentives such as tax holidays, concessional land and long-term financing, especially for capital-intensive sectors like battery technology. Leveraging resource endowments, as in the case of Indonesia, and planning for accommodating megaprojects by ensuring grid and port infrastructure, as well as talent with the necessary skills, are other crucial measures.

ASEAN has the market fundamentals, geographic advantage and a familiar and welcoming business environment for Chinese investments. Considering that the region is acting from a position of power, the key is not letting the opportunities slip. Doing so in the face of growing competition requires proactiveness — not a wait-and-see approach.",https://energytracker.asia/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Chinas-Green-Manufacturing-Industry-Brings-Massive-Investments-to-54-Countries-Photo-by-Harisankar-on-Unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 05:58:31.428662

The Horse Heaven Hills project was initially permitted by then-Governor Jay Inslee for up to 222 windmills, more than 5,000 acres of solar panels, and large battery storage facilities across 24 miles of mostly farmland from Finley to Benton City in the Tri-Cities metropolitan area, the conjoined cities of Kennewick, Pasco and Richland in southeastern Washington.

Last year, EFSEC reduced the scope of the Horse Heaven project to protect endangered ferruginous hawks and their habitat by creating a buffer zone around their nests. EFSEC also aimed to address other public concerns, such as visual impacts on the Tri-Cities skyline, wildlife migration corridors, and impacts to cultural resources.

Then-Gov. Jay Inslee then requested EFSEC to revisit these mitigation requirements to allow for a larger project, prioritizing clean energy needs over the stricter safeguards.

EFSEC approved most of the original project, nixing only about three dozen proposed turbines.

As reported by The Center Square, in December, a citizen group called Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S., Benton County and the Yakama Nation filed separate lawsuits against the project.

Fast-forward to a meeting last week in which EFSEC members, who are mostly state agency employees, indicated they are inclined to prevent Scout Clean Energy from putting windmills, solar panels, or batteries within two miles of five ferruginous hawk nests within the center of the project zone. EFSEC has agreed on 1-kilometer buffers for 39 additional nests.

On Tuesday, Paul Krupin with Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S. told The Center Square that while it’s encouraging to see EFSEC again potentially scaling back the project, he has not seen details of exactly what that will look like. He contends EFSEC has not addressed many of the additional concerns raised by community members, including quality of life and the anticipated loss of property values in the region.

“We don’t know what the council’s going to do. How many turbines, and where are they? They have not told us, and so we don’t know what the council is voting on, and we don’t have any way to really evaluate the true impacts,” he said. “It’s a [mysterious] process.”

Krupin added that EFSEC has failed to address firefighting concerns.

“Between Benton City and Kennewick and up in Canyon Lakes, we have fires here. We need these 727s and DC-10s, so that’s what we’re fighting for,” he said. “And if Scout gets to put those turbines on the ridgeline for 25 miles, there’s 100,000 people within four to six miles of the visual site of all these, and experts predict a 20 to 30% drop in real estate value, which will be devastating. They [EFSEC] are only listening to the governor, and the company talk about economic viability without taking economic harm into account.”

Krupin also raised concerns about a recent change by EFSEC during a June meeting. Members agreed to give Director Sonia Bumpus sole authority to approve nearly two dozen plans and projects overseen by EFSEC.

“Implementing this policy will contribute to timely completion of the plan review process and is consistent with EFSEC’s past practice of delegating certain review and approval authorities to the EFSEC Director. The adoption of this policy formalizes the delegation of this authority to the EFSEC Director and specifies the type of plans to which this delegated authority extends,” noted EFSEC Policy 16-01 document dated June 25.

“You can’t do that without going through official rulemaking,” Krupin said. “The Legislature needs to give you the authority. You can’t give that authority to yourself.”

In August, Tri-Cities C.A.R.E.S. and Friends of the Columbia Gorge filed a petition for judicial review against EFSEC over its policy change, which Krupin argued was made to expedite projects before federal tax dollars evaporate.

“President Trump came out with directives to minimize wind turbines and solar nationwide, and it basically says you have to begin construction by July 4th, 2026. You have to begin construction in order to get the tax credits that these companies need to build and operate, so they’re racing to get these things going,” Krupin said. “Now EFSEC has this new policy, and how do you think they are going to approve all these permits without any oversight whatsoever, and without any public knowledge and engagement whatsoever? I’ve never seen a process like this. I mean, never on earth did I ever imagine that I would see something like this.”

Chad Thompson, Scout Clean Energy’s media contact, emailed a July response letter sent to EFSEC, which said in part, “While ferruginous hawks are listed as endangered in Washington, they are fairly common across their range, which encompasses the western U.S. and Canada. Their rarity in Washington is a function of geography as much as anything, as they are only in the state during the breeding season, and migrate to other parts of their range during the non-breeding season.”

EFSEC responded to a question about the modified site proposal following initial publication of this article.

“Following Council discussion, staff indicated a draft resolution will be developed that the Council can discuss and vote on at a future meeting. These steps may impact the project proponent’s site map. We have not received updated site plans to reflect this discussion,” Karl Holappa, EFSEC public information officer, emailed The Center Square.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/thecentersquare.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/f/80/f8082e7a-ced7-11ef-9444-7ba83e62af6d/67804dfa2d7ed.image.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 00:58:40.841439

Air Force Roofing founded by Joel Alcocer announced that it is now one of the few roofing contractors in South Florida qualified to install the Tesla Solar Roof a premium code ready roof replacement that generates clean electricity while delivering hurricane grade durability. The advancement positions Air Force Roofing to help Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach residents replace aging tile or shingle roofs with a Tesla Solar Roof that can cut energy bills while protecting homes to the highest industry standards.

Data backed savings made for Broward County. Fort Lauderdale households pay about $0.16 per kWh and use roughly 20,256 kWh per year. A properly sized Tesla Solar Roof can offset most or all of that usage. At today’s local rates offsetting 20,256 kWh equals about $3,240 in annual bill avoidance. Even a 10 kW Tesla Solar Roof that produces about 15,000 kWh per year would avoid about $2,400 annually before incentives. These figures reflect local EnergySage data for Fort Lauderdale and typical South Florida solar yield of about 1,500 kWh per kW year.

Federal Incentive. The Residential Clean Energy Credit (Internal Revenue Code Section 25D) provides a 30% federal tax credit for qualified residential clean energy systems including solar panels and solar roofing tiles such as the Tesla Solar Roof. This credit applies only to the solar portion of the project (panels or tiles inverters wiring and batteries if paired) and does not apply to unrelated non solar roofing materials or structural costs. The credit remains at 30% through 2032 then steps down to 26% in 2033 and 22% in 2034 before expiring in 2035 unless extended by Congress.

Florida Incentives. While Florida does not have a state income tax credit it does provide:

100% property tax exemption on the added value of solar systems

Sales tax exemption on solar equipment purchases

This means installing a Tesla Solar Roof in Florida qualifies for both the 30% federal tax credit on the solar portion and Florida’s state tax exemptions maximizing return on investment for homeowners.

Net metering support from Florida utilities. Florida’s statewide net metering rule enables customers of investor owned utilities including Florida Power & Light FPL to receive bill credits at the retail rate for excess solar generation with FPL applying a customary 115% sizing guideline relative to past usage. Credits typically roll over monthly with annual true up practices defined by utility tariffs. These policies are important levers in achieving the projected savings from a Tesla Solar Roof.

Hurricane ready performance and Class leading ratings. Beyond energy savings a Tesla Solar Roof gives a South Florida home a fully integrated new roof replacement with Class A fire Class F wind and industry leading impact ratings supported by a 25 year product and power warranty. For homeowners replacing aging clay tile or asphalt shingles this means fewer roof penetrations than conventional rack mounted panels and a single envelope designed to handle severe weather common to Broward County.

Why now for Fort Lauderdale and Pompano Beach. Florida households use more electricity than the US average due to heavy air conditioning loads making the Tesla Solar Roof a targeted way to rein in long term energy costs while modernizing curb appeal. With strong sun (NREL PVWatts and Project Sunroof datasets show robust output across South Florida) and stable incentives a roof replacement that also generates power has become a financially and functionally compelling upgrade for the region.

Leadership and service. Joel Alcocer emphasized that the team’s mission is to combine precision roofing with modern energy engineering so homeowners receive one coordinated project one warranty stack and one dedicated installer. By pairing Tesla Solar Roof installation expertise with local permitting know how Air Force Roofing helps Broward County homeowners navigate product selection interconnection and utility paperwork with fewer handoffs and faster time to energy savings.

Since 2019, the US has been a net exporter of energy, with 2023 marking a record year for energy exports and peak oil production levels. But sustaining this independence in a reliable and affordable way remains a challenge.

A new report from the Committee for Economic Development (CED), the public policy center of The Conference Board, warns that rising permitting delays, global clean tech competition, regulatory imbalances, and uncertainty around tax credits could jeopardize America's energy advantage.

""Energy independence isn't just about production—it's about building a resilient, diversified energy system that can power new technologies, support exports, and meet growing demand,"" said David K. Young, President of CED. ""By modernizing infrastructure, balancing fossil fuels and renewables, and letting markets guide the way, we can keep the US secure and competitive.""

The report urges policymakers and business leaders to adopt a pragmatic, market-driven approach to energy—one that supports innovation, maintains regulatory neutrality, and leverages the full spectrum of US energy resources to strengthen long-term economic leadership.

Policy Recommendations for a Sustainable Energy Strategy

To sustain US energy independence and promote energy transmission and energy resilience, policymakers and business leaders should recognize that:

Both fossil fuels and renewables are important parts of energy independence.

The power of markets should drive energy policy as much as possible, and government should seek to interfere with or skew markets as little as possible.

Regulation should be based upon sound science, promote fair competition, and be as source-neutral as possible to permit markets to work.

As tax credits for clean energy are sunsetted, states will have an increasingly important role in promoting US clean energy industries, which preserves US jobs in these industries.

Permitting reform is essential for the modernization and expansion of the electric grid, including adding new capacity from all sources.

US business has an active and urgent role to play in leading energy innovation and growing exports of both liquefied natural gas (LNG) and clean energy products as well as promoting emissions reductions in their business interest.

TC Energy will focus on ramping up US investments to meet soaring power demand despite signals Canada is showing a more energy-friendly stance.

“The returns we can earn in the United States are significantly more attractive than they are in Canada,” Chief Executive Officer and President Francois Poirier said in an interview during the 2025 Concordia Annual Summit in New York. “I expect that the US will continue to be where we’ll invest.”

The pipeline company is seeking to tap into a push by US President Donald Trump, who recently signed executive orders aimed at boosting artificial intelligence development in the US by loosening regulations and expanding energy supplies for data centers, amid a broader desire for US energy dominance.

TC Energy recently announced plans to invest $8.5 billion into US energy infrastructure projects planned over the next five years. Poirier also pointed to Mexico as a priority for new investment.

“We have quite a few projects on the drawing board in Mexico, which would include getting natural gas from West Texas into the Northwest part of Mexico,” Poirier said. “There’s definitely the potential to expand” the company’s Topolobampo pipeline and “connect that line to West Texas.”

Still, TC Energy remains bullish on Canada with Prime Minister Mark Carney’s decision to speed construction of a major expansion of LNG Canada, a large-scale liquefied natural gas export project on the country’s west coast.

The project, known as LNG Canada’s Phase 2, would require doubling TC Energy’s Coastal GasLink pipeline’s capacity by adding five to six compressor stations. The capital investment would total several billion dollars, according to Poirier.

Clean energy capacity alone does not guarantee resilience — trust and transparency require policy coordination and governance capability.","ASEAN’s clean energy boom is taking shape. But without coordination, the region risks being locked into low-value roles in the green economy. China has emerged as ASEAN’s largest clean energy financier and now dominates regional electric vehicle and battery markets. Yet beneath the investment momentum, policies, standards, skills development and knowledge transfer remain fragmented. A China–ASEAN clean energy–industrial mechanismcould fill this gap.

Across the region, operations such as nickel processing in Indonesia and mining in the Philippines have drawn criticism for unsafe labour conditions, community displacement and habitat loss. US tariffs of up to 3500 per cent on ASEAN solar exports imposed in April 2025 exposed how fragile regional supply chains are. Without a framework to align industrial policy, workforce upgrading and environmental safeguards, Southeast Asia risks remaining a low-cost assembly hub, dependent on external capital but unable to shape the rules of the energy transition.

For Beijing, deeper clean energy engagement with ASEAN aligns with strategic priorities such as diversifying export markets, embedding outbound manufacturing in emerging industrial hubs and locking in supply chains for critical minerals and green technologies. For ASEAN, China offers capital, technology, and scale.

ASEAN already has platforms such as the ASEAN-China Clean Energy Cooperation Centre and the ASEAN+3 Clean Energy Roundtable Dialogue, but they lack the mandate and focus to align investment, industrial upgrading and governance on a regional scale. What is missing is a dedicated mechanism to link clean energy cooperation with industrial policy — one that embeds environmental, social, and governance (ESG) safeguards from the outset.

A China–ASEAN clean energy–industrial mechanism could anchor cooperation in labour and skills development. The mechanism could convene thematic working groups, support regional training hubs and co-design curricula with industry and academia to match labour upgrading with institutional commitment to build a capable workforce with structured training programs.

The mechanism could bridge the disconnect between capital and capacity. While investment is pouring into electric vehicles and renewable projects, enabling environments remain uneven. Drawing on models such as Singapore’s FAST-P and Indonesia’s Danantara, the mechanism could link Chinese policy banks, ASEAN state-owned enterprises and global financiers to develop ESG-anchored green industrial zones that pair infrastructure with manufacturing. A curated pipeline of bankable regional projects would turn capital inflows into strategic industrial capacity.

The mechanism can also create the institutional alignment required to move from one-off projects to enduring partnerships. Clean energy capacity alone does not guarantee resilience — trust and transparency require policy coordination and governance capability. The mechanism could host Track 1.5 dialogues, enabling joint procurement reforms, decarbonisation case studies and ESG compliance workshops.

Verifiable sustainability safeguards must be continuous and enforceable, not just contractual at project outset. Improving ASEAN’s environmental record will require Chinese corporates to adopt higher operational standards, ASEAN ministries to embed clear ESG regulations and local authorities to enforce them consistently — with the mechanism serving as the channel to align and monitor these efforts.

Initial participation could focus on ASEAN members with significant clean energy and industrial cooperation with China, such as Indonesia, Vietnam and Malaysia, before expanding as political and market conditions allow. A smaller coalition of willing states sidesteps ASEAN consensus paralysis and gives proof of concept.

But it would need a clear ministerial mandate spanning industry, labour and environment portfolios. The mechanism could be co-chaired by a standing Chinese lead ministry and a rotating ASEAN co-chair aligned with the ASEAN Chair, ensuring continuity on China’s side and regional ownership on ASEAN’s.

Private businesses’ roles would go beyond consultation. As conveners, firms could commit capital and expertise to joint research and development, ESG compliance and local partnerships on supply chains, helping translate government frameworks into tangible industry practice and durable benefits.

For ASEAN, such a mechanism would operationalise centrality by aligning national strategies with regional goals and enabling coherent engagement with external partners. For China, it would provide a structured channel to address ESG concerns, reduce friction and ensure investments generate long-term goodwill and influence.

While the mechanism centres on China given its economic gravity, it would not operate in isolation. Japan and South Korea remain important partners whose engagement could be channelled through the existing roundtable dialogues. This would allow the mechanism to remain focused on aligning cooperation with China, while still complementing and reinforcing wider regional partnerships.",https://eastasiaforum.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/2024-03-26T152237Z_345151988_RC2LT6AGXEA4_RTRMADP_3_TOTW-SOLAR-1024x694.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 20:59:13.378085

Ninety-eight years ago, the nation’s largest power grid operator was founded here by utilities serving Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro threatened to pull his state out of the coalition.

“It is time to get serious about making significant reform,” Shapiro said, at a conference he convened with representatives from all 13 states now in the grid to “chart a new course” for operator PJM Interconnection.

“If PJM refuses to change, we will be forced to go in a different direction,” he said.

Pennsylvania is the largest energy producer in the grid. Its absence would impact electricity consumers across the region, which stretches from Illinois to North Carolina.

Data centers built to fuel artificial intelligence technology are driving huge increases in electricity demand—and in prices for consumers. Shapiro and other elected leaders like Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin blame PJM for delays in approving new power projects, creating a bottleneck that is making the situation worse. Shapiro, a Democrat, and Youngkin, a Republican, want states to have a say in PJM’s decisions; right now, government officials do not have a voice on PJM’s board.

Speaking at the conference later in the day, PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is stepping down at the end of this year, said that “fingerpointing” wasn’t helpful.

“There’s an element of responsibility on both sides,” he said, meaning the states and PJM. All parties need to work together and ask, “‘How do we solve this?’” he said.

At the end of the conference, 11 of the states’ governors’ offices—all but Kentucky and West Virginia—announced they had formed a collaborative to continue to work together on the energy issues discussed at the meeting.

Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the joint criticism of PJM by multiple state governors “very unusual” and “the highest level of state engagement with PJM I’ve ever seen.” He said in an email that he thinks there’s a strong chance for governance reforms.

Shapiro’s statements come two months after nine governors in the PJM region demanded in a letter that PJM reserve two board seats to be filled with nominees by the states. Last month, those nominees surfaced as former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements.

PJM, which has conducted a months-long effort with a consultant to propose candidates, initially responded that it would consider the recommendations. It is expected to make a decision this Thursday.

“PJM is mired in a crisis of confidence,” Christie said at the conference. “Consumers have lost confidence in the people who run their grid.”

Christie said PJM needs a “new constitution,” one that reimagines the organization in a way that changes its governance structure to reflect the fact that PJM is a “policy-making body.”

Shapiro said PJM has “months, not years” to make changes, or Pennsylvania will take steps to leave the organization. “We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects, and we’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” he said. Shapiro did not provide details about what this new arrangement would look like.

New Jersey lawmakers have already taken up the issue. In June, the state Assembly passed a bill directing its Board of Public Utilities to work with other states and study alternatives for addressing skyrocketing electricity prices—including the option of leaving PJM altogether. A companion measure has been introduced in the state Senate but has not yet been assigned to a committee.

In remarks delivered remotely to the conference, Youngkin confirmed that he and his allies are working on bills that seek to do the same.

“The bottom line is that when PJM succeeds, we all succeed together. But if reforms stall, we will act and do what is needed to protect the families and businesses who depend on us,” Youngkin said.

In his recorded message for the conference attendees, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said, “Thirteen governors have united with a single urgent message for our regional grid operator, and it underscores the seriousness of the crisis that we now face. The path forward requires real transparency and accountability from PJM and a truly collaborative role for states in the governance process.”

Maryland, as a net importer of electricity, is frustrated by PJM’s delays connecting new clean-energy sources to the grid and opaque governance rules that Moore repeatedly said are disrupting the state’s climate targets and hurting households and businesses.

On Monday, ahead of his recorded message, Moore huddled with state Senate leadership in Annapolis to announce $200 million in direct energy bill rebates for low-income households to counter the rising prices.

Without commenting on how PJM should be governed, the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM and states should require data center developers to “pull their own weight” by investing in new energy generation—a policy push during the meeting colloquially tagged as “bring your own generation” or B.Y.O.G.

“The big message today was that prices are unsustainably high and PJM needs to do a better job protecting customers,” Rutigliano said. “The truth is that this crisis was caused by data centers and nearly all the money is going to old power plants.”

In a statement to Inside Climate News, PJM spokesperson Dan Lockwood said that “meeting the demands of a rapidly changing energy landscape will require solutions that extend beyond any one institution.”

“It will require PJM, the industry and especially our states all working in concert,” he said.

Asthana, PJM’s CEO, emphasized the scale of change that will be necessary to meet the challenges of powering AI now and in the future, not just at PJM but across the country. “If we’re going to win this race, I think we need to think differently,” he said.

What’s not clear is whether, or how, states leaving PJM would lead to a more affordable or reliable system.

Most of the power plants in PJM compete on an open market as a result of decisions by lawmakers in various states in the 1990s and 2000s to introduce more competition into the electricity sector. This restructuring meant that regulated utilities were limited to providing the delivery of electricity, while independent power producers would build and operate power plants.

Representatives of independent power producers said on Monday that they can understand the frustration with PJM, but they don’t see how it solves anything for states to leave.

“While we continue to stand in favor of common-sense reforms that will improve power market functionality, grid reliability, and consumer affordability, the actions taken by some elected officials do nothing more than disrupt PJM’s ability to do its job,” said a statement from Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group whose members include independent power producers.

Jon Gordon, director at Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents advanced generation technologies, said despite PJM’s high prices, participation within the regional grid provides more efficiency and competition for electricity sales, which keeps costs lower for ratepayers. The regime used prior to PJM’s shared marketplace allowed utilities to overbuild with less incentive to keep prices in check.

“I don’t think anybody wants to go back to that. … We just need to make improvements so we get all the benefits of competition but none of the inefficiencies,” Gordon said, adding that a PJM departure may mean state agencies could have to negotiate contracts with producers. “If these studies are fair and unbiased, I think they’re going to show it’s pretty risky to leave PJM and there’s probably not enough benefit to justify the potential risks.”

The challenge with PJM is the political diversity of the region that includes Republican West Virginia and Democratic New Jersey, compared to more ideologically homogeneous New England, Gordon added. The governors in the PJM region have now realized they don’t have much influence over decisions affecting how new generation sources get onto the grid.

“I think the states are completely different on whether it’s fossil or renewables generation,” Gordon said. “But they all agree that they want a voice, and they want lower prices.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gov-Josh-Shapiro-2048x1366-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-24 01:57:56.008722

This is yet another about-face for Bentley, which was originally aiming to only sell EVs by 2030. The ultra-luxury brand then pushed that date back to 2035 and now, who knows.

Speaking to Autocar, Bentley CEO Frank-Steffen Walliser appeared to blame the change on Audi and Porsche. The three brands are closely related as they share platforms, powertrains, and components. As a result, their decision to continue offering internal combustion engines has impacted Bentley.

Gas Still On The Menu

That means we can expect gas-powered versions of the next-generation Bentayga, Continental, and Flying Spur. This is said to be a concession to North America and the Middle East, which aren’t keen on ultra-luxury EVs. As Walliser explained, “There is a dip in demand for luxury electric vehicles, and customer demand is not yet strong enough to support an all-electric strategy.”

Despite the change, Bentley is still embracing electrification and is planning to launch a new plug-in hybrid or electric vehicle every year starting in 2026. This kicks off with their electric Urban SUV and will presumably continue with a greater emphasis on plug-in hybrids.

Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Sonja Nowakowski, chairperson of the task force, said generation has changed in Montana in recent years.
Just one person appeared to have offered public comment, a written remark a task force member read aloud.
She outlined three topics task force subgroups would focus on — energy generation; growing demand; and transmission and markets.
“With our abundant resources and outstanding potential, Montana can and should play a key role in unleashing American energy,” Gianforte said.","Electricity demand in western states is projected to increase 20% during the next decade — double what has been expected, Gov. Greg Gianforte said Monday.

“It’s clear we’ve got to meet this challenge head on to secure affordable, reliable energy for Montana families and businesses,” Gianforte said.

At their initial meeting Monday, the governor asked members of his newly formed energy task force to “dig deep, be creative, cast a wide net.” He asked the group to explore groundbreaking technologies for the state, including nuclear.

Gianforte created the Energy Advisory Council in a Sept. 10 executive order to provide him with short- and long-term recommendations to increase the supply of affordable and reliable energy.

In general, Gianforte said he was tasking the group with providing “actionable” recommendations to “unleash American made energy.”

He said Montana has an “historic opportunity” to make progress with President Donald Trump back in the White House.

The task force, a group of 20 industry representatives, energy experts, large consumers, and legislators, asked how much more energy generation Montana needs, how much transmission capacity is available, and how to turn the page on “negative press” about data centers.

Montana Department of Environmental Quality Director Sonja Nowakowski, chairperson of the task force, said generation has changed in Montana in recent years.

It has more energy capacity but less generation, with the closures of two coal fired plants at Colstrip and opening of “more variable resources,” such as wind, according to her presentation.

Data in the presentation said since 2019, wind capacity has increased 162% and wind generation has increased 93.6%.

But Nowakowski said demand is up even as generation is down — “We need to do something about that.”

And she said not much has changed with transmission in recent years.

Nowakowski said the group had significant expertise, it would have hard conversations during the next year, and she encouraged members to continually think about pushing the Treasure State forward.

“How can we make Montana first? I’m competitive. I want Montana to be first,” Nowakowski said.

She also said she wanted U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright and others at the national level “to know Montana is ready and open for business.”

In response to a question from state Sen. Chris Pope, a Bozeman Democrat, about whether reducing demand was part of the discussion, Nowakowski said “everything is on the table,” including energy efficiency.

“The cheapest electron is the one we save,” Nowakowski said.

Just one person appeared to have offered public comment, a written remark a task force member read aloud.

The person said they thought the makeup of task force members leaned toward those who favored fossil fuels and asked the group to consider including representation from the Montana Environmental Information Center.

Nowakowski, however, said the group’s charge in making recommendations included “fuel neutrality,” and she said the governor also had promoted an “all of the above” strategy for energy.

She outlined three topics task force subgroups would focus on — energy generation; growing demand; and transmission and markets.

The themes all three subgroups would consider are consumer perspectives, governance, regional markets, and best practices and innovation.

Gianforte said Montana already is a leader when it comes to energy resources and generation, and it’s ready to do more for producers and consumers, and for affordability and security.

They’re concerned about the situation and the possible effects that this pipeline would have on their families.

The letters came from Enbridge, dated Sept. 10th. In the letter, is a request for landowners to authorize a CO2 sequestration facility (called “The Project” throughout the letter) to perform survey activities for the project.

Survey types include civil, environmental, and cultural resources, according to the letter from Enbridge.

The letter reads, in part:

You are receiving this letter because your property has been identified as being potentially affected by the Project’s CO2 pipeline route. To further assist in analyzing and refining the proposed routes, civil, environmental, and cultural survey information is needed.

The Project is requesting your authorization to access a portion of your property for the

limited purpose of performing certain survey activities in connection with the Project. These civil, environmental, and cultural resource survey activities are necessary to thoroughly evaluate the proposed routes. Project surveys will be conducted in a minimal amount of

time with the goal of little to no inconvenience to you or to other landowners.

Survey work is scheduled to begin in your area within the next few weeks.

The survey activities planned along a portion of your property within the proposed routes, and any minimal impacts that may result, are more fully described in the enclosure entitled “Description of Survey Activities.” While we do not anticipate any damage to your property

because of these surveys, please be assured that you will be compensated if damage to your property or crops occurs as a direct result of these activities. Granting us authorization to access your property for the purpose of conducting these surveys does not grant any other rights to the Project, such as easement or construction rights. Your consent to survey and

cooperation would be sincerely appreciated.

On Sept. 10, 1PointFive and Enbridge Inc. announced the formation of a joint venture to develop the Pelican Sequestration Hub and transportation infrastructure in Louisiana. 1PointFive is responsible for developing the facilities that will store carbon dioxide underground, and Enbridge will build and operate pipelines from customer facilities to this hub, according to a press release.

“The hub enables vital investments in manufacturing and energy production to increase Louisiana’s ability to export its products globally,” the press release states.

District 8 Councilman Dean Coates is concerned about the situation, and is frustrated that he was unaware of this project until constituents began reaching out to him regarding these survey letters late last week.

“I’m just trying to find out what’s going on and find out what concerns the people have so that I can try to get some answers,” Coates said to UWK.

Coates is meeting with a company representative on Wednesday, Sept. 24, before holding a public meeting at 6 p.m. the same day in the Livingston Parish Council Chambers (20355 Government Blvd., Livingston). The town hall will allow people to find out more information about the proposed project and ask questions.

He said he has spoken with the project’s company about attending the town hall meeting, too, but is unsure whether any representatives from the company will be present for the public to speak with.

“This is just me trying to give people an outlet to vent to us about what’s going on and educate us as well as maybe I can give them some information,” Coates said.

One of the things Coates is aiming to find out more about is whether this project utilizes eminent domain and meets state requirements. In June 2025, the Louisiana Legislature updated language regarding eminent domain or “expropriation” for carbon storage.

Coates said that people have called him about the survey letters, saying they are feeling pressure from the company to permit them to conduct the surveys.

“They’re telling me, ‘I can’t tell them no.’ I said, ‘Tell them, No.’ If you don’t want them on your land, tell them no,” he said.

Coates said it’s important for all residents—not just in the area of this current project—to remain aware and informed. He said that “getting in the fight early” is important for those who want to stop projects from moving forward so close to home.

“Just because it’s not on your doorstep right now does not mean it will not be on your doorstep. You need to attend these meetings and get involved before it ends up there, because once they start pumping this stuff, we’re not gonna be able to stop it.”

The letter from Enbridge includes a “Project Hotline” number for questions or concerns: 1 (866) 315-9447.

However, a recent study has revealed much more immediate benefits that are measured in human life, the Guardian reported.

According to a study led by Princeton University, efforts to switch to clean energy and reduce the production of heat-trapping air pollution in the U.S. have already produced palpable benefits in every state and, more than that, in almost every county in the country. Climate action has led to improved health nationwide.

Not only that, but we can continue to reduce the death toll caused by particle air pollution. Within the next five years, we could see 6,000 fewer pollution-related deaths per year, or we could see an increase, depending on how we approach air pollution now. Other analyses have revealed that this would save our economy billions of dollars.

""Climate actions not only reduce carbon emissions but also bring significant air-quality improvements to regions with historically high pollution levels,"" said lead author Xinyuan Huang, according to the Guardian.

""Under ambitious climate policies, states like West Virginia and Kentucky could see deaths from particle pollution decrease by over 19% in 2030, demonstrating the substantial health benefits of shifting away from fossil fuels.""

To achieve this, we would need to turn to clean, renewable sources of energy, such as wind and solar, and away from dirty energy sources like oil and coal. Switching to electric cars and freight trains would also reduce the use of dirty fuels and further clean the air.

""Figuring out how to leverage and combine actions to maximize local benefits will be important to promote widespread public support for this transition,"" said Dr. Wei Peng, per the Guardian.

The U.S. energy storage sector is poised to grow significantly now that federal policy on incentives has been finalized and the impacts of trade tariffs are becoming clearer, according to a report from law firm Troutman Pepper Locke published Tuesday.

The versatility of energy storage resources has “untethered it from the fate of wind and solar to a meaningful degree,” report co-author and Troutman Pepper Locke partner Vaughn Morrison said in a statement. Renewable resources saw federal tax credits cut by the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, enacted in July, but storage incentives were left in place.

Price arbitrage is an increasingly popular use case for utilities adding energy storage resources, the U.S. Energy Information Administration said Monday. In 2024, two-thirds of all utility-scale battery capacity had arbitrage among its uses, and 41% of the total capacity was primarily used for arbitrage.

Dive Insight:

The Troutman Pepper Locke report does not make specific predictions about the energy storage market, but paints a narrative of optimism across the sector.

“Power prices are going to rise dramatically,” said Andrew Waranch, CEO of Spearmint Energy and one of several energy executives interviewed for the report. The company has 20 storage projects, totaling more than 13 GWh of capacity, under development in 10 states.

Waranch sees the post-OBBBA clarity, and the rising cost of electricity, as drivers of the storage market.

“So much of the power market and power price is set by expensive and old generators that only need to operate for the narrowest of windows during ramp times in the morning and evening,” Waranch said. “In contrast, batteries can solve that quickly and cheaply with extremely high reliability.”

Following arbitrage, EIA says frequency regulation is the most common use case for utility-scale storage.

Frequency regulation was the primary usage for 24% of battery capacity last year, EIA said.

“In previous years, operators had reported that frequency regulation was the most common use case for their battery systems,” it said.

While energy storage fared better in OBBBA than wind and solar incentives did, there are still challenges, the Troutman Pepper Locke report warned. The bill included Foreign Entities of Concern provisions for storage projects that limit access to tax credits when components coming from adversarial nations, particularly China, are used in batteries.

OBBBA’s impact on energy storage “is less severe than some feared,” John Leonti, partner and chair of the energy department at Troutman Pepper Locke, said in a statement. However, the FEOC provisions “issue significant supply challenges for the industry moving forward.”

The FEOC rules are “really handicapping the industry pretty significantly,” said Prevalon CEO Tom Cornell in the report. “There’s just not enough time to move the supply chain that quickly, especially around the battery cells, so that’s really our big concern.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/exLkb2bqraMCEvDcZPpKF3ggYMSb5rnXpiILvIIm_js/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMDQyNTQ3MjY5XzEuanBn.webp,N,,2025-09-23 20:01:50.819297

But that surge is likely to result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year and could lead to somewhat lower EV prices ahead.
EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars.
With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.
And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models.","(CNN) — Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1, leaving automakers and car buyers wondering where prices will go.

The tax credit, which was passed in 2022 as part of the Biden administration’s legislative push to support EVs and green energy, is going away as part of President Donald Trump’s broad spending and tax bill that passed in July. The move came after US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

The end of the tax credit means demand for EVs is expected to fall, which means prices in real terms will rise — a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September. But that surge is likely to result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year and could lead to somewhat lower EV prices ahead.

With fewer people buying EVs in the coming months, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain some baseline of demand. But it’s not clear how much savings that will provide buyers, and it likely won’t make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.

Automakers either didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.

But history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.

EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US electric vehicles rose more than three times as fast as the 2% rise in non-electric passenger vehicles, according to data from the BTS.

But sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% over the first six months of the year and actually falling 6.3% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.

“If you already can’t sell the vehicles at current prices, there’s no way you are going to sell them at today’s prices with this credit going by the wayside,” he said.

Automakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

Drury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms or cash-back offers for buyers.

But she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.

“I think we’ll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,” Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won’t kill all demand.

Cox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they’ll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.

The same survey from Cox found that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment, were all more important factors than the tax credit itself.

And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models. It’s not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won’t necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.

Also, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a “moving target,” said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.

“I think there’s going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,” Green said.",https://ktvz.b-cdn.net/2025/09/cnn-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2ltYWdlL2luc3RhbmNlcy9jbWZ2bTJ5MWEwMDAyM2I2bjJrcDc0cmlr-L19jb21wb25lbnRzL2FydGljbGUvaW5zdGFuY2VzL2NtZnZtMnB1dDAwMHkyNnFxNnc4ODQwd2g-300-860x637.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 22:01:02.731098

The list below shows the largest CO2 polluters in the U.S. in the Carbon Mapper database, as of August 2025.","On September 2, 2023, a specially equipped aircraft flew to Colstrip, Montana. On this fine late summer morning, the plane flew over the Colstrip coal-fired power plant, one of the largest and dirtiest in the U.S. The plant was generating about 1,500 megawatts of electricity per hour that day. The airplane flew back and forth in tidy parallel paths, making 12 passes over the power plant and its surroundings.

The airplane is called the Global Airborne Observatory, and it measures climate-warming pollution in pinpoint detail. Data from the flyover revealed a billowing plume of carbon dioxide coming from Colstrip’s twin smokestacks, with concentrations reaching beyond 100,000 parts per million. These measurements showed the power plant was emitting about 1.7 million pounds of CO2 an hour, which is what you’d get from burning 4.4 railcars full of coal.

The result of the flyover is a visual representation of climate-warming pollution that conveys something that numbers cannot. Most readers already know that a coal-burning power plant is a major source of CO2 emissions. But it strikes a different chord to see a plume of pollution emerging from a power plant and spreading silently over the landscape.

As the Trump administration moves to cancel greenhouse gas reporting by major polluters, a constellation of satellites and aircraft is already taking up the slack. Scores of instruments are peering down through Earth’s atmosphere, finding pollution all across the globe, every day. These programs are run by private companies, nonprofits, and governments, and most of them display their data for free so anyone can see it.

Read part one of this series: Climate polluters may be allowed to stop reporting their emissions. That doesn’t mean they can hide them.

Carbon Mapper shines a light on CO2 and methane

Carbon Mapper is one of the easiest-to-use tools for observing greenhouse gas pollution. One of the strengths of Carbon Mapper is that it combines data from multiple sources, both government and privately operated missions. Carbon Mapper uses data from three aircraft, its own satellite called Tanager-1, and NASA’s EMIT instrument on the International Space Station. The findings are displayed in a free mapping tool.

Snapshots from above capture a different view than EPA reporting

EPA reporting can be based on direct measurements at some facilities, or a calculation called an “inventory.” An inventory is simply the sum of the amount of fossil fuel burned, multiplied by an average emissions factor for the type of fuel, such as coal, gas, or oil.

Riley Duran, CEO of Carbon Mapper, said that inventory-style measurements don’t capture the full picture. For example, if a power plant generates the same amount of power on two different days, one might reasonably calculate the same rate of emissions. But that’s not necessarily true, said Riley. For every megawatt of power generated, the emissions can vary due to the efficiency of the power plant’s combustion. Riley said that a standardized emissions calculation doesn’t capture these variations, and “outliers can dramatically change the emission rate.”

Riley expects satellite monitoring will generate more accurate measurements of CO2 and methane pollution than inventory calculations, and satellites can fill in gaps in countries with no emissions reporting. This data will become more robust as more satellites are added to the fleet. Carbon Mapper plans to launch three new satellites by the end of next year, and Carbon Mapper is just one of several programs that are finding and mapping climate-warming pollution.

Coal plants are the largest CO2 super-emitters in the U.S.

In the U.S., the largest plumes of CO2 pollution are all coming from coal-burning power plants. In fact, the map of the country’s worst emitters looks exactly like a map of the places that still rely on coal to generate electricity.

After previously receiving nearly immediate approvals through the IRS portal and payments within days, dealers were surprised by this change.
It’s left them unsure when they’ll be reimbursed for the thousands of dollars they’re passing on to customers for each EV sale.","In just a few days, the federal tax credit for electric vehicles — which knocks several thousand dollars off the price of many new or used EVs for qualified buyers — will be history.

A few years ago, Democrats in Congress and former President Joe Biden expanded the credits. But the GOP tax and spending bill President Trump signed over the summer terminates them on September 30.

That’s caused a surge in EV sales over the past few months as consumers try to get in on the credits before they end. EV sales in the U.S. hit a record in August, according to Cox Automotive. But just as dealers try to handle the influx of buyers, many say they’re running into new hurdles from the IRS.

Dealers who specialize in EVs say business has been booming ever since the passage of the “One Big Beautiful Bill Act” in July.

“July, August, September, have all been just tremendous months,” said John Foley, who runs Recharged, a dealership in Richmond, Virginia.

“I'm getting five times the normal traffic,” said Dan Eldoueihi, owner of 1A Auto Sales outside of Boston.

Jesse Lore, owner of Green Wave Electric Vehicles in North Hampton, New Hampshire, said August was his company’s “best month ever. We helped 69 families go electric in our communities.”

And Alex Lawrence, who owns EV Auto, a dealership with locations in Utah and Tennessee described the past few months as “a very steady stream of super busy.”

All of these dealers run companies that sell used electric vehicles, which were made eligible for a $4,000 federal tax credit under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act, if they’re sold for under $25,000.

Ever since January of 2024, buyers have been able to claim that credit at the point of sale. So, instead of waiting until they file their taxes, a customer can apply the credit to the cost of the car upfront. Customers attest that they’re qualified for the credit, dealers input sale information into an online portal administered by the Internal Revenue Service, and the federal government sends the funds straight to the dealer.

Scott Case, the CEO of Recurrent, a company that keeps track of the EV market and works with hundreds of dealers around the country, said until recently, this system worked pretty seamlessly.

“The dealer makes the sale, uploads the information into the IRS portal, and within a couple of days, they get paid out from Treasury,” Case said.

But in mid-September, Case and all four dealers quoted in this story said that process changed without warning.

First, the IRS portal suddenly required new information for each sale, including a photo of each vehicle’s proof of purchase document held up next to its vehicle identification number in the car’s door jamb.

“You kind of have to do it in a proof-of-life-style picture,” Case explained.

Then, dealers said, the IRS began marking every sale they submitted as “pending.”

“Rather than getting accepted and processed and then paid out in a timely way, they're all getting, sort of like by default, shifted into this pending status,” Case said.

After previously receiving nearly immediate approvals through the IRS portal and payments within days, dealers were surprised by this change. It’s left them unsure when they’ll be reimbursed for the thousands of dollars they’re passing on to customers for each EV sale. Some fear they might not see the money for months — or at all. And they’re frustrated.

“We're being asked to do all these things during the last two weeks of the credit when it's going to be the craziest and the busiest,” said Alex Lawrence at EV Auto. “What a horrible time to change your process.”

An IRS spokesperson reached by “Marketplace” did not provide comment after multiple requests.

In August, the IRS published an FAQ stating that EVs “acquired” by September 30 will be eligible for the tax credits, meaning a buyer doesn’t necessarily need to have the vehicle in their possession, but must have submitted a payment and have a written binding contract by the end of the month to claim the credit.

Dealers are now weighing just how many more tax credit-eligible cars they’re willing to sell.

“I'm pretty sure I'll get reimbursed, but how long it takes — that's the question,” said Dan Eldoueihi of 1A Auto Sales. He plans to cut off sales when the IRS owes him $100,000 worth of tax credits. As of Monday, he said he had four cars to go to hit that number.

“It's our livelihood too,” he said. “So, if there's $100,000 I have to chase for six months, I mean, that's not easy for anyone.”

If the tax credit payments don’t come through soon, Jesse Lore at GreenWave Electric is worried about a cash crunch.

“$4,000 is a lot of money,” he said “It is higher, larger than the profit margin that we make on any one of these vehicles.”

Lore said he buys his inventory of used EVs using a line of credit which he has to repay every time he sells a car. But if that federal money doesn’t come through, “It goes from being a sale that helps us continue our work and our mission to a sale that costs us money to complete.”

Meanwhile, John Foley of Recharged plans to sell as many cars as he can in the tax credit’s final days.

“Is it frustrating that I'm going to have to rely on the IRS to make good on all of this? Yes. But I think that's just a risk I'm willing to take,” he said.

In part, because he thinks his business will keep thriving after September 30. All of the new EVs sold over the past few years, he said, mean the supply of used EVs will stay strong. He thinks demand will hold up well too.",https://img.apmcdn.org/d00526febdafc2899d1664cb79da252b387616ed/widescreen/68df47-20250923-cars-on-display-at-an-outdoor-dealership-2000.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:32.356664

Used electric car sales jumped 59% in the same period, according to Cox Automotive.","Automakers across America are asking the Trump administration to roll back tough pollution rules that force them to make more electric cars, saying the targets set by the previous president are impossible to meet.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation filed papers on Monday telling regulators that emission standards for cars made between 2027 and 2032 “are simply not achievable.” The group speaks for almost every big car company in the country, including General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp., and Volkswagen AG.

The automakers say the rules put in place under President Joe Biden were based on wrong guesses about how fast people would start buying electric cars. They point to slow sales, not enough charging stations, and high prices as major problems.

“Growth in consumer demand for EVs has stalled, and changes in government policy are expected to further depress EV market potential,” the Alliance said in their filing.

The pushback comes as the US Environmental Protection Agency thinks about getting rid of a key legal rule. This rule says that gases from cars and other sources hurt public health. Without this rule, the federal government would lose its main legal reason for making strict pollution limits, including those for cars.

President Donald Trump has been cutting support for electric vehicles since taking office. Earlier this year, Trump signed a law that stopped California from making its own rules about car pollution. His big tax and spending bill also ends the $7,500 tax break that people get when they buy new electric cars. That tax credit goes away on Sept. 30.

People who want cleaner air have criticized Trump for going after car pollution rules. Cars are one of the biggest sources of gases that warm the planet. The EPA said under Biden that the rules car companies now want to change would cut carbon dioxide by about 7 billion metric tons over the program’s lifetime. That’s more than the whole United States puts out in one year. The rules would also save drivers about $6,000 on average in gas and repair costs.

Automakers face tough decisions

Automakers have dealt with big changes in environmental rules every time a new president comes in. These changes affect billions of dollars in business plans. The Alliance wants the EPA to replace the current rules with standards that automakers can actually meet.

Meanwhile, people are rushing to buy electric vehicles before the federal tax credits disappear next week. The tax breaks – $7,500 for new cars and $4,000 for used ones – started in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act is ending these credits along with other clean energy tax breaks over the next few months.

With one week left before the tax credits end, customers are crowding into car lots to get the deals. Electric vehicle sales hit a record high in August. New electric vehicle sales went up 17.7% compared to the same time last year. Used electric car sales jumped 59% in the same period, according to Cox Automotive.

“As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August’s elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,” Cox Automotive said.

Cars Commerce, which owns Cars.com, found similar trends. Their data shows a 33% jump in demand for electric vehicles since last year as shoppers hurry to use the tax credits. The company also found that used electric vehicles stay on dealer lots for 46 days on average, almost 30% less than last year. This shows more people want used electric cars.

Car dealers want to clear out their electric vehicle stock before new models arrive in November. They’re offering their own deals, including monthly lease payments as low as 1% of the car’s full price.

""Eastern North Carolina has incredible potential with large tracts under single ownership,"" emphasizes Lucas.
Since 1992, North Carolina has enrolled 54,800 acres in the WRE program, with 50,000 acres fully restored.","Morning mist rises off 6,000 acres of restored wetlands at North River Wetland Preserve in eastern Carteret County, one of the largest wetland restoration projects in the nation. This massive transformation from farmland back to forested, freshwater, and tidal wetlands demonstrates how partnerships between the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS), the North Carolina Coastal Federation, and multiple agencies can achieve landscape-scale conservation.

The project exemplifies how federal programs, state funding, and local expertise combine to create lasting environmental and economic benefits. Central to this success is the collaboration between conservation leaders like Bill Edwards, NRCS Wetlands Reserve Easement Manager for North Carolina, whose decades of experience have shaped the state's approach to wetland restoration, and Todd Miller, Executive Director of the North Carolina Coastal Federation.

""Bill's enthusiasm is contagious when you see what's possible,"" says Josselyn Lucas, Working Lands for Wildlife Coordinator at the University of Georgia's River Basin Institute, after touring one of the partnership's restored wetlands in eastern N.C. ""Complete hydrology restoration, invasive species control, freshwater and saltwater improvements, living shorelines. They're using every tool. The site is a model of cross-cutting strategies and multi-stakeholder collaboration, integrating a broad suite of practices into a cohesive project that benefits both the landowner and the ecosystem.""

North River: Partnership at Scale

The North River Wetland Preserve represents unprecedented collaboration. Starting in 1999, the North Carolina Coastal Federation worked with the N.C. Clean Water Management Trust Fund, NRCS, various agencies, volunteers, and members to restore 6,000 acres of farmland to its original wetland state.

The N.C. Clean Water Management Trust Fund, established by the state legislature in 1996, provides funding to protect and restore water quality throughout North Carolina. This state program complemented federal conservation efforts, particularly through NRCS's Wetlands Reserve Easement (WRE) program, which offers landowners financial incentives to restore and protect wetlands while maintaining ownership of their property.

""For years, we were working with piecemeal funding, acquiring tracts here and there,"" explains Bree Charron, PE, Water Quality Program Director at the North Carolina Coastal Federation. ""Then WRE came along and allowed us to roll these pieces together into something much larger and more impactful.""

The primary goal was to improve water quality in degraded downstream estuaries and reopen waters for shellfishing. The recreated wetlands now retain, filter, and naturally treat agricultural runoff from upstream farmland. They're restoring watershed hydrology, trapping sediments, converting nutrients, and preventing pollutants from reaching coastal waters.

""The partnership between NRCS and the Coastal Federation brings all programs into one seamless process,"" Lucas observes. ""Bill Edwards at NRCS and Todd Miller at the Coastal Federation bring decades of experience. It's special but easily replicable.""

The ecological response confirms the success of this approach. King Rails, rare in North Carolina, have returned to nest in the restored marshes. Pintail and black duck populations have soared. The diversity extends beyond game species, with remarkable butterfly populations and wading birds that attract researchers from across the nation.

Lux Farm: Landowner-Driven Innovation

While North River demonstrates large-scale restoration, the Lux Farm project in Hyde County illustrates how partnerships enable individual landowners to transform marginal lands while maintaining profitable agricultural operations.

Here, NRCS collaborated with the Coastal Federation, drainage associations, and neighboring producers to address a complex challenge: maintaining necessary agricultural drainage while reducing nutrient runoff that affects downstream oyster beds.

""We redesigned entire water flow patterns,"" explains Edwards. ""Working with drainage associations, we moved pump stations and outfalls to route water through restored wetlands that naturally filter nutrients before reaching sensitive waters.""

For participating landowners, WRE provides compelling benefits. ""Landowners maintain ownership and access to their property while receiving direct payment for permanent conservation easements,"" emphasizes Charron. ""NRCS covers the full cost of restoration work."" This approach keeps productive farmland in production while transforming marginal, flood-prone areas into wetlands that generate income from hunting leases. The restored areas provide flood control for neighboring properties and filter nutrients that previously damaged downstream fisheries.

Multiplying Impact Through Program Integration

Both projects illustrate how integrating multiple NRCS programs amplifies conservation benefits. WRE provides the foundation with easement payments and restoration funding for private landowners. The Environmental Quality Incentives Program (EQIP) supports ongoing management, including the control of invasive species and the maintenance of water control structures. The Regional Conservation Partnership Program (RCPP) enables landscape-scale improvements, evidenced by the $16.8 million investment in the Lake Mattamuskeet watershed.

""We're combining WRE easements with EQIP practices for water control structures, dikes for freshwater management, and living shorelines,"" explains Lucas. ""These aren't exotic techniques. They're bread and butter conservation practices that work across many aquatic landscapes.""

Technical innovations stretch funding further. NRCS pioneered the incorporation of 22-mil landfill liners into dike cores, thereby reducing excavation costs. Natural seed banks eliminate replanting expenses. Water control structures enable seasonal management without costly pumping systems.

""We design management plans around producer objectives,"" notes Edwards. ""Our technical assistance ensures you achieve your goals while meeting conservation standards. It's your land, your vision, our support.""

Scaling Success Through Collaboration

North River and Lux Farm demonstrate how different partnership models deliver results:

Large-scale restoration by conservation organizations achieves watershed-level impacts by aggregating multiple properties into contiguous conservation areas, maximizing ecological benefits while simplifying management.

Individual landowner participation through WRE enables farmers to convert marginal lands to conservation use while maintaining profitable operations on their best agricultural acres, creating win-win scenarios for production and conservation.

Collaborative watershed management through drainage associations balances agricultural needs with environmental protection by coordinating water management across property boundaries, ensuring both farming viability and downstream water quality.

Each approach serves specific needs while contributing to landscape-scale conservation.

""Eastern North Carolina has incredible potential with large tracts under single ownership,"" emphasizes Lucas. ""The shared vision among NRCS, FSA, conservation districts, and partners makes landscape-scale conservation possible while serving individual producer needs. All of this is scalable.""

Since 1992, North Carolina has enrolled 54,800 acres in the WRE program, with 50,000 acres fully restored. Current funding of $1.5 million annually supports the acquisition of approximately 500 acres of new easements per year. Edwards estimates $5-10 million would allow the program to meet current landowner interest.

""Start at your local NRCS Service Center and connect with the WRE manager,"" advises Edwards to interested producers. ""Be patient. The program is competitive because it's so popular. But for those who qualify, it's truly transformative.""

The success at North River and Lux Farm proves that strategic partnerships achieve what no single entity could accomplish alone. Water quality improves. Wildlife thrives. Shellfishing waters reopen. Landowners profit from marginal lands. Communities prosper.

As these North Carolina projects demonstrate, when federal programs, state resources, local knowledge, and landowner commitment align, the results ripple across entire watersheds, proving that conservation at scale isn't just possible, it's already happening.

The US power grid, as it stands today, was built in the 1950s and 1960s.","They've got the money and the chips. Now they need the power.

Nvidia announced Monday that it plans to invest $100 billion in OpenAI in a deal that would give the ChatGPT maker a major leg up in the AI race — access to 10 gigawatts worth of the high-powered GPUs it needs to satisfy its mushrooming growth strategy.

What the deal can't guarantee — and what neither company mentioned — is how OpenAI will access the enormous amount of electricity needed to fire up those chips.

""It is a huge hurdle to get access to power,"" said Benjamin Hertz-Shargel, head grid expert at the energy consulting firm Wood Mackenzie. Monday's deal announcement, he added, is ""a far cry"" from a finished data center.

The deal, which the companies committed to in a letter of intent, highlights a growing constraint of the AI race: Access to electricity. The US power grid is already strained by an explosion of data center construction. Adding another 10 gigawatts of demand would amount to adding a power load nearly equivalent to New York City at its summer peak.

""Nationally, utilities are reporting the need for about 60 gigawatts of new power — six large cities' worth — to serve new data centers by the end of the decade,"" said Rob Gramlich, an energy policy consultant and founder of Grid Strategies.

OpenAI declined to comment for this story, but its deal with Nvidia underscores the physical and financial challenges required to develop and commercialize AI. Beyond cutting-edge software, leaders must have access to chips, data centers, and the electricity needed to power that infrastructure.

""Infrastructure is critical to everything we do,"" OpenAI CEO Sam Altman said in a joint interview with Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang on CNBC on Monday. ""Without doing this, we can't deliver the services people want.""

The 'silent bottleneck'

Limited access to power amid rampant data center growth is ""the silent bottleneck"" slowing the pace of Big Tech's ambitions for AI, said Brad Gastwirth, global head of research and market intelligence at Circular Technology.

Data centers access electricity the same way everyone else does — by connecting to the power grid through public utility companies and paying them for service. However, connecting to the power grid can come with a slew of regulatory and financial hurdles that are only increasing as utilities struggle to keep up with skyrocketing demand.

The surge in new service requests from data centers is so unprecedented that it has overwhelmed the country's major utilities and sparked a mad dash to build new infrastructure — a complex process that requires years of planning and regulatory approval.

As more data centers line up to connect, new development is being curbed. Commercial real estate services firm CBRE said that roughly 5.2 gigawatts of new data centers were underway in prime US markets in the first half of 2025, a 17.5% decline in the industry's construction pipeline from the same period a year prior, and that the limiting factor was power to light them up.

An additional 10 gigawatts of new demand adds even more pressure to an already strained system — and it represents only a slice of the electricity OpenAI will ultimately need to power its AI plans.

In July, OpenAI and Oracle announced they'd finalized plans to develop 4.5 gigawatts of data center capacity, including a site in Abilene, Texas, that was announced in January as part of Stargate, a $500 billion joint venture between OpenAI, Oracle, and SoftBank.

Nvidia declined to comment on whether an official contract had been signed, but a spokesperson for the company said that the 10 gigawatts of demand announced Monday is new and is not accounted for in any of OpenAI's previously announced plans.

While the media focuses on stock market fluctuations and the inner workings of tech companies, ""the industry is worried about power,"" said Gastwirth.

Big Tech needs to 'get creative'

It's against this backdrop that access to electricity is gaining in value. One of the year's largest merger and acquisition deals in the data center sector has been imperiled because shareholders believe the takeover target is worth more, in part because of its access to power.

The US power grid, as it stands today, was built in the 1950s and 1960s. It was due for major upgrades before the data center development boom, but the AI race has made new power plants and power lines — and a lot of them — a more urgent necessity. The US Department of Energy has warned that the number of blackouts in the US could increase by 100 in 2030 if new power infrastructure is not built.

Some data center operators have taken matters into their own hands, bypassing public utilities and going ""off grid"" to build their own on-site power plants. The first Stargate site in Abilene has done this with on-site natural gas turbines. Elon Musk has been powering his xAI data center in Memphis with natural gas generators for months, drawing ire from environmental and community activists who say they are a risk to air quality and public health.

The tech industry will have to ""get creative"" to solve the power problem, Gastwirth said. ""This is going to become a bigger and bigger issue as each year progresses.""

Big Tech companies have significantly ramped up investment in the energy sector, pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into emerging technologies like hydrogen fuel cells and nuclear fusion. Amazon and Microsoft have signed deals to buy electricity from major industrial nuclear plants. Altman himself is a major investor in Oklo, a small modular reactor company that has, despite its pending regulatory approval, has already signed deals to power data centers.

Despite the current challenges in accessing power, experts largely see OpenAI's deal with Nvidia as a smart strategic move, cementing the status of both companies as AI's leading players.

Sean Farney, executive director of data center strategy and innovation and Jones Lang Lasalle, said that Nvidia is the ""lead horse"" in the development of cutting-edge AI processors and that OpenAI's deal to secure that equipment was ""brilliant.""

""It's the two leaders getting together to ensure that they will continue to be the leaders,"" Farney said.

The power problem, said Farney, will work itself out.

""They will find or self-source the power to make this happen. There's too much interest and dollar signs on this deal,"" he said.",https://i.insider.com/68d1ab4e57d362d375e8a3e7?width=1200&format=jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:12.668639

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.",https://media.kvue.com/assets/CCT/images/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71/20241126T221110/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:35.887438

People who want cleaner air have criticized Trump for going after car pollution rules.
The EPA said under Biden that the rules car companies now want to change would cut carbon dioxide by about 7 billion metric tons over the program’s lifetime.
Automakers face tough decisions Automakers have dealt with big changes in environmental rules every time a new president comes in.
Used electric car sales jumped 59% in the same period, according to Cox Automotive.","Automakers across America are asking the Trump administration to roll back tough pollution rules that force them to make more electric cars, saying the targets set by the previous president are impossible to meet.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation filed papers on Monday telling regulators that emission standards for cars made between 2027 and 2032 “are simply not achievable.” The group speaks for almost every big car company in the country, including General Motors Co., Toyota Motor Corp., and Volkswagen AG.

The automakers say the rules put in place under President Joe Biden were based on wrong guesses about how fast people would start buying electric cars. They point to slow sales, not enough charging stations, and high prices as major problems.

“Growth in consumer demand for EVs has stalled, and changes in government policy are expected to further depress EV market potential,” the Alliance said in their filing.

The pushback comes as the US Environmental Protection Agency thinks about getting rid of a key legal rule. This rule says that gases from cars and other sources hurt public health. Without this rule, the federal government would lose its main legal reason for making strict pollution limits, including those for cars.

President Donald Trump has been cutting support for electric vehicles since taking office. Earlier this year, Trump signed a law that stopped California from making its own rules about car pollution. His big tax and spending bill also ends the $7,500 tax break that people get when they buy new electric cars. That tax credit goes away on Sept. 30.

People who want cleaner air have criticized Trump for going after car pollution rules. Cars are one of the biggest sources of gases that warm the planet. The EPA said under Biden that the rules car companies now want to change would cut carbon dioxide by about 7 billion metric tons over the program’s lifetime. That’s more than the whole United States puts out in one year. The rules would also save drivers about $6,000 on average in gas and repair costs.

Automakers face tough decisions

Automakers have dealt with big changes in environmental rules every time a new president comes in. These changes affect billions of dollars in business plans. The Alliance wants the EPA to replace the current rules with standards that automakers can actually meet.

Meanwhile, people are rushing to buy electric vehicles before the federal tax credits disappear next week. The tax breaks – $7,500 for new cars and $4,000 for used ones – started in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act. Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act is ending these credits along with other clean energy tax breaks over the next few months.

With one week left before the tax credits end, customers are crowding into car lots to get the deals. Electric vehicle sales hit a record high in August. New electric vehicle sales went up 17.7% compared to the same time last year. Used electric car sales jumped 59% in the same period, according to Cox Automotive.

“As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August’s elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,” Cox Automotive said.

Cars Commerce, which owns Cars.com, found similar trends. Their data shows a 33% jump in demand for electric vehicles since last year as shoppers hurry to use the tax credits. The company also found that used electric vehicles stay on dealer lots for 46 days on average, almost 30% less than last year. This shows more people want used electric cars.

Car dealers want to clear out their electric vehicle stock before new models arrive in November. They’re offering their own deals, including monthly lease payments as low as 1% of the car’s full price.",https://www.cryptopolitan.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Automakers-1.webp,N,,2025-09-23 19:02:32.308737

These entities must redirect their food waste from landfills to sustainable solutions such as food recovery services, composting, and anaerobic digestion – turning organic waste into renewable energy.
""These results illustrate how our food waste ban is protecting the environment while helping businesses,"" said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple.
""The food waste ban is a critical piece of our strategy to reduce waste.
As more businesses engage with food collection programs, awareness about food waste issues continues to grow, promoting initiatives for food rescue, donation, and waste prevention.","BOSTON — A recent report quantifies the substantial economic impact of the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection’s (MassDEP) ban on commercial food waste disposal. This initiative is a significant contributor to the state’s economy, generating jobs and revenue.

Key report findings include:

Creating 1,676 well-paying jobs, resulting in $143 million in labor income;

Generating $194 million in economic value (in addition to the labor income and intermediate inputs); and

Cumulatively generating more than $390 million in industry activity.

""Massachusetts is a leader in reducing food waste,"" said Governor Maura Healey. ""Our state’s businesses and institutions have stepped up to innovate and reduce their waste, and this report shows that the long-term impacts are positive. Finding an alternative to throwing away good food is a boost for our communities, our economy, and our environment.""

""This report reaffirms our commitment to reduce, reuse, and recycle here in Massachusetts,"" said Lieutenant Governor Kim Driscoll. ""Massachusetts has created the necessary infrastructure to ensure good, healthy food does not go to waste. For our cities and towns, this means getting food to those who need it first and foremost. It means jobs for our residents, and it conserves resources and supports local budgets.""

The disposal ban targets businesses and institutions that produce over half a ton of food waste weekly, including supermarkets, colleges, hotels, hospitals, nursing homes, restaurants, and food service providers. These entities must redirect their food waste from landfills to sustainable solutions such as food recovery services, composting, and anaerobic digestion – turning organic waste into renewable energy.

The number of facilities participating in food waste services has notably increased from 1,350 in 2014 to an estimated 4,150 by 2024. This growth has stimulated economic activity in related sectors, benefiting communities across the state.

""This report confirms what we’ve long known that banning food waste is not just an environmental win but also an economic one,"" said Energy and Environmental Affairs Secretary Rebecca Tepper. ""By reducing waste, creating jobs, and lowering costs, this policy helps build stronger communities and a more resilient economy.""

""These results illustrate how our food waste ban is protecting the environment while helping businesses,"" said MassDEP Commissioner Bonnie Heiple. ""The food waste ban is a critical piece of our strategy to reduce waste. But it does so much more. The program lowers disposal costs, reduces methane emissions, creates clean energy, produces nutrient-rich fertilizer for our farms, supports jobs, strengthens the economy, and helps get good food to people in need. We’re proud of this success and excited to build on it.""

As more businesses engage with food collection programs, awareness about food waste issues continues to grow, promoting initiatives for food rescue, donation, and waste prevention. Additionally, MassDEP funds RecyclingWorks in Massachusetts, which is a resource for businesses providing free technical assistance and online resources to support their recycling and diversion efforts. RecyclingWorks has helped divert more than 325,000 tons of material from disposal since 2013. For more information on RecyclingWorks, visit their website.

This mirrors what’s happened in other markets when EVs have gotten cheaper than gas vehicles.
Generous government programs in Norway made electric cars too good to resist, propelling the country’s EV sales share to nearly 90% in 2024.
In 2018, just 10% of electric cars sold in the country were cheaper than their ICE equivalents, according to the International Energy Agency.
In large part, surveys show, this is because Americans simply can’t afford electric cars.","Price parity between electric and combustion vehicles has launched electric-vehicle sales into the stratosphere in the few markets that have reached that elusive milestone. The logic is simple: Electric cars may be cleaner, cheaper to refuel and punchier from a stop than gas vehicles, but none of that carries much weight for a buyer who can't afford one in the first place.

Show consumers that EVs cost the same or less up front, though, and mass adoption can really take off.

Oddly enough, that critical turning point happened this summer in the U.S. during a time of massive uncertainty for the country’s clean-car industry. But don’t expect the trend to last.

In both July and August, the average transaction price for an EV dipped below that of a combustion-powered vehicle, according to data from JD Power shared with InsideEVs.

Last month, the average new EV cost an estimated $44,908, about $600 less than the $45,521 going rate for gas vehicles. In January 2023, before Tesla went on a price-cutting spree, the average EV cost roughly $62,500, some $16,000 more than a gas vehicle, according to JD Power's data

Today's $600 gap may be small, but it's an enormous shift when you consider the huge premium EVs have historically demanded. High battery costs, limited economies of scale for manufacturers and a focus on luxury models have kept EV prices stubbornly high in the U.S., limiting their appeal among mainstream buyers.

“It is fairly recent and rare that we're actually seeing EV transaction prices fall below ICE,” Tyson Jominy, the firm’s senior vice president of data and analytics, told InsideEVs, using the industry lingo for vehicles with internal combustion engines.

The Clock Starts Ticking

It’s no coincidence that July and August were the two months immediately following the passage of the Republicans’ sweeping policy agenda, which started running the clock on great EV deals.

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act set a Sept. 30 expiration date for the EV tax credits that have been supporting sales of cleaner cars for years. Now, amid a mad scramble to sell down EV inventory before the rug gets yanked out, manufacturers have been lathering on incentives to help move cars off of dealer lots, Jominy said.

“Once we hit October, the clock strikes midnight on Oct. 1, a lot of these EVs turn into pumpkins, and they become a lot more difficult to sell,” he said.

Combine that pile of cash on the hood with an EV tax credit worth up to $7,500 and you’re left with EVs that—for a short window, at least—are cheaper to buy than conventional cars.

“You put those two together, and the deals that can be found on EVs are pretty tremendous,” Jominy said.

In August, the average manufacturer incentive spend per EV hit nearly $7,500 (compared to around $2,500 for combustion cars), JD Power said. The firm put the average discount from the EV tax credit at around $5,000, a figure that has also grown lately.

Through something of a loophole, all EV leases can benefit from the entire $7,500 credit. For EVs purchased outright, however, rules surrounding assembly location, battery sourcing and personal income mean that only a fraction of models qualify. As a result, since the latest tax credit policy took effect in 2022, EV leasing has exploded, hitting 70% of EV transactions in July.

Federally funded discounts have risen in parallel. JD Power estimates that consumers buying or leasing a new EV saved $5,124 thanks to the federal tax credit in 2024, up from $4,302 in 2023 and $1,629 in 2022.

'Back To Gas'? Not So Fast

Why not just cut EV production and supply, rather than flooding the market with cars and dumping on incentives? That will happen down the line—we’ve already seen numerous companies cut back production plans or new models due to slowing demand growth—but it’s not that simple. Automakers have long-term commitments with suppliers, and they can’t just change production on a dime, Jominy explained.

“It's more like trying to pull a U-turn in an aircraft carrier,” he said. “A lot of these EV plans were set in stone before the legislation changed.”

The hefty discounts—plus a tax credit-fueled buying frenzy—have created a booming EV market. In August, the electric share of U.S. vehicle sales hit a record high of 9.9%, according to Cox Automotive.

This mirrors what’s happened in other markets when EVs have gotten cheaper than gas vehicles. Generous government programs in Norway made electric cars too good to resist, propelling the country’s EV sales share to nearly 90% in 2024. China, by far the global leader in both EV sales and production, is another prime example.

In 2018, just 10% of electric cars sold in the country were cheaper than their ICE equivalents, according to the International Energy Agency. By 2024, that proportion rose to two-thirds. As costs plummeted, annual EV sales in China grew eightfold during that six year period, from 800,000 units to 6.4 million.

Compare that to what’s happening in the U.S. In 2024, just one in five electric SUVs and pickup trucks was sold at a lower price than the average gas-powered equivalent, the IEA says. And just two electric models were priced below $30,000, compared with 50 options in the combustion segment. One culprit, according to the research firm BloombergNEF, is America's obsession with large trucks and lots of driving range. Both require big battery packs that drive up costs.

Battery-powered vehicle sales have skyrocketed over the last several years in the U.S., but the pace of growth has slowed notably. In large part, surveys show, this is because Americans simply can’t afford electric cars.

Between steadily falling battery costs and the gradual introduction of lower-cost options like the new Nissan Leaf and upcoming Slate truck, the U.S. EV market is bound to hit price parity with gas vehicles someday. But this summer’s pricing was likely more of a blip than a milestone.

With various tailpipe emissions regulations weakened or eliminated by the new Republican administration, automakers are already under far less pressure to sell cleaner cars. Soon, the EV tax credits will stop being a factor too. Over time, automakers will dial back supply, likely leading to lower incentives. Without the carrots and sticks prodding car buyers and sellers to move in a zero-emission direction, it will take longer for car companies to build the scale they need to sell electric models profitably.

JD Power expects that EV prices will rise above ICE prices again next year, and that electric sales won’t go anywhere fast in the near term.

“In the short term, EVs will probably, at best, go sideways,” Jominy said. “But over the long term, we are still optimistic about EVs. We do not believe that this is the end.”",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/KbMYMQ/s1/tesla-model-y.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 19:02:37.434374

And the agency may be moving in the same direction with a finalized PFAS drinking water limit rule (details below).
The move to defend the Biden-era Superfund regulation came as a surprise, as the new administration has loosened PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act.
The settlement adds to $13.7 billion that DuPont and 3M have paid specifically to impacted municipal drinking water systems.
They say companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams.","Trump’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has upheld a Biden administration rule designating two PFAS—PFOA and PFOS—as hazardous substances. The Superfund law, under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), requires manufacturers and other generators to report the release of these toxic chemicals; authorizes EPA to initiate cleanup projects; and holds generators accountable for remediation costs. The law also allows parties to seek reimbursement for cleanups.

While the rule was finalized in April 2024, its fate has been in question, especially lately, as the new administration has loosened a slew of regulations around various toxic chemicals. And the agency may be moving in the same direction with a finalized PFAS drinking water limit rule (details below).

But uncertainty, specifically around Superfund details, began before the administrative shift, triggered by a lawsuit brought by the National Waste & Recycling Association and other industry groups. At the root of their concerns is that the rule’s language does not ensure waste managers are exempt from liability when PFOA and PFOS ultimately end up at their sites.

The EPA stated it does not intend to pursue these “passive receivers”—namely, landfills, water treatment plants, and airports that deal with the waste but do not produce it. But as written, the policy could be reversed. And it does not prevent third-party lawsuits.

In a statement, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the Trump administration will seek a balance between holding polluters accountable and not unduly burdening passive receivers. But striking that balance is a challenge yet to be contended with.

“EPA intends to do what we can based on our existing authority, but we will need new statutory language from Congress to fully address our concerns with passive receiver liability,” Zeldin said.

Some provisions yet to be worked out are the criteria for determining who will be protected from liability, the scope of those protections, and other details to prevent unintended consequences and costs of the regulations.

The move to defend the Biden-era Superfund regulation came as a surprise, as the new administration has loosened PFAS regulations under the Safe Drinking Water Act. And Trump’s EPA has pushed back deadlines, holding manufacturers and other industrial generators responsible for what they produce.

While the agency says it will ultimately uphold drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, it has rescinded regulation of four other PFAS: GenX, PFBS, PFHxS, and PFNA.

And now some conservatives in Congress have proposed to delay a ban on PFAS-laden firefighting foam that was to take effect in 2026, cut cleanup funding, and reverse a rule prohibiting incinerating the foam. Research shows incineration does not destroy the chemicals and can release PFAS and toxic byproducts into the air.

By June 2024, the Department of Defense (DoD) had found most of its 718 installations potentially released PFAS, mainly from firefighting foam. In some cases, it has been detected in drinking water at three times to over 15 times the maximum contaminant level of 4 parts per trillion set by the EPA.

The use of PFAS in firefighting foam was originally to end by 2024, but new legislation would reportedly push that deadline to 2028.

Nationwide, these “forever chemicals” linked to cancers, infertility, compromised immunity, and other health issues are found in about 45 percent of the population’s tap water.

Some states are not waiting for federal laws to kick in. Many of them are advancing their own PFAS regulations, particularly targeting biosolid use and wastewater discharges.

Maine was the first to prohibit land application of sludge generated by wastewater treatment plants. Since then, Connecticut, Michigan, and New York have imposed laws of their own targeting PFAS-laden biosolids, as have Virginia and Maryland, which require some operators to test for PFAS before discharging wastewater or biosolids. And in New Hampshire, wastewater treatment plants can require dischargers to test for PFAS.

About 10 states have set their own maximum drinking water level limitations.

Meanwhile, states, water utilities, and ultimately ratepayers have footed cleanup costs. And some of them are going after the producers to recoup those costs.

In August 2025, New Jersey was awarded just over $2 billion to clean up PFAS leaking from four of DuPont’s industrial sites.

DuPont and two of its spinoff companies will pay $1.2 billion to remediate the four sites. Another $875 million will go into a state fund earmarked to restore natural resources and for abatement projects, including to treat PFAS-contaminated drinking water.

The settlement adds to $13.7 billion that DuPont and 3M have paid specifically to impacted municipal drinking water systems.

States, as well as municipalities and public water systems in Pennsylvania, Washington State, New York, New Mexico, and Colorado, have also been awarded compensation from chemical companies for damage from PFAS.

As pending enforcements loom, both generators and passive receivers are on alert for what is to come, as tackling these forever chemicals will be an astronomically expensive endeavor. The EPA forecasted the nationwide compliance costs at around $1.5 billion annually—that’s between investments in new treatment technology, operator training, and consulting fees.

For now, attorneys at Alston & Bird advise that companies and stakeholders follow developments both at the congressional and EPA levels.

They say companies should be aware of potential releases of PFAS—especially PFOA and PFOS—in their waste streams. Be mindful of potential PFAS contamination during environmental due diligence for transactions.

According to a new report by the Net Zero Industrial Policy Lab (NZIPL), since 2022 alone, overseas investments by Chinese firms have surged past $220 billion.

These investments have spanned across 54 countries and include sectors such as batteries, solar, wind, new energy vehicles (NEV) and green hydrogen. The scale of investments has surpassed the US Marshall Plan ($200 billion in current 2024 dollars) and, importantly, is strategically positioning the Global South within the global energy transition — with 75 per cent of these projects being located in emerging markets.

This analysis is based on the China Low Carbon Technology foreign direct investment (FDI) database, which catalogues 461 projects from 2011 to mid-2025. The database is hosted by NZIPL at Johns Hopkins University and the Global Development Policy Center at Boston University, and will be incorporated into a broader Global Low Carbon Technology FDI database in the coming year.

Unprecedented pace & scale

The report points towards a dramatic rise in Chinese overseas green technology investments beginning in 2022. Over 80 per cent of the total 461 projects tracked by the database were launched after 2022, accounting for over $210 billion — or 88 per cent of all pledged capital. A record 165 projects were announced in 2024 alone.

Further, there has been a rise of megaprojects, with over 60 ventures exceeding $1 billion each in committed investment. This indicates a move toward establishing deep-rooted, long-term and large-scale industrial assets of energy transition technologies in host countries. The report suggests that these megaprojects are likely to exert increasing economic, industrial and environmental impacts on local development.

The investment strategy has evolved from its initial solar-focused approach to encompass the entire clean technology value chain. Battery materials manufacturing now represents the single largest investment category, with commitments exceeding $62 billion, underscoring China’s strategic priority to secure upstream supply chain control. These investments have been largely concentrated in Southeast Asia, but Chinese firms are also moving upstream in Latin America’s Lithium Triangle (Chile, Bolivia and Argentina).

Other prominent sectors include battery manufacturing, where investments crossed $49 billion and are heavily concentrated in Europe, solar manufacturing with a portfolio of $57 billion spanning across 135 projects, and green hydrogen where investments reached $27 billion (with an average project size of around $2 billion) and were anchored in the Middle East and North Africa (MENA).

Both, EV manufacturing and wind projects show a balanced spread across geographies but exclude the United States, reflecting a cautionary strategy due to trade disruptions.

The report categorises China’s investments motivations into three categories:

• Access to raw material inputs: Indonesia's nickel reserves have made it the top location for battery material processing.

• Access to host countries’ markets: Hungary attracts downstream battery production investments, reflecting its role as a key battery manufacturer in Europe.

• Access to third country markets: Morocco has emerged as a major investment hotspot, leveraging its duty-free access to the European Union market, while Southeast Asia benefits from its re-export hub status.

Evolving strategies & future implications

The initial rapid pace of investments is now giving way to more nuanced strategies as companies navigate an increasingly complex global environment. The data suggests a downward trend in new projects — with 68 projects announced in the first half of 2025, pointing towards a phase of consolidation and recalibration.

Geopolitical concerns, particularly trade barriers and the threat of secondary sanctions, are actively reshaping investment flows. In response, a growing number of firms are pivoting towards ‘light-asset’ strategies, opting for technology licensing, contract manufacturing, and Original Equipment Manufacturer partnerships. This allows companies to safeguard their market access while limiting the fixed-asset exposure. As a result, headline construction numbers may falter even as commercial engagement expands.

For host governments, such heavy investment flows represent a major opportunity to attract green capital. However, according to the report, this will require providing tailored incentives to firms, leveraging resource endowments to anchor themselves in Chinese supply chains, and planning for the scale of infrastructure necessary to keep pace with large investments. International partners, too, will need to understand the dynamics of China’s outward manufacturing drive in order to respond with adequate trade policies, supply-chain resilience programmes and climate finance initiatives.",https://gumlet.assettype.com/downtoearth%2F2025-09-23%2F2vtuhj52%2FChina-capital-Global-South-clean-tech?w=1200&ar=40%3A21&auto=format%2Ccompress&ogImage=true&mode=crop&enlarge=true&overlay=false&overlay_position=bottom&overlay_width=100,N,,2025-09-23 20:59:18.449668

Sila expects to employ up to 500 people in Moses Lake when it ramps up to full capacity.","Battery materials startup Sila is starting operations today at its automotive-scale manufacturing facility, located in Moses Lake, Wash.

The plant is producing a silicon-carbon anode material that replaces graphite in lithium-ion batteries like those used to power electric vehicles, smartphones and other consumer devices. Batteries using Sila’s Titan Silicon can hold 20% more energy than traditional batteries.

The new plant measures 600,000 square-feet and is situated on a 160-acre site in the arid, Eastern Washington location.

Sila’s operations will start at a relatively modest capacity, producing enough anode material for 2 to 5 gigawatt hours of battery capacity. Depending on how much of the graphite is replaced by Sila’s product, that initial volume is enough to power tens of thousands of EVs or millions of mobile devices.

The plan is to scale to 250 gigawatt hours of material by the end of the decade, which would make the Sila plant the largest anode production facility in the world, the company said. Sila has shared news of partnerships with Mercedes-Benz and Panasonic, and expects to start shipping material to customers as soon as next year.

The opening of the site comes at a time when the U.S. clean energy sector is battling economic headwinds as the Trump administration has canceled funding and initiatives supporting many climate-related projects.

The Biden administration created programs to bolster domestic battery production to compete with China, who is the global lead in manufacturing the energy cells. Sila won a $100 million U.S. Department of Energy grant in 2022 as part of that effort.

“This is not just about building a factory. It is about closing the gap between innovation and manufacturing in America,” said Gene Berdichevsky, Sila’s CEO and co-founder, in a statement.

“If we do not execute, innovation will flow to places that can,” he added. “We have to build here in the United States to create a self-sustaining innovation economy, ensuring that our advancements in next-generation battery technology, like silicon-carbon anodes, are not only conceived but also produced domestically at a global scale.”

The company broke ground in Moses Lake less than two years ago and last year raised $375 million to help fund the completion of the plant. Sila has netted more than $1.3 billion from investors. The company launched in 2011 and is based in Alameda, Calif. It has 400 employees, with 100 working at the manufacturing plant.

“This new facility is a prime example of the domestic innovation needed to end our dependency on foreign countries for advanced battery technology and produce high-quality, cutting-edge technologies that protect our supply chains here at home,” said U.S. Rep. Dan Newhouse, R-Wash., who represents Moses Lake.

Sila competitor Group14 Technologies is building nearby, but earlier this year laid off an undisclosed number of employees and delayed its manufacturing start date. Group14 this summer secured $463 million from investors.

California-based OneD Battery Sciences shuttered its pilot manufacturing facility in Moses Lake this past spring, and appears to have ceased all operations.

Other Pacific Northwest battery materials startups include Ecellix and Emerald Battery Labs, which are based in Seattle, and Oregon’s Skip Technologies and ZincFive.

The report comes a week before the three-year anniversary of the launch of Duke’s Climate Commitment. It’s the product of almost two years of discussions among students, faculty and staff, setting interim targets for growth across each of the Climate Commitment’s five pillars: education, research, sustainable operations, external engagement and community partnerships.

Toddi Steelman, vice president and vice provost for climate and sustainability, explained that the report is “anchor[ed]” by 2030 because the year represents a major deadline in the broader scientific community — a target set by the Paris Agreement to cut greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 43% to avoid the worst impacts of climate change. Steelman added that the University set three-year targets because five years can feel like “a long way away,” especially when undergraduate students cycle every four years.

The report also reaffirms Duke’s Climate Commitment at a time when the path to achieving the University’s long-term climate plan remains in flux — and as climate action has largely fallen off the federal agenda.

“I would say the most common question I have these days is ‘what’s happened to the Climate Commitment?’” Steelman said. “And my reply is, ‘nothing’s happened to the Climate Commitment.’ We get to wake up every day and do this work, and there are a lot of peers and friends — university peers and friends — that are not going to be able to do this work.”

The Chronicle broke down several key takeaways from the report and its implications for climate work at Duke.

Working to lead the pack

Since assuming her position at the helm of the University’s Climate Commitment, Steelman has cemented her vision for Duke to become a global leader on climate action. That sentiment was a major throughline of the new report.

The report identifies climate policy, health and oceans as three fields of study where Duke already has “distinct advantages,” which Steelman said is largely aided by research teams across the health system, Marine Lab and schools like the Sanford School of Public Policy and Nicholas School of the Environment.

Duke also plans to leverage its alumni network as part of increasing investments in research on environmental and climate justice, community resilience and technology.

“We have literally an army of people who have gone on to do this kind of work who are very well situated to kind of help facilitate this societal and economic pivot that we know we need to make,” Steelman said.

As for tangible steps toward those goals, the report points to enhancing seed grant programs, developing a climate research inventory and dashboard, and supporting early-career faculty and researchers who can “bring new energy and perspectives” to emerging fields.

The University then hopes to display its work and become a model for other institutions. The report sets goals for Duke to participate in more national and international climate gatherings, such as Climate Week NYC, and to create a new “Climate Engagement Exchange” that would make opportunities for participation more accessible to students and faculty.

Long-term approach still in progress

After reaching carbon-neutral status for the first time last year, Duke reframed its strategy for making campus operations more sustainable around a goal of reaching net-zero emissions by 2050. Although the new report outlines some general steps toward that target, the University’s broader approach remains somewhat unclear.

Per the report, Duke aims to develop and implement plans to reduce GHG emissions across three categories by 2028. First on the agenda are scope 1 and scope 2 emissions, which come from direct campus operations and purchased electricity, respectively. Scope 3 emissions are trickier, since they come from activities along Duke’s supply chain that the University has less control over, like transportation and food procurement.

Duke is also including the health system in its 2050 goal, necessitating a separate plan to account for the system’s large physical footprint and different energy needs.

According to Steelman, Duke has hired consulting firm Buro Happold to help flesh out these strategies, but a couple new developments over recent months have complicated matters.

Administrative turnover has been a significant factor. Vice President for Facilities John Noonan stepped down last spring after 14 years in the role, and Steelman explained that ensuring his replacement, Thomas Morrison, is up to speed and involved in discussions about campus operations has been a top priority. A similar situation recently arose on the health system side after Craig Albanese, chief executive officer of the Duke University Health System, announced his Sept. 30 departure.

Meanwhile, Duke Energy — one of the largest utility companies in the United States and the source of much of the University and health system’s electricity — reversed course on its pledge to cut carbon emissions 70% by 2030 and delayed its deadline to develop a carbon neutrality plan. That means electricity used on campus will likely remain more carbon-intensive for longer.

“Our commitment to this 2050 net-zero plan hasn’t changed, but the dynamics are fierce,” Steelman said.

In the meantime, Duke is still determining whether to maintain its carbon-neutral status while it pursues net zero. An ad hoc committee of students and faculty was established last year to help decide whether the University should continue buying carbon offsets until it reaches its net-zero goal, or if those funds could be better used as investments in campus decarbonization efforts.

According to Steelman, the committee recently submitted its recommendation to Duke administrators, and it is now under review.

Adjusting to a new federal landscape

The report comes at a time when many federal incentives for climate action have disappeared, creating an uncertain backdrop for such work at Duke.

This summer, Congress rolled back a slate of tax incentives for clean energy development as part of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. In the ensuing months, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to rescind the finding that greenhouse gases threaten human health and to stop requiring industrial facilities to track their greenhouse gas emissions. Recently, the agency reportedly directed some of its employees to stop publishing scientific research.

Steelman noted that although the rollbacks have been “demoralizing,” they have pushed climate leaders at Duke to become more mindful about balancing “affordability, accessibility and sustainability goals” in their work. She affirmed that at Duke, the work will continue.

“Our president, our provost, our Board of Trustees continues to be highly supportive of the work that we’re doing,” Steelman said. “I think we have to do it in a little bit of a different way now than we did before, but it hasn’t dampened our enthusiasm.”",https://snworksceo.imgix.net/dtc/c92c3b38-b566-42d9-9785-8cef02eaba2b.sized-1000x1000.jpg?w=800&fit=crop&ar=16%3A9&crop=faces%2Cedges,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:18.320039

“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.","The race to replace coal in Indonesia, the world’s largest coal exporter, has become a contest between the U.S. and China. At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

U.S. exit impacts politics but not investment

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.

Lee said the JETP also provided a unifying platform for stakeholders and helped Indonesia partner with new countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Indonesia’s JETP secretariat didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

China offers a new model

China offers a “different version of energy security,” replacing imported fossil fuels with solar panels that generate electricity for decades, Adhiguna said.

Major Chinese projects in Indonesia include a $6 billion supply-chain venture by battery giant CATL with local partners in 2022 and BYD’s $1 billion EV plant announced in 2024 will produce 150,000 cars annually and employ 18,000 workers.

China’s BTR New Material Group launched a $478 million factory in 2024 that will make anode materials for EV batteries and create around 8,000 jobs, while a solar panel factory unveiled in 2025 by LONGi has an annual capacity of 1.6 gigawatts.

“It’s a whole-systems change,” said Dinita Setyawati, an energy analyst focused on Southeast Asia at the think tank Ember. She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.

These projects are deployed quickly, which is crucial for Indonesia’s five-year political cycles, even if Western investors offer more safeguards. POWERCHINA built a 100-megawatt solar park in just seven months in 2024.

“If a U.S. company takes four years to do a feasibility study, Chinese companies will already have invested by then,” Adhiguna said.

But Chinese investments often have come with high environmental costs.

Most of Indonesia’s nickel mines, for instance, are Chinese-owned. The country has the biggest reserves of the mineral needed to build EV batteries and the mines rely on captive coal-fired power plants, built on-site to supply electricity.

A 2024 study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air on the impact of nickel mining in three Indonesian provinces found pollution from smelters and the coal-fired power plants would cost the economy $2.6 billion in 2025, rising to $3.4 billion by 2030, while resulting in more than 3,800 deaths in 2025 and nearly 5,000 by 2030.

US gas could lock Indonesia into fossil fuels

Indonesia’s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations. LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid for storage and transport, burning cleaner than coal but still emitting greenhouse gases.

The risk is that the gas deals could further entrench Indonesia’s reliance on fossil fuels. Committing to long-term deals risks leaving countries stuck with outdated infrastructure, even as the world moves quickly toward cheaper, faster-to-deploy solar and wind power, analysts said.

Indonesia could risk falling behind in the clean energy transition and miss out on investment opportunities, such as data centers seeking renewable energy in Southeast Asia, Setyawati said.

“And once they realize it, it might be too late,” she said.

Meanwhile, Indonesia remains deeply tied to coal. It was the only country to propose building new coal plants and had the third-highest amount of coal capacity globally in 2024. About 80% of the 1.9 gigawatts of coal capacity Indonesia built was for the captive coal plants for smelters processing minerals like nickel and cobalt for electric vehicles, according to a report by U.S.-based nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

“The Indonesian government needs to realize that this is where the world is heading, like it or not,” Setyawati said.

A breakthrough moment for Hyundai and electrified family SUVs

The Northwest Automotive Press Association (NWAPA) has awarded the 2026 Hyundai IONIQ 9 AWD Performance Calligraphy Vehicle of the Year at its 2025 Drive Revolution competition. After two full days of driving on curated routes around the Ilani Casino Resort, NWAPA’s 15 media members found that the IONIQ 9’s 311-mile range, three-row layout, native NACS charging port, and generous cargo/passenger space set it apart in a crowded EV field.

It also won the award for Best Battery Electric Vehicle. Other top scorers included the 2025 Lucid Air Pure Sedan (runner-up Vehicle of the Year) with 372 miles of range and advanced hands-free driving, and the 2025 Dodge Charger Daytona Scat Pack Track Package bringing moody styling and performance flare.

Why does this matter right now?

The U.S. EV incentive landscape shifts sharply on September 30. For buyers, that deadline means tens of thousands in savings depend on whether a model qualifies. Vehicles like the IONIQ 9 that combine federal credit eligibility, practical range, and usable space are enormously advantaged.

Also, given growing concern over charging infrastructure, battery life, and family usability, this award shows what markets really want: not just style or zero emissions, but usable, comfortable, long-distance capability.

How does it compare to rivals?

Compared to the Lucid Air Pure, which scores range and refinement, the IONIQ 9 adds a dimension of versatility. The Dodge Charger Daytona EV is emotional and loud; the IONIQ 9 is commanding and composed. In hybrids and ICE, Toyota’s GR Corolla Premium Plus wins on spirited performance, Hyundai’s Santa Fe Hybrid Calligraphy AWD on family-friendly efficiency.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

For family haulers, long-distance travelers, EV early adopters, and buyers who demand premium touches without sacrificing day-to-day comfort, the IONIQ 9 will serve well. If you seek raw sound, lightweight track thrills, or a minimal footprint, other options may better suit.

Also, buyers sensitive to cost or those in areas with weak charging infrastructure may want to weigh whether the added luxury trims and range justify the price.

What is the long-term significance?

Hyundai’s dominance suggests the family EV formula is no longer optional; it’s essential. Long range, charger compatibility, and utility are becoming standard expectations, not extras. Manufacturers who fall short may find themselves playing catch-up.

At the same time, recognition for hybrids like the Santa Fe and ICE cars like the GR Corolla reminds us that the road to electrification will be varied. Diversity in powertrains isn’t merely transitional; it’s strategic.",https://www.cenlanow.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/32/2025/09/2025_Drive_Revolution_by_Doug_Berger-1661-e1758653960370.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-23 18:03:59.304532

Unless governments set boundaries, AI could accelerate energy demand beyond what grids and climate policies can bear.
Geopolitics of AI’s hunger The AI revolution is redrawing the global energy map.
What is clear is that the AI revolution cannot be separated from the energy revolution.","Artificial intelligence is hailed as the defining technology of the 21st century. Large language models, generative tools and conversational chatbots dominate the public imagination, promising to transform entire industries and daily life. However, behind this excitement lies a less glamorous truth: AI is hungry for electricity. Without abundant, reliable power, the much-heralded AI revolution risks stalling.

The numbers are stark. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global data centers consumed around 415 terawatt-hours of electricity in 2024, equal to 1.5% of total global use. The United States and China alone accounted for 70% of that demand, underscoring how AI power is already concentrated in a handful of geographies. By 2030, global data center demand could nearly double to 945 TWh, more than Japan’s current consumption. And unlike earlier waves of digitalization, AI workloads are the dominant driver of this surge. So at this point, the challenge is clear: how can states remain at the forefront of AI while meeting climate commitments and avoiding energy crises? That dilemma is fast becoming one of the central geopolitical questions of our time.

AI’s spiraling appetite

AI’s electricity needs dwarf those of traditional digital services. A single ChatGPT query can consume 10 times the energy of a Google search. Training a cutting-edge model can require megawatts of continuous power for weeks. In the U.S., data centers consumed 176 TWh in 2023, or 4.4% of national electricity, a figure projected to rise to 6-12% by 2028. China’s demand, growing 15% annually since 2015, has reached 100 TWh and now represents a quarter of the world’s total. Together with Europe, these giants account for roughly 85% of global consumption.

Of course, we must understand that this is not just about servers overheating in Silicon Valley or Shenzhen. It is about entire grids being reshaped. In Ireland, where hyperscale centers already use nearly a fifth of the country’s electricity, the country’s energy operator has restricted new data center connections. Similar concerns are emerging in the Netherlands, Singapore and even parts of the U.S. The question policymakers face is not whether AI will consume more power, because it will, but whether grids can adapt quickly enough without breaking climate pledges or raising public backlash over rising bills.

Search for power

Where will this electricity come from? For now, AI data centers draw from the same fossil-heavy grids that power the rest of the economy. Coal, oil and gas still make up more than 80% of primary energy worldwide. In the U.S. and Europe, this dependence is politically unsustainable. Both Washington and Brussels are pushing tech firms to sign long-term contracts for renewables. The EU’s Green Deal and the U.S. Inflation Reduction Act are designed not only to decarbonise transport and industry but also to green the digital sector.

Elsewhere, however, the picture is different. China and India still rely on coal, but both are experimenting with nuclear expansion and record renewable deployment to match AI’s growth. The Gulf states are seizing the moment, tying digital investments directly to massive solar and nuclear projects. The United Arab Emirates (UAE), for instance, is marketing itself as a hub for ""green compute,” hoping to export AI services powered by clean electricity.

However, it is understandable that renewables alone cannot shoulder the burden. Wind and solar are cheap and fast to deploy but intermittent. The IEA expects natural gas generation to increase by 175 TWh by 2030 just to cover new data center demand, locking in fossil infrastructure at the very moment when it should be phased out. Furthermore, nuclear is being revived as a low-carbon baseload option. U.S. tech giants from Google to Amazon are already signing power purchase agreements with nuclear plants, while policymakers bet on small modular reactors to arrive by the early 2030s.

And then comes fusion. Long ridiculed as ""always decades away,” it is suddenly attracting billions. Google’s 2025 deals to back and eventually purchase fusion power signal a belief that AI will require entirely new energy paradigms. Furthermore, China is spending $1-1.5 billion annually on its fusion program. While commercialisation is far from certain, the mere fact that fusion is now on the agenda shows how AI is bending the energy imagination of states and companies alike.

Can AI solve its energy use?

There is a paradox: AI is not only an energy guzzler, but it could also be an energy saver. Advanced machine learning can forecast demand, balance renewable supply, and manage distributed storage far more efficiently than traditional systems. The World Economic Forum estimates that AI-enabled tools could cut global emissions by up to 10% by 2030, equal to the EU’s annual output. To provide a specific case, Abu Dhabi National Oil Company offers a glimpse: its AI-driven energy management saved $500 million and avoided emissions equivalent to removing 200,000 cars from the road.

But efficiency carries risks. Jevons’ Paradox, the idea that efficiency gains drive greater overall consumption, looms large. Cheaper, smarter computation encourages more of it. Unless governments set boundaries, AI could accelerate energy demand beyond what grids and climate policies can bear. This tension, between AI as both savior and stressor, lies at the heart of the policy debates lately.

Geopolitics of AI’s hunger

The AI revolution is redrawing the global energy map. The ability to train and deploy frontier models is no longer determined only by chips, data or talent. It increasingly depends on something more basic: who controls enough reliable electricity to run them. In this sense, AI has transformed energy security from a traditional question of keeping the lights on into a strategic question of sustaining digital dominance, and therefore into a national security issue.

China understands this better than most. Its AI strategy is inseparable from the state-led expansion of coal, nuclear and renewables. By securing electricity at scale, Beijing ensures that its firms can train the next generation of models without interruption, even if the grid faces wider strains. The U.S. is pursuing a distinctive strategy that intertwines digital industrial growth with its broader decarbonization agenda. The Inflation Reduction Act delivers substantial incentives, such as grants, tax credits and loans, to stimulate clean energy and low-carbon manufacturing. Meanwhile, the CHIPS & Science Act provides targeted subsidies and tax credits to secure semiconductor and AI hardware production on U.S. territory. Together, these policies aim to anchor digital and high-tech growth within a domestic, low-carbon industrial base, although significant project delays some policy implementations have occurred.

The Gulf states are trying to leapfrog, branding themselves as providers of ""green compute” through solar megaprojects and nuclear capacity. By doing so, they aim to shift from oil exporters to data exporters, selling not barrels but compute cycles powered by clean energy. Europe, meanwhile, once again, risks being caught in the middle. Its strong climate rules may restrict AI deployment unless it can scale renewables even faster or import clean electricity from neighbours.

The likely outcome of these developments is a fragmented world of AI-energy zones. Energy-intensive training may be offshored to countries with cheap and abundant power, Iceland with geothermal, Canada with hydro, or the UAE with subsidised solar. Inference, which requires lower latency, might remain closer to consumers. But this division of labour introduces new dependencies. Just as oil once shaped strategic alliances, access to clean compute could dictate future diplomatic ties. Who hosts whose data centers may become as politically sensitive as who hosts whose military bases.

This raises a deeper danger: a widening digital divide rooted in energy inequality. Advanced economies that can subsidise clean energy for AI will race ahead, while middle and low-income states risk being left behind, unable to both decarbonize and compete in AI simultaneously. The political fallout could mirror past energy politics, such as resentment, dependency and vulnerability, only this time revolving around electricity rather than oil.

Türkiye’s opportunity

For middle powers, the challenge is magnified, but so too is the opportunity. Türkiye offers a vivid example. Its current data center capacity is still being built, with around 250 MW, consuming less than 0.5% of national electricity. But President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan’s 2025 AI strategy sets an ambitious target: 1 GW of capacity by 2030, supported by over $10 billion in investment.

This is no small bet. In early 2024, renewables already provided 53% of Türkiye’s power. Solar alone doubled in just over two years to nearly 20 GW, surpassing the government’s 2025 target ahead of schedule. The Akkuyu nuclear plant, with four reactors set to generate 35 TWh annually, will soon cover 10% of national demand. This combination of abundant renewables and nuclear baseload gives Türkiye a unique chance to power its digital economy with low-carbon electricity.

Crucially, Türkiye’s geography adds leverage. At the crossroads of Europe, the Middle East and the Caucasus, Ankara could market itself as a regional computing hub. Low-latency, low-carbon AI services could be exported to three continents, positioning Türkiye not just as a consumer of digital tools but as a provider of critical infrastructure.

AI is changing the energy question from one of supply security to one of strategic advantage. The race for AI is becoming, at its core, a race for energy, who can marshal the watts to fuel the weights of AI models. For leading powers, it means aligning industrial policy, climate strategy and digital ambition. For middle powers like Türkiye, it means seizing the window to turn geography and energy transition into geopolitical leverage.

What is clear is that the AI revolution cannot be separated from the energy revolution. Those who treat them in isolation will fall behind. Those who connect them, politically, technologically and strategically, will shape not just the future of AI but the future balance of power itself.",https://idsb.tmgrup.com.tr/ly/uploads/images/2025/09/23/thumbs/800x531/402885.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 22:00:14.717084

Then, officials take the maximum possible build-out of all those areas and analyze the flood risk, stormwater runoff, and other hazards based on that.
“We were very mindful about not inducing any flood risk to the area,” he says.
The city of Sacramento, for instance, has created a flood insurance model that essentially does this, he says.
You cannot depend solely upon the government, and you certainly can’t depend solely on flood insurance or even FEMA flood insurance.","The city of Roseville, 19 miles northeast of Sacramento, regularly sits at the top of California’s “best places to live” lists. The traffic is reasonable, the weather sunny, and the homes comparatively affordable. There are bike paths and well-ranked schools and, on one recent morning, even an outdoor step aerobics class cheerfully underway in a downtown park.

But there is another reason this railroad town now with some 160,000 residents gets such high accolades. After two decades of careful municipal planning, it has no problem with flooding.

To outsiders, this might seem like a strange claim to fame for a city in California’s Central Valley, away from the coasts and rising sea levels. But as people here know, the Sacramento Valley sits in a highly vulnerable flood plain. During the 1980s and ’90s, this city made national news when its creeks overflowed due to heavy rain. Hundreds of homes were destroyed. President Bill Clinton came to console. And Roseville began a full-scale reimagining of how to protect itself from water.

Now, a quarter century later, the city is regularly held up as a model as other municipalities across the United States increasingly focus on the risk of inland flooding. This summer’s flash flooding in Texas Hill Country was a stark reminder that floods away from the coasts are one of the deadliest, and most financially costly, severe weather events in the U.S.

“Roseville is one of those communities that is ahead of the curve,” says David Feldman, professor emeritus with the department of urban planning and public policy at the University of California, Irvine. “They definitely get it.”

Its approach is not flashy. Talk to Brian Walker, Roseville’s senior engineer and flood plain manager, and you’ll hear a lot about flood plain mapping and storm drainage, funding mechanisms and development ordinances. But this measured and deliberate approach has worked, he and others say.

Roseville was the first city in the U.S. to receive the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) top rating for flood preparedness; residents still receive discounts on home insurance policies because of it. Mr. Walker also works closely with businesses in town. New residential neighborhoods are booming across the city, and last year Bosch announced a $1.9 billion upgrade to its Roseville site, where it plans to produce and test semiconductors.

“Hazard mitigation has real-world implications for families and for businesses,” Mr. Walker says. “If we’re prepared, people can maybe hose out their garage that got a little bit wet and then get back to business.”

Growing awareness in local communities

Earlier this year, the National Weather Service predicted that 2025 would well surpass the annual average of 4,000 flash flood warnings. The reasons for this vary from location to location, but often include a growing number of extreme rain events, as well as infrastructure challenges. More inland flooding means an increased likelihood of tragedies, such as in Texas earlier this year and the destruction from Hurricane Helene in the mountains of North Carolina last year. Monetary strain on cities and towns from New Mexico to New Jersey, from Kentucky to Vermont, is also growing.

“Local communities are becoming more aware of [floods] for a number of reasons,” Dr. Feldman says. “The cost of flooding, and the ultimate costs on residents and local governments, is increasing.”

Some of these costs are direct, such as for emergency response during a crisis. But there is also infrastructure repair, lost tax revenue, and the expense of future mitigation projects.

And there is always the issue of insurance.

Homeowners who live in high-risk flood areas must have flood insurance to get a mortgage. But those policies are expensive. Many researchers also point out that FEMA maps do not consider future development or climate change, so they tend to underestimate flood risk.

“FEMA’s flood maps are based on a historical average, but we know that with climate change, the past isn’t going to be like the future in terms of the type of flooding that we see and the extent of flooding that we see,” says Joel Scata, senior attorney with the Natural Resources Defense Council.

This is why Roseville has long viewed federal flood maps as a minimum standard, says Mr. Walker.

“I think that FEMA’s maps are a huge asset for the country,” he says, adding that he and others in Placer County work regularly with FEMA to update maps and use them as a baseline. “FEMA doesn’t want to require communities to do what Roseville does. Roseville elected to say, ‘FEMA maps are great, but we want to do better.’”

Roseville analyzes flood risk by looking ahead to future development plans, both residential and commercial, in addition to assessing current development, he says. Then, officials take the maximum possible build-out of all those areas and analyze the flood risk, stormwater runoff, and other hazards based on that. With that information, the city creates its own maps and hazard ratings for citizens to access.

Those areas alongside Roseville’s 78 miles of creeks, for instance, tend to be open space, which can help manage the fierce bouts of rain that happen when an atmospheric river drops a fire hose of water on this city.

That means more restrictions on development, Mr. Walker acknowledges. But it also means space for a vast network of bike trails and parks that have become one of the big draws of the city. Additionally, it has prevented the situation facing Florida and other states where pricey businesses and homes are built in those places most likely to flood.

“If there’s one thing that I would say that is the most beneficial for mitigating flood risk, I’d say it is Roseville’s choice to define our flood plains more conservatively,” Mr. Walker says. “So, we define the risk, and then we keep structures and development outside of those risky areas.”

From containing water, to working with it

Across the street from Roseville’s city government offices, over a pedestrian bridge covering both a bike path and a creek, Mr. Walker points out the high-water marker from the city’s 1995 flood. It’s almost as tall as he is.

This park was under several feet of water, he says – and planners here do not forget it. When they renovated the pedestrian bridges, they made sure to make them extra high so that even a flooded creek would rush under them.

“We were very mindful about not inducing any flood risk to the area,” he says. “In all of our projects, we strive for having zero flood impact.”

This, says Dr. Feldman, is what cities will increasingly need to do. Historically, municipalities created infrastructure to try to contain water. (And after its flooding, Roseville, too, built levees.) Now, they must try to work with it.

“There’s a growing awareness of the fact that so-called structural measures to alleviate floods, that is to say, building of dams, levees, fortifications of various types, are not a panacea,” he says. “You have to be more imaginative.”

Individuals and businesses also need to take more responsibility, Dr. Feldman argues. If developers build in an area at risk of flooding, they should have to bear a greater share of the wider costs of flood mitigation and repair. The city of Sacramento, for instance, has created a flood insurance model that essentially does this, he says.

“I think what we’re beginning to learn ... is that you do have to take action locally,” he says. “You cannot depend on the cavalry coming to the rescue after a flood disaster. You cannot depend solely upon the government, and you certainly can’t depend solely on flood insurance or even FEMA flood insurance. The risks are too great.”",https://images.csmonitor.com/csm/2025/09/0922%20NFLOODSAFETY%20open%20space%20LEDE.jpg?alias=standard_900x600,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:44.672774

Viewed from the bottom line, however, Ivanpah is anything but.

The solar power plant, which features three 459-foot towers and thousands of computer-controlled mirrors known as heliostats, cost some $2.2 billion to build.

Construction began in 2010 and was completed in 2014. Now, it’s set to close in 2026 after failing to efficiently generate solar energy.

In 2011, the US Department of Energy under former President Barack Obama issued $1.6 billion in three federal loan guarantees for the project and the Secretary of Energy, Ernest Moniz, hailed it as “an example of how America is becoming a world leader in solar energy.”

But ultimately, it’s been more emblematic of profligate government spending and unwise bets on poorly conceived, quickly outdated technologies.

“Ivanpah stands as a testament to the waste and inefficiency of government subsidized energy schemes,”Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, an American energy advocacy group, told Fox News via statement this past February. It “never lived up to its promises, producing less electricity than expected, while relying on natural gas to stay operational.”

When Ivanpah began operating in 2014, it ranked as the world’s largest solar plant. It seemed like a viable solution to California’s renewable energy goals of employing affordable and efficient technology to reduce the need for fossil fuels.

Located near the California-Nevada border, 65 miles southwest of Las Vegas, the plant’s glowing towers are as striking as some casinos on the Strip.

The facility’s five-square-miles of desert were covered with some 173,500 heliostats, adjusted via computer to catch maximum rays. The computer-controlled mirrors can reflect light from the sun at temperatures that can reach 1,000 degrees in part of the installment.

“The idea was that you could use the sun to produce a heat source,” alternative energy consultant Edward Smeloff told The Post. “The mirrors reflect heat from the sun up to a receiver, which is mounted on top of the tower. That heats a fluid. It creates steam [that spins] a conventional steam turbine. It is complicated.”

Though it sounds like a bit of a Rube Goldberg contraption — and looks like an art installation — Ivanpah was a cutting edge idea for a while. But, as the market changed, it couldn’t compete with newer and less less expensive forms of creating solar power.

“It simply did not scale up,” said Smeloff. “It’s kind of an obsolete technology [that’s] been outpaced by solar photovoltaic technology.”

That tech uses semiconductor material to transform sunlight into energy in a streamlined process. The solar energy panels you see on many residential rooftops or lined up in endless rows across the desert rely on the technology.

A statement from NRG Energy, the Texas based company that was an Ivanpah partner and the largest investor, having put up $300 million, agrees with Smeloff’s view.

“When the power purchase agreements were signed in 2009, the prices were competitive, but advancements over time … have led to more efficient, cost effective and flexible options for producing reliable clean energy,” a company statement read.

Ivanpah hasn’t just been inefficient and expensive, it’s also been deadly for wildlife.

According to the Association of Avian Veterinarians, the power plant “is believed to be responsible for at least 6,000 bird deaths each year.”

They get fried “if they fly in the area where the reflection is going up to the tower,” Smeloff explained

But maybe it didn’t have to be that way. A report published by World Economic Forum earlier this year noted that private investors can be more nimble with new technologies than the government.

“Unlike public market investors, private equity firms can implement transformative changes through hands-on management and aligned incentives,” the report read.

Steven Milloy, senior fellow at the Energy & Environmental Legal Institute and former Trump EPA transition team member, agrees.

“No green project relying on taxpayer subsidies has ever made any economic or environmental sense,” he said. “It’s important that President Trump stop the taxpayer bleeding by ending what he accurately calls the Green New Scam.”",https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/111992415.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024,N,,2025-09-23 19:03:39.767837

On September 24 and 25, 17 allied organizations will meet with more than two dozen members of Parliament to demonstrate clear support for the federal government to build Canada’s east-west electricity grid with renewable energy, while upholding Indigenous and workers’ rights.

The coalition is wide-ranging, with labour unions, Indigenous clean-energy leaders, doctors, faith groups, climate activists, electrical workers and municipal councillors from across Canada working together for the first time to prioritize building renewable electricity across the country.

The coalition agrees that the federal government’s recent announcements on major projects signal missed opportunities. Collectively, they agree that an east-west electricity grid powered by renewable energy meets this moment and requires federal and provincial funding.

An east-west electricity grid with renewable energy will bring health, employment and economic benefits across Canada. This is especially true when it upholds workers’ rights by using made-in-Canada components and union labour. Beyond the health benefits of mitigating climate change, renewables and electrification would also bring billions of dollars in health-care system savings.

All projects must uphold the legal and inherent rights of First Nations, Inuit and Métis Peoples in Canada. The federal government should also recognize the leadership of Indigenous communities by prioritizing Indigenous-led electricity projects.

Today, Provincial electricity systems are significantly more interconnected with the United States than with one another, and Canada’s electricity needs are projected to double or even triple before 2050 due to increasing electrification of industry, transportation and heating. Building interprovincial electricity connections solves multiple problems, with studies showing it will reduce energy costs and improve reliability by connecting regions to low-cost renewable power.

Most people in Canada want to see these projects built, with 77 per cent saying they support upgrading Canada’s grid by connecting provinces and territories with new transmission lines, and 72 per cent supporting federal funding for new transmission lines. When given the choice, Canadians prefer a connected east-west electricity grid to help power Canada’s economy with renewable energy over a new pipeline to transport oil to either the East or West Coast for export.

Melina Laboucan-Massimo – Founder and Executive Director, Sacred Earth, Lubicon Cree

“In an era of wildfires and floods, Indigenous communities across the country are disproportionately facing the burdens of the climate crisis and fossil fuel extraction. Sacred Earth urges political leaders to prioritize critical transmission linkages between the provinces and territories through progressive energy policy and project investments that align with climate science, prioritize public and Indigenous ownership and uphold the rights of workers and Indigenous Peoples. Through these actions, we can advance energy sovereignty, self-determination and climate resiliency, creating a just future for all. The Canadian government must pick a path: injustice and environmental destruction, or a legacy of climate leadership, ecological balance and true economic reconciliation.”

Brandon Dyck – Government Affairs, International Brotherhood of Electrical Workers (IBEW)

“IBEW members across Canada are geared up and ready to build out a truly national electrical network from generation to end user. We share a long history of electrifying Canada through private and public endeavours with a highly skilled and diversified workforce. This renewed focus on clean, affordable power, easily shared across provincial borders, will provide long-term energy for homes and industries while also creating well-paying union jobs. Governments throughout the country should support the initiative for expanding renewables and transmission, with the participation of First Nations, to benefit the communities in which these workers live, creating more opportunities beyond fossil fuel extraction.”

Stephen Thomas – Clean Energy Manager, David Suzuki Foundation

“We are united in our call for the federal government to prioritize funding an east-west electricity grid with renewable energy that upholds workers’ and Indigenous rights. The effects of an east-west grid will be felt widely across the country, creating thousands of jobs, improving energy security and saving people money on energy bills. Building pipelines is a waste of time and money that only benefits fossil fuel billionaires in the long run. This moment in Canada calls for real solutions to the overlapping crises we face. We need jobs that are here to stay, affordable energy and to make sure our kids have healthy air to breathe. This will only be possible through building Canada’s east-west grid with renewables.”

Helen Hsu – Physician, Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment (CAPE)

“The health of the environment is the health of the people. We cannot thrive in isolation. Climate change and extreme weather harm physical and mental health. A national east-west renewable energy grid would reduce air pollution, improving Canadians’ health in the short term, and cut carbon emissions, protecting long-term health.”

David Miller – Co-Chair, Elbows Up for Climate

“This summer, communities throughout the country were seriously affected by wildfires, smoke and evacuation orders — caused or made worse by climate change. Canada needs to do its part to help the world avoid climate breakdown. A national clean energy grid will help us reach our potential to be a clean-energy superpower, directly benefiting our steel, aluminum and advanced manufacturing industries at a time when they’re under threat. It needs to be the government’s first priority as we continue to nation-build.”

AEIdeas

The Wall Street Journal’s USA250 series asked a group of economists to make a long-term forecast: What will American capitalism look like in 2075? Good luck. As the saying goes, predictions are hard, especially about the future.

I would guess that back at the Bicentennial, plenty of experts likely saw anything but a future where capitalism would be severely constrained by resource limits. It was a time of stagflation, oil shocks, and a productivity slowdown that seemed to herald permanent sclerosis. Surely many economists would have predicted more of the same.

Of the economists queried by the WSJ, Harvard economist Gregory Mankiw probably answered the question most expansively in a futurist style:

Thanks to advances in technology, the income of the average American, adjusted for inflation, will be about twice what it is today.

Substantial inequality will persist, and populist agitators will continue to argue that the elites have rigged the economy. Partly as a response, the social safety net will become more robust, including a modest universal basic income.

Taxes will be higher to fund the expanded safety net, and because people will have learned that government debt relative to GDP cannot rise forever. Like most of the world today, the US will have a value-added tax.

Workweeks will be shorter due to both the disincentive effect of higher taxes and the desire of most people to use their greater prosperity to enjoy more leisure.

Manufacturing employment will have nearly disappeared, but manufacturing output will remain strong with robots doing most of the work. Service jobs will expand, and entirely new jobs we cannot now imagine will emerge.

Acknowledging past mistakes, the government will eschew most heavy-handed interventions in competitive markets, such as industrial policy, tariffs, minimum wages, rent control and Nimby zoning.

What might I have written if asked by the WSJ? Here are a few things I for sure would have mentioned (as I do in my 2023 book “The Conservative Futurist: How To Create the Sci-Fi World We Were Promised”), especially if I were in a techno-optimistic mood:

American capitalism will become more explicitly pro-growth, helped along by tailwinds like rapid technological breakthroughs and geopolitical competition, as well as a bipartisan push to build being reflected in public policy.

Cheap, clean, and reliable energy from solar, fusion, advanced fission, and geothermal will provide the foundation for powering AI, robotics, and an overall far more productive economy.

A wave of general-purpose technologies—artificial intelligence, genetic editing, reusable rockets, and advanced energy—will generate myriad new industries and jobs both here on Earth and in orbit.

Cultural optimism will become a productive force, as solutionist thinking replaces dystopian fatalism and society once again celebrates building over blocking.

While AI will have continued to advance to a state that certainly qualifies as artificial general intelligence or superintelligence, it will not have killed us all (as some are currently predicting).

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Western North Carolina is home to thousands of privately owned roads and bridges that serve in many cases as the only access routes for emergency vehicles, mail delivery, and school buses and for people needing to get to school or work and to run the errands of daily life.

The scale of damage to private roads and bridges was tremendous. When North Carolina launched its Private Roads and BridgesProgram (Opens in new window), 6,543 sites were submitted using the state’s interest form, all of which have been assessed by hundreds of team members spread across the counties affected by Hurricane Helene. 3,759 unique sites have been verified by the NC Division of Emergency Management.

In addition, under Governor Stein’s leadership, $10 million has been made available to volunteer organizations to continue their bridge-building efforts. The State of North Carolina has begun repairing and replacing private roads and bridges and will be completing many more repairs in the coming months.

In July, the Governor stopped by the Thomas family’s private bridge in Yancey County, which has been reconstructed (Opens in new window) with funds from the Private Roads and Bridges Program.

Governor Stein continues to encourage North Carolinians in Helene disaster-declared counties who already repaired their private bridge or road to apply for up to 50 percent reimbursement of documented private road and bridge costs.

Independent power companies have argued against the idea of regulated power generation in deregulated states, saying utilities would pass the cost down to customers and further raise bills.","By Laila Kearney

NEW YORK (Reuters) -Major U.S. electric utility plans to step up its push to own power plants in its Mid-Atlantic service area next year, where electricity bills are spiking in the face of rising demand and new supplies are slow to be added, CEO Calvin Butler told Reuters this week.

Exelon’s effort comes as PJM Interconnection, the country’s largest grid providing electricity to over 65 million people in the Midwest to the Mid-Atlantic, faces supply shortfalls amid surging demand from data centers and the electrification of industries like transportation.

Chicago-based Exelon said in July that it was considering its options for building and owning regulated power generation, which electric utilities are legally barred from in about half of U.S. states.

In those states, regulated utilities generally own power lines, while independent power producers own and operate power plants to diversify market power, which can help prevent anti-competitive behavior.

Butler said allowing electric utilities like Exelon to build new regulated power supplies, which is currently barred by state laws in much of PJM’s territory, would ease the grid’s power crunch and bring down prices.

Regulated power generation in the region where Exelon operates would require a series of changes to state law, which Butler said his company is laying the groundwork for by talking to lawmakers and governors ahead of next year’s lawmaking meetings.

""I believe the 2026 legislative sessions are going to be an opportunity for us,"" Butler told Reuters at a meeting in New York on Monday. ""We’re going to be advocating for it.""

About half of U.S. states are considered deregulated, generally, meaning that electric utilities that own transmission and distribution lines cannot also own regulated power generation. The deregulation effort began in the 1990s in response to rising electricity costs.

As power bills rise again, some of the 13 states in PJM, like Maryland and New Jersey, have considered amending their laws to allow regulated power generation.

""I’m one of the staunchest supporters for competitive markets when they work, but we are seeing that the competitive marketplace in PJM is not working,"" Butler said.

U.S. power demand is forecast to hit record highs this year and next, according to the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

FIGHTING RISING BILLS

If allowed by the states, Butler said he would seek to build community solar in low-to-moderate income neighborhoods, which he said would reduce power bills.

Some 80% of recent household electricity bill increases are power supply costs, Butler said, as opposed to utility charges.

With nearly 11 million customers, Exelon is one of the biggest power utilities in the country and covers some of the most impoverished urban communities, including those in Philadelphia, Baltimore and Atlantic City. Some of those cities have also seen the biggest power bill increases over the summer.

Independent power companies have argued against the idea of regulated power generation in deregulated states, saying utilities would pass the cost down to customers and further raise bills.

Butler said regulated utilities can often build power supplies with a lower impact on bills. They have lower borrowing costs and cost of capital and a speedier permitting process because utilities like Exelon already own substantial land and easements to develop new power generation, he said.

Exelon’s overall return on its assets is about 9.5%, or roughly half of what he said independent power producers earn.",https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/news/https://i-invdn-com.investing.com/trkd-images/LYNXNPEL8M0V1_L.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:04:46.325106

Greenhouse-gas driven climate change is driving extreme weather, flooding, erosion, sea-level rise, heat waves, drought, catastrophic wildfires, famine, smog pollution, and other disasters.
Rife with clear errors, cherry-picked data, and misrepresented facts, the report peddles the lie that human-caused climate change is not a threat.
But scientists have known for over a century that greenhouse gases drive climate change.
In addition to Murphy, Whitehouse and Schumer, the letter was signed by the entire Senate Democratic Caucus, including U.S.","WASHINGTON—U.S. Senator Chris Murphy (D-Conn.) joined U.S. Senator Sheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.), Ranking Member of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee, Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.), and the entire Senate Democratic Caucus in demanding the Trump Administration withdraw its legally deficient and factually inaccurate proposed rollback of the endangerment finding that allows the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to control greenhouse gas emissions. The rollback, if finalized, would constitute a formal denial by the EPA that greenhouse gases pose a threat to public health and welfare—a position that defies decades of scientific evidence, agency precedent, and Supreme Court rulings. The 47 Senators called the repeal of the climate and public health protection a “dereliction of duty” and a “blatant failure to protect the American people.”

The endangerment finding is a 2009 scientific determination by EPA that greenhouse gases harm public health and welfare and is the legal basis for U.S. climate policy. It is grounded in extensive peer-reviewed science and confirmed by successive National Climate Assessments and reports from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change. Twice, EPA’s scientific finding has withstood challenge at the D.C. Circuit, and both times, the Supreme Court declined to revisit the decision. Repealing the endangerment finding would ignore overwhelming scientific evidence and set the stage for rolling back air quality standards for power plants, airplanes, and more, making it easier to pollute.

“Scientists, financial experts, international governments, and the American public agree that climate change is a looming crisis. Greenhouse-gas driven climate change is driving extreme weather, flooding, erosion, sea-level rise, heat waves, drought, catastrophic wildfires, famine, smog pollution, and other disasters. These effects drive illness, hospital visits, and deaths, as well as displacement, asset loss, infrastructure damage, rising insurance premiums, declining home values, and long-term destabilization of the national economy …. And yet, in this proposal, EPA proposes to abdicate all responsibility to address this dangerous pollution,” wrote the Senators.

Not only do EPA’s actions fail to protect the American public from well-documented harms, but the agency’s justifications “are directly at odds with Supreme Court precedent, Congressional directive, and the facts.”

“The Court in [Massachusetts v. EPA] found that ‘[c]arbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and hydrofluorocarbons are without a doubt’ air pollutants under the Clean Air Act’s definition, and that ‘[t]he statute is unambiguous’ on this point,” wrote the Senators. And “[u]nder the clear terms of the Clean Air Act, EPA can avoid [making an endangerment finding] only if it determines that greenhouse gases do not contribute to climate change or if it provides some reasonable explanation as to why it cannot or will not exercise its discretion to determine whether they do.”

To justify the repeal, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has relied on a Department of Energy pseudoscientific report written by known climate deniers with close ties to fossil fuel and polluting industry actors. Rife with clear errors, cherry-picked data, and misrepresented facts, the report peddles the lie that human-caused climate change is not a threat.

But scientists have known for over a century that greenhouse gases drive climate change. “In 1896, Swedish scientist Svante Arrhenius concluded that greenhouse gas emissions from human activities contribute to a global “greenhouse effect”, driving global warming. One hundred and twenty-nine years later, the reality of human-caused climate change is not up for debate,” wrote the Senators.

“Congress established the Clean Air Act to protect the public health and welfare, and the Supreme Court confirmed that this includes EPA’s obligation to regulate greenhouse gases to the extent they endanger the same. The science is clear that they do so. We ask that you withdraw this proposal and reverse your decision to rescind the 2009 endangerment finding,” concluded the Senators.

In addition to Murphy, Whitehouse and Schumer, the letter was signed by the entire Senate Democratic Caucus, including U.S. Senators Angela Alsobrooks (D-Md.), Tammy Baldwin (D-Wis.), Michael Bennet (D-Colo.), Richard Blumenthal (D-Conn.), Lisa Blunt Rochester (D-Del.), Cory Booker (D-N.J.), Maria Cantwell (D-Wash.), Chris Coons (D-Del.), Catherine Cortez Masto (D-Nev.), Tammy Duckworth (D-Ill.), Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), John Fetterman (D-Pa.), Ruben Gallego (D-Ariz.), Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.), Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.), Martin Heinrich (D-N.M.), John Hickenlooper (D-Colo.), Mazie Hirono (D-Hawaii), Tim Kaine (D-Va.), Mark Kelly (D-Ariz.), Andy Kim (D-N.J.), Angus King (I-Maine), Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.), Ben Ray Luján (D-N.M.), Ed Markey (D-Mass.), Jeff Merkley (D-Ore.), Patty Murray (D-Wash.), Jon Ossoff (D-Ga.), Alex Padilla (D-Calif.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Jack Reed (D-R.I.), Jacky Rosen (D-Nev.), Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii), Adam Schiff (D-Calif.), Jeanne Shaheen (D-N.H.), Elissa Slotkin (D-Mich.), Tina Smith (D-Minn.), Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.), Mark Warner (D-Va.), Raphael Warnock (D-Ga.), Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.), Peter Welch (D-Vt.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.).

Startup NatPower reported that it is investing more than $1.1 billion into a giant 32-acre battery energy storage facility near Middlesbrough that will store renewable energy for later use, allowing more clean power to supplement the grid.

The Teesside Gigapark will be located at the energy and utility service Sembcorp Utilities' site. It will be the largest and longest-duration storage facility of its kind once completed in 2028, Interesting Engineering and NatPower reported.

""The Teesside Gigapark is more than a storage project. It combines large-scale batteries with industrial electrification … setting a new standard for the U.K. energy sector,"" IE's Sujita Sinha wrote.

NatPower touts the privately funded project as a money-saving grid support that could conserve $4.1 billion in efficiencies annually by saving typically wasted renewable energy. It will use lithium-ion batteries that can store electricity for four hours, per IE.

Holding the cleaner power is crucial for using it during peak demand times, such as early evening hours when the sun goes down, but power use remains high. NatPower plans for the Teesside facility to eventually be able to provide electricity over an impressive eight hours, IE's report added.

Battery storage is being developed in the United States, too. In Texas, Tesla Megapacks are key grid contributors. A nearly 5,000-acre solar panel/battery storage facility is operational near Las Vegas.

It's a concept that can be realized at home, as well. Rooftop solar panels combined with batteries can generate and store free solar energy that can reduce or eliminate your utility bill. EnergySage is a free resource that can help you secure tax incentives while they last, compare quotes, and find a timely professional installer. It's advice that can save you up to $10,000 if you buy the panels before rebates expire at the end of the year due to federal policy changes.

The cleaner energy, at homes and at larger facilities, also limits planet-warming pollution produced when dirty fuels are burned to generate power. Air pollution impacts nearly everyone on the planet, according to the World Health Organization. And Earth's overheating is even hurting academic performance, according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency.

At Teesside, NatPower officials have some interesting plans for the battery project. Around 200 construction jobs will be created. Looking forward, officials intend to work with colleges and environmental groups on training programs for future clean-energy jobs. A focus of the project will be powering ships at a nearby port, allowing the vessels to turn off dirty diesel engines, all according to IE.

""Teesside, our most advanced Gigapark, will be the blueprint for combining large-scale storage with electrification of ports and industry, transforming Teesside into a net-zero economic powerhouse within five years,"" NatPower UK CEO Stefano D.M. Sommadossi said in the IE story.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Teesside-Gigaparkimage-rec3YdSn1GdOw1Omx-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:05:34.997501

That's below the U.S. average of 30%.

Why it matters: The numbers indicate some success in reducing emissions to curb climate change, but the Trump administration's pro-coal, anti-wind-and-solar attitude could jeopardize that progress as it gets harder to start new clean energy projects.

Between the lines: The nationwide emissions decline was primarily a result of less coal being burned to generate electricity.

An uptick in natural gas use, plus clean wind and solar energy, ""offset the decrease in coal generation,"" per the EIA.

The parties should act responsibly in the vote,” Mr. Lira said during Macro Day, an event hosted Monday (22) by BTG Pactual in São Paulo.
Hours earlier, at the same event, House Speaker Hugo Motta said he planned to schedule a vote on the tax exemption for next week.
Mr. Motta defended the bill approved by a special committee, with a favorable report by Mr. Lira, and said it could pass in the plenary.
Once it’s ready, I want to bring the income tax bill to a vote next week,” Mr. Motta added.","The rapporteur for the bill granting income tax exemption for those earning up to R$5,000 a month, Congressman Arthur Lira, predicted a “tough debate” when the measure goes to a vote in the Lower House and warned that the government “must be prepared” for possible changes. Mr. Lira said there was “unanimity” on creating a tax-free bracket, but that there would be “a lot of discussion” over compensation measures.

There will be a very intense debate in the plenary about form, values, and conditions, on how to offset the measure. The government must be prepared. The parties should act responsibly in the vote,” Mr. Lira said during Macro Day, an event hosted Monday (22) by BTG Pactual in São Paulo.

Hours earlier, at the same event, House Speaker Hugo Motta said he planned to schedule a vote on the tax exemption for next week. Mr. Motta defended the bill approved by a special committee, with a favorable report by Mr. Lira, and said it could pass in the plenary.

Both confirmed that Mr. Lira would present his report to party leaders in the House on Tuesday (23). Mr. Lira said he would outline the main points of the document and then seek dialogue with other party leaders, civil society, and representatives of productive sectors.

“The atmosphere, as you all know, was not easy. The House floor is an environment of great political and ideological diversity, with more conservative and more liberal views, and the climate was not calm for a project like this, which is important both for lower-income groups and for those already burdened by heavy taxation,” he said, referring to the search for negotiated solutions.

According to Mr. Lira, it is necessary to balance the social and fiscal goals of the bill, which benefits the poor, with the concerns of “those who produce, who generate jobs, who carry Brazil on their shoulders,” so that “they are not hit with yet another tax in a harsher way.”

Certainly, the debate will emerge about implementing a new tax, whether it involves dividends or not, and whether to tax individuals as corporations,” he said. “The productive class—entrepreneurs, people who create jobs and income—is still working through some issues in the text. We have not closed the door. We are listening to everyone,” Mr. Lira added, reaffirming his expectation that the House will review the bill next week. “When it comes to tax issues, we all know the debate becomes more intense and rigid because everyone considers the needs and challenges of each sector.”

The lawmaker observed that the special committee, where the report was approved in July, “is a much more controlled environment” than the House floor. Despite the tense atmosphere in Congress, he called for a “technical, independent, harmonious, and responsible” discussion so that the issue is not influenced by other interests or strategies for the 2026 elections.

Mr. Lira said he believed he had fulfilled his role so far, “with all the difficulties the matter requires.” He agreed that the exemption “in some way brings tax justice,” a theme emphasized by President Lula’s government.

Mr. Motta said he does not believe the compensation measures for the exemption, proposed by the government, will be removed from the bill to be voted on. Still, he emphasized that lawmakers must act responsibly and avoid approving measures that increase spending and threaten public finances.

“The plenary is sovereign, but the work of the special committee was well built,” the House speaker said. “Arthur Lira’s meeting with party leaders will be crucial to explain the reasoning behind the report.

MONTREAL, Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Gildan Activewear Inc. (GIL: TSX and NYSE) (“Gildan” or the “Company”) announced today that it has priced an offering of US$1.2 billion aggregate principal amount of senior unsecured notes in two series, consisting of US$600 million aggregate principal amount of 4.700% senior unsecured notes, due October 7, 2030 and US$600 million aggregate principal amount of 5.400% senior unsecured notes, due October 7, 2035 (together, the “Notes”).

The Company expects to use the net proceeds from the offering of the Notes, together with cash on hand or other immediately available funds, to fund the cash portion of the consideration to be paid for the acquisition of Hanesbrands Inc., the refinancing of Hanesbrands’ existing indebtedness and related transaction fees and expenses related to the offering of the Notes and the acquisition of Hanesbrands.

The offering is expected to close on or about October 7, 2025, subject to customary closing conditions.

The Notes will be senior unsecured obligations of the Company and will rank equally in right of payment with all of the Company’s existing and future senior unsecured and unsubordinated indebtedness.

The Company is offering the Notes pursuant to an exemption under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the “Securities Act”). The initial purchasers of the Notes will offer the Notes only to persons reasonably believed to be qualified institutional buyers in reliance on Rule 144A under the Securities Act or outside the United States to certain persons in reliance on Regulation S under the Securities Act. The Notes have not been and will not be registered under the Securities Act or under any state securities laws or the securities laws of any other jurisdiction. Therefore, the Notes may not be offered or sold in the United States absent registration or an applicable exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act and applicable state securities laws. The Notes have not been and will not be qualified for sale to the public under applicable securities laws in Canada and, accordingly, any offer and sale of the Notes in Canada will be made on a basis which is exempt from the prospectus requirements of such securities laws.

This press release shall not constitute an offer to sell or an invitation to purchase, in any jurisdiction in which such offer or invitation would be unlawful.

CARLSBAD, Calif., Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Natural Alternatives International, Inc. (""NAI"") (Nasdaq: NAII), a leading formulator, manufacturer, and marketer of customized nutritional supplements, today announced a net loss of $7.2 million, or ($1.20) per diluted share, on net sales of $33.9 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025 compared to a net loss of $1.9 million, or ($0.32) per diluted share, in the fourth quarter of the prior fiscal year. Our net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 included non-recurring non-cash charges of $1.4 million related to the settlement of a litigation matter and a $4.8 million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Excluding these charges, our net loss for the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 would have been $1.0 million.

Net sales during the three months ended June 30, 2025, increased $4.4 million, or 15%, to $33.9 million compared to $29.5 million recorded in the comparable prior year period. During the same period, private-label contract manufacturing sales increased 15% to $31.8 million. Private-label contract manufacturing sales increased primarily due to increased orders from several of our existing customers and orders from new customers, partially offset by reduced orders from one of our larger customers.

CarnoSyn® beta-alanine royalty, licensing and raw material sales revenue increased 14% to $2.1 million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2025, as compared to $1.8 million for the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2024. The increase in CarnoSyn® beta-alanine royalty, licensing, and raw material sales revenue during the fourth quarter of fiscal 2025 was primarily due to increased raw material sales to existing customers and royalty income.

Our net loss for fiscal year 2025 was $13.6 million, or ($2.28) per diluted share, compared to a net loss of $7.2 million, or ($1.23) per diluted share, for fiscal year 2024. Our net loss for fiscal 2025 included non-recurring non-cash charges of $1.4 million related to the settlement of a litigation matter and a $4.8 million valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets. Excluding these charges, our net loss for fiscal 2025 would have been $7.4 million.

Net sales during the year ended June 30, 2025, increased $16.1 million, or 14%, to $129.9 million as compared to $113.8 million recorded in the comparable prior year period. During the year ended June 30, 2025, private-label contract manufacturing sales increased 16% to $121.8 million, as compared to $105.4 million in the comparable prior period. CarnoSyn® beta-alanine royalty, licensing and raw material sales revenue decreased 4% to $8.1 million during the fiscal 2025, as compared to $8.4 million for fiscal 2024.

While we grew sales during the three and twelve months ended June 30, 2025, we experienced a net loss primarily due to underutilization of our available factory capacities, a valuation allowance against our domestic net deferred income tax assets and the accrual of a litigation settlement. Although our overall sales forecast for fiscal 2026 includes a significant increase in sales as compared to fiscal 2025, we currently anticipate we will experience a net loss in the first half of fiscal 2026, net income in the second half of fiscal 2026, and net income for the full fiscal 2026 year.

As of June 30, 2025, we had cash of $12.3 million and working capital of $30.5 million, compared to $12.0 million and $38.1 million respectively, as of June 30, 2024. As of June 30, 2025, we had $9.9 million of borrowing capacity on our credit facility of which we had outstanding borrowings of $1.9 million.

Mark A. Le Doux, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer of NAI stated, “The results achieved in our final quarter of fiscal year 2025 were negatively impacted by non-cash charges associated with accounting treatment of deferred tax assets and a litigation settlement, however, the net results were still a disappointment. The fourth quarter and fiscal 2025 showed increases in revenues and our preliminary outlook for this next fiscal year shows some ‘green shoots’ emerging in renewed growth in current and new customer relationships. Our team remains focused on client expansion, channel diversity and process improvements to increase revenues and profitability. We remain hopeful we will emerge from fiscal year 2026 profitable with expanded client relationships and revenues. We continue to focus our attention on adoption of the remarkable benefits associated with our highly bio-available form of CarnoSyn® beta-alanine known as TriBsyn™ and continue our human research in various settings around the world to bolster scientific support for this remarkable molecule – especially in light of the concerns associated with the millions of global consumers utilizing pharmaceutical agents to control weight. This molecule also addresses key concerns for addressing good health in the aging demographics by addressing issues like sarcopenia, mental function, skeletal integrity, cardiovascular function and immune responses to external challenges. We remain committed to maintaining the integrity of our balance sheet in our renewed dedication to secure profits in the near future.”

CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Sept. 23, 2025 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Biogen Inc. (Nasdaq: BIIB) today announced that the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Complete Response Letter (CRL) for the Company’s supplemental New Drug Application (sNDA) for the high dose regimen of nusinersen for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). The FDA letter requested an update to the technical information be included in the Chemistry Manufacturing and Controls (CMC) module of the sNDA.

The letter did not cite any deficiencies in the clinical data of the high dose regimen. The FDA provided options for resolution, and Biogen is planning to resubmit the application promptly based upon readily available information.

“While this outcome was unexpected, we remain committed to bringing the high dose regimen to people living with SMA,” said Priya Singhal, M.D., M.P.H., Head of Development at Biogen. “We are working diligently to provide the necessary information to the FDA.”

Biogen is working with regulatory authorities around the world to advance the high dose regimen as an additional dosing option for people living with SMA. The high dose regimen of SPINRAZA (nusinersen) was recently approved in Japan and is actively under review by the European Medicines Agency (EMA) and other global regulators.

About SPINRAZA

SPINRAZA (nusinersen) 12mg/5 mL injection is approved in more than 71 countries to treat infants, children and adults with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA). As a foundation of care in SMA, more than 14,000 individuals have been treated with SPINRAZA worldwide. 1

SPINRAZA has shown efficacy across ages and SMA types with a well-established safety profile based on data in patients treated up to 10 years, 2,3 combined with unsurpassed real-world experience.

Braun said data centers may not be for every community, but tech companies can also do a better job of highlighting the benefits.
The state also created tax incentives for data centers in 2019.
When asked whether more should be done by lawmakers to ensure affordable electric bills, Braun said ratepayers need a voice.
Applications to be on the IURC will be open until October 14th.","Governor Mike Braun announced applications are open for three vacant seats on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission — an agency that has a big impact on Hoosiers' electric bills.

The IURC decides whether a utility can recover the costs of things like power plants — something several utilities are looking to build as data centers drive up energy demand.

Braun said the state needs to keep rates in check while also growing Indiana's economy.

""We're seeking entrepreneurial individuals who are going to think out of the box and have a special attention to rates Hoosiers bear in general,"" he said.

Google recently withdrew its proposal for a one in Marion County after facing public backlash. Braun said data centers may not be for every community, but tech companies can also do a better job of highlighting the benefits.

""Met with a rural county just last week that would love to have a data center, because they don't have enough population to support a ton of employees, but they sure could use the [capital expenditures], the assessed value,"" he said.

In other words, they could use the tax revenue for things like schools and roads.

To fill those IURC seats, Braun appointed Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski, former Republican state representative Dollyne Sherman and Floyd County business executive Cory Cochran to the IURC nominating committee.

They'll review applications with four committee members appointed by the legislature and forward their suggestions to Braun.

The consumer and environmental advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition has criticized Braun, calling his statements ""hollow.""

The group said Braun has pushed for expensive nuclear, natural gas and coal instead of more affordable solutions like energy efficiency and community solar.

Consumer advocates have said that the legislature has often tied the hands of the IURC by allowing utilities to approve more kinds of costs and more quickly. The state also created tax incentives for data centers in 2019.

CAC Executive Director Kerwin Olson said Gov. Braun has a chance to lead.

""The rate hikes Hoosiers have endured in recent years are just the tip of the iceberg. We need decisive action to reverse the policies that got us here in the first place and embrace energy solutions that will lower bills and ensure long-term reliability without sending costs through the roof,"" Olson said.

When asked whether more should be done by lawmakers to ensure affordable electric bills, Braun said ratepayers need a voice.

""I will be that voice and I think the legislature's got eyes and ears — and they've been listening to and watching regarding utility prices,"" he said.

Thailand’s Energy Regulatory Commission (ERC) announced that the country’s first pilot project for the Direct Power Purchase Agreement (DPPA) is in its final stages of review and is expected to launch by the end of this year. Authorities hope the scheme will attract international data center developers to invest in Thailand. If industry response is strong, ERC may lift the current 2GW trading cap.

Third-party access rules still under discussion

ERC Secretary-General Poonpat Leesombatpiboon said officials from the Ministry of Energy and the Board of Investment (BOI) have been involved in discussions, with the Third Party Access Code being one of the main issues. ERC has previously stated that if power companies use the national grid in line with the code, related transactions would incur wheeling charges.

As more industries move toward low-carbon and net-zero goals, the government faces increasing pressure to liberalize the green electricity market. Foreign data center developers have explicitly told Thai authorities that they would consider investing if a clear DPPA policy is in place.

Naruechon Dhumrongpiyawut, CEO of Thai clean energy developer Gunkul Engineering, also urged the government to keep pace with other Asian countries such as the Philippines and Taiwan, noting that countries adopting DPPAs are more successful in attracting foreign investment—something she herself prefers when expanding business opportunities abroad.

Thailand’s National Energy Policy Council (NEPC) currently caps DPPA transactions at 2GW. Poonpat said the cap may be raised in the future to meet growing demand.

LNG imports decline for the first time since 2014

Electricity supply and demand in Thailand remain closely tied to the economy and weather. Government data shows that as of July this year, gas-fired power generation dropped 12%, the steepest fall on record, while liquefied natural gas (LNG) imports also contracted for the first time since 2014. Natural gas accounts for 56% of Thailand’s total power generation.

Raksit Pattanapitoon, an analyst at Norway-based consultancy Rystad Energy, noted that weather has been the key driver of Thailand’s electricity demand this year. Frequent rainfall in recent months reduced instances of extreme heat, lowering the demand for air conditioning.

Meanwhile, the World Bank projects Thailand’s economic growth will slow to 1.8% this year and further to 1.7% next year, citing weak exports, slower-than-expected tourism recovery, and political instability. These factors are also dampening electricity demand.

For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Rewiring America said it's not clear if that will continue given the accelerated expiration dates, and recommended consumers check with their tax adviser.",https://media.wltx.com/assets/CCT/images/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71/20241126T221110/e5bdd104-e1fa-4057-ab69-64c4cd72da71_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 18:03:31.443092

Introduced in 2022 under the Inflation Reduction Act signed, the federal tax credits — $7,500 for new and $4,000 for used — are being phased out due to President Trump's One Big Beautiful Bill Act, which is also ending a series of other clean energy credits over the next several months.

With just one week to go until the expiration date of the Biden-era EV credit, customers are flocking to dealerships to cash in. EV sales reached a record high in August, with new EV sales up 17.7% year over year and used EV sales up 59% for the same period, data from Cox Automotive shows.

""As we approach the sunset of the IRA tax credit, we expect September to mirror August's elevated sales activity, driven by time-sensitive purchase and lease offers,"" Cox Automotive said in its report.

The findings jibe with data from Cars Commerce — whose holdings include Cars.com — that shows a 33% surge in EV demand since last year as shoppers rush to take advantage of the credits. The automotive tech company also found that used EVs are on dealers' lots for 46 days on average, a nearly 30% decrease from last last year that indicates the sector of the EV market is rising in popularity.

Deals to be had

Anxious to clear out EV inventory before the arrival of new models in November, dealerships have been offering their own incentives, such as monthly lease rates that are are as little as 1% of the car's sticker price.

The Emich Volkswagen dealership in Denver has lowered EV lease rates to $40 a month. ""This deal is absurd and it's never gonna happen again,"" Philip De Jong, the marketing director at Emich, told CBS MoneyWatch.

One customer at the Denver dealership, Stephen Hynes, told CBS News' senior transportation correspondent Kris Van Cleave that that he would save as much as $400 a month compared with his last car payment.

""I'm getting an electric vehicle now; it's because of this tax credit,"" said Hynes.

A chart below from Cars.com shows which vehicles are still eligible for the federal tax credit, based on information from Environmental Protection Agency.

What will happen after the tax credit ends?

September 2025 could end up being the ""single biggest EV month in history,"" Tim Horvick, owner of the San Tan Ford dealership outside of Phoenix, told CBS' Van Cleave. But come October, when the EV credit is no longer in effect, the sales landscape could shift.

""It is the concern,"" Horvick said. ""It could be challenging.""

As a result of the coming end of the tax credit, along with other policy changes introduced by the Trump administration, automakers have already slowed their production of electric vehicles, shifting their attention to more popular gas and hybrid models, CBS News reported.

But not all experts believe the expiration of the tax credit will have a huge effect on future EV sales, and that's simply because sales were low to begin with.

EV sales ""can't fall off a cliff because they're not very high,"" Patrick Anderson, CEO of Anderson Economic Group, a Michigan-based economic consultancy, told CBS News' Van Cleave.

If finalized, oil and gas facilities, suppliers, and injection sites wouldn’t have to report emissions data to the EPA after 2024.
In this case, the administration’s target is greenhouse gas reporting for oil and gas producers, processors, and operators mandated under “Subpart W” of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which was revised by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.
Based on 2023 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data, oil and gas producers are the second-largest contributors of CO₂ emissions behind power plants (Figure 1).
Figure 1 The change to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program reporting requirements and other climate actions under the Biden administration were seen as a step forward.","Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published a proposed rule in the Federal Register that would eliminate reporting requirements for 46 types of sources under the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program. If finalized, oil and gas facilities, suppliers, and injection sites wouldn’t have to report emissions data to the EPA after 2024. While the action aligns with the administration’s efforts to undermine climate action and ease regulations for corporations, it is facing pushback from an unexpected source: the oil and gas companies.

EPA’s move ties back to an executive order in January, titled “Unleashing Prosperity Through Deregulation,” that aimed to reduce the costs for companies in complying with federal regulations. In this case, the administration’s target is greenhouse gas reporting for oil and gas producers, processors, and operators mandated under “Subpart W” of the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program, which was revised by the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022.

Congress initially created the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Rule with the passage of the 2008 Consolidated Appropriations Act, which stated that “greenhouse gases accumulating in the atmosphere are causing average temperatures to rise at a rate outside the range of natural variability and are posing a substantial risk of rising sea-levels, altered patterns of atmospheric and oceanic circulation, and increased frequency and severity of floods, droughts, and wildfires.” Data collection was made official under section 114 of the Clean Air Act. Later, the Inflation Reduction Act amended the Clean Air Act to add reporting requirements for “methane emissions and [a] waste reduction incentive program for petroleum and natural gas systems.”

Dealing with emissions from oil and gas production has been a challenge in achieving both US and international climate goals, especially as countries try to transition to cleaner energy. Based on 2023 Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program data, oil and gas producers are the second-largest contributors of CO₂ emissions behind power plants (Figure 1).

Figure 1

The change to the Greenhouse Gas Reporting Program reporting requirements and other climate actions under the Biden administration were seen as a step forward. But like in other areas of the government, the Trump administration is removing the data to hide the problem. One potential snag in Trump’s plan is the oil and gas producers themselves. According to Politico, no major trade associations have requested that the EPA end the reporting requirement. That’s because beginning in 2027, companies importing gas into the European Union will be required to provide the very same emissions data.

To comply with the EU’s new policy, the emissions data must be verified by a third party, which in the past has been the EPA. Without EPA monitoring, companies will have to rely on outside certification through third parties, which will increase costs for those looking to transport oil and gas on global markets, as well as for climate-conscious purchasers within the US. Ironically, the new EU policies are linked to Trump’s pressure on European nations to stop importing Russian gas, instead favoring US suppliers.

Ultimately, oil and gas companies could be the ones to stop the EPA’s plan to end reporting requirements, even though their goals are different from a clean energy transition. That’s because, much like with his tariffs, Trump’s actions will end up costing these companies more, highlighting the complex and often counterintuitive consequences of deregulation. While ultimately an environmental justice movement should be based on the dismantling of the fossil fuel industry, we’ll take what we can get right now.",https://cepr.net/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/ETH_Emissions.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:05:10.559720

“Nuclear energy is the way of the future,” said U.S. Senator Roger Marshall. “Nuclear produces reliable, clean power—and a lot of it. I’m excited about the prospect of welcoming TerraPower’s Natrium reactor to Kansas and look forward to helping bring this project to fruition so that Kansans can have safe, reliable, and affordable energy.”

“In order to continue our state’s phenomenal surge in economic activity that benefits Kansas residents and communities,” Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of Commerce David Toland said, “we need to consider all innovative options that strengthen our competitive position while driving down costs for consumers. This project could do both.”

The Natrium technology features a 345 MWe sodium-cooled fast reactor with a molten salt-based energy storage system. The storage technology can boost the system’s output to 500 MW of power when needed as it is designed to keep base output steady, ensuring constant reliability, and can quickly ramp up when demand peaks — it is the only advanced reactor design with this capability.

TerraPower broke ground on the first Natrium project in 2024 in Wyoming and is positioned to be America’s next commercial-scale nuclear power plant.

Wagner emphasized the importance of workforce development and education during the Western Governors’ Association’s two-day Energy Superabundance conference held Monday and Tuesday at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls.
It increased its workforce from about 4,000 employees roughly seven years ago to about 6,000 employees today.
Over the past couple of years, the Idaho National Laboratory has hired between 700 and 1,000 people a year, Wagner said.
Instead of being federal employees, the Idaho National Laboratory’s workforce are Battelle Energy Alliance employees.","IDAHO FALLS – If Idaho is going to lead a nuclear renaissance in America, Idaho legislators and other policy makers must focus on workforce development, training and educational opportunities, Idaho National Laboratory Director John Wagner said.

Wagner emphasized the importance of workforce development and education during the Western Governors’ Association’s two-day Energy Superabundance conference held Monday and Tuesday at Idaho National Laboratory in Idaho Falls.

‘Searching for energy solutions,’ Idaho Gov. Little creates new task force to advance nuclear energy

During the conference, Wagner told Idaho Gov. Brad Little and Utah Gov. Spencer Cox that America is in the middle of a nuclear renaissance and Idaho National Laboratory is in the process of building and permitting new nuclear reactors for the first time in 50 years to help meet the country’s increasing energy demands.

To tackle the challenge and lead the renaissance, Idaho will need a robust workforce with a variety of skills, Wagner said.

“When you think about your path, fast forward, and we’re building out many reactors in the West and beyond. It’s not just about nuclear engineers anymore,” Wagner said in an interview with the Idaho Capital Sun. “It’s about welders. It’s about all the different crafts. It’s about nuclear operators.”

Idaho National Laboratory director says Launch program can help state’s workforce pipeline

Wagner said Little’s Idaho Launch program, which provides up to $8,000 for Idaho students to receive career-technical training or enroll in eligible higher education programs tied to in-demand careers, is an excellent program that he supports.

“Making that easier to get first-generation college graduates into the pipeline is fantastic,” Wagner told the Sun. “I myself am a first generation college graduate, so l love that. That’s a great example of what can be done.”

Little has continuously championed the Idaho Launch program, but funding has come under fire over the past two years by conservative Republican legislators looking to reduce state spending.

Wagner also said new workforce training initiatives need to be launched. He suggested Idaho legislators could look to the Navy Nuclear Power School for ideas and best practices to replicate in Idaho. The Navy Nuclear Power School is a technical training program that helps train enlisted students and officers in math, physics and other disciplines to prepare students to work in nuclear power for the Navy.

Wagner did not have a specific proposal to put forward, but suggested Idaho elected officials could leverage the state’s existing higher education institutions like the College of Eastern Idaho, Idaho State University, Boise State University, University of Idaho and more to develop a workforce training program to prepare students to work at Idaho National Laboratory or in the nuclear industry.

Wagner said he has met with leaders in Utah and Idaho about creating the equivalent of a nuclear power school located in the West.

“How do you leverage what’s there, adjust the curriculum, and provide that sort of package?” Wagner said. “I would love to see us do something like that.”

Nuclear Regulatory Commission Commissioner Bradley Crowell also emphasized the importance of developing a competent and reliable workforce when he spoke Monday during the Energy Superabundance conference at INL.

“My biggest concern I shared with (Govs. Little and Cox): the highest hurdle to success, going forward, is workforce,” Crowell said Monday. “That’s workforce both for trade and scientists and engineers, et cetera. In the private sector, there’s not enough there – they are hiring actively. And on the government side, in the (Nuclear Regulatory Commission) we have serious current workforce shortcomings that are going to be exacerbated going forward.”

Idaho National Laboratory has hired 700 to 1,000 employees per year recently

As one of the state’s largest employers, Idaho National Laboratory will continue to need a robust and skilled workforce, Wagner said.

The INL has experienced significant growth in the past seven years, Wagner said. It increased its workforce from about 4,000 employees roughly seven years ago to about 6,000 employees today.

Over the past couple of years, the Idaho National Laboratory has hired between 700 and 1,000 people a year, Wagner said. Although he does not see that level of growth continuing now that he views INL’s staff as “right-sized,” Wagner said the lab will need to continue to hire staff due to attrition, retirement and the need for specialized skills and positions.

“Which is still significant when you’re talking about 6,000 people,” Wagner said. “So we will continue to have those needs.”

Wagner said Idaho National Laboratory employees have not been subject to workforce reductions, early retirement buyouts and deferred resignations that have affected the federal government this year, because INL employees are not federal employees. The U.S. Department of Energy owns the laboratory, but it hires a contractor, Battelle Energy Alliance, to operate and manage the lab. Instead of being federal employees, the Idaho National Laboratory’s workforce are Battelle Energy Alliance employees.

According to Type One, Infinity One will verify important aspects of the Infinity Two fusion pilot plant design and operating efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and affordability.
“We are proud that the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion project could be developed in Oak Ridge, creating high-quality jobs and driving continued economic growth and opportunity for Tennesseans.”","According to the companies, the LOI advances their collaboration in support of a 350-MW baseload fusion power plant, called Infinity Two, at the site near Knoxville, Tenn., using Type One’s stellarator fusion technology.

The LOI also covers potential future use of the prototype facilities as an operator and maintenance training facility for the Infinity Two workforce. The companies hope to have the pilot fusion power plant operational by the mid-2030s.

Infinity One: Project Infinity was born out of a triparty memorandum of understanding signed in 2023 among TVA, Type One, and Oak Ridge National Laboratory. At the time, the three parties noted “that fusion has the potential to become an attractive carbon-free power generation technology” and had “an interest in the successful development and commercialization of economic and practical fusion energy technologies.”

In February 2024, Type One announced plans to relocate its headquarters from Madison, Wis., to the Bull Run site, which was selected as the location for building the company’s first in situ stellarator testbed, Infinity One.

According to Type One, Infinity One will verify important aspects of the Infinity Two fusion pilot plant design and operating efficiency, reliability, maintainability, and affordability.

Infinity Two: Earlier this year, Type One and TVA signed a cooperative agreement to jointly develop plans for the Infinity Two power plant, and in July the companies signed the first set of commercial contracts related to Project Infinity.

Under the contracts, TVA, through its Power Service Shops facility in Muscle Shoals, Ala., and with support from other locations, will assist in the development of tailored welding and fabrication techniques for the Infinity One stellarator testbed. The manufacturing and construction methods developed for Infinity One will then be applied to the building of Infinity Two.

Type One said that Infinity Two is being developed using today’s existing materials and fundamental fusion technologies to support the near-term deployment of the stellarator technology.

Quotables: “TVA is a leader in pursuing advanced nuclear technologies we need to power America’s economic prosperity and fuel artificial intelligence, quantum computing, and advanced manufacturing,” said Don Moul, TVA president and CEO. “We are strategically partnering with innovative companies like Type One Energy to advance the development of nuclear technologies, and I am excited about the possibility of the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion power plant being built in the Tennessee Valley.”

“TVA is a best-in-class energy utility that knows how to build, operate, and maintain complex power generation technologies,” said Christofer Mowry, Type One Energy’s CEO. “This LOI with TVA, and the role it establishes for Type One Energy as the fusion technology provider for their Infinity Two project, is therefore fully aligned with our goal of pursuing the lowest-risk approach to commercializing fusion energy.”

“Tennessee is ready-made to lead America’s energy independence, and today’s announcement further strengthens our position as a leader in safe, clean, and reliable energy,” said Tennessee Gov. Bill Lee. “We are proud that the first U.S. commercial stellarator fusion project could be developed in Oak Ridge, creating high-quality jobs and driving continued economic growth and opportunity for Tennesseans.”",https://www.ans.org/file/21695/l/Picture1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 18:02:19.046618

The law establishing the new department, Act 458 of the 2025 Regular Session, not only renamed the department but overhauled its structure, powers and permitting processes.
Former Deputy Secretary Dustin Davidson, who worked closely on the reorganization, took over as secretary earlier this month following the resignation of Tyler Gray.
Davidson said the agency’s new structure is designed to modernize operations and bring it in line with today’s industry and environmental needs.
“In many ways, this agency has still been doing things the way it did when first created as DNR nearly 50 years ago.","Louisiana will complete a sweeping reorganization of its natural resources agency next week, formally transitioning the Department of Energy and Natural Resources into the newly named Department of Conservation and Energy.

The change, effective Oct. 1, comes after nearly two years of legislative work, public stakeholder input, and internal planning triggered by an executive order from Gov. Jeff Landry and a 227 page law passed in June.

The law establishing the new department, Act 458 of the 2025 Regular Session, not only renamed the department but overhauled its structure, powers and permitting processes.

Former Deputy Secretary Dustin Davidson, who worked closely on the reorganization, took over as secretary earlier this month following the resignation of Tyler Gray. Davidson said the agency’s new structure is designed to modernize operations and bring it in line with today’s industry and environmental needs.

“Throughout this effort, we have worked to craft an approach that is guided by the core principles of transparency, balance between economic growth and environmental stewardship, and technology-driven solutions,” Davidson said. “In many ways, this agency has still been doing things the way it did when first created as DNR nearly 50 years ago. Technology, industry, and environmental best practices have changed a great deal over those decades, and it’s time this agency caught up.”

The reorganization replaces the department’s four-office structure with six divisions that separate strategic management, administrative services, permitting, enforcement, resource leasing, and energy planning into distinct functions.

Davidson said the new framework is meant to break down information silos and eliminate duplicative processes by creating a single permitting system for coastal and noncoastal areas and establishing a centralized enforcement arm to handle inspections and compliance.

Act 458 also expands the secretary’s authority to issue rules, require financial security for plugging orphan wells, and create expedited permitting programs with defined review timelines

Davidson said there will be “an adjustment period for some time to come – for our staff, as we break decades worth of old habits and workflows that were inefficient but familiar; for the regulated community, who we hope to see embracing the changes we are making to create understandable and predictable processes; and to the people we serve, as we make the changes needed to set and maintain modern standards for environmental protection and resource management.”

The law reorganizing the department functioned as a container for several policy changes, including provisions on expedited permitting, groundwater protections, financial security for well plugging, and expanded rulemaking authority over pipelines, enforcement, and waste disposal.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/09/2.-Depositphotos_Louisiana-state-capital.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 18:03:49.654436

“And EPA cannot simply repeal its own standards based on a political whim.
Instead, CARB countered, the document relies on flawed, disproven assertions and data taken out of context.
Instead of standing up for everyday people and businesses, Trump’s EPA is cannibalizing itself to dodge its responsibility to protect health, safety, and the economy.
That is fundamental to the sound development of environmental regulations, CARB said, and is illegal since it turns a blind eye to the EPA’s obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act.","The California Air Resources Board (CARB) on Monday submitted comments opposing the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency’s (EPA) push to overturn the 2009 endangerment finding, noting that the EPA’s proposal ignores more than 15 years of its own research and regulations.

“Let’s just say the quiet part out loud: EPA’s proposal is a stunningly sloppy and amateurish effort to sow doubt where there is no doubt,” said CARB Chair Liane Randolph. “And EPA cannot simply repeal its own standards based on a political whim. The agency owes the American people straight, honest answers as to why it is proposing to carelessly risk their health, lives and property.”

In a separate comment, California Governor Gavin Newsom called the proposal ""not just putting politics over evidence, it is bad policy, a dereliction of duty, a moral abdication, and a betrayal of the very mission entrusted to (the EPA).""

The EPA has for almost 20 years required medium- and heavy-duty diesel vehicles to use Diesel Exhaust Fluid (DEF) and aftertreatment systems to reduce nitrogen oxide (NOx) emissions. In July, the Trump administration targeted the endangerment finding for repeal, which has allowed presidential administrations to regulate six greenhouse gases (carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, hydrofluorocarbons, perfluorocarbons, and sulfur hexafluoride) since 2009.

""Small-business truckers make up 96% of trucking and could be regulated out of existence if this nonsensical rule were to be implemented,"" said Owner-Operator Independent Drivers Association (OOIDA) President Todd Spencer, whose organization also filed comments in support of the repeal. ""Mom-and-pop trucking businesses would be suffocated by the sheer cost and operational challenges of effectively mandating zero-emission trucks. Vehicle reliability and affordability are top priorities for OOIDA members, and we have yet to see proof that electric commercial motor vehicles are a practical option for most trucking businesses considering the price tag and lack of charging infrastructure.""

CARB’s comments note that the U.S. Department of Energy report on which the EPA is relying was assembled by ""a small group of self-described climate skeptics and is almost totally devoid of scientific evidence to support or explain how they reached their conclusions.""

Instead, CARB countered, the document relies on flawed, disproven assertions and data taken out of context. In addition, CARB said, the EPA acknowledges that it is relying on the DOE report because it does not trust its own analysis, ""shamelessly ceding its responsibility to another agency whose current mandate is to prop up fossil fuels at any cost, including public health,"" according to CARB.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin claims rescinding the endangerment finding and resulting regulations would end $1 trillion or more ""in hidden taxes on American businesses and families.”

The proposal, if finalized, would remove all Biden- and Obama-era greenhouse gas standards for light-, medium- and heavy-duty vehicles and heavy-duty engines, starting with EPA’s first greenhouse gas regulations set in 2010 for light-duty vehicles and those set in 2011 for medium-duty vehicles and heavy-duty vehicles and engines, which includes off-cycle credits like the start-stop feature on most new cars.

""The Trump Administration wants you to believe that this is a battle about gas-powered cars versus electric ones. That’s a lie,"" said California's Secretary for Environmental Protection Yana Garcia. ""California is fighting for lives. Decades upon decades of science show that climate-warming gases produced by cars, trucks, power plants, and gas facilities are killing people. The proof is clear—more smog, more asthma, and more emergency room visits. Instead of standing up for everyday people and businesses, Trump’s EPA is cannibalizing itself to dodge its responsibility to protect health, safety, and the economy. There’s nothing patriotic about abandoning Americans.""

CARB charges the EPA with ignoring ""the tragic and painful experiences of thousands of Americans who’ve been severely harmed by more intense wildfires, hurricanes, and other natural disasters made worse by climate change. The proposal also discounts the billions of dollars in economic loss sustained each year by the country and the people who live here.""

In 2023 alone, according to Newsom, the United States endured 28 separate climate-driven weather disasters exceeding $1 billion in damage each — the highest number ever recorded — claiming more than 400 American lives and causing $92 billion in damages.

CARB further points out that the EPA leaves no obvious paper trail leading to the environmental impacts of its proposal and therefore provides no opportunity for informed public comment on those impacts. That is fundamental to the sound development of environmental regulations, CARB said, and is illegal since it turns a blind eye to the EPA’s obligations under the National Environmental Policy Act.",https://img.ccjdigital.com/mindful/rr/workspaces/default/uploads/2025/09/adobestock-3340656.jdFRbFuOhH.jpg?auto=format%2Ccompress&fit=max&q=70&w=1200,N,,2025-09-23 16:01:49.524445

Implementation of the NEVI program, which the Biden administration hoped would lead to 500,000 publicly available EV chargers by 2030, has been slow nationwide.","(The Center Square) – Colorado is once again set to receive $57 million in federal monies as part of the National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure Grant program.

This comes after the U.S. Department of Transportation announced plans last month to reinstate the funding, which was paused in February pending review.

U.S. Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said the review was necessary to streamline the program and allow states to actually move forward with building chargers. States did have to re-submit their plans.

“The Biden-Buttigieg Administration failed to deliver EV chargers despite their promises. Our revised NEVI guidance slashes red tape and makes it easier for states to efficiently build out this infrastructure,” Duffy said. “While I don’t agree with subsidizing green energy, we will respect Congress' will and make sure this program uses federal resources efficiently.”

The NEVI program is a national initiative funded by the federal 2021 Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and dedicates $5 billion to build a nationwide network of public EV charging stations.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis has led the charge for the NEVI program. The state joined 19 others in suing the Trump administration when it announced its pause of the program earlier this year.

Polis, a Democrat, expressed great concern with the pause.

“Electric vehicles are saving people money and protecting our air,” he said of the suspension. “The Trump administration is trying to put Colorado EV drivers in a pothole.”

Colorado even went so far as to announce plans in August to invest $5 million of its own money into electric chargers to continue with its clean energy goals, despite concerns about federal funding.

Federal changes to NEVI

The U.S. Department of Transportation said in its announcement of the program's reinstatement that the changes to NEVI were necessary.

“The updates streamline applications, provide states with more flexibility, and slash red tape left by the Biden-Buttigieg Administration,” it said. “This will ensure charging stations are actually built, and federal funding is spent effectively and efficiently.”

When the program was paused in February, 84% of NEVI Formula program funds remained unobligated. The department said that was a “clear signal of the program’s failure.”

Under the new guidelines for the program:

• Applications will be streamlined.

• The approval process will be simplified.

• States will have more flexibility with where chargers are placed and how the money is used.

Overall, the department said this will “accelerate project delivery.”

NEVI in Colorado

The NEVI program is expected to fund 168 new fast charging ports at 29 locations across Colorado in multiple rounds, with the state itself investing $48 million through the first three rounds.

Though the program was first funded in 2021, it took years for Colorado to open any stations.

Just this year, Colorado opened its first few NEVI-funded electric vehicle charging stations. Ten are currently open throughout the state, while another 50 have been conditionally awarded, according to the NEVI Awards Dashboard.

The NEVI program is part of a broader plan by Colorado to move toward electric vehicles.

Longterm, the state hopes that light-duty electric vehicles will make up “nearly 100%” of the market share by 2050.

“The state envisions the large-scale transition of Colorado’s transportation system to zero emission vehicles,” said Colorado’s 2023 Electric Vehicle Plan.

In 2017, a brand-new Nissan Leaf carried a price tag of about $35,000; today, that same car is yours for less than $6,500. This story repeats across the market. A Hyundai Kona that rolled off the showroom floor in 2021 for more than $43,000 has fallen below $16,000. Even newer models aren’t spared from this kind of depreciation. Take the 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5: it debuted with a sticker close to $62,000, but after 8,000 miles and less than 12 months on the road, at least one is selling for around $37,000. The drops are even starker in the luxury segment. An Audi e-Tron GT supercar that cost about $124,000 just three years ago is now offered at $52,000. All of this is before government incentives that could bring costs even lower.

In August, plummeting prices sparked a 59 percent year-over-year surge in used EV sales, according to the research firm Cox Automotive. But the trend also begs the question whether even well-priced used EVs are a bad investment in an asset that will continue to depreciate at an alarming rate. Experts say that depends on the car, and on how the buyer would use it.

“I would buy one now,” said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive. In August, used electric cars typically cost about $900 more than similar gas-powered ones, she added, which is the lowest gap on record. It’s a premium that is likely easily made up in gas savings and far lower maintenance costs because electric won’t need, say, oil changes. “There’s a really strong value proposition to buying a used EV,” Valdez Streaty said.

But even a deep discount may not be enough for some people to shake off their earlier experiences, or perceptions, about electric cars, said John Helveston, an engineer and professor at George Washington University who studies technology adoption. As he put it, “if you bought a used Leaf even a few years ago, your experience was likely not great.”

That’s because, until recently, batteries often deteriorated rapidly, which led to untenable driving ranges and often regrettable purchases. But Helveston said the landscape has changed dramatically, with a trend toward more efficient technologies and bigger packs that don’t degrade as fast. Still, most warranties only kick in once the capacity has fallen below 70 percent. So, Helveston said, the car’s original range remains critical and is one of the best indications of how quickly it might depreciate.

“If you’re sub-200 miles as your new starting range, they don’t hold their value very well,” he said. Conversely, that’s why Teslas — with ranges in the 300 or 400 mile realm — have historically depreciated considerably more slowly.

The other piece of good news is that, although research, by Helveston and others, has shown that EVs depreciate much more quickly than gas-powered vehicles in the first two to three years; after that, the rates of decline converge and all cars lose value at a similar pace.

Incentives are another factor to consider. Right now an income-qualified buyer can get up to $4,000 federal tax credit on a used EV costing under $25,000, or as much as $7,500 for a new one. Many states, municipalities and utilities offer rebates as well. But the federal credits go away at the end of month, which could cause electric car prices to inch upwards. On the other hand, a loophole in those incentives led to a glut of leased electric vehicles, more than a million of which are set to hit the used market within the next few years -— which could exert downward pressure on prices. It’s unclear how all those elements will interact.

“There’s no crystal ball on this,” said Kevin Roberts, director of economic and market intelligence at website CarGurus, via e-mail. “But given recent trends, we don’t expect to see the price volatility in used EVs that we’ve seen in the past.”

The bad news is that shopping for used EVs can be a bit of black box.

“With a gas car, between age and mileage you know a lot about that car. In the EV, people have no clue,” said Helveston. Battery health, he explained, is more linked to how the car was used than its age or mileage. If, for example, an owner only used super-fast Level 3 chargers, the battery would take much more of a beating than someone who primarily charged in their garage. Plus, even with recent improvements in battery tech, it’s still hard to predict exactly how a battery will perform five or 10 years out.

“There is this huge gap of information and because of that there’s a hesitance to buy it,” said Helveston. There are, however, some things people can do to mitigate those concerns. The first is to ask the dealer, or seller, to charge a car to 100 percent capacity before the test drive. Then compare the range on the dashboard to the manufacturer’s stated figure when the car was new. That should provide a rough approximation of remaining battery capacity. After a few years, the pack should retain 90 to 95 percent of its rating.

Valdez Streaty, at Cox, said that it’s not uncommon for dealers to either not have, or not know, how to access battery health information, though that process may become more standardized in coming years. In the meantime, she says, the used car auction that Cox operates — Manheim — rates batteries on a scale of 1 to 100. It’s the largest auction network in North America and is used by many dealers, which may be able to pass along any information they receive about the battery.

“Definitely you want something that’s going to be above 80 percent,” she said.

The other option is to ignore range or depreciation and buy the cheapest car possible and drive it into the ground. This works well for people who only need a car for around town — most people don’t drive more than 40 miles a day — and don’t care about features. This is what Helveston did when he bought a ten-year-old Leaf off Facebook Marketplace for $5,000. It had a remaining range of just 60 miles, but he drives no more than 30 per day.

“The miles are double what I need,” he said, and he doesn’t pay for gas or oil changes either. “If it dies on me, I only invested five grand in it and I’ll buy another one.”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/Jip5RJmoY_ZqaokbNY0CPA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/grist_112/c2283f6856827dd4e63d9de99b91e592,N,,2025-09-23 16:02:45.426604

The IURC decides whether a utility can recover the costs of things like power plants — something several utilities are looking to build as data centers drive up energy demand.

Braun said the state needs to keep rates in check while also growing Indiana’s economy.

“We’re seeking entrepreneurial individuals who are going to think out of the box and have a special attention to rates Hoosiers bear in general,"" he said.

Google recently withdrew its proposal for a one in Marion County after facing public backlash. Braun said data centers may not be for every community, but tech companies can also do a better job of highlighting the benefits.

“Met with a rural county just last week that would love to have a data center, because they don't have enough population to support a ton of employees, but they sure could use the [capital expenditures], the assessed value,"" he said.

In other words, they could use the tax revenue for things like schools and roads.

To fill those IURC seats, Braun appointed Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzanne Jaworowski, former Republican state representative Dollyne Sherman and Floyd County business executive Cory Cochran to the IURC nominating committee.

They’ll review applications with four committee members appointed by the legislature and forward their suggestions to Braun.

The consumer and environmental advocacy group Citizens Action Coalition has criticized Braun, calling his statements ""hollow.""

The group said Braun has pushed for expensive nuclear, natural gas and coal instead of more affordable solutions like energy efficiency and community solar.

Consumer advocates have said that the legislature has often tied the hands of the IURC by allowing utilities to approve more kinds of costs and more quickly. The state also created tax incentives for data centers in 2019.

The notification was required under a federal law intended to give workers advance notice to plan job transitions. WRAL received the letter this week through a public records request.

Sanders told state officials that the company planned to cut 348 positions — including laborers, electricians, foremen and equipment operators — at its Fayetteville office.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -U.S. Senator Edward Markey sent a letter to President Donald Trump on Tuesday saying he is concerned U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright is working in the interest of nuclear power company Oklo, of which he used to be a board member.

Markey, a Democrat, noted that the administration is moving ahead with plans to allow Oklo to build a nuclear waste reprocessing plant and transfer government-held plutonium from nuclear weapons to use as fuel in planned reactor projects.

“Oklo stands to benefit financially and Secretary Wright is acting in his former company’s interest,” Markey said.

The White House referred a request for comment to the energy department, which did not respond immediately. Oklo said it had no comment.

Oklo said this month it plans to build and operate a plant in Tennessee to reprocess nuclear waste as the first phase of a nuclear fuel center costing up to $1.68 billion.

Reuters reported in August the government plans to make available 20 metric tons of plutonium to nuclear companies. Oklo has not said it wants to use the plutonium and the department has not announced plans on the material.

But an energy department source said Oklo has been in touch with the agency about using the radioactive metal and that top energy officials were having conversations with the company about it.

Markey asked Trump questions about Wright’s connection to decision making and the Republican secretary’s financial interest in Oklo.

Trump in May ordered the government to halt much of its existing program to dispose of plutonium, and instead provide it as a fuel for reactors.

The idea of using surplus plutonium as fuel and extracting it from nuclear waste has concerned nuclear safety experts who say it could increase risks of proliferation and make it hard for the U.S. to tell other countries not to pursue similar technologies.

How Can We Build the Battery Supply Chain in Alabama?
This could provide a more predictable and timely development process for new battery industry facilities across the country.","As the global market for batteries continues to accelerate, American companies and communities are building out the supply chain to grow this industry across the nation. In the emerging “Battery Belt,” which includes much of the Southeast United States, the industry benefits from a unique advantage to cluster raw materials production, midstream manufacturing, and the final assembly of large grid-scale and electric vehicle batteries.

The opportunity to develop across the full value chain shines in Alabama, which has a history of mineral production, a natural graphite deposit, and is already a major player in the automotive industry.

This September, C2ES cohosted a roundtable event with the Alabama Mobility and Power (AMP) Center in Tuscaloosa, Alabama, as our first of three state specific conversations across the southeast United States. Participants included innovative startups and large multi-national companies, academia and research institutions, economic development professionals, and local and national non-profits. Together, these stakeholders led a conversation on how Alabama can leverage its competitive advantages to boost economic opportunity across the state.

Participants engaged in group discussions around common challenges in the industry and a strategic policy workshop to develop big picture goals and actionable next steps to accelerate the emerging sector’s growth here in America. Participants also had the chance to tour the AMP Center’s new advanced Power Research Lab, the Alabama Materials Institute, and the site of the upcoming Battery Research Lab. These labs, in partnership with the private sector, are supercharging battery research and innovation needed to meet growing demand for these technologies.

Why talk battery supply chain in Alabama?

Alabama offers a solid foundation for new battery supply chain development.

The state has a mature industrial base in several key sectors that would be compatible with new battery industry entrants, including defense and aerospace technologies and automotive manufacturing.

State agencies have been hard at work developing innovative strategies to attract and support new businesses in Alabama. The Economic Development Partnership of Alabama launched the Site Evaluation Economic Development Strategy (SEEDS), which offers a matching grant program for new facilities’ site assessment and development. Often a major barrier for new business, this program can help accelerate site development timelines by reducing financial hurdles.

To support companies as they grow their presence in Alabama, the s Alabama Department of Commerce’s workforce development, the Alabama Industrial Development Training (AIDT), offers customized training for companies at no cost. This includes construction of a new $30 million training hub for EV manufacturing and related battery industries. In an emerging industry, ensuring workers have the skills they need to succeed will help new facilities get up and running quickly and efficiently, while helping to build a long-term talent pipeline.

Driving these efforts are ambassadors from the state’s economic development, utilities, workforce training, and research institutions. This battery team, which includes the Alabama Mobility and Power (AMP) Center, aims to identify, recruit, and convene innovative companies, investors, and industry leaders in the state as Alabama looks to push the battery sector forward.

How Can We Build the Battery Supply Chain in Alabama?

During the roundtable conversation in Alabama, a key question emerged: How do companies address the cost of manufacturing at scale to meet the needs of a consumer market? With so many first of a kind factories looking to build in the United States, achieving economies of scale is critical to this nascent American industry.

Several supportive foundations emerged from the conversation to help reach this scale in Alabama, across the region, and country. Participants agreed that supportive and stable federal policy frameworks provide the certainty needed to unlock private markets to invest in new battery businesses. At the state level, workforce development and site preparedness, an area where Alabama leads nationally, is paramount to new business development.

Yet even with these supportive frameworks in place, one large barrier remains for companies looking to build their facilities in Alabama and across the region — access to private capital. Companies building these new first of a kind facilities in a highly technical field are hard pressed to find investors with the knowledge and patience to back capital-intensive business with long return timelines.

What’s Next?

To address these challenges and build out Alabama’s work on creating a supportive business environment for new battery supply chain companies, participants in the roundtable engaged in a policy and strategy workshop. Through this effort we collectively developed recommendations and experiments to move the industry forward, which will be shared in upcoming conversation takeaways and ultimately formal policy recommendations from C2ES.

Other near-term opportunities include upcoming federal legislation for permitting reform. This could provide a more predictable and timely development process for new battery industry facilities across the country.",https://www.c2es.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/iStock-1442852776-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:05:48.810791

Closing the EV confidence gap through remanufacturing As the EV market continues to evolve, battery remanufacturing represents a sustainable, cost-effective approach to extending battery life and building consumer confidence.","Trust is the foundation of the most fulfilling relationships. And when it comes to EVs compared to internal-combustion-engine (ICE) vehicles, range anxiety, a lack of national charging infrastructure, and costs, among other general misconceptions, are not helping consumers confidently choose electric.

However, a recent white paper, “Closing the EV Confidence Gap: The Role of Battery Remanufacturing,” from UK-based Autocraft EV Solutions, a part of the Autocraft Solutions Group, offers new perspectives on the subject. “This report aims to start an evidence-based conversation on why now is the time to embrace EV battery repair,” author Sara Ridley, engineering and quality director of Autocraft Solutions Group, told Battery Technology. “To prevent waste, we must maximize the use of every healthy cell. Our data underscores why this is essential—and why the success of electric vehicles depends on it.”

The economics of EV battery remanufacturing: 50% cost reduction

While still a fraction of overall vehicle manufacturing, the growth trajectory for EVs remains robust, even amid US rollbacks of tax advantages and environmental regulations. S&P Global Mobility has revised projections for US BEV sales by 2030 downward from more than 6.5 million vehicles annually to 5 million—still growing but facing significant headwinds. This would mean BEVs would account for about 30% of the US market.

Resolving uncertainty about battery performance would go a long way toward growing that number. The challenge lies in the complexity of safely identifying and fixing EV battery failure causes in modern vehicles, leading many industry experts to dismiss battery repair technology as a viable option. Awareness of potential EV battery remanufacturing options remains critically low.

“All too often, manufacturers are handling in-warranty failures by simply recycling the pack and replacing it with a new one,” Ridley writes. “Meanwhile, for out-of-warranty vehicles, the mere possibility of battery failure undermines consumer confidence, particularly given the high cost of replacement.”

Key battery repair statistics

The comprehensive dataset in Autocraft's report is based on a specific sample of 559 commercial EV battery repairs conducted in 2024. The packs contained an average of 13.5 modules each. “This work was delivered alongside extensive development work on other pack types, where we tested thousands of additional packs to consolidate our understanding of why EV batteries fail and how to fix them,” the report says.

One result the data reveals is that restoring in-warranty battery packs to optimal condition requires replacing just 1.1 modules on average: In other words, whole batteries don’t fail, individual cells do.

This reveals that there’s no benefit to scrapping largely healthy batteries and relegating them to recycling: “On average, 92% of modules within battery packs that have failed within the warranty period remain functional,” the report details. “These modules can be used in repairing other packs at a fraction of the environmental and financial cost of full replacement.

By addressing the specific root cause of failure, batteries can be repaired in the most targeted, cost-effective, and carbon-efficient way possible. In contrast, replacing an entire battery pack for what is essentially a localized issue is excessive and expensive, discouraging EV ownership.

One OEM’s experience: Battery remanufacturing in action

The white paper includes a revealing case study of a major vehicle manufacturer facing rising warranty costs for EV batteries. Even with relatively low failure rates, recycling all failed units to replace them with new ones was becoming financially unsustainable. The manufacturer initially believed there was no reliable method to detect battery failure causes and cost-effectively return units to service.

Following an initial pilot study with Autocraft's OptEVizer dynamic testing protocol—an advanced battery diagnostics system—test results on three failed battery packs were analyzed and cross-referenced with Autocraft's digital twin containing data from thousands of previous repairs. This technology enabled quick and precise identification of the root cause of pack failure at a cellular level and facilitated the identification of suitable replacement modules from batteries already designated for recycling.

The results exceeded expectations:

For the OEM, these results exceeded expectations, giving them the confidence to shift their warranty strategy, prioritizing EV battery remanufacturing over the costly replace-and-recycle approach. The environmental impact of a single repair was substantial, saving 10,500kg of CO2 per battery on their main running vehicle model.

Scaling sustainable battery solutions

Autocraft is now collaborating closely with the manufacturer to implement battery remanufacturing at scale from its dedicated EV battery repair center in the Netherlands. The facility handles batteries ranging from 30 kWh to 90kWh capacity. While specific repair cost data remains commercially sensitive, this approach achieves cost reductions exceeding 50% compared to traditional replacement and recycling methods.

When factoring in monthly carbon emissions reductions for just one customer—exceeding 500,000kg per month—the scale of this opportunity for the broader automotive industry becomes evident. Battery life extension through remanufacturing represents a critical pathway to sustainable transportation.

Closing the EV confidence gap through remanufacturing

As the EV market continues to evolve, battery remanufacturing represents a sustainable, cost-effective approach to extending battery life and building consumer confidence. By focusing on data-driven repair solutions rather than wholesale replacement, manufacturers can effectively address the EV confidence gap while significantly reducing environmental impact.

The evidence from Autocraft's study demonstrates that targeted battery repair technology not only makes economic sense but also substantially contributes to sustainability goals. For consumers concerned about battery longevity and replacement costs, the emergence of sophisticated battery diagnostics and repair options offers reassurance that EV ownership can be both practical and affordable over the vehicle's lifetime.

Industry adoption of remanufacturing practices will be essential to building a truly sustainable EV ecosystem that maximizes the value of every battery component while minimizing waste and environmental impact.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt855efe32b6734593/68d2e8dd1dbf262a8f4fb727/REVIVE_Mobile_lifting_module_from_pack_(3).jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-23 16:01:22.865675

Gov. Mike Braun is seeking “entrepreneurial” candidates to fill three vacancies on the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission and take on rising customer bills.

“If you’re interested in protecting ratepayers, ensuring Indiana has a stable energy supply … and if you can bring objectivity and fairness to the table, we want to hear from you,” Braun said.

“We will ensure that energy progress doesn’t come at the expense of Hoosier ratepayers’ ability to afford their energy bills,” he added, speaking during a Tuesday news conference.

Commissioners Sarah Freeman and Wesley Bennett are leaving in October — months before their terms were set to end — and Chair Jim Huston’s term lapsed in April, but he will remain until a replacement is chosen.

Braun finalized a nominating committee, which will conduct interviews after the application period ends Oct. 14.

He named three appointees: Secretary of Energy and Natural Resources Suzie Jaworowski; former state Rep. Dollyne Sherman; and Cory Cochran, an executive at commercial construction firm McRae Enterprises.

They join four appointees by the Indiana General Assembly:

Indiana Senate Republicans: Jim Merritt, president of JWM Consulting Corp. and a former state senator.

Indiana House Democrats: Grant Smith, a senior energy policy adviser at the Civil Society Institute.

Indiana House Republicans: Bill Champion, of corrugated pipe manufacturer Fratco.

Indiana Senate Democrats: Lindsay Shipps Haake, a government affairs specialist who has lobbied for utility customer advocates.

Asked if the nominating committee already has candidates in mind, Jaworowski said, “No, a lot of people have expressed interest, but we don’t know who will apply yet.”

The group will make recommendations, but final decisions are up to Braun.

Indiana is in the minority of states that gives the executive branch complete control over utility regulator selection.

In 13 states, they’re elected — mostly by voters, but also by lawmakers or political parties, according to research by Citizens Action Coalition, a utility customer advocacy group.

In 33 states, regulators are appointed but must be confirmed by the legislative branch. Appointed regulators in Indiana, Massachusetts, Nevada and New Hampshire aren’t.

Braun names next top utility customer advocate, tees up regulator overhaul

The IURC is charged with ensuring that utilities provide safe, reliable service at just and reasonable rates. It is “an advocate of neither the public nor the utilities,” according to its website.

But Braun suggested it has leaned too far in one direction.

“Ratepayers, I think, have taken the brunt of it,” he told reporters — and called the affordability uproar “very analogous to what we went through on property taxes.”

Braun asserted that, just as taxpayers didn’t have high-powered lobbyists representing them in the property tax debate, “probably ratepayers don’t” when it comes to utilities.

“That’s where someone’s got to be a voice for it,” he said. “And I will be that voice.”

Braun also named a new leader for the Office of Utility Consumer Counselor this month. Counselor Abby Gray’s first public action was to recommend denial of one utility company’s proposed hike — and endorse reductions in its current rates.

“Utility companies … had legitimate cost increases,” Braun said. “But whenever you go beyond covering your costs and it looks like you’re trying to do more, then you’re taking advantage of a system that needs to be a little more attentive.”

The application announcement came as Citizens Action Coalition launched a utility affordability campaign targeted at Braun — dubbed “Stop Mike’s Hikes.” It includes digital, outdoor and radio advertising, according to a Tuesday news release.

“Hoosiers are hurting, and Governor Braun has the chance to lead. He’s inherited an energy landscape that’s been carefully designed to benefit utilities and big industry,” Coalition Executive Director Kerwin Olson said. “The rate hikes Hoosiers have endured in recent years are just the tip of the iceberg. We need decisive action to reverse the policies that got us here in the first place and embrace energy solutions that will lower bills and ensure long-term reliability without sending costs through the roof.”",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47651/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/p9233803-1024x7681758658658.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=CXx0uS4O,N,,2025-09-23 17:06:49.056079

Known as the Clean Vehicle Credit , the benefit provides a tax discount of up to $7,500 for a new electric car and up to $4,000 for a used one. It expires on Sept. 30.

The tax credit was approved as part of the Inflation Reduction Act in 2022 and initially set to last through 2032. That timeline was cut short, however, by Congress’ recent tax and spending-cut law, known as the “one big, beautiful bill,” which is also winding down several other tax incentives for clean-energy home upgrades .

The electric vehicle credits are income-based. For a new car, the benefit applies to people whose adjusted gross income is no more than $150,000 or $225,000 for heads-of-household. For joint tax filers, they must make no more than $300,000 to use the credit.

For used vehicles, the income thresholds are $75,000 for individuals, $122,500 for heads-of-household, and $150,000 for joint filers.

The vehicles must also meet certain requirements. For new cars, that includes having a battery capacity of at least seven kilowatt hours and having undergone final assembly in North America. For used vehicles, the car’s sale price cannot exceed $25,000, not including taxes or title and registration fees, along with other requirements.

VRC is expected to create 21 direct new jobs for engineers and technicians over the coming years with an average salary of $80,000, which is 156% of the average Bossier Parish wage. Louisiana Economic Development estimates the project will result in an additional 25 indirect new jobs, for a total of 46 potential new job opportunities in the Northwest Region.

“This is a great milestone in a long-standing relationship between VRC and Air Force Global Strike Command and will solidify Air Force Global Strike Command leadership in equipping the warfighter with the latest in technology,” VRC Metal Systems CEO and co-founder Rob Hrabe said. “We are excited to support the warfighter and 2nd Bomb Wing mission in Louisiana because of the great nexus of military and commercial opportunities and business-friendly environment. Louisiana Economic Development and local businesses were a great help in pulling this together.”

“VRC Metal Systems highlights the growing role of companies using innovative approaches to expand Louisiana’s defense and aviation sector,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “Under our 9×90 plan, we are emphasizing the importance of supporting companies that offer high-paying engineering and technical jobs that strengthen our workforce, attract specialized talent and create new opportunities for Louisiana residents across the state. Welcoming yet another economic win for North Louisiana – coming on the heels of Meta and Radiance Technologies’ decision to invest in the region – exemplifies LED’s commitment to ensuring every community in the state has access to proud, good-paying jobs.”

The new structure, known as the Additive Manufacturing Rapid Maintenance Facility, will serve as a hub for advanced repair solutions, featuring the company’s proprietary cold spray technology. This innovative, cost-efficient method uses VRC’s patented high-pressure system to propel microscopic solid metal particles at supersonic speeds onto a surface using a stream of gas—eliminating the need for high-temperature melting and creating stronger, faster and more cost-effective repairs.

“We welcome the spotlight this brings to Barksdale Air Force Base and Northwest Louisiana. BAFB is not only a great asset to have, it is one that we must continue to leverage for other opportunities such as VRC Metal Systems,” North Louisiana Economic Partnership President and CEO Justyn Dixon said. “Congrats to BRF for its continued success with small business and its work with BAFB.”",https://businessfacilities.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/screenshot-2025-09-23-at-2.34.24-pm.png,N,,2025-09-23 17:07:39.293065

Our designers, along with their sustainability experts, are exploring applicable design, sustainable practices and feasibility.","Prior to joining UNC Charlotte in 2022, Cheryl Walker, an architect and project manager, already was a trailblazer for sustainable construction and planning in North Carolina. She spearheaded the first LEED project in Mecklenburg County, ImaginOn, which spurred several other sustainable firsts for the city of Charlotte and institutions for higher education.

As a member of the advisory committee for the Triangle J Council of Governments, she was part of a team to develop a construction and demolition waste management specification. This tool, funded by a grant from the Environmental Protection Agency, was adopted nationally to help owners, designers and contractors implement waste management practices on all projects. She worked with the firm that designed the Center City Building, now The Dubois Center at UNC Charlotte Center City. Their efforts enabled the facility to obtain LEED gold certification.

Today, as a planner in facilities planning, design and construction, she coordinates with campus leadership, facilities management, the Office of Sustainability, the design consultants, commissioning agents and contractors to integrate sustainable goals and practices near the start of project planning.

In this Q&A, Walker explains her move from the private sector to the University, how sustainability is integrated into the planning process and the long-term benefits of thoughtful design for the campus community.

What inspired your transition from private architectural practice to working at UNC Charlotte?

Most of my private practice has been designing civic and municipal projects and projects for higher education. I have a long history working with universities in North Carolina. I thought, instead of being the designer that’s hired by a university, what would it be like to be on the other side of the table where the planning happens?

I find this work really rewarding, being tasked with the responsibilities of helping the whole team — the university, the designers, technical consultants — make informed environmental decisions that have lasting impact on the quality and operations of campus buildings.

How do you integrate sustainability into campus planning and construction projects?

It starts in the advanced planning phase where you have the maximum engagement with the constituents: academic units, University leadership and facilities groups, including sustainability, engineering, maintenance and grounds. I coordinate University working groups that meet regularly with the designer to establish the project mission, goals and programmatic needs for each project and develop strategies to attain these. Sustainable goals and enabling strategies are reviewed at every phase of the project. This process is essential in how I make sustainability an integral part of the project.

As meetings continue throughout every phase of a project, it’s important to keep participants engaged. The Office of Sustainability has a lot to offer, so I invite them to the table. Our engineering group has an enormous capability in sustainable strategies that can be applied to a project. Our maintenance and operations folks are invested in ongoing performance and operation of buildings.

Unless sustainable goals are brought up early and consensus achieved, we lose sight of the maximum opportunities.

Twenty-five years ago, few firms in our area were knowledgeable and committed to delivering sustainable solutions for their clients. A cohesive framework for applying sustainable strategies was lacking. Fast forward to today and the landscape is very different. Firms and contractors are well schooled in recognized green strategies. A variety of rating systems exist to hold us accountable to our stated goals. Fortunately, UNC Charlotte has many people that see the value that this brings to the University over time.

What are some projects you’re working on that emphasize sustainable design?

One that’s about to begin construction is the Burson renovation and expansion project. In the advanced planning stage, the University wanted us to look at what was possible to achieve in terms of sustainability.

We decided to look at it through the lens of the LEED system. We had a design team that featured sustainability experts and commissioning agents who focused on achieving better energy efficiency and air quality. One criterion for higher a construction manager is their track record on delivering sustainable projects.The Charlotte facilities team is invested in realizing these goals. The project is registered with LEED, and we’re shooting for gold status.

I’m currently leading the advanced planning for the Smith Comprehensive Renovation. Our designers, along with their sustainability experts, are exploring applicable design, sustainable practices and feasibility.

What long-term benefits do sustainable buildings offer to students and the University?

Constructing a well-designed building that uses less energy and conserves water, improves indoor quality of learning spaces and introduces natural daylighting will have environmental benefits. The University can see improved performance, less costs and easier maintenance.

I’m always interested in the benefits for the users, the students. Students viscerally experience air quality within the classroom from its temperature to its smell. With good indoor air quality and good energy management, the learning conditions can vastly improve. Well-chosen construction materials have a lot to do with the indoor air quality of a room.

Another aspect that impacts students is lighting. Low energy cost lighting, particularly natural lighting, can greatly improve the experience of sitting in class and doing work.

There are lots of studies that try to tie high-level sustainable buildings to productivity and learning outcomes. Researchers also are looking at single elements such as self-sustaining green wall systems. And you can take it a step further, integrating the air flows from a wall system with the HVAC system to study the microbiome.

Some very talented professors, researchers and students are starting to track outcomes, and it will take time to gather data. These kinds of innovations, especially if it’s very visible to the student, can have more impacts and create a conducive learning environment.",https://inside.charlotte.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/1289/2025/09/Cheryl-Walker.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 17:05:53.090074

The agreement will see Ontario work toward supplying tritium, a critical fuel for nuclear fusion, to support the UKAEA’s research and development projects.
The MOU will also support fusion energy development projects in Ontario and Canada, opening new opportunities for local industries and supply chain partners.
“This historic agreement cements Ontario’s long-standing role at the forefront of next generation nuclear energy,” Lecce said.
The UKAEA leads the world’s largest publicly funded research and development program focused on making fusion energy commercially viable.","Ontario has signed a new partnership with the United Kingdom to advance nuclear fusion energy research and innovation.

At the International Tritium Conference in Ottawa on Monday, Minister Stephen Lecce announced that Ontario Power Generation (OPG) and the United Kingdom Atomic Energy Authority (UKAEA) Group have signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU). The agreement will see Ontario work toward supplying tritium, a critical fuel for nuclear fusion, to support the UKAEA’s research and development projects.

The province said the deal leverages Ontario’s nuclear advantage to expand export opportunities, create jobs, and build a more competitive and resilient economy in the face of U.S. tariffs. OPG will provide a secure and reliable tritium supply to fuel UKAEA’s facilities, further establishing Ontario as a leader in the international nuclear energy sector. The MOU will also support fusion energy development projects in Ontario and Canada, opening new opportunities for local industries and supply chain partners.

“This historic agreement cements Ontario’s long-standing role at the forefront of next generation nuclear energy,” Lecce said. “From building the G7’s first Small Modular Reactor to powering breakthroughs in fusion and medical isotopes, Ontario is leading the world’s clean energy future. We’re exporting our expertise, creating jobs at home and showing the world what energy security looks like.”

Ontario’s tritium is sourced from CANDU reactors, extracted from heavy water during routine operations. As tritium decays, it produces helium-3, a rare and valuable isotope used in quantum computing and with potential as a future fuel for fusion reactors.

The UKAEA leads the world’s largest publicly funded research and development program focused on making fusion energy commercially viable. Tritium supplied by Ontario could play a significant role in projects such as the Spherical Tokamak for Energy Production, a prototype fusion power plant expected to prove the viability of fusion technology by the early 2040s.

“Ontario Power Generation is proud to build on our world-class leadership in producing life-saving medical isotopes and our 50-plus year history of operating safe, clean and reliable nuclear power generation,” said Kim Lauritsen, OPG’s Senior Vice President of Enterprise Strategy and Growth. “This agreement demonstrates how OPG is leveraging Ontario’s isotope and nuclear expertise to support and power the promise of nuclear fusion.”

Steve Wheeler, Executive Director of Fusion Technology at the UKAEA, said the agreement strengthens the partnership between the two jurisdictions. “OPG has played a critical part in enabling the fundamental fusion research that has become a foundation for the international fusion community,” Wheeler said. “This MOU strengthens UKAEA’s strategic relationship with the Government of Ontario and OPG to drive progress toward delivering future fusion powerplants.”

The province said the initiative is a key part of Energy for Generations, Ontario’s long-term plan to deliver reliable, affordable and secure energy to support the economy. Officials said the plan is protecting jobs, supporting workers and driving growth for the future.

Nolan Quinn, Ontario’s Minister of Colleges, Universities, Research Excellence and Security, said the agreement positions the province as a global hub for clean energy and nuclear research. “Ontario’s world-class researchers are driving our economy and cementing the province as an epicentre of clean energy and nuclear innovation,” Quinn said. “This monumental agreement will accelerate cutting-edge energy developments, advance the production and commercialization of crucial clean energy and expand Ontario’s role in the global energy market.”

Ontario noted that its nuclear reactors also produce isotopes used worldwide in health care, energy and industrial applications. OPG has previously supplied tritium for the Joint European Torus fusion experiment in the U.K.",https://sydenhamcurrent.ca/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2025/03/cropped-SYDENHAM-CURRENT-LOGO-32x32.png,N,,2025-09-23 18:02:03.560627

“It requires a strong network of pipelines and infrastructure to move natural gas efficiently and ensure reliable power for end users.

West Texas — known for producing 40% of the nation’s crude oil — also has an extraordinary amount of natural gas that could power those data centers. But the region lacks adequate infrastructure to convert the gas, a byproduct of pumping oil, into electricity and transmit it to the growing industry, experts said.

“Meeting this unprecedented demand takes more than production alone,” said Ed Longanecker, president of the Texas Independent Producers and Royalty Owners Association, a trade group. “It requires a strong network of pipelines and infrastructure to move natural gas efficiently and ensure reliable power for end users. In Texas, expanding this network has never been more important to keep pace with growth.”

The lack of infrastructure puts the Permian Basin region at a major disadvantage compared to other oil and gas producing regions, said Jason Jennaro, CEO of FrontierGen, a business analytics company that helps industrial developers secure land.

Oil and gas companies in West Texas will need to compete with those in the Eagle Ford and Haynesville shales, two other major oil basins in southern and eastern Texas, for customers on the hunt for remarkable amounts of natural gas.

Further complicating the matter is the number of companies with high energy needs, including cryptocurrency facilities, Jennaro said, who authored a report in September, evaluating different Texas oil basins and their potential to bring energy to AI. The oil and gas industry itself is also increasingly needing more energy.

“The demand for generation, particularly in high voltage transmission, is going to have to be spread across a number of different industries looking to pursue it,” Jennaro said.

Jennaro said the United States will need to add roughly 400 terawatts — enough energy to power France for a year — in five years to satisfy AI demand. His study relied on estimates from McKinsey and the Energy Information Administration, a government analysis agency.

Texas is also expecting more demand. The Electric Reliability Council of Texas, the state’s main grid operator, may have to nearly double in size by 2030, according to its own forecasts. The demand is mostly coming from data centers and the oil and gas industry.

The dearth of ways to carry gas that surfaces along with crude oil in the Permian Basin is not just lost revenue; it’s a money pit. Earlier this year, oil companies were paying other companies to take the gas. Supplying that gas to data center companies would mean West Texas producers could turn the financial drain into profit.

Among the first steps to realizing that goal, the region needs gas plants to generate electricity. Longanecker said oil companies are spending billions of dollars in West Texas for such projects.

But it won’t be so simple as building facilities. More pipelines are also needed. The pipelines carrying 6.5 billion cubic feet a day of natural gas in the region can only transport so much of it to meet the congested field of customers.

The oil fields of Eagle Ford and Haynesville, on the other hand, are better equipped with transmission lines, less congestion of industries and proximity to liquefied natural gas hubs. The two also have a more robust fiber optic network.

Longanecker said that the federal government should reform pipeline permitting to shorten the approval process, which can take up to seven years.

Jennaro said he’s bullish about a state plan in Texas to build transmission lines capable of transmitting higher voltages of electricity. The Permian Basin Reliability Plan, passed by lawmakers in 2023, is set to be built by 2030.

“In our opinion, we are entering America’s Fourth Industrial Revolution. This revolution will be defined by the creation of large industrial nexus points where substantial amounts of electricity, transmission, natural gas, water, and fiber optics converge,” Jennaro said. “Texas and its energy basins are a great place for this.”

WASHINGTON (Reuters) -A group representing nearly all major automakers asked the Trump administration Tuesday to roll back aggressive vehicle emissions limits that seek to force the industry to build a rising number of electric vehicles.

The Alliance for Automotive Innovation, which represents General Motors, Toyota Motor, Volkswagen, Hyundai and other major automakers, said in a filing with the Environmental Protection Agency that legislation signed by President Donald Trump in June will increase the effective price of EVs and could lead to a near-term decline in EV market share.

They argue rules finalized last year under President Joe Biden are no longer feasible.

“The 2027 and later standards are simply not achievable in light of significant market, charging infrastructure, supply chain, affordability, and other challenges as well as recent policy changes enacted,” the group said.

The 2024 Biden rules aim to cut passenger vehicle fleetwide tailpipe emissions by nearly 50% by 2032 compared with 2027 projected levels. The EPA forecast between 35% and 56% of new vehicles sold between 2030 and 2032 would need to be electric.

On Sept. 30, the $7,500 EV tax credit expires and automakers warn that “a significant portion” of automakers may lose a battery production tax credit for EVs typically worth $3,000 per year next year under the law.

“This harms not only the automotive manufacturers that have spent hundreds of millions of dollars investing in electric vehicle technology, but also the entire supply chain that has supported these initiatives,” the group said.

In July, the EPA proposed rescinding the long-standing finding that greenhouse gas emissions endanger human health, removing the legal foundation for all U.S. greenhouse gas regulations, a move that would end current limits on greenhouse gas pollution from vehicle tailpipes.

Democrats in Congress and environmental groups have called on the EPA to drop its plan and retain the rules.

Automakers argue the EPA should still rewrite the Biden rules, saying they “still need to be revised to feasible levels to provide certainty for the industry.” The group said “such a contingency plan will be critical if motor vehicle GHG standards are retained or reinstated in some way.”

“If we look past the noise, the facts show a world aligning with the Paris agreement,” he said.
The impacts of the climate crisis were also accelerating, he added, so progress needed to be much faster.
Governments are obliged, under the Paris agreement, to produce fresh national plans – known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs – on curbing greenhouse gases.
Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris agreement.","Harnessing artificial intelligence will help the world to tackle the climate crisis, but governments must step in to regulate the technology, the UN’s climate chief has said.

AI is being used to make energy systems more efficient, and to develop tools to reduce carbon from industrial processes. The UN is also using AI as an aid to climate diplomacy.

But concerns over the vast and increasing energy requirements of large datacentres must prompt governments to act, said Simon Stiell, executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change.

“AI is not a ready-made solution, and it carries risks. But it can also be a gamechanger. So we now need to blunt its dangerous edges, sharpen its catalytic ones, and put it astutely to work,” he said. “If you run a major AI platform, power it with renewables, and innovate to drive energy efficiency.”

He added: “Done properly, AI releases human capacity, not replaces it. Most important is its power to drive real-world outcomes: managing microgrids, mapping climate risk, guiding resilient planning.”

Stiell gave an upbeat assessment of the state of global climate action, saying the world was “aligning with the Paris agreement”, with renewable energy booming, and governments set to produce fresh commitments on cutting carbon.

Speaking on Monday on the sidelines of the UN general assembly in New York, where world leaders have gathered amid stark geopolitical tensions, conflict and economic strains, he made a robust defence of climate diplomacy, in the face of outright hostility from Donald Trump’s White House.

“If we look past the noise, the facts show a world aligning with the Paris agreement,” he said. “Investment in renewables has increased tenfold in 10 years. The clean energy transition is booming across almost all major economies, and hit $2tn last year alone.”

China has led the global clean energy boom, but others – including the EU, India, African nations and Latin America – are also seeing widespread uptake of clean options. Investment has hit obstacles in the US, where Trump has ordered the dismantling of federal efforts to tackle the climate crisis, but many state governments and companies are continuing with their commitments.

Companies are seeing economic opportunities in the shift to a low-carbon world, but more finance is still needed. According to research published on Monday by the Industrial Transition Accelerator, of more than 700 low-carbon industrial installations in planning and development around the world, only 15 a year were gaining the finance necessary to go into full production. This represented a $1.6tn (£1.2tn) opportunity for investors, the group said.

Citing the research, Stiell said: “We’re not waiting for miracles. The economics are on our side. Over 90% of new renewables cost less than the cheapest new fossil option. The technologies and solutions already exist.”

But he said the benefits of the race to a low-carbon economy were not yet being felt “in living rooms”, though companies were seeing the difference. “This boom is uneven. Its vast benefits are not shared by all,” said Stiell.

The impacts of the climate crisis were also accelerating, he added, so progress needed to be much faster. Governments are obliged, under the Paris agreement, to produce fresh national plans – known as nationally determined contributions, or NDCs – on curbing greenhouse gases. They were due in February, but Stiell extended the deadline to this month ahead of the crunch Cop30 climate summit in Brazil in November, where the next decade of climate action will be discussed.

Many major economies – including the EU, China, India, Russia and Saudi Arabia – have yet to formally submit their national plans. Trump has withdrawn the US from the Paris agreement.

Stiell, who in a recent interview with the Guardian called for more emphasis on the positive economic opportunities of the climate crisis, said: “Every Cop has its challenges. And there are always naysayers. But they are only the story if we make them the story.

“Right now we need to reaffirm, sending a stronger, unmistakable signal: the world is still rock-solid behind Paris, and fully onboard for climate cooperation – because it works, and together we will make it work faster.”","https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/de65968274b441ea71a2fca7623809f86ae08587/809_0_6870_5493/master/6870.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&precrop=40:21,offset-x50,offset-y0&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=ed9db385c90001c5e51a0bb099363bb8",N,,2025-09-23 16:01:40.454328

With support from companies like Schneider Electric, Microsoft, Zurich, and Arcadis, the coalition aims to fortify the U.S. power grid before current federal clean energy incentives expire.

The initiative arrives at a pivotal moment. Experts forecast that by 2028, the U.S. power grid could hit a tipping point, where electricity supply may no longer meet peak demand. This strain—driven by rising energy needs, extreme weather, and cybersecurity risks—already contributes to economic losses estimated at $150 billion annually from power outages.

To help offset these risks, the coalition is mobilizing $7.5 billion in identified funding to support infrastructure projects at critical facilities like schools, hospitals, airports, water treatment plants, and municipal campuses. This capital is designed to make resilience upgrades financially viable, even for budget-constrained organizations.

Financing models like Energy-as-a-Service (EaaS) and Energy Savings Performance Contracts (ESPCs) are central to the strategy. These tools allow organizations to bypass large upfront investments by funding upgrades through long-term savings or operational budgets—unlocking access to cleaner, more reliable power without financial strain.

Localized Energy Systems Drive Real-World Results

The coalition’s technical approach centers on distributed energy resources (DERs)—a mix of systems that reduce dependency on the centralized grid. These include solar panels, battery storage, EV charging infrastructure, and geothermal systems, often integrated into microgrids that can function independently during outages or peak load events.

Technology providers like AlphaStruxure, Sunrock, and Schneider Electric are supporting project deployments with scalable microgrid systems. Schneider’s EcoStruxure Microgrid Flex and Energy Control Center are being used to optimize and manage distributed assets, while their national EcoXpert partner network delivers on-the-ground implementation.

In Maryland, Montgomery County has installed AlphaStruxure microgrids at two bus depots, powering electric buses with a 6.5 MW system. In Piscataway, New Jersey, a comprehensive microgrid project supports eight municipal buildings and includes battery storage with five days of backup power, 2.9 MW of solar, and 28 EV chargers—all expected to reduce the township's carbon footprint by over 50% by 2026.

Longview Independent School District in Texas has also adopted solar infrastructure across 10 schools, projecting $450,000 in annual utility savings and a reduction of roughly 9 million pounds of CO₂ emissions.

Beyond sustainability goals, these projects provide real operational benefits: energy cost stability, improved outage resilience, and long-term fiscal savings.",https://alpha.creativecirclecdn.com/environment/original/20250919-102554-139-getty-images-jEB8A9l7ffQ-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 18:03:26.906117

Sean Casten: Suppose that the Senate was confirming an agricultural secretary and somebody said to the proposed nominee, what are you going to do about food insecurity in America? And that person said, “I’m going to plant more corn.” We would all hear that and say, okay, you’re obviously a shill for the corn lobby. But that’s not actually an answer to the question. And yet when you ask someone who’s being considered for energy secretary what they’re going to do about energy insecurity in America, they say “drill, baby drill.” The purpose of energy policy should be to make sure that consumers have access to reliable, affordable energy.

Jason Bordoff: Following the rollback of key climate provisions from the inflation reduction Act, the debate over America’s energy future feels very contentious. The passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act has eliminated or at least cobbled many of the clean energy incentives that were centerpieces of Biden-era climate policy. This week, climate policymakers, business leaders, investors and advocates are converging in New York City for Climate Week. With so much happening and many questions around the pace of the energy transition, it’s a crucial moment in US energy policy.

So how are policymakers facing these challenges and working to accelerate clean energy deployment in a shifting political environment? What does pragmatic energy policy even look like in an era of such deep partisanship? And what should the policy response be to rising electricity demand today in the US?

This is Columbia Energy Exchange, a weekly podcast from the Center on Global Energy Policy at Columbia University. I’m Jason Bordoff.

Today on the show US representative Sean Casten. Congressman Caston represents Illinois’s 6th Congressional District and serves on both the House Financial Services Committee and on the Joint Economic Committee. He’s also vice chair of the Sustainable Energy and Environment Coalition. Before entering Congress, Representative Casten was a clean energy entrepreneur and consultant serving as CEO of Turbo Stream Corporation. And as founding chairman of the Northeast CHP Initiative.

Congressman Caston joined me to discuss the current state of clean energy deployment in the US, including his thoughts on the rollback of IRA provisions. We discussed how to balance energy security with affordability and the case for grid modernization and regulatory reforms in the United States. And we talked about how to address the new energy security challenges that may arise with more rapid deployment of clean energy.

I hope you enjoy our conversation.

Congressman Sean Caston, thanks so much for joining us on Columbia Energy Exchange. Really a privilege to have you with us.

Rep. Sean Casten: So happy to be here. Thanks so much for having me. Jason. I

Jason Bordoff: I think a lot of people listening, they’’ll know of you and know of your background, but maybe not all. And so you’re unique in probably a couple of ways, but one of them is a member of Congress working on energy and climate who really comes from that world, I mean you and your father, and you have a whole family background in energy. Just tell people a little bit about your background, your family’s background and how you came to this work.

Rep. Sean Casten: So when I tell this on the campaign trail, and I just want to prop up all of my own expertise, I tell a completely true story that I was 20 years in the clean energy industry, chemical engineer by training, worked at Arthur D. Little, developing new energy technologies and took over a manufacturing company that built waste, heat recovery power plants, and then built another company to own and operate those. And all that’s true. When we told it around the family table, we started a little earlier that in 1970, well I was born in ‘71 … in 1975 my dad testified before the Senate on the bill that would become PURPA and founded a company that ultimately came Trigen Energy that was the largest district energy company in the United States. They built the third qualifying facility in the country in Trenton, New Jersey. That was a couple of Detroit diesels recovering waste heat, and then providing steam and chilled water to the municipal buildings in Trenton. Little fun fact, the plant manager of that facility was a guy named Don Leibowitz whose son Jon would change his last name to Stewart and go on to have a celebrity career outside of that. And so suffice to say, I kind of grew up thinking PURPA was a word, thinking QF was a word and thinking that ConEdison usually had an expletive in front of it.

Jason Bordoff: Hence for FERCalicious and nerding out on energy policy in a way few members of Congress can. And it sounds like we have a lot in common, not only being almost exactly the same age, but we have a house down the Jersey shore and spend a lot of time in areas not far from there. And in all the extensive preparation I do, I see that if you were going to do anything else, it would be to be part of the E Street band, which I think I have two photos in my office other than family. One is with President Obama and the other is Springsteen.

Rep. Sean Casten: Oh wow. I’ve only got one of those pictures, but I’d like the other one.

Jason Bordoff: And before we finish the hour together, given that you represent Chicago and I’m a born and raised New Yorker, you’ll need to explain to everyone listening why New York pizza is better than Chicago, which I also discovered in all of my research about you.

Rep. Sean Casten: I mean the answer to that one. And you get into politics and you’re supposed to provide things with political answers, but I got a degree in biochemistry and biochemical engineering when something is just factually true, you don’t want to get into the politics of whether you should suggest something to the contrary. And I did grow up in New York for what it’s worth. So it’s my formative pizza years.

Jason Bordoff: This is the sort of honest truth telling we want on this podcast. Okay. So now talk about the challenges of doing this kind of work in Congress at this moment. I mean, it’s hard enough to sit in a place like Columbia where I am and teach PURPA to people. These are really complicated issues. How do you view the engagement level of knowledge across all of these issues on the hill generally maybe these days? And then maybe talk a little bit about what it’s like to try to work in any sort of bipartisan fashion if that’s even possible these days?

Rep. Sean Casten:

I guess the first thing I’d note is that energy policy as much as nerds like you, and I think it’s really important and really critical and is at the core of everything we do. I mean arguably, I mean, energy policy, ag policy and healthcare policy, if we get those three right, we’ll be healthy, wealthy and wise, right? And I’ll throw in education policy, voters by and large don’t care a lot about energy policy. They care about it when there’s a blackout, but it’s something that people just assume is going to be there. And I say that because there’s not a lot of political pressure for people to come up to speed on energy policy before coming to Congress, and that’s not criticizing my colleagues. It’s just what are the things that you’re incentivized to spend your limited time learning about? And one of my biggest frustrations is that there’s no real appreciation of the value chain of the energy system.

And if you think about, suppose that the Senate was confirming an agricultural secretary and somebody said to the proposed nominee, what are you going to do about food insecurity in America? And that person said, I’m going to plant more corn. We would all hear that and say, okay, you’re obviously a shill for the corn lobby, but that’s not actually an answer to the question. And yet when you ask someone who’s being considered for energy secretary what they’re going to do about energy insecurity in America, they say drill, baby drill. And that’s an acceptable answer. And trying to get Congress writ large, and this isn’t partisan, but congress writ large to say the purpose of energy policy should be to make sure that consumers have access to reliable, affordable energy. The purpose of energy policy should not be to make sure that producers are making a lot of money except in so far as they need to be generating enough profit, all the things that has to happen to provide that energy.

And we just don’t get to that point. And I mean, I’ve had this conversation on a bipartisan basis with folks in the Biden administration as well as in the Trump administration. When you simply ask people, “should energy policy serve primarily to benefit consumers or producers?” you get a long pause and that shouldn’t be hard. And yet if you look at how our energy policy has been structured through the years, we’ve spent a lot of effort making sure that we provide tax subsidies for people to drill coal, environmental liability waivers for whatever you might have at an oil well, guaranteed cost recovery for utilities. And we spend almost no time saying, “well, what should we do to make sure that you, Jason, have the opportunity to put something on your house that will reduce your energy loads?” Not only do we not do that, but if you do that, your utility might come and say, well, if you do that, I’m going to have to spread my cost set over more rate payers and raise the rates. So I need to get a right of first refusal on that investment. And so we don’t do things that benefit consumers and that is both depressing but also an enormous opportunity.

Jason Bordoff: Do you think that’s a function of the fact that the history of energy policy back to World Wars and the 1970s was very much about energy security, security and supply availability, price. And in the last few decades there’s been an appropriate significant focus on sustainability and decarbonization, but people took energy security and affordability mostly for granted. We had a lot of abundant energy. It hasn’t been that expensive without some exceptions here and there. That might not be true going forward. And we can talk about where the world is headed and rising power demand, but do you think that’s where that comes from?

Rep. Sean Casten: I think it goes back deeper than that. I was having a conversation with a European parliamentarian. We were at the Glasgow COP. And we were talking about the fact that the UK generates almost twice as much GDP per unit of energy as the United States does, which is a shocking number. And by the way, the Danes generate even more and the Swiss even more than the Danes. And so I asked him what he thought was the primary difference and he laughed and he said, we have the same form of government. It was created by the same people. It was Ben Franklin and John Locke and Rousseau and all these people who were bouncing around. And in our case, the people had already spread it over the land and we had to figure out how to efficiently use finite resources. In your case, you’d killed all the Natives.

And so you built a pressure relief valve of “go extract more resources.” And because we are geographically blessed with all these resources, we have a long history in our country, not just an energy policy. The Homestead Act: go out, take a bunch of land, seize it. We do things in the United States that sound crazy in the rest of the world. If you buy a house, you own the mineral rights underneath the house. Go to Mexico, they don’t do that. The mineral rights are the right of the state. You own the property above that. And so we’ve built, our democracy is based on to some degree incentivizing extraction. And we’ve never totally got beyond that. We have made a lot of progress. The progress we’ve made has primarily been because at the end of the day, people preferred cheap energy. Why did coal collapse in the United States by 50%? Not because we got woke because gas was cheaper and renewables was cheaper than that and people liked the cheaper stuff. We could go faster if we didn’t have all the policy barriers, but those opportunities wouldn’t have existed but for the fact that historically we prioritized resource consumption over efficient resource utilization.

Jason Bordoff: Can you talk just about setting the scene and then we’ll come to some specific issues and the Big Beautiful Bill on other things about just this moment we’re in not just politically, but when it comes to the issue of climate change and energy, and not just in the US but in other countries, parts of Europe as well, a sort of broad sense that maybe it’s still there for some political parties or administrations maybe not even there at all, but it’s taken a backseat. You look at the corporate world, the financial institutions, it’s not sort of prominent in the way it was. The conversation today focuses on pragmatism and realism and there are calls for more of that. I’m just wondering what the words like that mean to you and what you make of this moment we’re in and how we move forward on all of our energy policy goals, security, affordability, and sustainability.

Rep. Sean Casten: My general thought is Winston Churchill that we’ve entered an era of consequences in the time of baffling half-measures has come to a close, but we’ve got an awful lot of baffling half-measures going on right now. We’ve already exceeded one and a half degrees of warming. That’s not actually what the IPCC report says, but the IPCC report says that we’re darn close. And then the fine print says we’ve got a half a degree of cooling that’s baked in because of all the soot in the air. And as that soot comes out, the warming’s going to accelerate. So we’ve already overshot, we have already locked in just in the United States that sea levels on the Gulf Coast are going to be two feet higher in 2050 than they are right now. That is not that far from now. That is within the life of a 30-year mortgage. We’ve baked that all into the system. And of course, whether it’s European wildfires or Australian wildfires or all of that is going on, and I don’t mean to be overly gloom and doom, but you can sit in this moment and say, well, it’s politically easier for me to not prioritize that issue right now. Or you can lead. That’s a choice.

I take the optimism that I have on this from the fact that in spite of certainly a political retrenchment in the United States and some other countries, in spite of a real failure, I think of a lot of our corporate leaders to say, I’m going to get people to follow me, not just I’m going to go where I think is easy in this moment and hedge my bets in spite of all that. Electric vehicles are the fastest growing vehicle class in the country. Renewables continue to surge even during the Trump administration. We now generate more power from non-hydro renewables than we do from nuclear, than we do from coal.

You go to Europe and what Norway is now, 90% of the vehicles that are being sold in a year are electric. These are all being driven for economic reasons in the wake of the war in the Ukraine or in Ukraine, I’m sorry, the Europeans have made massive investments that they don’t have to depend on Russian gas that is in their own self-interest to invest on that efficiency and conservation. And now we’re having a conversation around, is Germany too dependent on Chinese BYD vehicles? Is the United States solar industry too dependent on Chinese solar panels? And that’s a good conversation around do we want to own the technologies of that transition? But you only have that conversation if you’ve acknowledged that the transition is well underway.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah. Well, I mean that raises a number of issues I want to come to. So what lessons do you take? I mean much of what you just said and the urgency of moving faster to reduce emissions, bring them to net zero. We’re already at one and a half or just about there. I suspect if we’d had this conversation a few years ago, you would’ve said something like that. So I’m wondering, when you reflect on the federal climate policy that you played such an important role in helping to pass in the last several years, in the early 2020s, the focus on carrots rather than sticks. We’ll take an IRA subsidy approach rather than a carbon tax or cap and trade approach. But again, coming to this moment where it feels like there’s a retrenchment or something about the urgency of the problem you described as not resonating with people and tell me if that’s wrong and your interactions with all of your constituents. What lessons do people who want to pursue that agenda need to learn as we look forward?

Rep. Sean Casten: So I would argue that subject to the degrees of freedom we had, we did a really, really good job in the IRA, the putting carrots in place creates constituencies who want to maintain those laws. And it’s been difficult for some of my Republican colleagues to justify trying to repeal those laws because so many jobs came to their districts using sticks creates a constituency to get rid of laws. The other big piece of logic in the IRA was this recognition because all those trends that I told you about, about the surge in renewables, the collapsing coal, that all happened before the IRA was passed. We also were well aware that if you have a solar panel on the roof of your house, you stop paying for electricity. You can’t get the solar panel on the roof of your house unless you own a home and you have the discretionary income to make that capital investment.

It’s a good investment, but you have to have the capital to make the investment. And so a lot of what we did in the IRA was to try to say let’s use tax policy to make it possible for larger numbers of American people to access cheap energy. And that was successful and went through, I said at the start subject to the degrees of freedom we had, the biggest limitation we had in the IRA was the structure of the Senate. Because under senate rules, it takes 50 votes to change government spending or government revenues under the Byrd Rule, but it takes 60 votes to change the incentives for the private sector to deploy capital. And so all of the things that we had recommended on the climate committee from the house, I mean I think we had 700 recommendations and 350 of ’em became law mostly in the IRA, some in the infrastructure bill.

Jason Bordoff: This was the report of the committee, the climate committee climate crisis.

Rep. Sean Casten: Yeah, so we’re batting 500, which is pretty good. If you look at those things that didn’t get into the final bill, most of it were issues where the Senate parliamentarian said those are issues of energy policy, not of fiscal policy, and therefore it would take 60 votes. And they didn’t have 60 votes in the Senate. It was a straight party line vote. And so that the Senate, because of the filibuster and the Byrd Rule, the Senate is, as structured right now in this moment, is incapable of doing energy policy. And that’s a choice by the Senate. They could change their rules, but under their rules they can’t do energy policy. And so a lot of the structural pieces that we had, I sort of described the IRA as saying, we put, you had a car that had no gas in the tank and had the emergency brake on. We put gas in the tank and the car started driving, but we still had the emergency brake on because we couldn’t change the energy policy pieces that discouraged private sector actors from doing things that would lower the cost of energy for the American people with their own capital. We could only use federal money to do it. Make me king. I can fix those problems as it is subject to,

Jason Bordoff: Are you talking about things like permitting reform, make it easier to build infrastructure…

Rep. Sean Casten: Things like that. Permit reform, change the incentives of the way that utilities make money. There’s no reason. Why do we continue to tolerate a world where if your utility lowers your cost of energy, the utility doesn’t make as much money.

Jason Bordoff:

And the solutions to that are not even necessarily the federal level at all. It’s not just 50 or 60 votes, right?

Rep. Sean Casten: Many of those are state level. We could certainly change those rules for the federally jurisdictional utilities, the BPAs and the TVA’s, we could change those for transmission. I’ve got bills to do all these things, by the way. Stay tuned on all this. There were provisions in, I want to say I think it was the 2006 Energy Act for FERC to develop performance-based ratemaking that fer has never done and Congress hasn’t pushed ’em to get it done. But why don’t we have rules that say if you reduce the congestion charges on your grid, if you help your state meet their RPS targets, if you lower the cost for your consumers, let’s give you a little higher return on equity. Right? We could do that if we are in George Bush’s words making the pie higher. Let’s make sure everybody gets a slice.

Jason Bordoff: So I want to come to several of the policy proposals you put on the table, and I have a list here of the bills related to climate change you’ve introduced. Reading, it would take up the entire podcast, so I won’t do that. But I want to just before getting to the specifics, sort of ask how you think about moving forward with those things. Because as you said, the idea that.. is it still possible to work across the aisle to get to 16 nevertheless more? I discovered before this something else we have in common. My first exposure to government was as a college intern for Senator John Chaffee of Rhode Island who was a Republican. I’m not sure it would be today. And I think you had said in an interview how around the same time you had a cast a vote for George HW Bush, a sort of inclination to try to engage across the aisle and find common ground. And I just had Carlos Curbelo on this podcast too, who obviously was involved in creating the Bipartisan Climate Caucus. We have a bunch of problems as a country, we need to address climate being one of them. But even leaving that aside, we need a lot more energy. We need power. We need to meet rising power demand, things are changing. Do you see a possibility to move forward in ways that are not purely partisan on some of the issues you just talked about?

Rep. Sean Casten: It is difficult. I’m not going to lie about that. There are small bore issues that you can work on that are more geographically specific. As an example, Randy Feenstra from Iowa and I were working to try to get the SOO Green line installed that would bring cheap wind from Iowa into higher price markets in Chicago, would lower the cost for my consumers and would help businesses in his district. So you find those situational opportunities. I think the challenge we face is only coincidentally a partisan challenge. And I got to give some numbers on what I’d said about the UK before. Take the US GDP, divide it by our total primary energy use. We generate a little over $200 of economic activity for every MMBT of primary energy. The Brits generate $360. The Danes generate over $500. The Swiss generate over $600 that suggests on its face, since they have access to the same technologies comparably – leave the Swiss out, their economy is weird. But certainly the Danes and the Brits have similarly structured economies that suggests that we could either double or triple the size of our economy without using any more energy. Or if you prefer we could cut our energy use and therefore emissions by a factor of two or three or maybe even more since the stuff we displace is the expensive stuff and have the same standard of living. That’s a hell of an opportunity. But if we were to do that, think about the massive wealth transfer that would happen from those parts of America that depend on coal mining, that depend on oil extraction to those parts of America that benefit when the price of energy goes down. And once upon a time you could have a senior Democrat like Tom Dashell representing the Bakken Shale. Now that’s John Thone representing the Bakken Shale. Once upon a time you could have districts like mine in the Chicago suburbs where decent amount of industrial activity really wants the price of energy to be cheap.

You could have that represented by someone like Henry Hyde who used to have my seat. Now it’s represented by me. And so a commitment to a consumer focused energy policy. If we do nothing else, decimates Appalachia, decimates the Gulf Coast because those parts of the country are dependent on industries that can’t compete against clean energy. And one of the things that we tried to do in the IRA was make sure we were prioritizing those transition communities so that we didn’t leave them behind. And so you saw a preferential investment in battery facilities in those communities and solar manufacturing facilities. And when you look at those stats out of the Biden administration that so many of the projects, the majority of the projects were in red parts of the country. That wasn’t because it was a political decision. It was because we wanted to make sure that we didn’t leave people behind who otherwise are left behind.

That challenge doesn’t go away if all of a sudden we have a Democrat representing the Dakotas. Again, there still is this question of equity between extractive America and consumptive America in our own Democratic party. We don’t want to lose any more seats than the Republicans are already causing us to lose in Texas. So what sorts of things should we be doing to make sure that the people who represent those communities don’t feel like they’re at odds with their party’s energy policy? These are solvable problems, but they’re big meaty problems we have to talk through and we have to think about, do we want to live in a world where energy is cheap? Sure. Do we want to live in a world where there are large numbers of men in New Orleans and Texas and Kentucky and West Virginia and Wyoming who are now unemployed and angry at the government? No. Right. And we can do both, but we have to be intentional about it and I think more thoughtful than we’ve been as a nation so far.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah. It’s an important point. And we have a very significant effort underway with resources for the future and the Bezos Earth Fund and some others on this question of economic activity and fossil fuel dependent economies. And it is a hard challenge in the same way that 30 years ago when we talked about expanding trade and globalization and there are winners and losers and as long as policy helps the winners compensate the losers, everyone can end up better off. We didn’t necessarily do a great job with that compensating the losers part. And I think that’s generally true,

Rep. Sean Casten: And I think there’s some optimism there because global trade, I think a strong case can be made that we brought cheap stuff into the United States, but we didn’t think at all about what was going to happen in those communities and we lost a lot of the high margin into the value chain. In this case, if we bring cheaper energy to America, sure, I’d love to be manufacturing the solar panels, but I’d vastly prefer to be the country that has access to cheap electricity because of all the things downstream that are going to happen if you have that. So I think this transition is a much easier one to manage that political pressure. We just have to be intentional about it and have to be honest that there’s nothing there is dignity in being a coal miner. Doesn’t mean we should keep doing it, but let’s honor that dignity and make sure that those people are treated with the dignity that they’ve earned.

Jason Bordoff: And you talked about the adverse impacts on those communities and not even from trying to move to zero carbon sources of energy, but you’ve talked several times already in the discussion about making energy cheap, thinking about affordability for people. And so how would you respond to someone who says energy is really cheap in a world where we’re focused on energy security and affordability and now there’s growing concern about the dominant position China has in a lot of these supply chains, but gasoline’s not that expensive. What is it, three 20 or something? National average natural gas is really cheap here compared to other parts of the world. There’s a sense in which America’s fortunate to have all of this abundant hydrocarbons be the largest producer in the world. And so I often hear people, so to say, wait, why are we switching to all this other stuff? Climate might be one super important reason I think it is. But if you’re just talking about affordability and security, why does being the largest oil and gas producer in the world not give us that?

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, I would submit to you that 90% of the country doesn’t give a damn what it costs to buy a standard cubic foot of natural gas or a rail car full of coal because it’s not particularly useful to them. They want to know how much of my paycheck goes to keeping my home warm, keeping my beer cold, getting me to work every day, which is that downstream end of energy. And all of those fossil fuel sources cannot compete with free if you upgrade the efficiency in your house. I don’t think there’s anybody who would argue that a well insulated home has a higher energy cost than a poorly insulated home. There’s nothing different there than if you have an electric vehicle in your driveway that doesn’t consume gasoline in a solar panel on the roof so that you don’t have to pay for the electricity to generate it.

You have to have the capital, but you also have to have the capital to build a coal plant. And what we’ve seen in the market dynamics over the last two decades is that investors have said, I like the return on a capital investment that produces a lower cost energy source that makes money during more hours of the year than making the investment in a gas plant in a coal plant that’s going to have a lot of hours of the year when it’s getting squeezed out of the market because the wind, the solar, the geothermal, the nuclear is all cheaper. So clean and cheap are the same thing here. And whether or not our energy costs are cheaper than the Europeans has something to do with differential tax policy has something to do with differential resource access. It’s an entirely separate question of have we designed our energy policy to make sure that energy prices are as low as possible for energy consumers? And the answer to that is a resounding hell no.

Jason Bordoff: And how do you respond with someone who hears that and says, wait a minute, if this stuff is so great, it’s so cheap. Why is pulling back these IRA tax credits so problematic? Why does it change the trajectory – as the Rhodium Group just said it will – for how much solar and wind we’re going to deploy? Why does it need all that support?

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, number one, the surest way that you can tell that somebody has never spent any time in the energy industry is that they think energy markets efficiently allocate capital, right? We have massive distortions on what we subsidize. I’ll give you just a quick example because some of the subsidies are less explicit. April, 2020, middle of COVID, well, the start of COVID, everybody stopped driving gasoline prices collapsed in the United States because there wasn’t demand. The price of oil collapsed, and that was a huge challenge for domestic oil and gas producers. Donald Trump responded to that by calling the Saudis and saying, we are going to take military aid out of Saudi Arabia unless you curtail production to raise the price of oil because our oil producers need the price of oil to be higher. The Saudis flinched, the price of oil went up the cover of Bloomberg Business the next day, Fox Business the next day praised Trump, the deal maker for protecting our oil industry.

Fast forward two years later when we’re in the peak of all the inflation rebound, Biden is now in the White House, and a number of us, myself, Congressman Tom Malinowski, Congresswoman Susan Wilde, put together a bill and called on the Biden administration to say, do exactly what Trump just did with the Saudis and pressured them to bring it down and we could not get the Biden administration to do what Trump had proven worked. And a part of their concern, they didn’t say this explicitly, but the subtext was, we’re looking at midterms coming up and we can’t afford to lose the members that we have in those extractive parts of the country.

And so there you have a direct example where our government directly intervened to raise the price of energy to benefit producers and our government directly chose not to intervene to benefit consumers. And that was a Republican who I do not celebrate, who I do not venerate, who I can’t wait to have out of office again, who understood that United States policy can have a direct impact on the price of energy and a government who I have a lot of respect for president have a lot of respect for who chose not to use that tool. And their common interest was that they had to be very careful about the economic interests of energy producers rather than consumers.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah. It is a bunch of ways in which I think we haven’t quite wrapped our heads around. We’ve spent 50 years obsessing about what it means to be an import-dependent consumer country, and other considerations come up when you realize you’re the largest producer in the world.

Rep. Sean Casten: Yeah. Yeah. And I say that in response to your question of, so now, well, why aren’t people deploying these without subsidies? Because they can’t count on our government to prioritize the consumer. I would also point out on the subsidy side, most of the subsidies that fossil energy receives are designed to lower the marginal cost of production for fossil fuels. You get away from some of your environmental compliance obligations that would raise your marginal cost where you have tax subsidies tied to how much you extract. The overwhelming majority of subsidies for clean energy are to lower the cost to make the initial investment. How do I make it possible for you to have an EV? How do I make it possible for you to have a solar panel? Because I don’t have to worry about the fact that once you have the solar panel, it’s always going to make sense for you to run it as long as the sun is shining.

I do have to worry about the fact that once you have a coal plant, there are a lot hours where it may not make sense for you to run that. And so we subsidize both, but we subsidize them in very different ways. And when we build those clean energy assets, which maybe we have to subsidize to bridge the capital gap, you don’t have to subsidize it anymore. The fossil sector, you have to keep subsidizing it all the time as long as we have competitive markets that keep innovating and keep providing technologies that are providing better value, better service, and lower pollution.

Jason Bordoff: And the other question that I often hear come up in response to some of what you just said is, especially in a world of great power competition and rivalry and fragmentation and issues like economic, national security, economic security are front and center now in even a bigger way, why are we going from all of this domestic energy? We’re a net exporter, we produce more than we need, to being heavily dependent, particularly on China in supply chains. You talked about solar and EVs and batteries and obviously where all the critical mineral refining and processing is. So how do you address that concern? And you hear it on the Hill all the time, we don’t want to go from dependence on the Middle East to dependence on China, that sort of sentiment.

Rep. Sean Casten: It is a interesting conversation. It’s also a category error. I spent a lot of time in the energy industry. I built a lot of steam turbines. I don’t ever remember any policymaker being upset about the fact that we don’t have any casting plants in the United States that are making castings for steam turbines that are used in our nation’s coal plants and gas plants and steam plants. I don’t recall anybody raising concerns about the critical minerals that get used in electrostatic precipitators on the back end of coal plants or in the catalytic converters of our cars. Right. I’m not saying that to say both sides thing. I’m saying that because I think in we didn’t have that conversation because we understood that the value of the energy was the energy, not the thing that you build. So it can then operate and provide you with energy for 30 years.

So yes, if I could have everything, I’d like to have all of that value added in the United States, but if I had to choose between what country will control the manufacturing of an asset that will take a year to build and a year to permit and get commissioned, and what country will extract the 2030 years of value out of that asset once it operates, I’ll take door two every time. And so the reason I say it’s a category error is if we are concerned about extracting oil from countries with shady human rights records and all sorts of other foreign policy concerns where we have to extract that oil every second of every minute of every hour of every day to keep our economy running, we can’t say “and I’m also concerned with the fact that we might have to mine something once and ship that on a truck so that we never have to do that oil thing again.” It’s orders of magnitude of different volumes.

Jason Bordoff: Yeah, I think that’s a point well taken. And I’m just wondering whether you think in addition to, well, I hear everything you just said and that struck me. We didn’t really talk too much about how the steel for oil and gas pipelines was heavily dependent on imports as well, but we’re talking about a lot of things differently now, semiconductors and chips and a whole range of things. So I’m wondering if part of the answer to your question, do you think might be the world has changed and people are not thinking in the same way about in China in an era of today as they did unlike a more copacetic geopolitical era. Might that explain part of it or not?

Rep. Sean Casten: My initial pushback is that I think there’s a lot of false equivalents that if your goal is to protect expensive energy from competition, the Chinese minerals is a useful argument. You don’t have to believe it to make the argument. You just have to persuade people. And so I think it’s important to shut down the argument as a completely separate matter. Should we generally be concerned where there are parts of our economy that depend on critical minerals where the geological deposits are more or less exclusively located in countries that we have some geopolitical concerns with? Sure we should. That’s an appropriate conversation. It was certainly a conversation we had in the twenties when the oil industry was being built out and it’s no less relevant today. So we can have that conversation while at the same time recognizing that we’re talking about orders of magnitude differences, which in some cases doesn’t matter.

If that’s a critical mineral that you can shut down one entire economy by limiting their access. It doesn’t matter that there’s not a lot of it. It’s critical. So yes, that’s an important foreign policy question. Like I said, it’s orders of magnitude difference. And if we can solve that issue, whether with statecraft or foreign policy, et cetera, et cetera, then I think our next focus should be are we the country that’s got the highest margin part of the value chain and on balance, I’d rather be the country that’s turning those rare materials into high value products that’s turning the electricity they generate into even higher value products than the country that’s running a mine.

Jason Bordoff: Well, and that’s a sentiment that’s shared in lots of countries and emerging markets and elsewhere, which is both sensible but potentially a risk, right? If every country puts export restrictions on everything to say, we’re not going to export nickel or copper, you got to build the batteries here and do the refining and processing here, it does start to get expensive and lead to some geopolitical conflict. But do you think you mentioned sort of the statecraft responses to that. The idea that we see this administration taking equity stakes and setting price floors in a rare earth, mine MP materials or both sides of the aisle have a sense that we’re in an era of where it seems there’s support for the state being more involved in private enterprise to try to deal with what are broadly seen as national security risks, although they’re not always incredibly well-defined. How do you feel about that trend we’re seeing?

Rep. Sean Casten: Deeply uncomfortable. I think there’s a healthy conversation to have around what parts of the value chain would we like to have in the United States. We certainly had this with all of the solar tariffs. Is it more important that we can rapidly deploy solar energy in the United States, or is it more important that the panels be manufactured in Ohio, even if that means we’re going to pay more for them? Do we like slave labor in China? Of course not. Do we benefit from having cheaper stuff? Yes. How do we think through that trade? What is the role of the state in bridging that? And is that in the healthy version of that conversation is that’s a very targeted tariff policy, human rights policy, statecraft, all the rest of that stuff. There’s a real dangerous conversation we’re having now of let’s just have taxpayer money invest in these companies and try to control them. And that’s a slippery road to a lot of things that have not worked well for a lot of countries in the Soviet block. Not to put too fine a point out. And as recently as a year ago, my Republican colleagues were making a lot of noise about how we had to ban any ability for the US government to contract with state-owned enterprises. That was a very direct assault on Chinese involvement in various parts of the global supply chain. And now I guess Intel is a state-owned enterprise

Jason Bordoff: And is that different in kind from say, the CHIPS Act or the idea that government needs to support these companies? You’re particularly talking about having an ownership stake, having the potential to influence decisions, push companies to be less DEI or more environmental or something like that. That’s the risk you’re identifying?

Rep. Sean Casten: Totally different. I mean, the CHIPS Act was basically saying, how do we get the private sector to invest in projects in the United States, and we will give them some form of leverage. We’ll give you a tax credit, you’re going to have to put up a lot more money than we put up. If I give you a 30% investment tax credit, you’re going to have to come up with 70% of the money. But how do we leverage tax policy to bring that back and how do we think through, if I can manufacture something in El Paso with $10 an hour labor and you can move that plant to Ciudad Juarez and do it with 80 cents an hour labor, how much is lost for the community in El Paso that loses that plant? And is that worth the $9.20 cents that manufacturer got to their bottom line? Would it be worth a tax policy that gave them $8.20 cents to incentivize ’em to keep that plant to the United States and then they could build it? That’s a healthy trade.

I realize I should have picked numbers that were easier to subtract in my head, but you get my point. So that’s healthy trade. That’s very different from saying we want to put federal money into these companies where we’ve got some kind of a governance stake. We’ve got some kind of ability to directly affect your equity going forward, because if I decide to suddenly sell down my position, it’s going to put you in a horrible position and might I use that to extract some political favors? That’s so far down the road towards crony capitalism. I think the closest we ever got to that prior to this intel deal, at least in my memory, was in the GM bailout. But in the GM bailout, the government gave preferred equity that had a stipulated repayment schedule that was baked into certain milestones. So we saved GM, but markets knew that GM sources of cash going forward we’re going to have to involve this repayment obligation. And so it didn’t introduce uncertainty into the thesis of an investment in gm. I think we’ve just invested massive uncertainty into the investment, not just of Intel, but what do you do if you’re Samsung right now? Do you come asking for your 10%? Do you say, I can’t invest in the United States anymore because they’re going to try to force me to take 10%? I don’t know. Right? But none of that is good for having a vibrant dynamic US economy.

Jason Bordoff: A conversation like this about affordability, energy security, energy geopolitics, I think for a long time was mostly about global oil markets, concerns about the Middle East, opec much more focused now on the power sector and concerns about affordability seem more focused on electricity prices sometimes than oil and gasoline prices. So I’m wondering how you think about the coming challenge of rising electricity demand, how real it is? Is it exaggerated and overstated and sort of what the right policy responses to it are?

Rep. Sean Casten: The demand rise is real. Our economy is electrifying. If you look, oil use in the United States is basically the same as it was 15 years ago. In spite of rising population, in spite of rising economy, I mentioned coal use is down. Gas is increasingly an export commodity in the US. Yes, gas demand is up, but on the margin, new gas goes to export markets, not to domestic use. And some of that’s because we invested in efficiency. Some of that’s because really energy intensive manufacturing moved to,

Jason Bordoff: I mean, we’re still consuming a lot of gas, right? I mean, exports are growing, but…

Rep. Sean Casten: Yes, no, we are. But gas is the only fossil fuel where domestic consumption is still growing. Domestic consumption for oil is not growing. Domestic consumption for coal is shrinking drastically and demand for energy is rising dramatically. It’s just that we’re increasingly consuming electricity and we’re increasingly using non-fossil sources to generate that electricity. And some of that is investments in efficiency. Some of that’s deindustrialization, some of that’s reindustrialization bringing some of these manufacturers on plant back on shore or near-shoring that use electric loads, of course AI, electrification of vehicle fleets. And on the power side, we had this very, and I’ve still never seen, maybe you’ve seen a good explanation of why for basically a hundred years with a couple little wiggles in the line, power demand grew by two to 3% a year in the United States, and then it totally flatlined from 2008 to 2020.

I’ve seen lots of explanations. None of them are totally intellectually satisfying to me. And now of course it’s shot up again. And because the electric industry is so capital intensive and because we still regulate the electric utility industry for the most part in a way that says if you deploy capital, I will give you a guaranteed return of your capital. That means that when we were in this anomalous period where demand wasn’t growing and therefore you didn’t need to build a lot more capital, you were amortizing all those investments out and there was no upward pressure. Now that we’re suddenly having to build all this new capacity, if we’re going to build it in that regulated paradigm, you’re forcing rates to go up. And from a lot of perspectives, that’s a good thing. I’d like to be in an economy that’s growing, and I like that it’s growing in ways that are less carbon intensive than the way it used to grow.

But we still need that physical plant. And that’s true if you’re building a coal plant. It’s true if you’re building a wind farm, someone’s got to build something and no one’s going to build that something unless they have a reasonable expectation, they can get their capital out of it. And so that dynamic is real. We also have such massive opportunities to cut it down. We’ve woefully underdeployed all these grid enhancing technologies that would slash our line losses by as much as 50%, which means we can use those wires more. We’ve done an atrocious job at building transmission wires that would lower the cost of power. Virtually all the transmission we build in this country is for reliability. Virtually none of it is for cost reduction. That’s a choice that falls out of policy decisions. But if we make the opposite choice, then all of a sudden we could be deploying capital that exists to lower people’s cost of energy instead of deploying capital that must be amortized and raise your price of energy. So we’ve got a real opportunity if we’re smart about it, but the demand growth is real, and the consequences of building capacity to meet that demand growth follows naturally from that. We just have to decide what it is we’re going to build.

Jason Bordoff: And the consequences of not meeting that demand growth, particularly for some of these massive tech companies, who view the leadership in AI as existential, is enormous and they have a lot of capital to spend. And there’s a what, five, six year backlog for new gas turbines, a lot of excitement about nuclear, but even optimistically, that’s still kind of far away. So I’m wondering how much of a headwind, how much sand in the gears you think pulling back the IRA support in the Big beautiful bill actually, how different is the outlook for renewables now given that the power’s got to come from somewhere? And as you said, it still looks pretty attractive in terms of an economic investment?

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, and I haven’t looked at this chart recently, but I’d be amazed given how sticky it is, if it’s changed much. But at the end of ‘24, there were about 2000 gigawatts of generation that was trying to get interconnected to the grid. And for your listeners, we have, what, about 1100 gigawatts of generation? So 2001 to connect, which would roughly three x increase in our grid capacity. Not all of that will go through, but there were 2000 that was sitting there waiting to get approval to interconnect of that 2000 gigawatt, one was coal, 85 was gas, and the balance was all solar, wind and storage. And so the market was telling us, and those trends, again, the IRA accelerated them, but the basic trends that would also have been true if we looked before the IRA, what markets want to build is the stuff that doesn’t have a marginal cost because it’s got a better investment thesis.

I am, I’m concerned about the equity impacts of repealing the IRA because when you take away the ability to provide tax credits, refundable tax credits to people who don’t have disposable capital, then we’re saying only wealthy people can access cheap energy. On my bigger concerns with what the Trump administration has done is things like shutting down the offshore wind plant that was 80% complete off the coast of Connecticut because that sends a signal to capital people who are willing to write billion dollar checks that you should not invest in the United States unless you’re willing to bribe the president. Doing things like shutting down the loan guarantee to the grain belt express that in energy was going to build that would’ve brought cheap energy from the plain states into Southern Illinois. Those decisions to shut those down are being driven by an anti-competitive motivation, not an anti unclean motivation, an anti-competitive motivation because the biggest threat to the domestic gas industry, the domestic coal industry is cheap energy. And so those pieces, some of which were accelerated by the IRA, some of those were just general policy of a more thoughtful administration. Pulling those back doesn’t stop us from building new generation, but it overtly preferences that we will build the most expensive stuff.

Jason Bordoff: If there, in your view, it’s still economically attractive, you’re bringing up these issues of can you get permits to build? Can you rely on permits to build? And so at a broad level, there seems to be support on both sides of the aisle abundance movement to make it easier to build. What do you think the prospects for that are the ability for maybe something to happen in Congress on permitting? What does that look like? And I assume it’s necessarily some sort of compromise that is about oil and gas as well as clean energy and all of the above.

Rep. Sean Casten: The dynamics of the compromise that was there at the end of the last term are a little harder to come by now because virtually everything that the Republicans wanted in exchange for the compromise, which was a weakening of environmental enforcement, don’t consider the climate impacts of LNG export and production. They’ve basically given themselves all those things through other either administrative or legislative actions that they’ve gotten with their majority. So at this point, what is there to compromise on? There were the other pieces that we wanted to go out there and get done. We’ll see, but it’s going to be, let’s just say this has not been a Congress that has seemed predisposed to compromising with Democrats. Having said all that, there are things we could do very much in an abundance construct that we should have done years ago. In any given year in the United States, we build 10 to a hundred times as many miles of high pressure gas distribution as we build of high voltage electric transmission.

The primary reason is because FERC has sole source authority for gas pipelines and nobody has sole source authority for electric transmission. So if we just gave FERC the same permitting authority that they have for gas, all the same laws would apply, all the same interveners could still petition. You can’t just lose at one county level and then petition the county next door. And if you lose their petition, the county next door and gum up the whole process, you want to do that in the name of abundance. You want to do that in the name of cheap energy. You want to do that in the name of making it easier for corporations to build these. I don’t care. But that’s the right policy to do, right? And yes, I’ve got bills for that as well, and we’ll be bringing ’em forward. But these sorts of things shouldn’t be partisan except for the fact that I keep coming back to those are the things you do if you want to prioritize cheap energy for consumers. And that’s in the current moment is a very partisan idea.

Jason Bordoff: How likely do you think it is and do you think there should be a government shutdown? And this probably is not top of the list of implications, but for people thinking about energy and climate and what should they be thinking about in terms of the implications of that?

Rep. Sean Casten: Do I think there should be a shutdown? Absolutely not. Do I think there should be the amount of pain imposed on the American people that’s implicit in the proposal that Mr. Johnson has just put out as the condition of a shutdown also? Absolutely not. So we’re going to have to see how the next few weeks play out. I am more uncertain about the prospect…

Jason Bordoff: And when I say, do you think there should be, I sort of meant is it the view that it’s time for Democrats to stand up and not sort of concede to in the way people perceive Schumer and others did last time?

Rep. Sean Casten: I think the single stupidest thing we can do is to view this through a partisan lens of who would be blamed for causing pain. I just don’t want to vote for causing pain. And if we’re going to vote for a bill that’s going to strip people’s healthcare away, that’s going to make everyone sicker. That’s not something that we can vote for. There’s a way through there. What I was starting to say about my nervousness, the moment is more that the Congress is no different from anybody else’s office. Ultimately, the currency is trust. And when we’re sitting there saying, watching the Trump administration choose not to disperse funds consistent with law, consistent with congressional intent, not be pressured by the Republicans to defend the prerogatives of Congress, it’s a lot harder to say what exactly are we fighting for? What concessions would we make that would actually be enforced in the absence of some commitment on oversight or others? And I can imagine ways to solve that, but I think it’s difficult for a lot of us in Congress to think about if you don’t have that trust, how certain can we be that in the next two weeks, there’s not going to be a tremendous amount of pain imposed on the American people because the White House can’t be trusted with the American People’s Bank account.

Jason Bordoff: I’m going to bring it to a close. You’ve been very generous with your time, but I can talk to you for hours. But is there anything in particular we haven’t talked about that you just wanted to make sure to touch on or lead people with? We’ve covered a lot.

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, I always feel like I hate ending these, particularly when we’ve dealt with such heavy topics without some note of optimism. And I would just point out that we’ve had plenty of times in our history when we’ve been close to losing this republic. We’ve had plenty of times in our history when we prioritize the robber barons over the man and woman in the street. And what’s always striking now, being a member of Congress, traveling abroad is a little bit of a different vibe than when I was a civilian, shall we say. And what other countries are most jealous about of the United States is not the leaders we elect, but the character of the American people that we’ve gone through stresses like the Civil War that would’ve broken other countries. And we survived it as a union and we survived it and held fast, ultimately messily and completely. But ultimately, we held fast to those principles that the rest of the world’s jealous about. And so I think in this moment as well, the optimism is if Americans simply express the character that we know they have, we’re going to be fine.

Jason Bordoff: It’s a great note to end on. I’ll just in closing, say, as someone who’s built an institute that views our mission as providing expertise and analysis to help decision makers and policy make the best decisions they can, I always appreciate people who are such active consumers of that and take energy and climate policies as seriously as you do. And thanks for your leadership on all those issues, and thanks for spending so much time with us today.

Rep. Sean Casten: Well, thank you for breeding voters who think that energy policy is their top issue. It’s my surest path to higher office.

For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?
OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed.","WASHINGTON — Tax incentives that saved U.S. residents thousands of dollars on home efficiency upgrades, clean energy installations and electric vehicles are expiring this year. That means people who want to take advantage of them before they disappear have to act quickly.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

WASHINGTON – Today, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) acted under its Clean Air Act (CAA) statutory authority to safeguard the long-term availability of the chemical Halon-1301 that is a critical fire suppression agent for commercial aviation, defense, and energy. Without it, critical infrastructure and civilian safety is at risk. EPA is issuing CAA 114 information requests to three companies—the American Carbon Registry, Wesco, and Tradewater—seeking to gather information about projects involving the destruction of Halon-1301 in exchange for carbon offset credits.

“EPA is deeply concerned that companies are destroying critical lifesaving fire suppression products for carbon credits. Doing so not only deprives our country of this critical chemical, needlessly putting public safety at risk, but could also make the United States dependent on other countries like China,” said EPA Assistant Administrator Aaron Szabo. “This is yet another example of companies prioritizing short term financial gains over real, lifesaving products.”

Halon-1301 remains indispensable to protecting public safety and human health because of its unmatched ability to extinguish fires quickly in confined spaces without leaving corrosive or harmful residues. Halons are class I ozone-depleting substances regulated under CAA Title VI, and new production of the chemical was banned under the Montreal Protocol in 1994. However, America’s recycling industry has successfully managed existing stocks for more than three decades, and EPA has worked closely with the Federal Aviation Administration, the Department of War, and others to ensure safe and reliable supplies of recycled halons for the civil aviation industry and other critical applications.

This careful stewardship and management is under threat due to entities attempting to destroy perfectly usable halon in exchange for carbon offset credits, undermining the United States’ long-term availability of this strategic chemical. The latest example came in July 2025, when an entity attempted to destroy 30,000 pounds of the United States’ Halon-1301 supply in France in exchange for these credits. After receiving information that the Halon-1301 could be reclaimed, EPA’s Office of Air and Radiation stepped in to prevent the destruction.

If America’s reclaimed and recycled stocks are needlessly destroyed, the United States could be forced to secure Halon-1301 from China or one of the other few countries that still produce Halon-1301. EPA’s action makes clear that the agency will not allow short-term financial incentives in carbon offset markets to jeopardize the United States’ long-term safety and security. Simultaneously, EPA is exploring other avenues to both safeguard the supply and find suitable alternatives.

The American Carbon Registry, Wesco, and Tradewater have 21 days following the receipt of EPA’s letters to respond to the agency’s mandatory request. To view the letters, please visit EPA’s Halons Program website.

“There is still time, but the clock is ticking,” said Zach Pierce, head of policy at Rewiring America, a nonprofit focused on electrification.

With thousands of dollars on the line and mere days or months to claim them, we've got some tips on how to maximize savings.

Refresh my memory. What are these incentives?

The Inflation Reduction Act that passed in 2022 includes a slew of tax credits for electric vehicles and home efficiency upgrades.

The credits had two main goals: to help people afford cleaner alternatives like heat pumps and electric vehicles that can save them money, and to reduce greenhouse gas emissions that are the largest driver of climate change.

In addition to EVs, home upgrades that qualify include home energy audits, heat pumps, solar panels, water heaters, appliances, battery storage, car chargers and improvements to windows, doors, skylights, insulation and electrical panels.

Payback comes at tax filing time. For example, if you buy a heat pump and qualify for a $2,000 tax credit, you document that expense on your tax return, and you owe $2,000 less in taxes that year.

Some incentives have a cap. You can only get $1,200 of credit per year for most of the home improvements like insulation and efficient windows, and $2,000 of credit for heat pumps and water heaters. The big expenses, including geothermal heat pumps, rooftop solar and battery storage, aren't capped. Those tax credits are 30% of the purchase price. So a new $20,000 rooftop solar system earns you a $6,000 tax credit.

Most of these credits were originally set to expire between 2032 and 2034. But the budget passed by Congress this year ends them far sooner.

When are they expiring?

Most of them expire at the end of this year. But there are some exceptions.

The clean vehicle tax credit worth $7,500 for new EVs and up to $4,000 for used ones expires Sept. 30.

Pierce said with a deadline that tight, people shopping for a new vehicle that qualifies should get on that “as soon as you hear this message.”

Olivia Alves, senior associate with the nonprofit clean energy advocacy group RMI, said it's also the one IRA credit you can typically get upfront. “You use the clean vehicle tax credit, you can work with your dealership to get that money off the day that you make the purchase. So it operates like a point of sale rebate,” she said.

The car doesn't need to be parked in your driveway by the deadline. A buyer simply needs to enter into a contract and make a down payment or trade-in to qualify.

The credit for EV chargers, which is up to $1,000 for qualifying residents, is good through June 30 of next year. Everything else expires on Dec. 31.

If I'm focused on my home, what should I prioritize?

Start with the home energy assessment, Alves said.

“That is really the bread and butter for a lot of these types of retrofits,” she said. “Those are done by professionals that can help you map out what those projects would look like.”

Pierce said after that, if solar panels are in the game plan, tackle that next. But some solar installers are already booked through the end of the year.

“We are seeing more bottlenecks for rooftop solar installations than we are for heat pumps, for example, but that doesn’t mean that it may not be an option for your region or your neighborhood,” Pierce said.

“Experts estimate that takes 60 to 90 days to get a solar panels system installed, and that’s quick,” said Kate Ashford, investing specialist with the personal finance company NerdWallet. “You might be a little late, but you could look into it to see if it’s even possible.”

Alves said next, tackle smaller installations like doors and insulation. Her final tier is major appliances like heat pumps, which are more expensive and can take longer, but may not face the same backlog as solar installations.

But what if the tax credits exceed what I owe?

OK, let's say you qualified for tax credits on a home efficiency improvement and the amount exceeded the tax you owed. You weren't allowed to carry that unused credit forward into a future year anyway.

But credits for residential clean energy projects — think really big-ticket items like solar, geothermal heat pumps and battery storage — could be carried forward if you didn't get the full benefit of the incentive on your tax return.

Ninety-eight years ago, the nation’s largest power grid operator was founded here by utilities serving Pennsylvania and New Jersey. On Monday, Pennsylvania Gov. Josh Shapiro threatened to pull his state out of the coalition.

“It is time to get serious about making significant reform,” Shapiro said, at a conference he convened with representatives from all 13 states now in the grid to “chart a new course” for operator PJM Interconnection.

“If PJM refuses to change, we will be forced to go in a different direction,” he said.

Pennsylvania is the largest energy producer in the grid. Its absence would impact electricity consumers across the region, which stretches from Illinois to North Carolina.

Data centers built to fuel artificial intelligence technology are driving huge increases in electricity demand—and in prices for consumers. Shapiro and other elected leaders like Virginia Gov. Glenn Youngkin blame PJM for delays in approving new power projects, creating a bottleneck that is making the situation worse. Shapiro, a Democrat, and Youngkin, a Republican, want states to have a say in PJM’s decisions; right now, government officials do not have a voice on PJM’s board.

Speaking at the conference later in the day, PJM CEO Manu Asthana, who is stepping down at the end of this year, said that “fingerpointing” wasn’t helpful.

“There’s an element of responsibility on both sides,” he said, meaning the states and PJM. All parties need to work together and ask, “‘How do we solve this?’” he said.

At the end of the conference, 11 of the states’ governors’ offices—all but Kentucky and West Virginia—announced they had formed a collaborative to continue to work together on the energy issues discussed at the meeting.

Tom Rutigliano, senior advocate with the Natural Resources Defense Council, called the joint criticism of PJM by multiple state governors “very unusual” and “the highest level of state engagement with PJM I’ve ever seen.” He said in an email that he thinks there’s a strong chance for governance reforms.

Shapiro’s statements come two months after nine governors in the PJM region demanded in a letter that PJM reserve two board seats to be filled with nominees by the states. Last month, those nominees surfaced as former Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Chairman Mark Christie and former FERC Commissioner Allison Clements.

PJM, which has conducted a months-long effort with a consultant to propose candidates, initially responded that it would consider the recommendations. It is expected to make a decision this Thursday.

“PJM is mired in a crisis of confidence,” Christie said at the conference. “Consumers have lost confidence in the people who run their grid.”

Christie said PJM needs a “new constitution,” one that reimagines the organization in a way that changes its governance structure to reflect the fact that PJM is a “policy-making body.”

Shapiro said PJM has “months, not years” to make changes, or Pennsylvania will take steps to leave the organization. “We need to move more quickly on these energy-producing projects, and we’ve got to hold down costs. If PJM cannot do that, then Pennsylvania will look to go it alone,” he said. Shapiro did not provide details about what this new arrangement would look like.

New Jersey lawmakers have already taken up the issue. In June, the state Assembly passed a bill directing its Board of Public Utilities to work with other states and study alternatives for addressing skyrocketing electricity prices—including the option of leaving PJM altogether. A companion measure has been introduced in the state Senate but has not yet been assigned to a committee.

In remarks delivered remotely to the conference, Youngkin confirmed that he and his allies are working on bills that seek to do the same.

“The bottom line is that when PJM succeeds, we all succeed together. But if reforms stall, we will act and do what is needed to protect the families and businesses who depend on us,” Youngkin said.

In his recorded message for the conference attendees, Maryland Gov. Wes Moore said, “Thirteen governors have united with a single urgent message for our regional grid operator, and it underscores the seriousness of the crisis that we now face. The path forward requires real transparency and accountability from PJM and a truly collaborative role for states in the governance process.”

Maryland, as a net importer of electricity, is frustrated by PJM’s delays connecting new clean-energy sources to the grid and opaque governance rules that Moore repeatedly said are disrupting the state’s climate targets and hurting households and businesses.

On Monday, ahead of his recorded message, Moore huddled with state Senate leadership in Annapolis to announce $200 million in direct energy bill rebates for low-income households to counter the rising prices.

Without commenting on how PJM should be governed, the Natural Resources Defense Council said in a statement that PJM and states should require data center developers to “pull their own weight” by investing in new energy generation—a policy push during the meeting colloquially tagged as “bring your own generation” or B.Y.O.G.

“The big message today was that prices are unsustainably high and PJM needs to do a better job protecting customers,” Rutigliano said. “The truth is that this crisis was caused by data centers and nearly all the money is going to old power plants.”

In a statement to Inside Climate News, PJM spokesperson Dan Lockwood said that “meeting the demands of a rapidly changing energy landscape will require solutions that extend beyond any one institution.”

“It will require PJM, the industry and especially our states all working in concert,” he said.

Asthana, PJM’s CEO, emphasized the scale of change that will be necessary to meet the challenges of powering AI now and in the future, not just at PJM but across the country. “If we’re going to win this race, I think we need to think differently,” he said.

What’s not clear is whether, or how, states leaving PJM would lead to a more affordable or reliable system.

Most of the power plants in PJM compete on an open market as a result of decisions by lawmakers in various states in the 1990s and 2000s to introduce more competition into the electricity sector. This restructuring meant that regulated utilities were limited to providing the delivery of electricity, while independent power producers would build and operate power plants.

Representatives of independent power producers said on Monday that they can understand the frustration with PJM, but they don’t see how it solves anything for states to leave.

“While we continue to stand in favor of common-sense reforms that will improve power market functionality, grid reliability, and consumer affordability, the actions taken by some elected officials do nothing more than disrupt PJM’s ability to do its job,” said a statement from Todd Snitchler, president and CEO of the Electric Power Supply Association, a trade group whose members include independent power producers.

Jon Gordon, director at Advanced Energy United, a trade group that represents advanced generation technologies, said despite PJM’s high prices, participation within the regional grid provides more efficiency and competition for electricity sales, which keeps costs lower for ratepayers. The regime used prior to PJM’s shared marketplace allowed utilities to overbuild with less incentive to keep prices in check.

“I don’t think anybody wants to go back to that. … We just need to make improvements so we get all the benefits of competition but none of the inefficiencies,” Gordon said, adding that a PJM departure may mean state agencies could have to negotiate contracts with producers. “If these studies are fair and unbiased, I think they’re going to show it’s pretty risky to leave PJM and there’s probably not enough benefit to justify the potential risks.”

The challenge with PJM is the political diversity of the region that includes Republican West Virginia and Democratic New Jersey, compared to more ideologically homogeneous New England, Gordon added. The governors in the PJM region have now realized they don’t have much influence over decisions affecting how new generation sources get onto the grid.

“I think the states are completely different on whether it’s fossil or renewables generation,” Gordon said. “But they all agree that they want a voice, and they want lower prices.”",https://www.renewableenergyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Gov-Josh-Shapiro-2048x1366-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 15:01:53.336845

The next most common application was frequency regulation, which was the primary use for 24% of battery capacity.
Growing fleet The majority of the US utility-scale battery capacity is concentrated in California and Texas, within the CAISO and ERCOT markets.
Nationally, by the end of 2024, the US had approximatel 11 GW of grid-scale battery capacity with arbitrage as the top use case.
These evolving applications underscore the increasing versatility of battery energy storage systems and their expanding role in grid stabilization.","The latest data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) confirms that arbitrage – the practice of buying electricity when prices are low and selling it when prices are high – remains the dominant use case for utility-scale battery energy storage systems in the US.

In 2024, operators reported that 66% of all utility-scale battery capacity included arbitrage among its applications, while 41% of total capacity was used primarily for arbitrage.

The next most common application was frequency regulation, which was the primary use for 24% of battery capacity. Frequency regulation plays a critical role in maintaining the grid’s stability by keeping it operating at a steady 60 cycles per second.

While this breakdown is similar to 2023 – still with arbitrage leading the way – it’s a notable shift compared to earlier years, when frequency regulation was the most commonly cited primary use of battery systems.

This transition reflects a broader trend seen in mature energy storage markets, such as the UK. As ancillary services markets tend to be relatively shallow, a shift from frequency regulation to energy arbitrage is a natural evolution as battery deployment scales.

The most significant change in the US is occurring in Texas, where battery operators are increasingly depending on energy arbitrage as their main revenue stream, rather than ancillary services.

According to Modo Energy, in 2023, 85% of BESS revenues in Texas came from ancillary services. By 2024, that number had dropped sharply, with nearly 60% of revenues coming from arbitrage – a clear signal of market maturation and shifting economics.

Growing fleet

The majority of the US utility-scale battery capacity is concentrated in California and Texas, within the CAISO and ERCOT markets.

As of the end of 2024, CAISO reported 11.7 GW of installed battery capacity, 43% of which was primarily used for arbitrage. Meanwhile, ERCOT reported 8.1 GW of capacity, with 50% primarily used for arbitrage.

That’s up from 8 GW in CAISO and 3.9 GW in ERCOT at the end of 2023. Despite the rapid growth, the share of capacity primarily used for arbitrage remained consistent year-over-year.

Nationally, by the end of 2024, the US had approximatel 11 GW of grid-scale battery capacity with arbitrage as the top use case. Around 6.5 GW primarily dedicated to frequency regulation.

Beyond arbitrage and frequency regulation, utility-scale batteries in the US are also being used for a growing number of grid-support applications, including: absorbing excess wind and solar energy, system peak shaving, load following, co-located renewable firming, ramping/spinning reserve, voltage or reactive power support, load management, backup power, and transmission and distribution referral.

These evolving applications underscore the increasing versatility of battery energy storage systems and their expanding role in grid stabilization.",https://www.ess-news.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-180.png,N,,2025-09-23 15:01:50.450949

The interest-free and unsecured contribution will be provided by Natural Resources Canada (NRCan) and delivered by The Economic Development Agency of Canada for Quebec Regions (CED), under the Regional Economic Growth Through Innovation Program. It will finance 75% of the eligible costs for the pit extension at the mine to support continued production.

LDI, located about 150 km northwest of Montreal, produces approximately 15,000 tonnes of graphite concentrate annually, from an installed capacity of 25,000 tonnes per year.

The funding will help the company avoid putting LDI on care and maintenance at the end of 2025 and allow it to immediately begin work on extending the existing pit.

The goal is to break ground as soon as possible to ensure a continuous flow of material to the plant. First production from the new zones could start in around 6-8 months. In the meantime, Northern will continue supplying customers by processing ore from existing pit and ore stockpiles through the third quarter, and will then fulfill orders from inventory.

Thinking of an electric vehicle? You’ve only got a week left before federal tax credits end, or you’ll have to pay full price.

The $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 credit for used electric vehicles (EV) ends Sept. 30. Steven Hershkowitz is the managing director for clean transportation for the Washington Department of Commerce. He expects the loss of this incentive will hurt EV sales in the short term.

“There is going to be a bit of a drag on the growth rate that we have seen,” Hershkowitz said. “We’ve already seen the market growth slow down in 2024 and into 2025.

Washington got rid of its tax exemption for EVs earlier this year. The legislature and Governor Ferguson are deciding to use those dollars elsewhere, but Herskowitz said the state’s commitment to electric vehicles and clean energy isn’t going away.

“The commitment is still there, and the prioritization is still there,” Herskowitz said. “These consumer-facing incentives that were quite popular are not, unfortunately, but there’s progress being made in terms of making sure that, hopefully, we can get the incentives back at some point.”

Climate Commitment Act to fund clean energy projects

The state will continue to use funds from the Climate Commitment Act to push clean energy and expand EV charging around the state.

Herskowitz believes electric vehicles are the future, and the demand will eventually return.

“The automakers know that this is where it’s going,” he said. “The global competition is further ahead in many major markets now internationally for EVs, and so this is where we’re going. It’s just about the pace at which we get there.”

The pace also includes finding ways to improve the pricing for electric vehicles.

The average price for a new EV is over $55,000. The average price for a new gas car is $49,000. You can certainly find new EVs for much less. Some only run about $30,000.

Now might be the time to get in, if you want to take advantage of the tax credit.

“It’s a good opportunity for people who have been considering getting an electric vehicle to really bring that consideration up to a higher level, perhaps go into dealerships, test drive, see what the prices are,” Herskowitz said. “This could be a good opportunity to get deals depending on which model you’re looking at.”

But expect a lot of company. You won’t be the only person trying to squeeze in before the deadline.

The action aims to streamline the permitting process as well as support President Donald Trump’s executive orders aimed at boosting data center infrastructure and accelerating the development of new artificial intelligence systems in the United States.

The actions are part of EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin’s “Powering the Great American Comeback” initiative that aims to create more jobs and grow the U.S. economy.Those efforts include streamlining permit processing as well as expanding the U.S.’s artificial intelligence and data center global footprint, which involves TSCA pre-manufacturing chemical review.

Under the TSCA law, manufacturers and processors are required to submit pre-manufacture notices, or PMNs, for new chemicals. They are also required to submit a significant new use notice, or SNUN, if they plan to use existing chemicals for new uses.

However, in December 2024, the agency under the Biden administration finalized an amendment under TSCA requiring manufacturers to submit advance federal notice before adding any new chemicals, particularly PFAS, or other toxic substances into their production processes.

The rule, which went into effect Jan. 17, aligns with the chemical safety amendment enacted in 2016 under TSCA, known as the Frank R. Lautenberg Chemical Safety for the 21st Century Act.

The TSCA amendment gives the EPA additional testing authority, helping the agency to gather information on new chemicals. This allows the EPA to determine if the material poses a health or environmental risk, if there is sufficient information about the chemical, any risks associated with the manufacturing process and the amount that will be produced.

From this evaluation, the EPA is then required to take action against any risks the toxic substances may pose, such as issuing a rule to limit or ban the chemical’s amount used in manufacturing, processing or distribution.

The effort comes days after the agency held an AI roundtable with C-suite executives including from Hitachi Americas and the Data Center Coalition. Zeldin said in the Sept. 18 press release that the EPA inherited a “massive backlog” of new chemical reviews from the Biden administration, hindering data center and AI-related projects.

In January, the Government Accountability Office released a report that found the EPA’s new chemical review process is taking longer than the expected 90 days, harming manufacturers’ customer relations and prompting them to introduce and make new products outside the U.S.

“The Trump EPA wants to get out of the way and help speed up progress on these critical developments, as opposed to gumming up the works,” said EPA Administrator Zeldin.

For many, that raises the question: will adoption stall without that $7,500 headline incentive? At Cox Automotive, we believe EV adoption will continue, but not automatically. To maintain momentum, automakers, policymakers, and industry stakeholders must stay focused on three critical levers: cost, confidence, and convenience.

Cost: The Affordability Test

Even as battery costs decline, EVs remain a premium purchase. In August 2025, the average EV sold for $57,245, which is $9,066 more than a comparable gasoline model. Incentives narrowed that gap, but with federal credits ending, mainstream buyers will feel the pinch.

Automakers and the government alike have been offering plenty of sales incentives on EVs, with the typical incentive package reaching a record 17.5% of average transaction price in July before dropping to 16% in August. They have also been increasingly leaning on leasing. Since 2023, more than 1.1 million EVs have been leased, with lease share holding above 50% for eight straight months. Leasing lowers monthly payments, keeps technology fresh, and builds the pipeline of used electric vehicles that will define the next stage of adoption.

As government-backed incentives fade away in October, the biggest near-term challenge to the industry and automakers will be how to manage costs and ensure that EVs are within reach of more consumers. Price parity remains elusive. Until that happens, EV growth will be challenged.

Confidence: Making Battery Health Visible

Price alone won’t close the deal. Electric vehicle buyers need confidence, especially when it comes to battery life. That’s why the industry is converging on a new metric: State of Health (SoH). SoH reporting, tied to each vehicle’s VIN, is becoming essential for consumers, lenders and insurers alike. As it becomes as routine as an odometer reading, battery health measures will ease buyer anxiety, stabilize pricing, and unlock the used EV market at scale.

Convenience: Charging Shapes the Map

Between January and August 2025, the U.S. added more than 21,000 charging ports, bringing the total to 228,701. DC fast chargers alone grew nearly 19%. Still, reliability and availability vary by region, meaning geography matters more than ever. States with rebates, utility programs, and National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) funded corridors, like those in California, Colorado, and Washington, are creating adoption hotspots. As we have noted before, the gasoline infrastructure in the U.S. has been under development for more than 100 years. A charging infrastructure to support the wide adoption of EVs still has a long way to go.

The Used EV Wave Is Coming

Lease returns and trade-ins are boosting the supply of used EVs, making them more affordable than ever. In August, the price difference between a used EV and a used internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle fell to just $897 – the lowest on record – as used EV sales climbed to nearly 41,000 units, lifting market share to 2.4%.

For mainstream buyers, EV affordability in the used-vehicle space is finally within reach. At the same time, hybrids and plug-in hybrids continue to appeal to shoppers who value fuel economy and the convenience of familiar refueling. But the long-term trajectory favors full electrification: Falling cell costs, the rise of new battery technology and chemistry, and a domestic battery supply chain supported by the 45X credit (the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit created under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022) all point in that direction.

Consumer intent to purchase an EV reinforces this outlook. Recent Morning Consult research found that 65% of EV Intenders still say they would consider buying an electric vehicle despite the phasing out of the Inflation Reduction Act tax rebates. Access to charging, vehicle performance, cost savings and environmental concerns all ranked higher in purchase consideration than rebates.

Together, these forces suggest a solid foundation for future EV market growth. As the price gap narrows and the total cost of ownership becomes more compelling, intent can translate into used EV sales, but only if transparency keeps pace. Without VIN-level battery health data, deals stall and margins compress. Delivering clarity and confidence will be critical to unlocking scale in the used EV market.

What Next For EVs in the U.S.: Outlook and Action

Without fresh federal support, the U.S. EV share is likely to hover below 10% in 2025. However, we still believe the EV mix of sales can climb to near 25% by 2030, well short of the 50% once envisioned, but certainly moving out of the “niche” category. That slower climb carries real consequences for emissions, competitiveness, and industry planning.

What the Industry Must Do Now: With $7,500 incentives eliminated, the case for EVs now rests on performance, technology and total cost of ownership, rather than subsidies. Making data understandable, with SoH reporting standardized at the VIN level across listings, appraisals and financing, is essential.

The industry also needs to follow demand as closely as policy, concentrating inventory and marketing in the regions where state and utility incentives, as well as charging density, align to support adoption.

And it’s not just about consumers: fleets remain a critical lever. Electrified fleets – especially those with predictable routes and centralized charging – are well-suited for early adoption. As these vehicles transition out of commercial service, they help seed the used EV market, expanding access to more affordable electric options for secondary buyers

Cox Automotive’s Role: Cox Automotive is helping scale EV adoption by making data and tools more accessible.

Bottom Line

The federal tax credit was a key catalyst for EV adoption, and its expiration marks a pivotal moment. This shift will test whether the electric vehicle market is mature enough to thrive on its own fundamentals or still needs support to expand further. Growth moving forward will be slower than many advocates hoped, though continued innovation in battery technology, improved transparency in battery health and expanding infrastructure give reason for optimism. The road ahead will be challenging, but progress will continue.",https://www.coxautoinc.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/EVIncentivesArticle2400x1260-Facebook.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 14:01:53.028519

Live6 hosts these workshops, community meetings and programs out of its headquarters, Neighborhood HomeBase, which is located at 7426 W. McNichols.
“Success in the next 10 years looks like more active commercial real estate on the corridor and longer hours for existing businesses,” Murphy says.
“Everyone seems to have ties to this neighborhood,” Murphy says.
“The strategies we are putting in place will spur more growth, more opportunities, and more retention of existing businesses and residents.","When Live6 Alliance was founded in 2015, its mission sounded straightforward. Serve as a bridge between institutions, businesses and residents along Detroit’s Livernois and McNichols corridors.

The reality was complex.

Vacant storefronts lined McNichols, which is also known as Six Mile. Historic homes needed repair. Longtime residents, the people who carried Detroit through its hardest times, often felt overlooked as investment skipped past their blocks.

A decade later, progress is visible.

Restaurants, clothing boutiques and art galleries are bringing new life to a stretch of Livernois called the Avenue of Fashion. New streetscapes, updated lighting and bike lanes have reshaped public infrastructure on Livernois and West McNichols. Pocket parks and public art signal pride and momentum. Most importantly, neighbors are showing up and leading.

“When Live6 started, we were a team of one,” says Executive Director Caitlin Murphy. “Our focus was on listening and convening. We were advocates. Today we are stewards of place. We are working closely with block clubs and neighborhood associations to implement projects, manage assets and align partners and dollars so that the entire district moves forward.”

That shift from planning to doing shows up everywhere.

Live6 supports home repairs and tangled title work through its Heirs Property Program. It offers more concerted business support, from retention and attraction to workshops with lenders and local partners, including the Detroit Economic Growth Corporation, Small Business Administration, and the Detroit Neighborhood Entrepreneurs Project out of the University of Michigan’s Ross School of Businesses. Live6 hosts these workshops, community meetings and programs out of its headquarters, Neighborhood HomeBase, which is located at 7426 W. McNichols. HomeBase is a flexible community space that doubles as the Alliance’s primary office.

“HomeBase serves as one of our key neighborhood gathering spaces,” Murphy says. “On a weekly basis, block clubs meet here free of charge. We host workshops with the local service providers, home repair information sessions, and even art shows from time to time. We are also a tech hub and a Connect313 site so residents can drop in to use computers and Wi-Fi and get support from one of our Digital Navigators or Community Tech Consultants in order to pay bills online, or get help with their websites or social media if they are local entrepreneurs.”

The results include both physical improvements and social fabric. “There has been an uptick in civic life and participation,” Murphy says. “People pop into HomeBase every day to ask what we do because they notice the visual difference on the corridor. New businesses are coming along, and people want to learn more and get involved.”

For Murphy, the proudest moments are in the everyday scenes. “The bike lanes can be controversial, but I smile when I see kids rollerblading in them or an older resident riding to run errands,” she says. “I love driving down Prairie and seeing a full basketball game in action with dozens of teenagers on the sidelines waiting to play. There is real vibrancy in the public realm, and that matters for social connection and mental wellbeing.”

Live6’s anchor partnerships have been foundational. “If it was not for University of Detroit Mercy (UDM) at the beginning, we would not be the healthy organization we are today,” Murphy says. “They provided back-office support and helped us get started. With Marygrove, it has been powerful to see the campus transform into a cradle-to-career community asset. Residents tell us their children just started at the early childhood center or enrolled in the high school. It is becoming the community’s campus.”

Over the years, trust has deepened by putting residents at the center of implementation.

“We are in a moment of planning fatigue,” Murphy says. “To combat this, we started bringing people in weekly to work alongside us. We hire local caterers and lawn crews. We help entrepreneurs form LLCs (limited liability company) so they can be permanent vendors. Most of our staff were born, raised or live here now. We are investing in people as we grow the place.”

Looking ahead, Live6 has clear goals. “Success in the next 10 years looks like more active commercial real estate on the corridor and longer hours for existing businesses,” Murphy says. “We want to complete more home repairs and help more families secure the resources necessary to preserve and build wealth. We were just designated a select-level Michigan Main Street community, a five-year partnership with the MEDC (Michigan Economic Development Corporation) that will accelerate our stewardship of our commercial corridors. Expect more business crawls, facade improvements and interior supports along with outdoor patios that bring energy and customers to the street.”

The vision is block-by-block, node-by-node. “We started with a micro-district on West McNichols,” Murphy says. “Now we are pursuing a few key sites to activate both sides of the street and create another node of retail closer to Wyoming, directly across from the Marygrove Campus. Retail likes retail across the street. When we do that, the rest can fill in more organically. This is long-game, multi-generational work.”

For many residents the work is generational and personal.

“Everyone seems to have ties to this neighborhood,” Murphy says. “My grandfather had a hair salon on Livernois in the 1960s. My grandma graduated from Immaculata High School. My mom has worked at University of Detroit Mercy for 40 years. I graduated from UDM’s Master of Community Development program and did my capstone project with Live6’s first executive director. I have been part of this from the start, and I am grateful to be afforded the opportunity to lead the organization today.”

If she had to choose one word for the next decade, Murphy does not hesitate. “Catalytic,” she says. “The strategies we are putting in place will spur more growth, more opportunities, and more retention of existing businesses and residents. We are excited to implement and to bring as many people with us as possible and our team is equipped and ready to partner.

Ten years in, Live6 is not just a neighborhood nonprofit. It is a steward of the promise of Detroit’s neighborhoods , showing how residents, anchor institutions, small businesses, and a fully thought out public realm can add up to a place where Detroiters are proud to want to live, work, learn, play and lead.",https://kresge.org/wp-content/uploads/live6-800.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 13:01:35.949944

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump's administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries ... they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

U.S. exit impacts politics but not investment

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/GVx_1cje3RRJKIcocfm0Pg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD04MDA7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/cp_finance_889/a197f89e633515b0e8197b4dd5896077,N,,2025-09-23 17:04:35.736390

Ameren previously requested and received an exemption from the heightened MATS rules for its coal plants from the Trump administration.","Utilities, fossil fuel companies, and aligned groups filed public comments last month supporting a pair of Trump administration proposals to repeal EPA limits on harmful emissions of air pollution and greenhouse gases from power plants.

One of the Trump administration’s proposals would reverse a Biden-era EPA rule that strengthened Mercury and Air Toxics Standards (MATS), Clean Air Act regulations limiting oil- and coal-fired power plants’ emissions of hazardous air pollutants, including mercury, arsenic and lead. Under the proposed reversal, the EPA would revert to enforcing weaker standards that were previously in place, and the EPA’s tools to enforce the standards would be limited.

Another Trump proposal would repeal all greenhouse gas (GHG) emission standards for fossil fuel-fired power plants, based on the Trump administration’s proposed determination that they “do not contribute significantly to dangerous air pollution.” It also includes an alternative proposal to repeal GHG limits on existing power plants and requirements to utilize carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) at new and modified fossil fuel-fired plants, leaving in place only dramatically weakened standards for new methane gas and oil plants. Either proposal would entirely eliminate GHG regulations for coal-fired power plants.

The public comments are just the latest volley in the fossil fuel and utility industries’ long-running efforts to undermine U.S. environmental and climate standards.

The Trump administration expects to move swiftly to finalize both the GHG and MATS rule repeals in December 2025.

Utility front groups and trade associations push for deregulation

Electric utility industry groups that commented in support of the weakened federal pollution standards included the Edison Electric Institute (EEI); National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA); American Public Power Association (APPA); Alliance for Fuel Options, Reliability, and Diversity (AFFORD); Midwest Ozone Group (MOG); and Power Generators Air Coalition (PGen).

Edison Electric Institute

EEI is the trade association for U.S. investor-owned electric utilities. It has used front groups to undermine climate science and delay climate action. Utilities knew as early as the 1960s and 1970s that the climate risks of burning fossil fuels could ultimately require a transition away from fossil fuels to cleaner sources of electricity. Despite this knowledge, utilities backed misinformation campaigns to sow doubt about the causes and harmful impacts of climate change, and delay climate action. EEI previously fought the Obama-era Clean Power Plan, which sought to regulate GHG emissions from power plants for the first time in the U.S., through its backing of the Utility Air Regulatory Group.

EEI supported an earlier determination by the first Trump administration that a lowered MAT standard would be“protective of human health with an adequate margin of safety.” EEI also said that the first Trump administration’s determination was “consistent with those of the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI) in a pair of June 2018 reports” in its comments on the MATS reversal. EPRI research is largely funded by its electric utility members, who generally pass on the cost of their EPRI dues to their customers.

Numerous medical organizations dispute the Trump administration’s adequate safety claim, including the American College of Physicians, American Lung Association and American Heart Association.

EEI also argued for looser compliance and monitoring in its MATS comments.

In its comment on the GHG rule, EEI stopped short of fully endorsing the Trump administration’s elimination of GHG regulation, instead supporting the more targeted rollback in the EPA’s alternative proposal. As part of its rationale, EEI cited case law that enables utilities to avoid federal common lawsuits where they could face liability for their climate pollution as long as the EPA retains its Clean Air Act authority to regulate GHGs. In other words, EEI wants the EPA to retain weak limits on GHG emissions from new fossil fuel plants, in part so its members can’t be sued in federal courts for their contributions to harmful climate change.

EEI also argued that CCS “has yet to be demonstrated at the levels of operation required for broad-scale deployment, and the cost of such technologies remains an additional barrier to widespread deployment.” This mirrors the argument EEI made in a 2024 lawsuit attempting to block the Biden-era GHG rule requiring CCS that Trump wants to repeal. EEI and member-utilities have long used their voluntary (and largely taxpayer and ratepayer-funded) CCS and “clean coal” research and development programs as a reason to delay transitioning from fossil fuels to cleaner power sources like wind and solar power, and list CCS among their decarbonization strategies.

National Rural Electric Cooperative Association (NRECA)

NRECA is the trade association for electric cooperatives. The organization supports the rollbacks of MATS regulations and the primary proposal to eliminate GHG regulations entirely on fossil fuel-fired power plants.

Along with EEI, NRECA previously opposed the Obama administration’s Clean Power Plan. In addition, NRECA ran a public relations campaign in 2021 to promote coal in Illinois. NRECA touts prior and current membership in front groups that regularly fight clean air standards, including the Utility Air Regulatory Group and Power Generators Air Coalition.

American Public Power Association (APPA)

APPA is the trade association for publicly-owned utilities, such as the Salt River Project in Arizona, the Los Angeles Department of Water & Power, Austin Energy, the Nebraska Public Power District, and hundreds of others.

APPA’s comments on the proposed MATS rule fully supported the rollback. Its comments on the GHG proposal, like EEI, supported the alternative proposal’s rollback, and declined to weigh in on the primary proposal beyond agreeing that a finding of significant contribution to dangerous air pollution is necessary.

APPA also previously opposed the Clean Power Plan and touted membership in the now-defunct Utility Air Regulatory Group.

Alliance for Fuel Options, Reliability, and Diversity (AFFORD)

AFFORD, previously known as the Climate Policy Group, is a trade association that bills itself as a “coalition of not-for-profit electric utilities,” though the organization does not appear to have a website and did not list its members in its comments on the proposed rules.

The group supports the repeal of Biden-era standards for MATS, arguing that coal is necessary for grid reliability, and opposes stronger regulation of the pollution-heavy fuel that might make it even more uneconomical. In its comments on the proposed GHG rule repeal, AFFORD again cites reliability as an argument for undoing regulation, ignoring the outsized costs of coal and the reliability of renewables paired with energy storage. AFFORD agrees with the primary proposal for the GHG rule and the Trump administration’s assertion that coal plants’ don’t contribute significantly to climate change, arguing that their “contribution to total global warming is negligible.”

AFFORD’s chairman is James Fuller, who is also president and CEO of MEAG Power, a generation and transmission cooperative utility in Georgia. Terry Torrens, a senior lobbyist with the Orlando Utilities Commission, is listed as a program director. Previous AFFORD leadership includes James Dickenson from JEA — the municipal utility that serves Jacksonville, Florida, Timothy Grove from Omaha Public Power, Patrick Pope from Nebraska Public Power District, and Dave Lock from the Tri-State Generation and Transmission Association, according to IRS filings.

AFFORD’s comments on the proposed GHG regulatory rollback were submitted by Robert Talley, a lobbyist whose client list includes AFFORD and MEAG, as well as several other municipal utilities and generation and transmission cooperatives, according to OpenSecrets. Of Talley’s listed utility clients, all still have active coal plants.

Midwest Ozone Group (MOG)

Midwest Ozone Group (MOG) is a front group comprised of utilities including Ameren, Duke and American Electric Power (AEP); steel and other heavy industry interests; and fossil fuel companies like ExxonMobil and Marathon Petroleum. MOG supports the complete rollback of the 2024 MATS rule and the EPA’s primary proposal to eliminate all GHG regulations for fossil fuel plants.

The group states that its primary goal is “to work with policymakers in evaluating air quality policies by encouraging sound science.” MOG previously sued the EPA to prevent the implementation of the GHG and MAT standards that the Trump administration is now pushing to repeal.

Power Generators Air Coalition (PGen)

PGen was created around late 2020 or early 2021, as the Utility Air Regulatory Group (UARG) disbanded amidst a Congressional investigation, which had for years represented utilities in litigation and regulatory opposition against EPA Clean Air Act rules. PGen is operated through the same lawyers as UARG, and many of its members are the same. PGen’s founding directors included investor-owned utilities like American Electric Power, Arizona Public Service, Consumers Energy, DTE Energy, Southern Company, and Vistra.

The group commented in support of the Trump Administration plan to repeal the MATS standards. Its comments on the proposed GHG rule endorsed the alternative proposal to eliminate most regulations if coupled with an additional weakening of the few regulations remaining.

While PGen is openly engaged in the federal regulatory process, its website states that it does not lobby or litigate. However, PGen’s lawyers are active in lawsuits through other front groups with similar membership.

PGen’s comments were written and submitted by Allison Wood and Makram Jaber, attorneys at the McGuire Woods law firm. Wood and Jaber represent a separate utility group – Electric Generators for Sensible Transition – in an earlier lawsuit seeking to block the same EPA regulations now under consideration for repeal. Wood and Jaber also represented the now-defunct UARG, which had many of the same members as PGen.

PGen, APPA, and MOG all based their GHG rule comments, particularly around the issue of CCS, on an analysis by J. Edward Cichanowicz and Michael Hein. Both Hein and Cichanowicz repeatedly served as consultants for UARG — the front-group predecessor to PGen — as early as 2004. In 2011, Cichanowicz testified to Congress that “probably 75 percent” of his income comes from utilities.

Ratepayers subsidize utility advocacy

In many states, utilities are able to embed the costs of their membership in these trade associations, typically including litigation costs, into ratepayers’ electric bills. As a result, ratepayers subsidize the network of front groups filing anti-regulation litigation and advocacy. In the case of public and non-profit power, ratepayers and taxpayers are left on the hook for APPA’s, AFFORD’s, and NRECA’s pro-pollution advocacy.

Utilities supporting climate and environmental obstruction

In addition to affiliated front groups and trade associations, some utilities themselves commented in support of rolling back pollution regulations. Ameren, American Electric Power (AEP), and Cleco all filed comments last month in support of both proposed rollbacks. Duke, Arizona Public Service (APS), and FirstEnergy commented in support of the rollback of the GHG rule.

In December, federal authorities required Ameren Missouri to spend $61 million on projects to mitigate harms from Clean Air Act violations at its now-retired Rush Island coal plant, including 14 years of sulfur dioxide emissions in excess of what the law allows. Now, Ameren Missouri joins the chorus of polluters calling for weaker monitoring and lower MATS standards for its remaining Labadie and Sioux coal plants. Ameren previously requested and received an exemption from the heightened MATS rules for its coal plants from the Trump administration.

In its comments supporting the full repeal of GHG regulations for power plants, Ameren argued that electric utilities do not “contribute significantly” to climate change. In its comments, Ameren publishes an 18-page debunking of CCS as a plausible means for reducing greenhouse-gas emissions, but continues to plan to use CCS in its sustainability reports and integrated resource plan as a justification for building out its methane gas-fired generation fleet while maintaining corporate climate targets.

Duke Energy adds to its extensive history of climate obstruction

In a January letter, Duke, along with 9 other utilities, requested that then-nominee for EPA administrator Lee Zeldin repeal the GHG regulations at issue in the current proceeding, as well as regulations related to coal ash. Duke’s comments build on its extensive history of opposing GHG regulation, though Duke does support a standard that requires new methane gas turbines to be more efficient in its comments.

Beginning in the 1990s, Duke backed disinformation campaigns that denied the science that showed human causes and harmful impacts of climate change. Since then, the utility has opposed limits and regulations on GHG emissions. This includes supporting efforts by EEI and UARG, as well as the State Policy Network and American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, discussed below.

The Town of Carrboro, North Carolina, last year sued Duke for its “decades-long role leading a nationwide climate deception scheme that has worsened the climate crisis, harmed the community and cost the town millions of dollars.”

Like EEI, Duke argues that CCS capturing 90% of emissions is “not adequately demonstrated” and “its costs are not reasonable.” This argument comes months after Duke’s request for $10 million from ratepayers for a feasibility study on installing CCS to curb 95% of emissions at its Edwardsport coal gasification plant was approved by the Indiana Utility Regulatory Commission.

Coal interests are also pushing regulatory rollbacks

In addition to the utility industry and its front groups, coal companies and their trade associations support the regulatory rollbacks, continuing a long history of fighting climate and environmental regulation.

As coal industry groups represent coal interests broadly, their membership can include utilities. In many cases, utilities seek to charge these membership dues to customers, forcing their ratepayers to subsidize pro-coal and anti-environmental advocacy.

America’s Power

America’s Power, formerly the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity (ACCCE), is a trade association that represents a coalition of industries involved in producing electricity from coal, though its membership is no longer publicly shared, and utilities fled the group under pressure from investors. America’s Power has consistently opposed regulation of coal power and its polluting byproducts, including air toxins and greenhouse gases, and has perpetuated outright climate denial. America’s Power supports both the rollback of the EPA’s MATS standards and GHG regulations.

As part of its support of the Trump administration’s rollback of GHG regulations, America’s Power insists that CCS is “not economically achievable” and “not adequately demonstrated.” This comes despite ACCCE previously touting CCS as a technology that could make coal “clean” and “control pollutants regulated by federal clean-air statutes.”

American Coal Council

The American Coal Council is another coal trade association that represents the coal industry supply chain, including mining, transportation, and coal-burning utilities like AEP, Dominion, DTE, Duke, Xcel, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. In its comments, the group encouraged the EPA to gut both the MATS and GHG regulations.

Like America’s Power and ACCCE, the American Coal Council has opposed environmental regulation and downplayed or denied the effects of climate change — it has called carbon dioxide the “environmental boogeyman of the day” and posted climate denial claiming that carbon dioxide emissions are actually advantageous. An American Coal Council communication kit for climate change and carbon dioxide provided the coal industry with a talking point: “bottom line on climate change: Coal equates to fewer deaths, lower medical costs, and more food.”

Also like America’s Power, the American Coal Council previously pointed to carbon capture and sequestration as the solution to coal’s greenhouse-gas pollution and a way to justify coal as clean. Now, however, the organization objects to requiring carbon capture as a best system for emissions reduction, arguing that the system is technologically and economically impractical.

Lignite Energy Council

The Lignite Energy Council is a regional trade association that represents North Dakota’s coal industry and its customers, like electric utilities. The Lignite Energy Council conducts pro-coal public relations campaigns and lobbies for coal-friendly legislation, including spending millions of dollars in attempts to block Minnesota clean energy policies. The group commented in support of both proposed rollbacks.

North American Coal

North American Coal, a coal mining company that “operates surface coal mines across Mississippi, Louisiana, Texas and North Dakota,” submitted comments in support of rolling back MATS regulations. North American Coal was the lead plaintiff in a lawsuit seeking to restrict the EPA’s ability to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. That suit was eventually consolidated with West Virginia v. EPA, which substantially limited the EPA’s authority to regulate GHG emissions from existing power plants in the Clean Power Plan.

Koch-funded right-wing groups supporting GHG regulation repeal

State Policy Network

Multiple affiliates of the State Policy Network (SPN) advocated for the elimination of GHG regulations on fossil fuel generation, including the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, Buckeye Institute, John Locke Foundation, and Texas Public Policy Foundation. SPN serves as the central hub of a network of affiliated think tanks located in all 50 states, and is funded by right-wing and corporate donors that include fossil fuel interests and petrochemical billionaire Charles Koch’s network of conservative donors.

The network has long backed opposition to clean energy and climate policies, and at the start of 2024 listed opposing renewable energy as a top legislative priority for the coming year.

Heritage Foundation

The Heritage Foundation — the primary organization behind Project 2025, the right-wing playbook for Trump to consolidate power and pursue a right-wing agenda including environmental deregulation — also commented in support of eliminating GHG regulations for electricity generation. The group has a long record of funding from the fossil fuel industry and the Koch network.

Prime Mover Institute

The Prime Mover Institute (PMI) filed comments supporting both the rollback of MATS regulations and the elimination of greenhouse-gas emission regulations for fossil fuel plants. PMI is a new think tank created and directed by Russell Greene, who is a senior fellow with the Stand Together Foundation, founded by Charles Koch. Brian Hooks, the director and CEO of Stand Together is also a director of the Charles Koch Institute and Charles Koch Foundation, according to IRS filings.

In its comments supporting the rollback of greenhouse-gas regulations, PMI relies entirely on an analysis by Always On Energy Research, the project of Isaac Orr, Mitch Rolling, and Amy Cooke. Both Rolling and Orr previously served as policy fellows at the Koch– and Lignite Energy Council-backed Center of the American Experiment, Minnesota’s SPN affiliate, where they authored and spread disinformation intended to discredit renewable energy. Cooke is the former CEO of the John Locke Foundation and Executive Vice President of the Independence Institute, both SPN affiliates. She was also part of President Trump’s 2016 EPA transition team and a visiting energy policy fellow at SPN, where she led the organization’s Energy Policy Working Group.

American Enterprise Institute

In addition, the American Enterprise Institute (AEI) — a pro-free market and anti-regulation think tank — commented in support of both proposed rollbacks. AEI has a history of climate denial, and previously offered to pay scientists to dispute climate science. The think tank has received millions of dollars from fossil-fuel interests, including the Koch network and Exxon Mobil. AEI received $550,000 between 2019 and 2020 from the foundation of Joe Craft, the CEO of coal producer Alliance Resource Partners, and a GOP and Trump donor.",https://energyandpolicy.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/13978507500_da095d4904_o.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 14:02:13.152346

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) proposed fundamental shifts to how it conducts risk evaluations under the Toxic Substances Control Act (TSCA) for chemicals already in use and already on the market. TSCA, the nation’s main chemical safety law, requires EPA to evaluate chemicals used in everyday products — from shower curtains and children’s toys to paint strippers and degreasers. EPA is touting the move as increasing efficiency, but the proposed changes undo important provisions that would better protect public health. EPA is giving the chemical industry much of what they have asked for — a promise that EPA will downplay the risks of toxic chemicals, so that industry can continue to put them in our homes and workplaces.

“Yet again, we’re seeing Trump’s EPA prioritize industry profits over the health, safety, and wellbeing of people. EPA’s changes would hide the true dangers of the toxic chemicals we come into contact with,” said Kelly Lester, Earthjustice attorney. “Bad risk evaluations mean toxic chemical risks will seem lower than they really are. Families will be left unprotected, because the safeguards built on these flawed evaluations won’t address the danger people actually face. EPA needs to do its job and evaluate toxic chemicals the right way, not the corporations’ way.”

Under TSCA, EPA is required to evaluate chemicals in commerce to determine whether they pose an unreasonable risk to human health or the environment. Comprehensive, robust risk evaluations are necessary to understand the full risks associated with a chemical. If EPA does not accurately measure unreasonable risk—an outcome all but guaranteed by EPA’s proposed changes—it cannot manage chemicals in a way that fulfills its mandate to eliminate that risk.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/baby-room_lisa-anna-unsplash.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 16:02:37.918532

""Despite Republican efforts to repeal this tax credit, 25C is still the law of the land through 2032, and families should keep getting the savings they were promised.
The 25C credit, which reduces the amount of taxes owed, is capped at $3,200 a year, with lower limits for specific equipment and improvements.","Democrats on the House Ways and Means Committee recently wrote to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, who is also acting commissioner of the Internal Revenue Service (IRS), saying the OBBBA cited the wrong subsection, in Section 25C of the Internal Revenue Code, in canceling the credit. The IRA had moved the provision for 25C's expiration from subsection (h) of Section 25C to subsection (i).

The letter argues that the credit remains in effect through 2032 and calls on the IRS to affirm that. ""Any suggestion that Section 25C has expired is not only legally incorrect but would also represent an unauthorized $21 billion tax hike on hard-working American families,"" the letter says, in part.

""Democrats argue that because the termination clause was no longer in subsection (h), Republicans' One Big Beautiful Bill amending subsection (h) to end the credit in 2025 was legally ineffective,"" wrote Alex Ayers, vice president of government affairs at Heating, Air Conditioning & Refrigeration Distributors International (HARDI), in a blog post.

However, Ayers' take is that the technicality on which the Democrats are pinning their hopes does not in fact exist and that 25C will almost certainly expire at the end of the year. Ayers doesn't want the Democrats' efforts to mislead consumers or contractors into thinking they'll be able to use 25C after this year. HARDI and other HVACR trade groups are aligned on the issue, he said.

""We would love to see incentives,"" Ayers said during a recent interview. ""We don't want a consumer to feel they've been hurt by a contractor based on a press release.""

Ayers said that, for reasons that are unclear to him, the change in the IRA that moved 25C's subsection (h) — the expiration date provision — to subsection (i) had not been written into ""positive law"" at the time the OBBBA was adopted in July. At that point, he said, the change remained in what's called ""slip law,"" which, while valid, does not have the authority of positive law.

""At the time the law (OBBBA) was passed, subsection H contained the expiration date, and that's what was amended,"" Ayers said.

A Congressional source said Democrats were seeking clarification on the issue from the Office of the Law Revision Counsel (OLRC). The OLRC is in charge of accurately maintaining the U.S. Code.

The IRS, Ayers said, has issued guidance that says that 25C can be claimed only for equipment that is installed and put into service before the end of the year. The IRS is unlikely to change its position, he said. ""The only out that we see is for House Democrats to try and file a lawsuit,"" which is also unlikely, he said.

""Time is running out for homeowners to take advantage of the credit, and (HARDI) members should encourage contractors to schedule qualifying projects as soon as possible to avoid installation delays in December,"" Ayers wrote in his blog post.

But Rep. Jimmy Gomez, D-Calif., one of the leaders of the Democrats' effort to preserve 25C, said he'll keep working to protect it.

""I wrote the Home Energy Savings Act, which was signed into law through the IRA, because working families deserve to get real savings on their energy bills,"" Gomez said in an emailed statement. ""Despite Republican efforts to repeal this tax credit, 25C is still the law of the land through 2032, and families should keep getting the savings they were promised. I led the fight to create this credit, and I'll keep leading the fight to protect it.""

The IRS did not respond to a request for comment.

The 25C credit, which reduces the amount of taxes owed, is capped at $3,200 a year, with lower limits for specific equipment and improvements. The credit for a qualified heat pump, for example, is $2,000, while the credit for a qualified central a/c unit is $600.

Daniel Raimi: Hello, and welcome to Resources Radio, a weekly podcast from Resources for the Future (RFF). I'm your host, Daniel Raimi. Today, we talk with Dr. Sheila Olmstead, professor at the Cornell Brooks School of Public Policy, Atkinson scholar, senior faculty fellow at the Cornell Atkinson Center for Sustainability, and a university fellow here at RFF.

Along with a group of colleagues, Sheila recently published an opinion piece critiquing the way that the United States incentivizes the deployment of carbon capture and storage, or CCS. Specifically, they argue that current policies could actually lead to more pollution, deter the deployment of alternative energy sources, and cost a whole lot of money. In this conversation, Sheila will make the argument for why the current policy design is flawed and offer some suggestions for how to make it better. Stay with us.

All right, Sheila Olmstead from Cornell and RFF. Welcome back to the show.

Sheila Olmstead: Thank you, Daniel. Thanks for having me.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, of course. I was looking back at our records and noticed that the last time you were on the show was almost five years ago. It was December 2020 and you were talking about a totally different topic—the Clean Water Rule with my colleague Kristin Hayes. So, I'm wondering if you can remind us how you got interested in working on environmental issues in your career.

Sheila Olmstead: Yeah, of course. I like to tell this story to my students because it shows, in a way, that life is long, and you can follow a twisted journey to your ultimate destination.

I actually was in my master's program in public policy at the University of Texas at Austin. I was doing foreign policy stuff, and I had an internship lined up at the US embassy in Baku, Azerbaijan, between my two years in my master's program. Then, my dad got sick, and I ended up deciding I needed to stay in Austin for the summer.

So, there I was in the era of the bulletin board. Literally, the internship office had paper opportunities posted with tacks on a bulletin board. The only one left at the time, which I realized was going to be an important change for me, was an internship at the state environmental regulatory agency—at the time, it was the Texas Natural Resource Conservation Commission and has now become the Texas Council on Environmental Quality.

I took that internship, and it was delightful. It was in the Office of Border Affairs. I started working on understanding the water and wastewater infrastructure needs of communities called colonias—very low-income communities on the Texas side of the border that had inadequate sanitation, drinking water supply, roadways, and services like trash and schools. I was hooked after working on that and realizing, “Hey, we are in a wealthy state, in a wealthy country, and it's amazing that there are these environmental challenges that have such profound implications for human health. And here they are, right in our backyard.” So, that was it. I started taking environmental policy classes and studying economics, and then here I am today.

Daniel Raimi: That's so interesting. I don't think we've ever talked about this, because I had a similar experience when I was doing my master's program at Duke. I wanted to get a job or an internship in education policy, and I didn't get one. The only one that I got offered was an environmental job at the state environmental regulator.

Sheila Olmstead: We have that in common.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah. So, I took that internship, and the rest is history.

Sheila Olmstead: That's so great. I love that.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah. Cool. As I mentioned in the intro, we're going to talk today about carbon capture and storage, or CCS. The federal government's been subsidizing CCS since 2008, I believe. The policy's called 45Q, because that's the relevant section of the tax code that codifies the subsidy. Can you get us started by giving us a sense of how much deployment of CCS the current policy landscape might actually lead to, and how much it might cost in the years ahead?

Sheila Olmstead: Sure. Yeah, it's interesting. The subsidy for CCS, in contrast to subsidies for some other climate-friendly tech, has been remarkably generous and persistent over administrations of many different political flavors. As you noticed, it has been around since 2008. It's really only gotten richer since then. And that's, again, quite different from subsidies for wind and solar, for example, and electric vehicles, which have gone up and down. The wind and solar subsidy has been canceled, so there's been a lot of uncertainty, really for a long time, over those.

But, for CCS, it's been quite bulletproof. And it's hard to know. As you know, there's a lot of uncertainty about exactly how much deployment is going to happen as a result of any policy. But for this one, there are some pretty good recent estimates looking at the total fiscal cost of the Inflation Reduction Act's increase in the 45Q subsidy, suggesting that it'll exceed $100 billion through 2031.

Unlike some of those other climate-friendly subsidies that I just mentioned, the CCS subsidy was not reduced by the recent One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA), or the law that was passed by Congress with the budget and signed by the president. I would anticipate that that cost number is probably still about right. There are some changes we may talk about later that have maybe made it even more appealing for firms to take, so it's possible that those costs could even be higher.

Then, we can think about how, at the level of an individual deployer of CCS for a single 500-megawatt coal-fired power station, studies suggest that payments could amount to $3 billion to $4 billion over 12 years. The subsidy has a 12-year lifetime, basically from the time the firm begins taking it until it expires. If we think about deployment overall, its current level is $85 per ton. That's the 45Q tax credit that could certainly lead to more rapid US deployment of CCS than what we've seen under lower versions of the subsidy.

There's some models suggesting that total predicted carbon dioxide storage could reach 200 million to 800 million tons annually just because of the increase that happened under the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—which, as I mentioned, is continuing even under the new rules and budget.

Daniel Raimi: Right. Okay. So, definitely large dollar numbers we're talking about here. Tens of billions of dollars a year, potentially.

Sheila Olmstead: Yes.

Daniel Raimi: You mentioned that the OBBBA changed the 45Q subsidy. That's been a little controversial. We've talked about it a little bit on the show before, but can you just remind us, What was the change? How do you think about that change from an economic perspective?

Sheila Olmstead: This is a great question, and it's one we hear a lot of conversation about. But, I feel like there's been some fogginess with how we talk about it, maybe because we haven't thought that much as economists about carbon capture and storage and the structure of the subsidies for it.

It used to be the case in the IRA and before (so, basically, all versions of the 45Q subsidy) that firms would get a smaller subsidy for capturing carbon dioxide right from their flue gases and storing that by using it for enhanced oil recovery. So, it's a process in which firms will take carbon dioxide, pump it into an aging oil and gas field, and then stimulate and reduce the cost of production from those fields.

This process, called EOR or enhanced oil recovery, does store carbon. Most of the carbon dioxide that is pumped down into the well, into the formation that the firm is getting oil and gas from, does stay underground. So, it is a form of storage, but it used to be the case that it got a smaller payment from the federal government than did what's called geologic storage—in which firms take carbon dioxide from, say, a refinery or a power plant, and then purely store it deep underground. And that could be a saline aquifer, an old oil and gas field, or something like that.

What the OBBBA did is it created parity between those payments, so the EOR subsidy went up. Now, if I'm storing carbon dioxide by stimulating new oil and gas production, I get the same payment as if I just took carbon dioxide from a power plant or a refinery and then stored it geologically without stimulating new production. There's some controversy to this, because just thinking through—wait a minute. If what we're trying to do is decarbonize and shift away from fossil fuels, then why would we be making equal payments for using carbon dioxide to generate more oil production or cheaper oil production?

It's a fair question, but there are three things to think about as we consider whether, from an economic perspective, providing equal payments for these two forms of storage seems right or not.

The first is the source of carbon dioxide. So, if I took emissions—from a power plant or refinery—and used them for enhancing oil recovery by storing most of that carbon underground or geologically in some other fashion, as long as both of those emissions are coming from the same types of anthropogenic sources that would otherwise (or, counterfactually) have been released to the atmosphere, then the two technologies, the two approaches shouldn't differ and shouldn't get different levels of payment. The 45Q subsidy is designed really only to provide payments for that kind of emissions capture—so, for anthropogenic emissions that would otherwise have been released. On that basis, I think we can say parity seems to make sense unless that changes.

In the past, a lot of firms have used naturally sourced carbon dioxide from deposits underground for EOR. So, in a way, if they're switching and using anthropogenic carbon dioxide, that could even be better than we were before.

The second thing that you'd want to think about is, Is there a difference between the long-run storage security you get if you inject carbon dioxide underground to enhance oil production, or if you just inject it purely for storage?

I haven't seen any evidence that those are not equal mechanisms in these particular cases, but that would, I think, require some further study and some investigation. And, if they are different on those bases, then having a different payment might make sense, or having an equal payment might not make sense.

The thing that's, I think, biggest, and maybe the one that a lot of folks have missed, is whether any oil production that you get from this injection of carbon dioxide is actually additional. So, if it's not expanding global oil production, then parity seems reasonable to me. I hate to go out on a limb here, because I like to see studies that look at this, but if new oil produced using enhanced oil recovery by injecting carbon dioxide in the United States simply displaces a barrel of oil that would've been produced elsewhere by not storing carbon dioxide, then I see these approaches as fundamentally equivalent to injecting carbon dioxide for deep storage purposes without the enhanced oil recovery.

But again, I think that needs some further study. And I think a lot of folks that are critical of making these payments equal are very focused on this idea that it's going to increase oil production. It's possible, in the long run, that it could do that if US production is a large enough share of global production and this subsidy makes a big enough difference that we get more production than we would otherwise have done, or at a lower price, or both. But I don't think anyone can answer the question of whether that's true or not. And so, until we can, I don't think we can confidently say whether this change under the OBBBA really makes sense from an economic perspective.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, really interesting. I feel like that's a good study that our colleague Brian Prest might be able to run with some of his oil and gas modeling.

Sheila Olmstead: Yes.

Daniel Raimi: One quick follow up to that: I was talking with Jen Wilcox from the University of Pennsylvania about this, and one thing that she pointed out to me (which, I'm curious to hear if this changes your thinking at all) is that the expansion of the 45Q credit wasn't just for enhanced oil recovery—it was actually for any use of the captured carbon dioxide.

Sheila Olmstead: Yeah.

Daniel Raimi: So, she was a little bit more positive about it, because she was excited that maybe the carbon was going to get used in new advanced materials or for other applications that don't involve extracting fossil fuels. Does that change how you think about it at all?

Sheila Olmstead: It also contributes. This is an area where I think we're in much earlier days than we are with pure storage, in a geologic sense. I would say two things.

One, I agree 100 percent that if this stimulates more research into how to embody carbon dioxide within concrete or cement or other materials that have seemed to have some significant prospects in that direction, I think that's a great thing that could be very useful. The only caveat to that is, for utilization purposes and given the scale of carbon dioxide storage that people talk about, if you look at models of what's necessary to meet either national or global decarbonization goals and avoid, say, two degrees of sea warming, the scale of that amount of storage is just enormous, and I don't think we're ever going to be in a position where demand for things like carbon dioxide for cement or other materials is going to eat up enough of that necessary storage to make a huge dent in the problem.

But, I do think we need an all-of-the-above energy strategy, and I think this is exactly the kind of technology that's nascent and really needs support before it could be deployed at any scale. It would make a lot of sense to subsidize that work.

Daniel Raimi: Yeah, really interesting. Let's get back to the analysis that you ran with your colleagues. So, one of the key points that you make is that, unlike renewable energy projects like wind or solar—which are expensive to build, but very cheap to operate—CCS is expensive to build, and it's expensive to operate. Why does that matter in a policy context?

Sheila Olmstead: I'm so glad you asked this because, again, I think it's something that we haven't necessarily thought through very well when we think about carbon capture.

I think, if you look at the package of subsidies that the United States has had, and certainly which were enriched under the IRA, we think about them as all roughly equivalent. There's either subsidizing some capital, such as the construction of new stuff, or they're subsidizing production of climate-friendly stuff. Some are big, and some are small, and they're going to induce some carbon dioxide emissions reductions, hopefully. CCS is completely different from something like subsidizing the production of electricity from wind turbines or solar panels. To capture carbon from a coal-fired power plant is a very different endeavor.

Why is it different? It's different because the cost of generating electricity from the sun or the wind will come down over time. And what are we producing with those technologies? We’re just making electrons, or sending electrons through a transmission system, and that's eventually being used as electricity in homes and businesses. So, the cost of that comes down over time, and it competes with other ways of generating electricity in the marketplace, including coal and gas. And that's true in the United States and many other places with abundant renewable resources. New onshore wind or solar photovoltaic both compete with the cost of a new natural gas power plant, even without subsidies, in many parts of the country.

In contrast, the government payment per ton of carbon dioxide is the market for CCS. There is no other market, though there are some small exceptions in the United States: California has a cap and trade, and there's the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative cap-and-trade program for carbon dioxide emissions from power plants in the Mid-Atlantic and Northeastern United States. So, there are some places where there are carbon prices, and those provide, at this time, a fairly small incentive. I haven't looked at those prices recently, but my guess would be less than $30 per ton, maybe $40 per ton. CCS costs a lot more than that for most applications. So, without the federal subsidy, there is no carbon capture.

The government subsidy has to be enough to cover the whole cost of this, and it has to continue in perpetuity. This has really important implications materially for both climate change, and fiscally for the United States.

For climate change, climate-tech subsidies come and go. We see this historically in the United States. Even the stuff that's pretty popular is sometimes not. Sometimes it's big; sometimes it's small. Unfortunately, CCS firms have no incentive to run a carbon capture facility without that payment, and they will never have an incentive to do that. So, any coal or gas power plant, or industrial facility that's built with CCS, is only going to capture carbon when the payment is sufficient to support it.

As just one example of that, the only coal-fired power plant in the United States—at least that I know of that currently has a carbon capture unit—is the Petra Nova project, which is on one of the generating units at the W. A. Parish Generating Station coal-fired power plant near Houston. And that project was heavily subsidized by the US Department of Energy and the federal government, and received payments under section 45Q—the subsidy for carbon capture. For a couple of years, when the price of oil dropped during the pandemic, it shut off the capture unit because it was not profitable to run that unit. The reason the price of oil made a difference was because the use of that carbon dioxide is for enhanced oil recovery.

So, the firm is getting a payment from the federal government to capture the carbon, and then it's also getting a payment for that carbon dioxide to be used in nearby oil fields for enhanced oil recovery. The EOR incentive was just not enough to keep that unit running. It really needed the government payment and a high oil price.

They have since restarted, but I would anticipate that if we see additional deployment of CCS in the power and industrial sector in the United States, exactly that kind of pattern will emerge, and they will say, “Hey, wait, when the subsidy is high enough, I'm going to run this thing. When it's not, I'm going to shut it off.”

For climate, this makes a big difference. If I incentivize a bunch of deployment and get a whole bunch of, say, power plants that stay in the industry and generate electricity that might have exited either without the subsidy or with a carbon tax or some other policy approach that might've achieved the same level of emissions change, then I have to keep paying those guys, or they're going to shut off the capture unit, and that is a real problem for the climate.

But it's also, as you can imagine, a problem fiscally. Currently, the subsidy expires after 12 years. And so, if we don't want all those capture units, and if we induce a bunch of deployment, and we don't want them shut off after 12 years, then the government is hostage to that. They have to keep making those payments in the absence of any kind of additional policy that might replace it, like a mandate or a carbon price or something like that. So, both for the sake of emissions and climate change, and for the fiscal situation of the federal government, I think CCS is very different from the other technologies that we're subsidizing. And it's very important.

If we can say one thing that comes away from this podcast, I hope people will keep that in mind: that these are not comparable subsidies.

Daniel Raimi: Right. Totally. And, just for context, I looked up the price in the Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative in California, and it's on the order of $25 a ton right now. So, significantly less than the carbon capture subsidy that we're talking about.

Okay, so another point that you make in your piece is that providing a per-ton subsidy for CCS will actually encourage some of the most polluting plants to keep running so that they can take advantage of the fact that they have the most carbon dioxide that's available to capture and monetize. What's the implication of that for the deployment of other clean energy technologies and the competition between coal with CCS or gas with CCS and other nonpolluting sources?

Sheila Olmstead: Yes, it has pretty significant implications, I think. Again, I'm not a modeler. If you look at models suggesting the amount of deployment we might expect and so on, CCS is still a fairly small slice of the picture. But, as you know, Daniel, imagine we keep in the power-generation industry a small number of the dirtiest coal-fired power plants—those that have the highest emissions intensity. We could do that by paying $85 per ton for carbon dioxide stored. If we're doing that, then you have to ask, What would've happened without the subsidy? Would those coal-fired power plants have been displaced by either new gas generation or by new wind and solar? And really, in either of those cases, we might be better off for the climate with the counterfactual—without the subsidy being there for those plants. And so that's, I think, a pretty important point that may have been missed by a lot of other folks.

It's true that if I put carbon capture on a coal-fired power plant, I'm going to reduce a lot of carbon dioxide. The unit cost of removal is approximately constant between 80 and 95 percent removal, and 45Q requires 75 percent capture. So, those numbers are pretty high. It's good news that we are going to capture most carbon dioxide emissions.

But, again, the counterfactual is not, “What do we look like with the subsidy and capturing carbon dioxide from coal versus without the subsidy and not capturing carbon dioxide from coal?” It's, “What would otherwise have been there without the subsidy?” And for the climate, wind and solar would be better than even coal with, say, 85 percent or 90 percent removal. So, we really need to take that into account as we think about our modeling.

Another piece is that there's a dynamic to this, and I have touched on this a little bit. This subsidy alters these entry and exit incentives for power plants and industrial facilities in a way that favors carbon intensity over the long run. So, the richer that subsidy is, the more we might expect that we're shaping the fleet of power plants and industrial facilities in the United States in a direction that is exactly counter to what we would like to do as we decarbonize.

And so, those are both important points—both a static incentive, to be as dirty as possible and to increase your payments as much as you can, and the dynamic incentive that changes the nature of carbon intensity within the affected industries over time.

Daniel Raimi: Great. Got it. All right. So, you've already articulated a number of theoretical concerns with this policy design. In the paper, you articulate three specific flaws. What are those three specific concerns with 45Q?

Sheila Olmstead: The first two are related to what you just mentioned, that we could actually get, in a static sense, some increased emissions under 45Q, even with the high removal standard that the subsidy requires.

Think about this: if a coal-fired power plant has installed CCS, and it obtains this $85-per-ton tax credit, it would likely produce more electricity over the course of a year than it would without CCS, even during hours with low electricity prices, because the 45Q subsidy could make it profitable for the plant to generate even when it otherwise would not. So, again, it's not just, “Do I displace one plant with another? Do I have coal with CCS instead of wind and solar?” But, “How do those coal plants operate when they're receiving the subsidy?” They're likely to basically displace more generation by other resources, even in the short run, simply because it's profitable to run them more often when they have the subsidy than when they don't.

The second flaw is this dynamic problem of altering these entry and exit incentives. Polluting facilities that would have been unprofitable with a price on carbon or a mandate of some kind would actually earn a profit with an equivalent 45Q subsidy that's going to cover their carbon capture costs. And so, that could keep them in an industry that they would otherwise exit and likely be displaced by cleaner sources.

The third flaw is somewhat linked to these first two in that what we're doing when we pay $85 per ton for carbon dioxide storage is we're incentivizing more of the dirtiest production of whatever good or service we're talking about. And when we do that, a lot of that carbon dioxide is coming from the combustion of fossil fuels. This creates other emissions that we might worry a lot about, since they generate human health damages because of local air pollution.

There are a lot of good questions out there about how CCS is going to affect different pollutants. Some good news is that it will generally tend to reduce direct emissions of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter. But some bad news is that, when facilities adopt this post-combustion carbon capture technology, ammonia emissions may rise. For the most common post-combustion carbon capture technologies, we tend to see an increase, and sometimes a big increase, in ammonia emissions, and the result is an uptick in the secondary formation of fine particulate matter.

Some work that I've done with Andrew Waxman would suggest that, at least in the Gulf region on net for industrial facilities and for natural gas power plants, those human health damages on average are net negative. They're quite significant. They're still outweighed by the climate benefits, but it does suggest that there's potentially important (both from a distributional perspective and from a political and feasibility perspective) trade-offs between local damages and global benefits. And again, that gets more and more steep the more of that dirtier generation we incentivize through the per-ton subsidy.

Daniel Raimi: Right. Andrew was on the show talking about that paper maybe a year ago or something like that. I think it just reinforces the concerns that a lot of environmental justice organizations have about the deployment of carbon capture, at least with the specific technologies that we're talking about that can lead to increased ammonia around the plants.

Okay, so you've articulated lots of flaws with the policy design, but let's get constructive now. What are some recommendations that you offer for how to do this better?

Sheila Olmstead: That's a great question. So, I'm trying to follow the rules. So, my boss when I was at the Council of Economic Advisers in the Obama administration was Jason Furman. He was the chair at the time of the council and he would always say, “You don't always want to be the economist in the room that says, ‘How about a carbon tax?’” Because it's not very constructive.

But the first thing I have to say (forgive me, Jason) is, How about a carbon tax? Okay, so I will just get that out of the way. Tax carbon dioxide. If we did that, we would have prompt deployment of carbon capture where it's cost-effective. It would probably happen in some hard-to-decarbonize industries, places where that makes a lot of sense without these counterproductive dynamic effects on industry composition and possibly on emissions. Not likely, as you know, to be politically feasible. So, in order not to be laughed out of the room, I'll offer some other, maybe marginal, changes that I think would be really helpful and viable given the design of other subsidies, even in the OBBBA.

The first thing I would recommend is to correct that most significant downside to 45Q, which is the fact that it is awarded on a per-ton-of-carbon-dioxide basis and rewards carbon-intensive production. So, the subsidy amounts to something like $100 per megawatt-hour for a coal-fired power plant and $40 for a natural gas–fired power plant. That really makes very little sense from a climate perspective. And I'm not sure, even from a stimulating-industry perspective, or whatever the other prompts behind 45Q are, I'm not sure it makes sense from that perspective, either, and I'm not sure it was on purpose per se.

I think you could pay it per unit of production and restrict it to firms that are meeting strict emissions standards—a megawatt-hour for fossil-fired power plants, or something like that, rather than per unit of captured emissions. And that's consistent with other tax credit designs that we've seen out there—the 45V hydrogen tax credit, for example, which determines subsidy eligibility based on life-cycle emissions. So that's one, I think, viable and important potential fix. I wish we had seen that in the OBBBA, since it's a slight tweak—a redesign of the subsidy.

You could also imagine hybrid approaches. We could adjust the structure so that it doesn't favor carbon-intensive production, but then also price uncaptured carbon dioxide emissions. You see how I snuck that in, pricing emissions again?

But the idea would be to provide some carrots to adopting facilities. And so, you're paying firms to continue to reduce carbon dioxide, but if you're basically taxing the residual emissions, they're still getting the payment so that they can afford to deploy the technology. Though we're creating marked technology, we for sure would reduce carbon dioxide emissions if we did that. But it's more expensive for sure than a carbon price alone, and it doesn't get us out of the fiscal jam of having to pay forever.

Another thing that I think would be very sensible—it might even make more sense at this stage of the technology's history and deployment—would be to reduce the level of the current per-ton incentive. You wouldn't have to drive it to zero, but you could reduce it from $85 per ton to soften these counterproductive effects and maybe better contain fiscal costs over the long run. Then, pair that with an investment tax credit that would reduce the cost of installing CCS, setting up the storage, and so on. That would enable projects to recoup more of their costs up front, which would also potentially be helpful in this era of uncertainty about how long these kinds of subsidies are going to be around and whether they're going to persist long enough for the stream of payments to make up for the up-front investment.

Again, at this fairly early stage, it's not unreasonable to think that this might be a better design and might both expose firms to less uncertainty about future policy risk and the federal budget to less uncertainty about future fiscal risk of making these really large payments in perpetuity.

And I would just add that, in order to fix this problem with local air pollution trade-offs, that would have to be directly addressed in a different way—to either require water washes or acid washes or another technology to reduce ammonia emissions, or just simply have some kind of a standard so that we don't get these unintended increases in local human health damages.

Daniel Raimi: Great. This has been a fascinating conversation. I feel like we're going to be talking about carbon capture for a long time into the future, so it's great to get these conversations going and really think hard about how the policies need to be designed.

I'd love to ask you now, Sheila, the same question we ask all of our guests at the end of each episode, which is to recommend something that you think is great and that you think our listeners would enjoy. So, what's at the top of your literal or metaphorical reading stack?

Thinking of an electric vehicle? You’ve only got a week left before federal tax credits end, or you’ll have to pay full price.

The $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 credit for used electric vehicles (EV) ends Sept. 30. Steven Hershkowitz is the managing director for clean transportation for the Washington Department of Commerce. He expects the loss of this incentive will hurt EV sales in the short term.

“There is going to be a bit of a drag on the growth rate that we have seen,” Hershkowitz said. “We’ve already seen the market growth slow down in 2024 and into 2025.

Washington got rid of its tax exemption for EVs earlier this year. The legislature and Governor Ferguson are deciding to use those dollars elsewhere, but Herskowitz said the state’s commitment to electric vehicles and clean energy isn’t going away.

“The commitment is still there, and the prioritization is still there,” Herskowitz said. “These consumer-facing incentives that were quite popular are not, unfortunately, but there’s progress being made in terms of making sure that, hopefully, we can get the incentives back at some point.”

Climate Commitment Act to fund clean energy projects

The state will continue to use funds from the Climate Commitment Act to push clean energy and expand EV charging around the state.

Herskowitz believes electric vehicles are the future, and the demand will eventually return.

“The automakers know that this is where it’s going,” he said. “The global competition is further ahead in many major markets now internationally for EVs, and so this is where we’re going. It’s just about the pace at which we get there.”

The pace also includes finding ways to improve the pricing for electric vehicles.

The average price for a new EV is over $55,000. The average price for a new gas car is $49,000. You can certainly find new EVs for much less. Some only run about $30,000.

Now might be the time to get in, if you want to take advantage of the tax credit.

“It’s a good opportunity for people who have been considering getting an electric vehicle to really bring that consideration up to a higher level, perhaps go into dealerships, test drive, see what the prices are,” Herskowitz said. “This could be a good opportunity to get deals depending on which model you’re looking at.”

But expect a lot of company. You won’t be the only person trying to squeeze in before the deadline.

On Sept. 28, four six-man line crews and engineering personnel set out west from Horry Electric to Abbeville, a four-hour-plus ride in normal conditions.
Shortly after the storm hit, Horry Electric announced extended waiting times for new service requests, generator installation and outdoor light repairs so employees could focus on Helene restoration.","Editor’s note: This is the fourth installment in our series of stories looking back at Hurricane Helene’s impact on electric cooperatives. Read the first three stories here.

In 2019, in the shadow of Hurricane Dorian, Danny Shelley, the new CEO at Horry Electric Cooperative in coastal South Carolina, sat at dinner with mutual aid crews including Chad Stone, a line foreman at Little River Electric Cooperative.

“This hurricane is coming and I haven’t been in this job six months,” Stone recalled a concerned Shelley saying. “I just want to let you know I appreciate you.”

The words stuck with Stone. In September 2024, he was the new interim general manager at Little River Electric Cooperative when an unthinkable hurricane shook his inland co-op to the core. Teams from Horry Electric were there the next day and would eventually outnumber the entire Little River staff.

The situation was reversed. You’ll excuse the catch in the Stone’s voice.

“This is what they kept saying: ‘We are not leaving till every light is on.’ And the ones that went home didn’t want to. They said, ‘We’re coming back, Chad, we’re coming back. We’re not gonna leave y’all until every light is on.’”

A war movie

Off a beaten path in Abbeville, about 90 miles west of Columbia, Little River has a little more than 15,000 meters. It is a blueprint for the tightly knit, small-town co-op, where everybody knows each other, wears multiple hats and takes pride in treating people with respect. Stone went to school with Tricia Smith, member service and communications director; he and Mike Hall, vice president of engineering services, have each put in more than 30 years at the co-op, which has 32 full-time staffers.

“Most of us that work here knew each other at some point long before we came here. We already had friendships before we came,” Smith said. “When we come to work here, you are already part of the family because you’ve known that person forever.”

As Helene approached, the family needed outside help. Anticipating the damage high winds could do to the oak and pine forests across Little River’s four-county territory, Stone asked the South Carolina statewide association to locate extra crews, figuring that his team could take care of about half of any situation.

The red dots showed otherwise. They flashed on the outage map screen in Hall’s office, one on top of another, outage after outage, on the morning of Sept. 27, 2024, until just about all of the co-op’s members were in the dark.

“It reminded me of those war movies when people are in the Defense Department and looking at the map of all the places that are going to be bombed. And this was kind of a bombing in a way. That was what we felt like,” Stone said.

Anecdotal evidence backed it up. Stone had called all lineworkers into the office, but a three-foot-wide pine tree blocked one crew member’s return after he had responded to a car trapped under a power line.

“We started going out to try to get to him and we couldn’t. No road was passable that quickly. It took us probably 30 minutes to finally get around trees and go this road and that road to get to him,” Stone recalled.

Once located, Stone and the lineworker found themselves on opposite sides of the immovable tree. Stone had planned to pick up an order at Cold Springs Cafe. With his path stymied, the lineworker went in his place, only to find the store pushing water out the front door.

“That is when I really realized that it was going to be 15 days or so before we got things under control,” Stone said.

From here to there

The morning after Helene hit, Horry Electric and Little River were going in opposite directions at the same time with distressingly poor prognoses.

Conway-based Horry Electric quickly brushed off Helene’s impact, restoring power to about 9,000 members within a few hours. On Sept. 28, four six-man line crews and engineering personnel set out west from Horry Electric to Abbeville, a four-hour-plus ride in normal conditions. As they got to the city of Newberry, it was time to refuel the trucks. But that was not going to happen.

“Everything was dark, no power, not a store or station was available, so we said we’ll just go as far as we can,” said lineworker Chad Tyler. They drove another 50 miles. Fallen pine trees everywhere. A bucket truck could barely squeeze by on some roads.

“The entire system, north to south, was destroyed. So overall their damage was way more than what we’ve ever experienced here since I’ve been here,” said supervisor Franklin Williams. “It was two days before we could really see all the damage.”

As line crews tried to make sense of things, Little River confronted the need to feed and care for a rush of visitors that eventually would number about 180 lineworkers. A preorder of sandwiches and biscuits proved to be inadequate, and a small team of employees from the office headed east in four SUVs around 9 a.m. to buy groceries in nearby Greenwood even as Horry Electric crews headed toward them.

It was a disaster. There was nothing in Greenwood. Every store was closed, every road was blocked. Turn around, find another road, find another blockage. On their own, they headed to Columbia, about two hours away. At headquarters, Smith became concerned. “We had no communication. I couldn’t call them. I had no idea where they were. And I was like, ‘Why is it taking so long?’” It was nightfall when they finally pulled into the Little River lot.

“Columbia’s not a hard ride, but they said it was so bad they could not get there. It took three or three-and-a-half hours,” Smith said. “And they were exhausted and tired and emotional because it had taken them about 10 hours to go get some groceries. They brought all that food back in four SUVs and we were like, ‘Gosh, this will last for days.’ Our food was gone in two days.”

With the community’s help, the co-op started to find a groove. Retirees came in to help. A local restaurant with a food truck made some dinners. Headquarters became Grand Central Station South as donations of food and ice turned the office into a food pantry. A member donated a refrigerator. “We had so much food we didn’t know where to put it,” Smith said. Staffers worked from 4 a.m. to 11 p.m. so they’d be the first to arrive and the last to leave; Smith slept on an air mattress for nine nights.

A local doctor volunteered his house; that provided several comfortable beds for weary lineworkers. The fire station opened its doors, while other workers stayed at the house of Hall’s mother, a prominent educator who died three months before Helene. “We were buying cots and blow-up mattresses and blankets and pillows, putting them wherever we could,” Stone said. “I’m thankful that the crews didn’t know what was going on behind the scenes. All they knew was they had a place to go.”

Reinforcements arrive

Stone has a display of framed, color 8x10s of his heroes on one wall of his office. They’re not of sports stars or celebrities, though. They’re photographs of the dozens of line crews that came from points near and far to help Little River in its darkest hour.

Like Dave Monson, materials coordinator at Nishnabotna Valley REC in Harlan, Iowa, who traveled 1,100 miles as a part of a four-man team, waited out a three-hour traffic delay in Atlanta and labored 16 hours a day for 10 days in working his first hurricane.

“Being from Iowa, you don’t realize the amount of trees,” Monson said. “A lot of their structures just jump at angles through the trees. Almost every pole they had was at angles. The biggest thing I noticed right away, as we were driving into the hurricane damage, was how many trees were uprooted versus just broken off.”

At night, Monson and his partners ended up in a historic hotel in Abbeville. “Come to find out, after we were there a couple of days, it was haunted. We didn’t see anything but it was just kind of an interesting little story,” he said.

Out-of-state crews arriving a week after the storm found the challenges just as daunting as the first responders from Horry Electric. About 400 poles were down. A Dominion transmission outage presented a major complication in a portion of McCormick County, south of Abbeville. Little River couldn’t think about restoring power until that was fixed, which took nearly a week.

“If it wasn’t broken poles, it was wire on the ground or broken crossarms or some of that nature—everything from a three-phase pole to a service pole,” said crew foreman Jason McKinney, one of eight mutual aid lineworkers from Mecklenburg Electric Cooperative in Chase City, Virginia. “It was wild, all those roads with trees still across them.”

Little River was not sufficiently staffed to dispatch bird dogs, the term given a coordinator who appraises and supervises an area of repair. Lineworkers from Horry Electric stepped in and filled the vital role of leading and directing crews in the field.

“The help from the outside, it was just awesome. Maybe we could have done it without them, but it would have taken a lot longer and been a lot more painful,” Hall said. “We want to safely get everybody’s lights on as soon as we can. We like to take care of ourselves. But sometimes you need help.”

The Little River staff also wanted to make a good first impression on its visiting lineworkers. “I always say if you want respect from them, you better give them respect,” Hall said. From his experience on the ground during Hurricane Katrina, Stone knew the value of keeping a stockpile of supplies at hand. “We had headache medicine, we had socks, we had belts, we had everything. It was like a buffet every day and they appreciated that.”

Staffers, volunteers and employee spouses tended to lineworkers’ laundry every night. When the laundry came back in the morning, each basket was topped by a handwritten card or note from a child via a school or a church.

“There were notes everywhere with your lunches and everything from kids, members … I mean it was pretty amazing,” Monson said. “Almost every morning they had a devotional prayer for us. They really made it made you try to feel as close to home as you could.”

And Little River came full circle from the night when Shelley sat down with Stone and other crews at the onset of Hurricane Dorian. “They weren’t just a face; they were somebody we actually sat down with every night at dinner,” Smith said. “We would go from table to table or just greet them. I think that helped. It was like they were the same people from a whole different state.”

Chicken bog

Horry Electric did not let up by any means; in fact, it forestalled some of its work at home so its lineworkers could help Little River and other co-ops. Shortly after the storm hit, Horry Electric announced extended waiting times for new service requests, generator installation and outdoor light repairs so employees could focus on Helene restoration.

“They were not hooking up new connections as quickly as usual because so many of them were here and at other co-ops,” Stone said. “That was something their membership lost, but it was to help another community. That just really stuck out to me.”

Horry Electric’s communications team helped with social media posts and images sent by its lineworkers, and one of its retirees cooked a massive chicken bog as a celebration for all the good work done by the line crews.

“It’s rice, chicken, sausage, onions, a bunch of different seasonings. They brought it in these cast iron pots, just loads of them. That must be a tradition down there. It was new to me, but I tell you what, it was good,” said McKinney of Mecklenburg Electric. In fact, two members of his team cooked a chicken bog of their own when they returned home.

Stone also took note of a budding relationship between Horry Electric and the pastor of a small church in a troubled part of Little River’s territory. “They brought a huge trailer of supplies and were taking it to that community, and they dropped off supplies for that church to distribute. They had a horse trailer; it was that full. Then when they left here, they went straight to North Carolina to drop off more things. So they didn’t just help us. They were helping as many people as they could.”

That, he said, represents the best of the cooperative community and helps to explain the ties that bind Little River and Horry Electric.

“When their crews were leaving, there was a strong sense of gratitude and mutual respect shared between us,” Stone said. “That relationship we made with that co-op is like no other one you ever will see.”

It's also worth saying that the rush to falsely blame data centers as the single greatest contributing factor to rising electric bills is not benign.","Rarely, if ever, do our nation’s most complex public policy problems have a singular cause. Such is the case of rising power bills across the country, and the misleading narrative that electricity is becoming more costly solely because of the growth of the data center industry.

For starters, consider Georgia, where the plan to build multiple new data centers is actually keeping electricity prices steady – bucking the national trend of rising power rates. In fact, Georgia Power, the state’s regulated utility, just got approval to freeze its rates for three years. This rate freeze is possible because data centers are pumping vast sums into the state’s economy and creating sufficient revenues for Georgia Power to stabilize rates for everyone else.

It is also worth noting, that for all the talk about data center development driving up rates across the country, current data centers are actually clustered in a small handful of states like: Virginia, Texas, California, Illinois, Florida, and New York. But with the explosion of Artificial Intelligence, which will be powered by data centers, these facilities are rapidly expanding into new parts of the country.

However, a planned data center or one under construction does not impact current electric prices.

For example, Louisiana just approved what might one day be the largest data center on the planet for Meta (Facebook’s parent company). In the frenzied lead up to the vote by the state’s Public Service Commission to approve electric service for the facility, the false narrative of data centers and higher electric prices took hold. It led to inaccurate headlines like “Louisiana's electricity costs rise amid data center boom” even though the state only has a handful of data centers, with no impact on Louisiana's energy prices.

Also, in some states where electricity costs are going up, it’s because of external factors that have created roadblocks preventing new sources of generation. For example, PJM, the mid-Atlantic grid operator that encompasses 13 states and the District of Columbia, has become a regime incapable of bringing sufficient new electrons onto the grid.

Now, anger at PJM’s failings is bipartisan, with nine Governors – Democrats and Republicans – in the PJM footprint recently sending the grid operator a letter stating, among other things, that: “…PJM's multi-year inability to efficiently connect new resources to its grid and to engage in effective long-term transmission planning has deprived our states of thousands of jobs and billions of dollars in investment...”

PJM’s dysfunction means that its available capacity today is about the same as it was in 2024. So, it’s no surprise that with the rise of electric demand, including from data centers, that PJM’s electricity prices are skyrocketing to alarming levels and creating economic hardships for millions of customers.

Another factor driving up energy costs is that electrification means more Americans are plugging in their electric vehicles, converting to electric stoves, furnaces and water heaters, and using an ever-increasing number of electrified devices. Also, we cannot ignore the fact that parts of the country are experiencing weather extremes, forcing people to use large amounts of electricity to stay comfortable year-round. This drives up energy bills and customers are understandably frustrated.

Other reasons energy prices are rising is because after years of insufficient investment, states now need to spend billions on grid improvements like new transmission lines and distribution wires to people’s homes and businesses. Because of this long-term lack of investment in our electric grid, we are dealing with a series of electricity bottlenecks across the country that drives up electricity costs. Data centers, utilities, regulators and grid operators need to come together on this crisis, to ensure that electricity can move more efficiently across the nation.

It’s also worth noting, that because the construction of data centers is so appealing to states looking to create jobs and fill tax coffers, many will be built. But, again, that doesn’t mean they need to drive-up electricity rates. In Georgia, an additional reason they could implement a three-year rate freeze, was because the electric utility, working with state regulators and their data center customers, was able to create a special rate class for data centers to ensure they cover their share of grid maintenance, and those costs are not passed onto customers.

Other options to protect customers from rate hikes due to data center expansion, include using AI to coordinate with the utilities so that when demand spikes – say during a heatwave – those data centers can be throttled down to use less electricity. Data centers can also have their own generation onsite to reduce demand and lower electricity prices. If those data centers want to also use the electric grid as a backup, again, they must pay their fair share for maintaining that infrastructure. But with coordination and common sense, utilities and data centers can profit without exposing customers to risk.

It's also worth saying that the rush to falsely blame data centers as the single greatest contributing factor to rising electric bills is not benign. After all, if lawmakers and regulators seek to lower energy costs, by throwing up roadblocks to data center construction, they will be trying to solve a problem by addressing the wrong cause. In the end, the result will be poorly crafted public policy that hamstrings the tech sector and our economy but fails to help the American people cope with rising electricity costs.",https://assets.realclear.com/images/69/696241_6_.jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 13:03:05.748129

As the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine concluded just days ago, the 2009 Endangerment Finding was accurate when first decided and has been reinforced by even stronger evidence since then. The conclusion is now “beyond scientific dispute,” the National Academies panel concluded.

“The EPA grasps at straws to explain away its statutory obligation under the Clean Air Act and muddies the water with bogus science, but its rushed and opaque rulemaking process cannot hide that its proposed repeal is contrary to law, science, and basic common sense,” the environmental groups said in their 221-page comments.

NRDC was joined by the Center for Biological Diversity, Clean Air Task Force, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund, and Sierra Club in its filing. These groups are not alone. More than 600 witnesses testified over four days of public hearings in August – 97 percent of them opposing EPA’s proposals. And more than 350,000 individuals and organizations filed public comments, overwhelmingly against EPA’s retreat.

In addition to the substantive criticisms, the groups highlight how EPA has violated fundamental principles of administrative law: rushing its process; relying on a report prepared by a secret panel set up in an illegal manner; and failing to discuss its divergence from recommendations from the National Academies.

“EPA’s irrational and rushed process would leave Americans exposed to the worst climate impacts just as we are all seeing the evidence up close. Whether it’s flooding in North Carolina or heat waves in Phoenix, climate change is here and we need to tackle it,” said Meredith Hankins, federal climate legal director at NRDC. “What EPA is doing is clearly against the law, and if it follows through with this approach, we will see them in court.”

Separately, NRDC filed comments detailing why the EPA should also abandon its paired plans to eliminate carbon pollution standards for cars and trucks. Those comments detail how nixing those rules will mean higher costs for drivers, fewer American jobs, more asthma and heart disease, and greater amounts of harmful greenhouse gas emissions. Without even considering the health and climate lost benefits, repealing the rules would mean an additional $257 billion in fuel and maintenance costs for drivers over the next 25 years if realistic fuel prices are used.

Overall, repealing the standards would mean the loss of $3.38 trillion in net societal benefits by 2050, an analysis prepared for NRDC by the consulting firm ERM found.

“Clean car standards are a win-win proposition. They address the largest source of climate pollution, while also saving drivers on their fuel and maintenance costs,” said Kathy Harris, clean vehicles director at NRDC. “Repealing them might appease the oil industry, but the rest of us will suffer with more air pollution, more extreme storms and heat waves – and more trips to fill up at the gas station.”

Comments were due yesterday for EPA’s plan to rescind the endangerment finding and vehicle rules. EPA must now consider these comments before deciding if it will finalize its proposal. The agency has said it plans to do so by the end of the year.

Despite being the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity on the planet, nuclear energy is still largely excluded from voluntary carbon markets.
Investors are far more likely to back early-stage projects that can tap into carbon markets — especially when competing technologies already do.
Excluding nuclear from carbon markets undermines those goals by weakening the business case for investment in one of our most effective decarbonization tools.
Carbon markets without nuclear are incomplete.","Guido Núñez-Mujica is director of data science at the Anthropocene Institute.

As the world doubles down on net-zero targets, carbon markets have become a cornerstone of our global climate response. But their credibility hinges on one critical question: Are we truly valuing all forms of low-carbon energy? Right now, the answer is an emphatic no. And one glaring omission proves it: nuclear power.

Despite being the second-largest source of low-carbon electricity on the planet, nuclear energy is still largely excluded from voluntary carbon markets. Major standards like Verra and Gold Standard currently do not allow nuclear projects to generate carbon credits. This omission doesn’t just weaken the integrity of the system: it distorts the entire market.

Nuclear power prevents 430 million metric tons of CO2 emissions each year. That’s more than the annual emissions of Japan. Finland reduced their coal use by 70% after their latest nuclear reactor went online. Nuclear plants operate at high capacity, providing reliable baseload power that complements variable renewables like wind and solar. And yet, the enormous climate value of that contribution goes unrewarded — financially and symbolically.

To put it in perspective: while wind and solar generation often fluctuate with the weather and time of day, nuclear plants run more than 90% of the time. This makes them a crucial anchor in a clean energy grid — one that allows intermittent renewables to expand without sacrificing reliability or stability and able to replace fossil fuels 24/7.

This has serious implications. Around the world, aging nuclear reactors are being decommissioned without adequate replacements. In many cases, they are replaced by fossil fuels. When Germany shut down its nuclear fleet, coal use spiked. In California, emissions rose after San Onofre closed. In New York City, shutting down Indian Point led to such an increase in emissions that the Texas grid is cleaner now than the NYC grid. These are not isolated incidents: they are symptoms of a global financing problem.

Why does this happen? Because carbon markets create powerful economic signals. If nuclear can’t participate, it has no way to monetize the emissions it avoids. That makes it harder to keep existing plants running, and even harder to build new ones. Clean energy technologies like solar and wind benefit from both policy support and access to carbon finance. Nuclear, despite its proven performance, remains ineligible.

And this isn’t just about today’s technology. Tomorrow’s nuclear — small modular reactors, advanced molten salt systems, even solid-state fusion prototypes — is on the cusp of commercial readiness. These systems promise cleaner, safer and more flexible applications of nuclear power. But to scale, they need capital. Investors are far more likely to back early-stage projects that can tap into carbon markets — especially when competing technologies already do.

This sends the wrong message at precisely the wrong time.

The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change has repeatedly stated that we cannot meet 1.5°C goals without nuclear energy. The International Energy Agency agrees, calling for a doubling of nuclear capacity by 2050. Excluding nuclear from carbon markets undermines those goals by weakening the business case for investment in one of our most effective decarbonization tools.

It also risks undercutting energy sovereignty for countries that could be ready to decarbonize but can’t depend solely on weather-dependent renewables. Nations in the Global South, in particular, stand to benefit from new nuclear technologies that are resilient, dispatchable and space-efficient. By blocking nuclear from carbon finance, we are effectively restricting access to one of the most scalable decarbonization tools for emerging economies and pushing them towards cheaper and reliable fossil fuels. There is a reason why coal use has been skyrocketing for the last decade despite the apparent success of solar and wind.

This issue is especially urgent for emerging reactor developers. New designs — many of them smaller, safer and more flexible — are ready to support hard-to-decarbonize sectors like industrial heat, hydrogen and desalination. But without access to carbon credits, their financing models are incomplete. That’s not just a missed opportunity. It’s a structural roadblock to innovation that makes our climate goals much harder, maybe impossible, to meet.

Industrial emissions alone account for roughly one-quarter of global greenhouse gases. These are sectors like steel, cement, chemicals and heavy transport — sectors where renewables often fall short. High-temperature nuclear reactors could supply the heat, hydrogen and power these industries need, without emissions. But first, we have to level the playing field.

Of course, bringing nuclear into carbon markets should come with safeguards. We need transparency, rigorous life cycle accounting and alignment with international safety standards. But exclusion by default is not a safeguard — it’s a failure to reflect scientific consensus.

There’s also a fairness issue at play. Carbon credits are meant to reward avoided emissions. If a new solar project gets credits, why not a nuclear project that avoids the same — or more — CO₂? If we are serious about climate outcomes, if we truly think we are in a climate emergency, then the rules must reflect the physics of carbon, not political or historical bias.

We don’t have time to cling to outdated perceptions. The original rationale for excluding nuclear from voluntary markets was tied to fears about safety, weapons proliferation and public perception. But decades of evidence — and a new generation of safer technologies — have shifted the conversation. Even the European Union accepts nuclear power as green in their energy taxonomy. Climate science now overwhelmingly supports nuclear as part of the solution. Climate Policy must catch up.

Nuclear energy is not a panacea. But it is a powerful, proven and essential part of the climate solution. If we want carbon markets to work the way they are supposed to — if we want them to drive real decarbonization — we must ensure they recognize all forms of low-carbon energy. That includes nuclear.

On September 11th, 2001, America was changed forever. We remember the innocent lives that were taken, the brave first responders and volunteers who answered the call to help, and those who have sacrificed so much in the Global War on Terrorism.

My heart is with the families who lost loved ones on that tragic day. We also remember the 7,085 U.S. service fatalities and the 53,533 wounded that were a result of the Global War on Terrorism that ensued. May God bless them and their families who have to endure the pain of their loss.

We will never forget.

Key Votes

Passed Government Funding Package

The House has successfully voted to keep the government running and deliver on our agenda to put the American people first. In a perfect world, I do not support funding our government through continuing resolutions. However, Democrat obstruction has prevented Congress from passing appropriations bills under regular order as our Founding Fathers intended. Folks are tired of the partisan games that consume Washington and want our leaders to work together to meaningfully improve the lives of our constituents. Unfortunately, Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer wants to shut down the government to appease the far-left voices in his party, even if it hurts the American people. If Schumer and the Progressive Left want to shut down the government, it is solely on them. I supported the clean, bipartisan package to keep the government open and avert a harmful shutdown.

Passed FY26 National Defense Authorization Act

I applaud the passage of the National Defense Authorization Act for FY26, and I am especially proud to share that over $90 million for Camp Lejeune and $200 million for F-35 maintenance at FRC East were secured.

This package robustly modernizes our armed forces to prepare us against threats and solidifies our national security.

Through this legislation, Congress has restored lethality and the warrior ethos in the military, put in measures to restore security at America’s borders, created reforms to improve the quality of life of servicemembers, supported the Golden Dome, and so much more.

This package robustly funds and modernizes our armed forces to prepare us against threats abroad and bolsters our national security.

Passed H. Res. 719, Honoring the Life and Legacy of Charles “Charlie” James Kirk

It was a somber day in the House as we passed H. Res. 719, Honoring the Life and Legacy of Charles “Charlie” James Kirk. America, and the world for that matter, lost a great voice for reason and clarity in a time of vast confusion. It is imperative that we, as Americans, look towards peace. It is okay to disagree, but as Charlie always said, ""When people stop talking, that's when you get violence.""

Charlie was a strong believer in the power of faith, family, and for standing firm in your beliefs. He was a loving husband and father, inspiring many people through his work. He dared to engage with those who disagreed with him, even in hostile environments, with vigor and integrity in the pursuit of truth.

Our nation mourns the loss of a good man who fervently believed in the American experiment and dedicated his life to making a strong case to young individuals for continuing to keep faith in our institutions.

May his death not be in vain; may it evoke a turning point in our nation to engage with one another respectfully and with reverence for the dignity of life.

Passed H.R. 3579, the Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act

I am excited that H.R. 3579, the Veterans Readiness and Employment Program Integrity Act, has passed the House. As an original cosponsor of this bill, I recognize its importance in assisting veterans with service-connected disabilities.

This bill modifies the Veteran Readiness and Employment (VR&E) program of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that provides job training and employment-related services to veterans with service-connected disabilities. It requires the VA to report to Congress regarding the employment of veterans who participate in a vocational rehabilitation program under the VR&E program, including the annual wages of veterans before and after completion of a program. Additionally, the VA must annually publish the date on which a veteran requests a vocational rehabilitation program under the VR&E program and the date on which they first meet with a counselor as part of the program. Finally, the VA must seek to enter into a contract with a non-VA entity that has expertise in vocational rehabilitation to review, report, and provide recommendations on rehabilitation programs under the VR&E program.

This bipartisan bill will improve the support and opportunities that are available to veterans transitioning back to civilian life. I proudly supported it in the House Veterans’ Affairs Committee as it was being considered.

Introduced the Make America’s Youth Healthy Again Act

President Trump has reestablished the Presidential Fitness Test to promote the well-being of our nation’s youth, promote discipline, and encourage personal growth. That is why I introduced the Make America's Youth Healthy Again Act to codify this executive order into law.

Physical fitness is requisite to combating obesity, a major contributor to our nation’s life expectancy stagnation and mental health crisis. Daily movement improves brain health, lowers risk of disease, and physically active students receive better grades.

Introduced Resolution to Urge UN to End Special Treatment of China

For decades, China’s economy has grown to become the second largest in the world, fueling its ambition for global hegemony. Despite this status, China is still classified as a developing nation under multiple treaties and international organizations, allowing it to receive special privileges.

That is why I introduced a resolution calling on the House of Representatives to reject China’s classification and stand up for common sense.

Veterans National Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act Companion Legislation Introduced in Senate

America tragically loses 17 or more veterans to suicide each day. Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and traumatic brain injuries (TBIs) are far more prevalent among the veteran community. Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is a promising treatment option that offers a lifeline to veterans with PTSD/TBI on whom other treatments have failed.

That is why I introduced H.R. 1336, the Veterans National Traumatic Brain Injury Treatment Act, which passed the House Veterans' Affairs Committee.

I am proud to continue my fight, alongside Senator Tuberville, who introduced companion legislation in the United States Senate, to make this therapy accessible to all of America's veterans.

House Committee on Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee Hearing

The House Committee on Ways and Means Oversight Subcommittee held a hearing on tax-exempt hospital spending. Many nonprofit hospitals spent significant amounts of money while failing to provide adequate community benefit, as required by law.

While health care costs have increased over the last few years, President Trump and Congressional Republicans have been working to decrease wasteful spending through reducing burdensome regulations and allowing innovation to thrive.

Some institutions of medicine have lost sight of their core mission to provide accessible, quality, and affordable health care through discriminatory diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives. It is time for accountability.

House Administration Subcommittee on Elections Hearing

The House Administration Subcommittee on Elections held a hearing on maintaining election operations in the face of natural disasters. North Carolina is no stranger to natural disasters. Time and again, our state has endured the impact of damaging hurricanes and powerful weather systems that test our leaders, institutions, and infrastructure. We understand the risk hurricane season poses each year to our communities, including the disruptions to critical services and functions of society, and we prepare accordingly.

Chief among these responsibilities is maintaining the ability to administer safe and secure elections under the difficult circumstances that natural disasters create. Regardless of the challenges thrown our way, voters deserve to have confidence in the results of our elections. It’s vital that we maintain the operations of our country during all natural disasters that we may face.

In the aftermath of Hurricane Helene, there was significant uncertainty about how affected individuals would be able to participate in the 2024 election, including claims that the disaster would be leveraged for political purposes. It is a testament to the outstanding performance of the Board that not only were voters not disenfranchised by the disaster, but Western North Carolina led the state in turnout.

North Carolina continues to be a powerful role model in our country.

North Carolina Delegation Hurricane Helene Update

Nearly one year ago, Western North Carolina experienced the devastating impact of Hurricane Helene. It is our job to make sure WNC's ongoing recovery efforts are being funded. I joined members of the NC delegation, Governor Stein and his Staff, NC Emergency Management, and GROW NC to discuss the state of repair efforts and what Congress can do to continue assisting in restoration efforts.

Since the hurricane, we have been advocating as a bipartisan congressional delegation for continued funding and recovery support from the federal government. There is much funding that has been requested and approved by the Governor’s Office. However, due to federal bureaucracy, there have been delays with getting this funding to the local governments. I asked hard questions of our state leaders to uncover the cause of delays and determine how funding can be better distributed. It is essential that the entire North Carolina congressional delegation continue to work together to combat delays and deliver for the state.

Western North Carolina has been there for us in Eastern North Carolina through numerous natural disasters, and we will continue to be there for them now and in the years to come.

Meeting with the Austrian Vice-Chancellor

It was an honor to meet with the Austrian Vice-Chancellor, H.E. Andreas Babler, to discuss how the United States and Austria can cultivate a mutually beneficial relationship. The Central European nation is a democratic ally, friend, and economic partner. Our collaboration helps foster open dialogue and cooperation at an important time.

Meeting with White House Office of Science and Technology

I was able to meet with Michael Kratsios, Director of the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy, to discuss maintaining the United States’ global dominance in biopharmaceutical research and innovation.

During this pivotal time, we must ensure Americans can access safe and reliable medications at home and abroad.

Phone Call with the Ambassador of the Republic of Haiti to the US

I had the opportunity to speak with the Ambassador of the Republic of Haiti to the US, Lionel Delatour. It is in the interest of America to maintain peace and stability in the Caribbean.

We must reauthorize the HOPE/HELP Program to continue our fruitful partnership with Haiti and further develop our relationships with countries in our hemisphere.

Meeting with North Carolina Dermatologists

It was great to meet with dermatologists from North Carolina to discuss Medicare payment reform, the prior authorization process, and step therapy.

We must ensure insurance bureaucracy does not impede patients from receiving timely care.

Thank you for your vigorous advocacy on behalf of patients in our state!

Meeting with North Carolina Orthopedic Surgeons

I had the pleasure of meeting with several orthopedic surgeons from North Carolina to discuss Medicare payment reform, prior authorization reform, physician-led hospitals, and research funding.

The Trump Administration secured an industry pledge to fix the broken prior authorization system. Major insurance companies, which cover nearly 75% of American patients, have agreed to enact comprehensive reform to the prior authorization process to ensure at least 80% of prior authorization claims are adjudicated in real time by 2027. However, further oversight is needed to ensure progress is being made and other harmful insurer practices don’t arise.

As a physician for over 30 years, I have witnessed the ridiculous and ever-increasing obstructions caused by insurance companies to delay or deny care to patients. These bureaucratic hurdles end up hurting patients and those who care for them. Practices have had to hire many more staff to fight with insurance companies, which takes away from the time physicians should be spending with patients.

I have made reform a top priority of mine since coming to Congress. I am grateful we have so many surgeons advocating for our patients and ensuring bureaucracy does not affect timely care.

Helsinki Commission Hearing

The Helsinki Commission held a hearing regarding the country of Georgia’s government collaborating with U.S. adversaries, such as Russia, China, and Iran. Against the wishes of the Georgian people, the pro-Moscow government has engaged in authoritarian practices such as silencing independent media, jailing opposition leaders, and criminalizing civil society.

Action must be taken to hold the Georgian government accountable and to safeguard American interests.

Meeting with the National Community Pharmacists Association

I had the opportunity to speak with members of the National Community Pharmacists Association to discuss issues facing America’s pharmacies, including Pharmacy Benefit Managers (PBMs) who make drugs more expensive for patients.

NCPA was founded in 1898 and aims to be the voice of independent pharmacists so that they may compete in a free and fair marketplace through the American free enterprise system. They represent over 18,900 pharmacies that employ more than 205,000 individuals nationwide.

Congress must put patients and health care providers before insurers and their middlemen, who siphon precious health dollars off the backs of good folks in need of care.

The Hill: Employment in Healthcare Event

I had the opportunity to participate in a vibrant discussion on employer-sponsored health care. Quality health insurance should put patients first, providing access to timely care with price transparency.

We must protect the doctor-patient relationship, enhance the standard of care for all Americans, and preserve patients' dignity.

Meeting with the Association of Academic Physiatrists

It was great meeting with the Chairman of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation at East Carolina University and member of the Association of Academic Physiatrists. The AAP is a group of psychiatry professionals working to improve patient care for prevention, diagnosis, treatment, and rehabilitation.

I appreciate the efforts of the group to expand research and education for numerous conditions affecting patients.

Meeting with Former President Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia

Thank you to former President Salome Zourabichvili of Georgia for meeting with me to discuss the fight for freedom by the Georgian people who are resisting Russia. The Helsinki Commission held a hearing regarding Georgia’s pro-Putin government collaborating with Moscow.

I am glad to see that former President Zourabichvili is working with the Commission to foster communication and transparency.

Meeting with the Ambassador of Denmark to the USA

I had the opportunity to meet with the Ambassador of Denmark to the USA, Jesper Møller Sørensen. As founding members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), the United States and Denmark continue to have a strong and lasting friendship. This relationship helps advance U.S. foreign policy and national security initiatives while cultivating the defensive strength of the Nordic Region.

Meeting with Puerto Rico Representatives

Great to meet with leaders from Puerto Rico to discuss various health care issues facing Americans living on the island.

We discussed H.R. 3042, the Medical Manufacturing, Economic Development, and Sustainability (MMEDS) Act of 2025, which would incentivize medical manufacturing in economically distressed areas of the US and the effects of this bill on Puerto Rico, if passed.

Additionally, we discussed the Medicaid block grant that is set to expire in 2027 and Medicare Advantage financing. Medicare Advantage benchmark rates in Puerto Rico are significantly lower than in the mainland, leading to lower plan quality, reduced benefits, and provider attrition.

We must stand up for Puerto Rican Americans and ensure they have access to quality care.

Meeting with the Epilepsies Action Network

I enjoyed meeting with Scott Copeland, who co-founded the Epilepsies Action Network with his wife after their son was diagnosed with epilepsy at a young age. Scott and his team have been vigorously advocating for the epilepsy community by promoting awareness, funding, and collaborating with various stakeholders to improve the lives of those living with epilepsy.

There are currently 3.4 million individuals living with active epilepsy in the U.S., and 1 in 26 individuals will develop epilepsy at some point in their lives. Even with its prevalence, epilepsy is the only common neurological disorder without a National Plan. Once passed by Congress and signed into law by the president, a National Plan would reduce epilepsy-related mortality, improve prevention, diagnosis, and treatment of epilepsies, increase research, and decrease socioeconomic, racial, and geographical disparities in healthcare.",http://static1.squarespace.com/static/5af308849d5abbb875f94e0f/5af308c30e2e72435caef952/68d1345396b3861f20af5576/1758620100427/NCPN+Template+Post+%2813%29.png?format=1500w,N,,2025-09-23 13:02:26.138130

Trump campaigned on a pledge to unleash American energy, and he has already signed multiple executive actions aimed at bolstering the nation’s nuclear power in particular. Energy groups have taken notice, and Trump’s efforts appear to have trickled into the state level, with places like New York embracing nuclear energy.

“President Trump has flipped the script on nuclear,” Jason Isaac, CEO of the American Energy Institute, said in a statement to The Hill.

“This is energy dominance in action, delivering more domestic fuel, more reliable 24/7 power, and downward pressure on electricity costs for families and industry,” Isaac added.

New York Gov. Kathy Hochul (D) in June directed the New York Power Authority (NYPA) to develop at least one new nuclear plant to provide at least a gigawatt of power. In the announcement, Hochul touted the need to “embrace an energy policy of abundance that centers on energy independence.”

Earlier this month, California-based company Oklo Inc. announced plans to build three modular nuclear reactors in Tennessee as part of a $1.7 billion facility that will convert nuclear waste into fuel.

The announcements follow actions taken by the Trump administration to increase the nation’s nuclear energy capacity.

In May, Trump signed executive orders aimed at quadrupling the nation’s nuclear power, including by cutting back on health and environmental considerations.

He also issued an order in May stating the government “must utilize its full authority to accelerate the secure and responsible development, demonstration, deployment, and export of United States designed advanced nuclear technologies to bolster readiness and enhance American technological superiority.”

“President Trump, along with those who he’s brought into his administration, has shifted the paradigm away from unfounded fear and alarmism on climate and energy, to new opportunities for American energy and its benefits for Americans,” Steve Milloy, senior policy fellow at the Energy and Environment Legal Institute, said in a statement to The Hill.

“Embracing safe, affordable nuclear energy is just one aspect of this change but it’s noteworthy because it demonstrates the declining influence of organizations whose objective has been to keep our leaders and the public in a perpetual state of fear; those days are over,” Milloy added.

Trump will be in New York City on Tuesday to attend events for the United Nations General Assembly. His presence will coincide with Climate Week NYC, an annual gathering of business, government and environmental leaders to discuss investments in clean technology and other ways to combat climate change.

Confirmed speakers for the climate event include European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, Kenyan President William Ruto and top energy officials from Denmark, Australia and other nations.

“This is a critical year for climate action. It’s inspiring to see businesses, governments, and the wider climate community stepping up to show the world that global climate action continues,” Helen Clarkson, CEO of Climate Group, said in a statement.

“Our theme this year is Power On, because we need to stay focused, ambitious, and keep delivering progress,” Clarkson said. “New York City has really lived up to that spirit this year and it’s shaping up to be the most impactful Climate Week NYC we’ve ever held.”",https://thehill.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Trump_911_Pentagon.jpg?w=1280,N,,2025-09-23 15:01:22.121398

Within the automotive aftermarket, AutoZone's performance offers a mixed bag.
The sustained demand in the automotive aftermarket, evidenced by strong same-store sales growth across both DIY and DIFM segments, reinforces the industry's often-cited resilience.","AutoZone (NYSE: AZO), the automotive aftermarket retail giant, unveiled its fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 results on September 23, 2025, presenting a nuanced picture of consumer spending in a dynamic economic landscape. While the company largely met revenue expectations with robust sales growth, a notable miss on earnings per share (EPS) sent ripples through the market, causing an immediate dip in the company's stock price. This divergence highlights the ongoing pressures on profitability within the retail sector, even as demand for essential automotive parts and services remains resilient.

The earnings report serves as a critical barometer for the health of the automotive aftermarket, an industry often seen as recession-resistant due to the necessity of vehicle maintenance. AutoZone's performance, particularly its ability to drive sales across both its Do-It-Yourself (DIY) and Do-It-For-Me (DIFM) segments, offers valuable insights into how consumers are prioritizing vehicle upkeep amidst evolving economic conditions. The market's reaction underscores the importance of bottom-line performance in investor sentiment, even when top-line figures appear strong.

AutoZone's Q4 Performance: A Closer Look at What Happened and Why It Matters

On Tuesday, September 23, 2025, AutoZone (NYSE: AZO) reported diluted earnings per share of $48.71 for its fiscal fourth quarter, which concluded on August 30, 2025. This figure fell short of the consensus analyst expectation of $50.86, representing a miss of approximately $2.01 per share. Despite the EPS shortfall, the company's net sales reached $6.24 billion, aligning closely with analyst forecasts that hovered around the $6.24 billion to $6.25 billion mark. When adjusted for an extra week in the prior year's quarter, sales growth was even more impressive at 6.9%.

The immediate aftermath saw AutoZone's stock price experience a negative reaction, declining by over 4% initially and settling down by 3.2% in early trading. This market response signals that while investors appreciate top-line growth, profitability remains a paramount concern. The primary culprit for the EPS miss and margin pressure was an $80 million non-cash LIFO (Last-In, First-Out) charge, which significantly impacted the gross profit margin, leading to a 98-basis point decline to 51.5%. Additionally, operating expenses increased to 32.4% of sales, driven by strategic investments in growth initiatives.

These results matter because they provide a clear window into the current state of the automotive aftermarket. The solid 5.1% increase in total company same-store sales, with domestic same-store sales up 4.8%, indicates robust consumer demand for automotive parts and accessories. Both the DIY and commercial (DIFM) segments demonstrated steady improvement throughout the quarter, with pre-earnings analyst projections suggesting DIFM growth at 11% and DIY growth at 1.5%. This dual-channel strength underscores the ongoing necessity of vehicle maintenance and repair, whether consumers choose to perform the work themselves or rely on professionals.

The increased inventory by 14.1% year-over-year also signals AutoZone's commitment to supporting its growth initiatives and ensuring product availability. However, the LIFO charge and increased operating expenses highlight the challenges retailers face in maintaining profitability amidst inflationary pressures and significant investments. The ability of companies like AutoZone to manage these costs while continuing to grow market share will be a key determinant of future success.

Market Implications: Winners, Losers, and Shifting Dynamics

AutoZone's (NYSE: AZO) Q4 results are likely to send varied signals across the broader market, particularly within the retail and automotive sectors. The immediate impact on AZO's stock, with its initial decline, suggests that investors are highly sensitive to profitability metrics, even when sales figures are strong. This could lead to increased scrutiny on other retail companies reporting earnings, prompting a closer look at their gross margins and operating expenses. Companies that can demonstrate efficient cost management alongside revenue growth may see their valuations strengthen, while those facing similar margin pressures could experience investor skepticism.

Within the automotive aftermarket, AutoZone's performance offers a mixed bag. The robust same-store sales growth, particularly in the DIFM segment, bodes well for other players in the commercial auto parts supply chain, such as distributors and smaller independent repair shops. These entities could benefit from the sustained demand for professional automotive services. However, the gross margin contraction faced by AutoZone due to LIFO charges might signal broader inflationary pressures on inventory costs that could affect the entire industry. Competitors like O'Reilly Automotive (NASDAQ: ORLY) and Advance Auto Parts (NYSE: AAP) will be closely watched to see if they experience similar cost pressures or if their operational efficiencies allow them to better navigate these challenges.

The emphasis on aggressive store expansion and investment in the Mega-Hub network by AutoZone indicates a commitment to gaining market share. This strategic move could intensify competition within the aftermarket, potentially putting pressure on smaller, less capitalized players. Companies with strong supply chain management and efficient distribution networks may emerge as winners, while those unable to scale or adapt to increased competition could face headwinds. Furthermore, the continued strength of both DIY and DIFM segments suggests that consumers are maintaining their vehicles, which is a positive for manufacturers of automotive parts and components, as well as diagnostic tools and equipment.

Conversely, companies heavily reliant on discretionary consumer spending, especially those outside of essential services like auto maintenance, might find the market's focus on profitability more challenging. The AutoZone report serves as a reminder that even in sectors with steady demand, cost control and margin protection are paramount for investor confidence. This could lead to a broader market trend of favoring companies with strong fundamentals and proven abilities to convert revenue into healthy profits, potentially impacting valuations across various consumer-facing industries.

Broader Implications: Navigating Macroeconomic Headwinds and Industry Evolution

AutoZone's (NYSE: AZO) recent quarterly results extend beyond mere financial figures, offering a deeper understanding of broader industry trends and macroeconomic undercurrents. The sustained demand in the automotive aftermarket, evidenced by strong same-store sales growth across both DIY and DIFM segments, reinforces the industry's often-cited resilience. In an environment where consumers might be tightening their belts on discretionary purchases, vehicle maintenance remains a non-negotiable expense, positioning the aftermarket as a relatively stable sector. This trend suggests that consumers are opting to repair and maintain existing vehicles rather than purchasing new ones, a common behavior during periods of economic uncertainty or higher interest rates.

The challenges to profitability, particularly the impact of the LIFO charge and increased operating expenses, highlight the pervasive issue of inflation and supply chain complexities affecting retailers globally. AutoZone's experience is not isolated; many businesses are grappling with rising input costs and the need to invest in infrastructure and technology to maintain competitiveness. This situation could lead to further consolidation within the automotive aftermarket as smaller players struggle to absorb these costs, while larger entities with greater economies of scale and purchasing power, like AutoZone, continue to expand their footprint. The company's aggressive store expansion and investment in its Mega-Hub network underscore a strategic pivot towards enhancing efficiency and inventory management to mitigate these pressures.

Moreover, the report sheds light on the evolving landscape of automotive service and parts distribution. The continued strength of the DIFM segment, catering to professional mechanics and repair shops, indicates a growing reliance on expert services. This trend could be driven by the increasing complexity of modern vehicles, which often require specialized tools and diagnostic equipment, making DIY repairs more challenging for the average consumer. For manufacturers of advanced automotive components and diagnostic software, this shift presents significant opportunities. Conversely, traditional DIY parts retailers may need to further enhance their service offerings and digital capabilities to retain their customer base.

Historically, the automotive aftermarket has demonstrated counter-cyclical tendencies, performing well when the broader economy faces headwinds. AutoZone's Q4 results largely align with this historical pattern, showcasing demand for essential services even as profitability faces external pressures. Regulatory implications could also emerge, particularly concerning supply chain resilience and pricing transparency, as governments and consumers become more attuned to the factors influencing product availability and cost. The industry's ability to adapt to these evolving dynamics, from technological advancements in vehicles to shifting consumer preferences and economic realities, will define its trajectory in the coming years.

What Comes Next: Strategic Pivots and Market Opportunities

Looking ahead, AutoZone's (NYSE: AZO) Q4 2025 earnings report sets the stage for several key areas that investors, industry observers, and consumers should closely monitor. In the short term, the market will be keenly watching how AutoZone manages its gross margins and operating expenses in the coming quarters. The $80 million LIFO charge was a significant factor in the EPS miss, and the effectiveness of the company's strategies to mitigate such cost pressures will be crucial. Any signs of improved margin performance or continued investment in cost-saving technologies could positively influence investor sentiment and potentially lead to a stock price recovery.

From a long-term perspective, AutoZone's aggressive store expansion strategy and continued investment in its Mega-Hub network will be pivotal. CEO Phil Daniele's commitment to ""aggresively open stores in the new year"" to grow market share indicates a clear strategic direction. The success of this expansion will depend on effective site selection, efficient supply chain integration, and the ability to capture new customers in both DIY and DIFM segments. Market opportunities may emerge for companies that can provide complementary services or technologies to support this expansion, such as logistics providers or software solutions for inventory management and customer relationship management.

Potential strategic pivots for AutoZone might include further diversification of its product offerings, an intensified focus on digital sales channels, or even strategic acquisitions to bolster its market position and service capabilities. The balance between catering to the traditional DIY customer and the growing DIFM professional will remain a delicate but critical act. Companies that can effectively bridge this gap, offering tailored solutions and superior customer experiences for both segments, are likely to thrive.

Emerging challenges could include sustained inflationary pressures, potential shifts in consumer vehicle ownership patterns (e.g., increased adoption of electric vehicles requiring different parts and maintenance), and intensified competition from online retailers. Investors should pay close attention to AutoZone's guidance on future capital expenditures, inventory management strategies, and any commentary on its long-term vision for navigating these evolving market dynamics. The coming quarters will offer further clarity on whether AutoZone can translate its strong sales performance into sustainable profitability and continued market leadership.

Conclusion: A Resilient Market Faces Profitability Hurdles

AutoZone's (NYSE: AZO) fiscal fourth-quarter 2025 earnings report paints a compelling picture of a resilient automotive aftermarket sector grappling with persistent profitability challenges. The robust sales growth, particularly the strength in both the DIY and DIFM segments, underscores the non-discretionary nature of vehicle maintenance and repair, positioning the industry as a bedrock of consumer spending even amidst economic uncertainties. This demand highlights the enduring need for reliable transportation and consumers' willingness to invest in their existing vehicles.

However, the notable miss on earnings per share, primarily driven by a significant LIFO charge and increased operating expenses, serves as a stark reminder of the broader macroeconomic pressures impacting retailers. Inflationary costs, supply chain complexities, and the necessity of strategic investments for future growth are collectively squeezing margins across the industry. AutoZone's immediate stock price reaction reflects investor sensitivity to these profitability hurdles, indicating that top-line growth alone is not sufficient to satisfy market expectations.

Moving forward, the market will closely monitor AutoZone's ability to effectively manage its cost structure while continuing its aggressive expansion plans. The company's strategic focus on growing market share through new store openings and enhancing its Mega-Hub network is a clear commitment to long-term growth, but the execution of these initiatives will be critical. Investors should watch for improvements in gross margins, efficient inventory management, and the successful integration of new operational efficiencies.",https://wwwcache.wral.com/favicons/favicon-48x48.png,N,,2025-09-23 12:09:27.635459

pause—the abeyance placed on the proceedings, so that the lawsuit could move forward and be adjudicated.
However, the agency did in that case determine that it would leave undisturbed the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, the same two PFAS listed as hazardous substances in the CERCLA final rule.
Although it still remains to be seen whether either rule will survive judicial review, it appears that both will remain effective throughout the course of litigation.","Responding to the D.C. Circuit’s deadline to inform the court how it wishes to proceed in litigation challenging the agency’s listing of two types of per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) as hazardous substances under Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA), the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) stood behind its rule. In a September 17, 2025 filing, EPA told the court that the Trump administration had completed its review and would ultimately keep the Biden-era CERCLA final rule in place. The agency also requested that the court remove—i.e. pause—the abeyance placed on the proceedings, so that the lawsuit could move forward and be adjudicated.

In an unusual move, EPA’s motion was accompanied by a declaration signed by John Evans, the principal deputy assistant administrator in the Office of Land and Emergency Management (OLEM), hinting that the administration would still seek to alter the regulatory framework for PFAS under CERCLA, but would do so instead through congressional engagement to shield liability for “passive receivers”—those entities that do not directly manufacture or generate PFAS but receive it through feedstocks, products, or waste. In a press release issued the same day as the filing, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin doubled down on requests for congressional engagement, while also announcing EPA’s intent to develop a “CERCLA section 102(a) Framework Rule” aimed at codifying a “uniform approach to guide future hazardous substance designations, including how the agency will consider the costs of proposed designations.”

The decision to defend the rule came as a surprise to some, as just last week, EPA told the same court, in a separate proceeding, that it would abandon support for Biden-era regulations setting nation-wide maximum contaminant levels (MCLs) for four types of PFAS under the Safe Drinking Water Act. However, the agency did in that case determine that it would leave undisturbed the MCLs for PFOA and PFOS, the same two PFAS listed as hazardous substances in the CERCLA final rule. EPA also plans to extend the deadline for compliance with the PFOA and PFOS MCLs by an additional two years (from 2019 to 2031) as originally proposed under the Biden Administration.

Although it still remains to be seen whether either rule will survive judicial review, it appears that both will remain effective throughout the course of litigation. The Trump EPA has now confirmed that it intends to federally regulate at least some types of PFAS, and entities that suspect the presence of PFOA or PFOS in their wastewater, outfalls, or operations should begin preparing for compliance and potential CERCLA response actions.",https://www.crowell.com/a/web/r7g3u7E89nDi6HjG6hoBL8/aPY2QC/2025-09-22_the_other_pfas_shoe_drops.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:07:03.371719

At the company’s last earnings call in July, it shared that this model would be delayed since Tesla was concentrating on increasing Model Y deliveries before US tax credits ran out.

Now, a new software update has revealed key details about the cheaper model, hinting at a no-frills design that cuts costs. According to Tesla app code expert, greentheonly, who shared on X, several of the changes have been spotted.

This includes confirms that it will have a new outer design, code-named E41 and no glass roof and smaller 18-inch wheels with tyre pressure monitoring systems removed, on the outside.

There are also hints that the powered mirrors will be removed. Other changes include removing the heater from the reversing camera.

On the inside, the changes go a bit further with no scrren in the rear, a simpler audio system labelled in the code as “Essential”, a basic fibreglass headliner, less interior lights, simpler seat controls and removal of puddle lights found on Tesla’s other models.

Previously, a test vehicle was seen, indicating some of these changes that were expected when this goes into production before the end of the year.

Other signs that match what’s been shared in the software now are that the exterior and interior are shown in close-ups, indicating a solid roof rather than the panoramic glass found in all of Tesla’s current models, including the well-liked Model 3 and Model Y.

The front and back seats are now made of cloth on the interior, which means they won’t have the ventilation that comes with all current models.

The front and rear have also undergone styling changes to the outer design. The lightbars found on the new Model Y will likely not be included.

Also, it seems that the new model will be shorter than the typical Tesla Model Y, which is roughly 4.8 meters long.

On the design of the upcoming model, we learned more about the car’s styling from Elon Musk, Tesla’s CEO, response to a question from a Tesla investor during the last company earnings call..

Musk replied by jokingly saying that the more affordable model will look like the Model Y.

With several more reasonably priced options from rivals already on the market and about to be released in the coming months, a model in the lineup that comes under $58,900 starting price of Tesla’s Model Y may be the car that helps the company see strong growth locally and in other key markets around the world..

A cheaper model has been in the works for a while, with multiple mentions of this model at the company earnings calls over the last few quarters, including the last one where it was announced that it would be in Q4 instead of the end of Q2.

Without the federal tax credit or California’s own rebates, however, many potential EV buyers may now consider delaying their purchase or opting for a vehicle with an internal-combustion engine.
Federal EV Tax Credit Can Still Be Claimed After Deadline Despite the federal EV tax credit deadline now only days away, it’s not too late to take advantage.
Unsurprisingly, EV sales have spiked in the lead-up to the deadline.","Time is running out for anyone hoping to take advantage of the federal electric vehicle tax credit and snag a bargain like a discounted Chevrolet Equinox EV, as the generous incentive program is set to expire on September 30 under the “One Big Beautiful Bill” signed into law by President Donald Trump in July. The looming deadline applies nationwide, including in California, where drivers had been assured by Governor Gavin Newsom that the state would step in with its own rebate program if the federal credit were eliminated.

However, despite his earlier pledge, Newsom has announced he's now backtracking on it. The governor, who originally made the promise in November 2024, told reporters in San Francisco last week that California will not be reviving its own EV rebate program, which ended in 2023. He said California simply didn't have the funding to match the federal tax credit, which offers up to $7,500 towards new EVs and up to $4,000 towards used models, SFGate reported.

California Still Open To Reviving Rebate Program

Newsom said that the funding the state does have will be directed toward expanding EV infrastructure, and pointed to the tens of thousands of public charging stations already built as proof of California’s commitment to the clean energy transition. He also added that California's rebate program could be revived if officials agree to use funds from the state's separate cap and trade program, which raises hundreds of millions of dollars each year.

For many, the expectation was that California – long a leader in green policy – would shield residents from the loss of a popular incentive that has helped drive EV adoption. Last year, EV sales represented roughly one out of every five new vehicles sold in the state, reaching nearly 380,000 units in total. Without the federal tax credit or California’s own rebates, however, many potential EV buyers may now consider delaying their purchase or opting for a vehicle with an internal-combustion engine.

Newsom, during his speech to reporters last week, also brought up the issue of automakers, specifically targeting Detroit companies like General Motors and its CEO, Mary Barra, of spearheading efforts in Congress to block the state’s planned 2035 ban on new ICE vehicle sales. The California Air Resources Board (CARB) adopted the ban in 2022, but in May of this year, the US Senate voted to block the rule, and President Trump signed the resolution into law in June, effectively halting the state’s mandate.

Federal EV Tax Credit Can Still Be Claimed After Deadline

Despite the federal EV tax credit deadline now only days away, it’s not too late to take advantage. A loophole allows buyers to still qualify, even if their EV is delivered well after the deadline. Anyone who has a written binding sales contract in place and has made at least a single payment before Sept. 30 will remain entitled to claim the credit upon eventual delivery.

Unsurprisingly, EV sales have spiked in the lead-up to the deadline. Kelley Blue Book reported that July sales jumped 26.4% compared to the previous month, with models like the Tesla Model Y and Model 3 topping the charts, while the Chevrolet Equinox EV, Honda Prologue, and Hyundai Ioniq 5 also cracked the top five. Of course, a sharp decline in sales is likely in October and beyond, as the looming cutoff has clearly pulled demand forward.",https://static0.carbuzzimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/tesla-model-y-charging.png?w=1600&h=900&fit=crop,N,,2025-09-23 12:07:39.450558

(TNS)

Katie Larsell and Michael Schilmoeller adore the electric vehicle they bought in late August—a full month before the federal $7,500 tax credit is set to expire on Sept. 30—but not the big headache that came with it.

The Northeast Portland couple said they had to go to great lengths to ensure that they secured the tax credit that is supposed to come with each purchase of a qualifying EV. That’s because, they say, the Gresham dealership they patronized didn’t file the required paperwork with the IRS.

“I really had to push,” Larsell told The Oregonian/OregonLive, adding that the salesperson told her the paperwork was unnecessary. “The way this went, it was almost like they didn’t know about it.”

Larsell and Schilmoeller were unlucky to fall into a hole that other buyers of electric vehicles in Oregon and across the nation have also found themselves in. The National Auto Dealers Association earlier this year warned dealerships about this paperwork pitfall. The IRS, too, has issued instructions for two consecutive years as it has extended the window for dealerships to file paperwork that’s required so car buyers don’t miss out on the tax credit.

But apparently the same mistake keeps happening, again and again.

Larsell, a former Parkrose School Board member and current community minister at Eastrose Fellowship Unitarian Universalist, was worried enough that others might encounter the same troubles that she called The Oregonian/OregonLive to share her experience.

She also contacted friends who she knew bought the same car, a Kia EV6, from a different dealership last spring. Those friends—Gresham residents Richard Curtis and Jan Apland-Curtis—told The Oregonian/OregonLive that thanks to Larsell, they also discovered their dealership had failed to file the proper paperwork, putting them at risk of losing out on their $7,500 as well.

The couple said they spent a few months researching the purchase of a new EV. When they settled on a model, they figured they had everything they needed to get their $7,500 tax credit come tax filing season in early 2026. Little did they know, they would have had an unpleasant suprise waiting for them, if Larsell hadn’t reached out.

“We were blindsided,” Curtis said. “We said, ‘No, that can’t be right.’”

But it was.

Here’s what happened in each of their cases and how you, if you’re one of Oregon’s 2025 buyers of an electric vehicle, can avoid this bombshell before filing your taxes early next year:

According to the IRS, all buyers of new EVs qualify for the $7,500 tax credit only after the dealership gives them a “time-of-sale report” and a “copy of confirmation” showing that the dealership successfully entered the time-of-sale report into an IRS portal. (The same process is required for a customer to receive a $4,000 tax credit upon buying a used EV from a dealer.)

Since Jan. 1, 2024, the IRS has been requiring dealerships to complete these tasks within three days of the sale, according to step-by-step rules laid out on the IRS’s website. But because so many dealerships haven’t followed through, the IRS told The Oregonian/OregonLive that it has allowed for exceptions to the three-day time limit as long as dealerships provide a reason for blowing past it.

That’s key, because that’s what saved both couples—Larsell and Schilmoeller, and Curtis and Apland-Curtis—from missing out on the federal credit.

Larsell said when she and her husband bought their Kia on Aug. 26, they had no problem securing the state’s $2,500 EV rebate because the dealership immediately applied it to the sale price of her car. (The state EV rebate expired Sept. 8.)

But when it came to the $7,500 federal tax credit, Larsell said she told the salesperson at Weston Kia in Gresham that she thought they needed “some sort of report” in order to claim the credit. Larsell said the salesperson assured her that they didn’t and that they’d get their tax credit when filing their 2025 taxes next year.

Larsell said it wasn’t until the next week that she revisited the IRS website, realized the report was called a “time-of-sale report” and asked Schilmoeller to give her the stack of paperwork they’d taken home from the dealership. The report wasn’t there. And the IRS’ mandatory three-day time limit had already passed.

“The fact that this was an IRS thing made my heart sink,” Larsell said.

Larsell said she called the dealership and again the salesperson thought it was a non-issue. But she pressed: “I said, ‘This is really serious.’ I kind of went into a little rant.” Eventually, Larsell said, she was dealing with Jacob Weston, vice president of operations and grandson of the 50-year-old dealership’s founder. It wasn’t until 16 days after Larsell and her husband bought the EV that they finally had the time-of-sale report in hand, Larsell said.

Weston declined to talk to The Oregonian/OregonLive about his interactions with Larsell. That includes whether she was a customer, though she provided The Oregonian/OregonLive with documentation that she purchased her Kia EV6 there. Specifically, Weston declined to answer questions about whether the dealership had failed to report the sale to the IRS and give Larsell a time-of-sale report until she asked for one.

“I’m not going to discuss customer interactions with anybody, we value our customer privacy. We’d extend you the same courtesy obviously if you were a customer of ours,” Weston told The Oregonian/OregonLive.

But Weston did say, in general, his company has known since the tax credit began what it needed to do to ensure that customers get their $7,500 federal tax credits. At times, he said, he has encountered delays on the IRS’s side in accepting the information his dealership provided.

In the case of Curtis and Apland-Curtis, after Larsell told them about her troubles, they contacted the dealership where they purchased their EV—Power Kia in Salem—to ask for their time-of-sale report and confirmation. After a few weeks of texts, emails and a phone call—and a few non-responses—Curtis said they finally got theirs in hand, too, last week.

“It’s just maddening,” Curtis said.

Power Kia’s general manager didn’t respond to a phone message and an email from The Oregonian/OregonLive seeking comment.

Apland-Curtis said she hates to think of how many other recent EV buyers might be in for a shock.

“We think this is happening to a lot of people, and it doesn’t feel fair to the consumer,” Apland-Curtis said.

NV Energy’s score reveals the utility has begun to lag in its clean energy transition.
According to NV Energy’s latest energy plans, the utility will trade one expensive, polluting fossil fuel for another by converting the North Valmy coal plant to gas rather than an affordable, renewable source like solar.
In addition to converting Valmy, the utility also plans to build two new gas units at the site.
“NV Energy has taken a step backwards, binding Nevadans to costly fossil fuels for years to come,” said Olivia Tanager, Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter Director.","RENO, Nev. — Today, Sierra Club released its fifth annual Dirty Truth Report, which grades 75 utilities across the country on their plans to retire coal plants by 2030, not build new gas plants through 2035, and transition to clean energy through 2035. This year, Berkshire Hathaway-owned NV Energy received a B, a grade that has decreased over the last two years.

Since 2023, NV Energy’s score in its northern service area dropped 21 points from 80 out of 100 to 59 out of 100, while the score in its southern service area dropped 10 points from 83 out of 100 to 73 out of 100. NV Energy’s score reveals the utility has begun to lag in its clean energy transition. At the same time, Nevada is experiencing a data center boom and energy demand is increasing significantly, with data centers largely powered by dangerous fossil fuels like natural gas.

According to NV Energy’s latest energy plans, the utility will trade one expensive, polluting fossil fuel for another by converting the North Valmy coal plant to gas rather than an affordable, renewable source like solar. In addition to converting Valmy, the utility also plans to build two new gas units at the site.

“NV Energy has taken a step backwards, binding Nevadans to costly fossil fuels for years to come,” said Olivia Tanager, Sierra Club Toiyabe Chapter Director. “Customers shouldn’t have to pay the price for utilities’ poor planning. It’s time NV Energy got back on track with an accelerated clean energy plan that will meet growing demand, lower bills, and ensure a livable future for all.”

Faced with rapidly increasing load projections, utility companies are failing to meet this critical moment by championing renewable energy—instead, they are backsliding on their commitments and doubling down on fossil fuels. Across all 75 utilities, the companies scored an aggregate of 15 out of 100 points, earning an F. This marks the lowest score since the first year of this report in 2021, and the first time the score has ever dropped below the inaugural report.

But President Trump is a longtime critic of offshore wind, and his administration has launched a multi-agency effort to stop projects at all phases of development.","A federal judge ruled on Monday that work can resume on Revolution Wind, a large and nearly complete offshore wind farm near Rhode Island. Construction on the project had been halted since Aug. 22, when the Trump administration issued a stop-work order.

The order represents a rare — and, at least for now, temporary — win for the offshore wind industry, which has been a frequent target of the Trump administration.

In issuing a preliminary injunction in favor of Revolution, Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia said the construction pause represented the ""height of arbitrary and capricious action."" In explaining his decision, the judge repeatedly said that while the government cited potential national security concerns related to the project, it failed to ""make any factual findings or cite any reasons"" why the project needed to be paused.

Furthermore, Lamberth noted that the project's developer, Ørsted, was losing at least $2.3 million a day, and that hundreds of people were out of work while the project was in limbo.

""There is no question in my mind of irreparable harm to the plaintiffs,"" he said.

In granting the injunction, Lamberth didn't make a final ruling in the case; the lawsuit over the stop-work order will continue, but in the meantime, construction can restart.

In a statement, Ørsted said it would ""resume impacted construction work as soon as possible, with safety as the top priority.""

The Bureau of Ocean Energy Management, which issued the stop-work order, could challenge the injunction. In a statement, the agency said it will continue ""its investigation into possible impacts by the project to national security and prevention of other uses on the Outer Continental Shelf.""

Revolution Wind is a 65-turbine project that's slated to deliver 704 megawatts of power to Rhode Island and Connecticut starting next year — enough electricity to power about 350,000 homes. The project received its final federal permits in 2023 and has been staging the wind farm from a newly revitalized port in New London, Connecticut.

At the time of the stop-work order, the company had spent around $5 billion on the project and construction was 80% complete.

Connecticut Gov. Ned Lamont praised the judge's decision, calling it ""good news on behalf of consumers."" Once the project comes online, it's expected to save ratepayers in the state about $500 million annually.

""If you want to talk about the birds and the fish and national security, we can do that,"" Lamont added. ""But in the meantime, let's get back to work.""

Rhode Island Attorney General Peter Neronha also applauded the injunction, writing in a statement that the ""President cannot cancel clean energy projects just because he believes doing so is politically expedient for him.""

In a separate lawsuit, Rhode Island and Connecticut sued the Trump administration over the stop-work order.

""What we're looking for is to get this project up and running again as quickly as possible — get those workers and ships back out to sea to get the last 20% of this project done, and to bring this clean, reliable, over time inexpensive energy online to meet our energy needs up here in New England,"" Neronha said.

In New London, where daily construction work at State Pier has come to a standstill since the stop-work order was issued, Mayor Mike Passero said his reaction to the news was ""exuberance.""

""It's been a long month and we're so close to the end of this project,"" he said. ""We're just months away from turning on the spigot, so it's just a relief.""

Passero said Ørsted still has its construction workforce in place, so work should resume quickly.

""To be perfectly honest, I was a little concerned about irreparable harm,"" he added. But he now expects the project will be done before the lawsuit over the stop-work order wraps up.

Across New England, wind advocates outside of government also celebrated news of the injunction.

""This ruling confirms what we’ve known all along — that the Trump administration’s attempt to stop Revolution Wind is not only a violation of the law but a dramatic overreach,"" said Kate Sinding Daly, senior vice president for law and policy at Conservation Law Foundation. ""We applaud the court for upholding the rule of law and rejecting a reckless attempt to sabotage clean energy progress that will slash bills and toxic pollution.""

Revolution Wind is just one of a handful of large offshore wind projects under construction along the Atlantic Coast. Several New England states are counting on the renewable energy from offshore wind projects to provide a critical source of power, create jobs and spur economic development.

Under the Biden administration, these states, and the young industry, had a lot of support. But President Trump is a longtime critic of offshore wind, and his administration has launched a multi-agency effort to stop projects at all phases of development.

Just last week, the administration moved to revoke key permits for two previously-approved wind projects: SouthCoast Wind near Massachusetts and US Wind near Maryland. In court documents, the administration has announced its intention to revoke permits for another Massachusetts project, New England Wind, sometime in the next few weeks.

A FEW MILES DOWNSTREAM from the bridge that connects Cannelton, Indiana, to Hawesville, Kentucky, Southwire Company fulfills another important connection—producing the material needed to carry electricity from power generation sites to homes, businesses and industrial facilities across North America.

In operation since 1969, the Hancock County facility produces aluminum rod, strip and bare overhead conductors while also manufacturing bare transmission and distribution cable.

Within the last several years, Southwire has marked significant growth in efficiency, productivity and safety. The plant recently expanded the workforce by about 30% and square footage from 439,570 to 806,770 square feet.

“The growth of our Hawesville plant over the past few years is truly exciting,” says Roy Jackson, Southwire’s vice president of manufacturing. “We are in the process of our third and fourth expansions, which will add another 50 positions. Once these expansions are complete, we will have nearly doubled our bare overhead production capacity and replaced almost all legacy production equipment with new machines and technology.”

As growth coincides with rising energy demand and a more electrified economy, “Southwire provides the strong partnership electric co-ops are looking for,” says Phil Clark, executive vice president of United Utility Supply, a Kentucky-based cooperative that distributes material to utilities across the Midwest and Atlantic Coast. “Southwire is a partner with you to the end of the line.”

Southwire officials credit a partnership with Kenergy, its local electric cooperative, with a more responsive, tailored approach to its energy requirements compared with larger, investor-owned utilities.

“Decisions about electricity service are made locally and are driven by the needs of the members Kenergy serves,” says Nathan Ward, site leader at Southwire’s Kentucky plant.

“The amount of investment being made here in Hawesville is a great example of Southwire’s commitment to being a long-term blessing to the community and the people we serve,” Ward says.

“I don’t care what party you are in, if you get poisoned by a pesticide manufacturer you want to be able to sue.","Listen to the audio version of this article (generated by AI).

It’s been seven years since Germany’s Bayer bought US agrochemical giant Monsanto, inheriting not only the company’s vast portfolio of seeds and pesticide products, but also more than 100,000 lawsuits alleging Monsanto’s popular Roundup herbicide causes cancer. Bayer, which has so far paid out billions of dollars in settlements and jury verdicts to cancer victims, has been working – so far in vain – to put an end to the litigation and to block any future such cases.

Now, the company appears closer than ever to success, as many Republican congressional leaders push for measures that would effectively block lawsuits against pesticide makers around the country.

A group founded by Bayer called the Modern Ag Alliance is the face of the legislative push, advocating for liability shields they say are necessary to allow companies to continue to sell pesticides that farmers use to kill weeds and bugs in their fields.

The group says it represents more than 100 agricultural organizations, including farmers who grow wheat, corn, soybeans and other key food crops.

“Without legislative action, a potential catastrophe is on the horizon that could result in many farmers going out of business and food prices rising even further,” the alliance warns on its website.

The alliance has been lobbying for the passage of state laws blocking such lawsuits, so far succeeding in two states – Georgia and North Dakota – and continues to lobby for such laws in all 50 states.

But the immediate battleground is in the halls of Congress where a provision tucked into a congressional appropriations bill is outraging consumer advocates, including those affiliated with the influential Make America Healthy Again (MAHA) movement. Similar protective language for pesticide makers is expected to be included in the new Farm Bill as well.

“Bayer is in a desperate position,” said Kelly Ryerson, a leading MAHA advocate who has been lobbying lawmakers and her 84,000 social media followers to fight back against pesticide company protections. “Rather than slapping a [warning] label on the side of the product, they would rather take on the enormous challenge of changing US federal and state law.

“The audacity of elected officials voting for legislation to fully strip our legal rights away when injured by chemicals is stunning, especially in this age of MAHA when an unprecedented number of Americans are rallying against toxins in food and the environment,” Ryerson said.

“Important investments”

Bayer has made it clear that changing laws in its favor is a priority. The company states on its website that without “legislative certainty,” lawsuits over its glyphosate-based Roundup and other weed killers can impact its research and product development and other “important investments.”

The company says the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) should be the ultimate arbiter of product safety and what warnings should be required on product labels. If the EPA approves a product label, consumers should not be able to sue companies for failing to warn of perceived risks, according to Bayer.

In a statement to The New Lede, Bayer said federal legislation is “needed to ensure that states and courts do not take a position or action regarding product labels at odds with congressional intent, federal law and established scientific research and federal authority.”

Bayer has already removed glyphosate, classified as “probably” carcinogenic to humans by World Health Organization cancer experts, from consumer herbicide products. And the company has threatened to stop selling it to farmers if the litigation is not brought to an end.

The company disputes, however, that the appropriations bill will provide that certainty, saying in its statement that the language doesn’t prevent lawsuits and asserting it does in a “distortion of reality.”

The relevant section of the House version of the appropriations bill – Section 453 – does not mention litigation or pesticide company liability. Section 453 simply says that no funds can be used to “issue or adopt any guidance or any policy, take any regulatory action, or approve any labeling or change to such labeling” inconsistent with the conclusion of an EPA human health assessment.

But critics say the language effectively would impede states and local governments from warning about risks of pesticides even in the face of new scientific findings about health harms if such warnings are not consistent with outdated EPA assessments. The EPA itself would not be able to update warnings without finalizing a new assessment, the critics say.

And because of the limits on warnings, consumers would find it nearly impossible to sue pesticide makers for failing to warn them of health risks if the EPA assessments do not support such warnings.

The language is “by design, sneaky and complicated and hard to explain,” said Daniel Hinkle, senior state affairs counsel for the American Association for Justice, who has been lobbying against the action. “Nobody thinks that a giant chemical company should be able to lie about the risks of using their product and get away with it. It’s just making sure that people understand that is what is at stake,” Hinkle said.

The language is also clear to the Farm & Ranch Freedom Alliance, which warns in an “action alert” opposing the measure that it would “give pesticide manufacturers immunity from lawsuits, even when their products devastate a farmer’s crops, sicken farm workers, or contaminate organic fields.”

And even though Bayer downplays the significance of the appropriations language, its Modern Ag Alliance promotes support for Section 453 as a way “Congress can put American farmers first,” and says having “enough healthy, affordable food depends on it.”

“Very worried”

US Rep. Chellie Pingree, a Democrat from Maine who tried but failed to overturn the language in a July appropriations committee hearing, said she is “very worried” about the “outrageous” efforts to protect pesticide companies from litigation.

“We’re talking about chemicals here that are already prone to health risks,” Pingree said. “And the chemical industry is trying to keep that information from consumers … and then to have immunity from being responsible if you get cancer from being in the presence of these chemicals.”

The language is not currently included in the short-term government spending package being debated ahead of a looming government shutdown that would occur at the end of the month in the absence of continued spending authorization.

But it is expected to see support in both House and Senate appropriations bill versions once the short-term budget is resolved. As well, the new Farm Bill is expected to include language limiting or preventing pesticide injury lawsuits, with strong signals from Glenn Thompson, chairman of the US House Committee on Agriculture favoring such protections.

Thompson has weighed in on the side of Bayer in the past in the company’s ongoing efforts to get the US Supreme Court to weigh in on the issue of federal “preemption” over pesticide regulation.

The involvement and influence of the MAHA movement is adding a bipartisan element to what otherwise might be a highly partisan fight, raising awareness with voters in both red and blue states about the issues at stake.

Max Lugavere, a health journalist, author and podcaster who posted a photo of a MAHA-related visit to the White House to his 1.1 million Instagram followers, said pushing lawmakers is important, but “awareness among everyday people is the first domino.”

Citing “growing evidence linking pesticides to health risks,” Lugavere said “stripping away legal recourse in these cases wouldn’t just be wrong, it would be a tragedy.”

For California lawyer Brent Wisner, who helped lead the early Roundup litigation against Bayer, the efforts by lawmakers to protect the company against future litigation is un-American and potentially unconstitutional.

“I don’t care what party you are in, if you get poisoned by a pesticide manufacturer you want to be able to sue. You need to be able to sue,” Wisner said. “For you to think otherwise you have to assume that the EPA is infallible and that our federal government’s regulators are the top notch. Bayer is paying millions of dollars to get these laws passed because it’s cheaper than it is to pay people they’ve given cancer to.”",https://www.thenewlede.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/cropped-NewLede-Fav-32x32.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 16:01:44.559055

“Competitive, market-rate royalty rates do not affect industry interest or production decisions — lowering rates only shortchanges taxpayers by reducing future royalty revenue,” Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote.
Oil and gas industry officials in Wyoming agree.
The Inflation Reduction Act increased the federal oil and gas royalty rate from 12.5% to 16.67% in 2022, Obermueller noted.
The industry holds a vast amount of federal oil and gas leases that it has not acted on, they note.","A federal oil and natural gas lease sale in Wyoming this month netted $8.5 million for 32 parcels spanning 39,225 acres, according to the U.S. Bureau of Land Management.

The “bonus bid” proceeds are paid up front and split between the U.S. Treasury and the state. Companies also pay federal mineral royalties as they produce the petrol.

But the sale — the BLM’s third competitive oil and gas lease auction in Wyoming so far this year — and any resulting royalty payments will ultimately generate less revenue for American taxpayers than sales in the past, conservation groups and one taxpayer advocacy organization say.

The One Big Beautiful Bill, passed in July, reduced the royalty rate for federal oil and gas from 16.67% to 12.5%. If all 32 parcels in this month’s sale are fully developed, then the lesser royalty rate will reap an estimated $22 million less than under the previous royalty rate, according to calculations by Taxpayers for Common Sense. That would put Wyoming’s loss at $11 million.

Advocacy groups have also noted that a similar royalty rate reduction for federal coal will cost Wyoming about $50 million annually — a revenue loss that many state lawmakers want to rectify.

“Competitive, market-rate royalty rates do not affect industry interest or production decisions — lowering rates only shortchanges taxpayers by reducing future royalty revenue,” Taxpayers for Common Sense wrote.

The BLM, under the Trump administration, doesn’t see it that way.

Instead, the reduced royalty rate “is expected to spur additional leasing and drilling activity, which in turn supports increased domestic energy production and strengthens U.S. energy security,” according to a BLM statement regarding the Wyoming lease sale.

Oil and gas industry officials in Wyoming agree.

“It simply isn’t true to claim that higher royalty rates always result in more revenue for the federal government,” Petroleum Association of Wyoming President Pete Obermueller told WyoFile.

The Inflation Reduction Act increased the federal oil and gas royalty rate from 12.5% to 16.67% in 2022, Obermueller noted. “Total royalties paid by Wyoming’s industry decreased by 17% from 2022 to 2023,” he said. “In 2024, while still under the IRA-mandated higher royalty rate, federal royalties decreased again, this time falling by a whopping 30%.”

Compounding the issue, conservation groups contend the industry is nominating and acquiring federal oil and gas lease parcels beyond the typical “speculation” required to suss out the potential productivity of new areas. The type of speculation alleged by some conservation groups is to simply hold some areas open to future development, where they fear environmental restrictions in the future might keep them out.

The industry holds a vast amount of federal oil and gas leases that it has not acted on, they note.

One piece of evidence the taxpayer advocacy group points to is what they say is an uncommonly low average dollar-per-acre among successful bids in this month’s lease sale in Wyoming.

“More than 90% of acres [in Fremont and Natrona counties] were leased for less than $40 per acre,” Taxpayers for Common Sense said. In contrast, some of the highest winning bids were for parcels in Converse and Campbell counties — a highly active oil play — fetching more than $1,000 per acre, including one in Campbell County for $4,612 per acre, based on BLM reports.

The accusation of speculation, or buying federal oil and gas leases to fend off future environmental limitations to development, “is an odd concept,” and doesn’t hold water, according to Obermueller.

“Every single lease ever offered is, at one point, speculative,” he said. “People forget that oil and natural gas must first be found before it can be produced.”

Oil and gas companies that bought federal leases in the Jonah Field in the late 1990s or early 2000s, for example, were considered by some within the industry to be risky, at best, Obermueller suggested. “They paid off quite handsomely for Wyoming.

“Wyoming,” Obermueller continued, “is exciting to oil and gas operators precisely because we are still exploring for resources and testing the horizontal and vertical bounds of oil and natural gas basins. If so-called ‘speculative’ leasing were not allowed, then there would no longer be a mechanism for exploring in Wyoming.”

The BLM’s lease sale this month is the first to “fully” implement myriad new policies under the Trump administration, Lander-based Wyoming Outdoor Council Conservation Director Alec Underwood told WyoFile. The concern laid out by Taxpayers for Common Sense — that the average per-acre bid price suggests overt speculation — he said, holds some merit.

“Only a very small percentage of acres purchased in the sale, 7%, accounted for more than 80% of auction revenue. This points to many of the parcels being leased through speculation,” Underwood said. “Rather than offering a fire sale of leases in important habitat such as crucial winter range for ungulates, we should be prioritizing leasing in areas that are likely for production and adjacent to existing development.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47643/wyofile.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/workover-rig-hwy-59-cc-dbleizeffer1758623167.jpg?h=3fcb88d5&itok=Rr9GHqy_,N,,2025-09-23 12:08:42.840268

The $7,500 tax credit for new electric vehicles and $4,000 credit for used electric vehicles (EV) ends Sept. 30. Steven Hershkowitz is the managing director for clean transportation for the Washington Department of Commerce. He expects the loss of this incentive will hurt EV sales in the short term.

“There is going to be a bit of a drag on the growth rate that we have seen,” Hershkowitz said. “We’ve already seen the market growth slow down in 2024 and into 2025.

Washington got rid of its tax exemption for EVs earlier this year. The legislature and Governor Ferguson are deciding to use those dollars elsewhere, but Herskowitz said the state’s commitment to electric vehicles and clean energy isn’t going away.

“The commitment is still there, and the prioritization is still there,” Herskowitz said. “These consumer-facing incentives that were quite popular are not, unfortunately, but there’s progress being made in terms of making sure that, hopefully, we can get the incentives back at some point.”

Climate Commitment Act to fund clean energy projects

The state will continue to use funds from the Climate Commitment Act to push clean energy and expand EV charging around the state.

Herskowitz believes electric vehicles are the future, and the demand will eventually return.

“The automakers know that this is where it’s going,” he said. “The global competition is further ahead in many major markets now internationally for EVs, and so this is where we’re going. It’s just about the pace at which we get there.”

The pace also includes finding ways to improve the pricing for electric vehicles.

The average price for a new EV is over $55,000. The average price for a new gas car is $49,000. You can certainly find new EVs for much less. Some only run about $30,000.

Now might be the time to get in, if you want to take advantage of the tax credit.

“It’s a good opportunity for people who have been considering getting an electric vehicle to really bring that consideration up to a higher level, perhaps go into dealerships, test drive, see what the prices are,” Herskowitz said. “This could be a good opportunity to get deals depending on which model you’re looking at.”

But expect a lot of company. You won’t be the only person trying to squeeze in before the deadline.

To take advantage of the tax credit, you only need to have ordered an EV by the deadline. You can take delivery later and still get it.

According to the politician, California “can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits,” and won’t be able to support direct subsidies, while remaining committed to support expanding EV infrastructure in the state.
Automakers, including Tesla, Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, have since urged Governor Newsom to create a $5,000 state incentive to offset the loss of the federal EV tax credit in California, the nation’s largest auto market.
California’s previous EV rebate program ended in 2023, after President Joe Biden approved the federal tax credit as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022.
Earlier this year, Congress moved the expiration date up to September 30, following a proposal by Senate Republicans and reflecting the Trump Administration’s push to end clean energy and EV tax incentives.","Governor Gavin Newsom previously said California would restart its Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) rebate program once the federal EV tax credit expired.

However, as the anticipated deadline of September 30 approaches and given California’s budget deficit, Newson announced that the state will not revive the program.

According to the politician, California “can’t make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits,” and won’t be able to support direct subsidies, while remaining committed to support expanding EV infrastructure in the state.

After Donald Trump’s election late last year, Newsom had promised that California would step in if Trump followed through on his threat to end the $7,500 federal credit.

Automakers, including Tesla, Rivian, Hyundai, and Volkswagen, have since urged Governor Newsom to create a $5,000 state incentive to offset the loss of the federal EV tax credit in California, the nation’s largest auto market.

Despite the Government’s efforts, California will not be able to revive the EV credit yet, but the Governor’s office said that it is possible that it can come back “next year.”

The office cited hundreds of millions of dollars from a carbon-trading program that supports environmental initiatives, which the states will soon have to allocate.

California’s previous EV rebate program ended in 2023, after President Joe Biden approved the federal tax credit as part of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), signed into law in August 2022.

Under the IRA, buyers of eligible electric vehicles starting in 2023 could receive up to $7,500, provided the vehicle met requirements for battery sourcing and final assembly.

The law originally set the credit to expire on December 31, 2025, unless new legislation extended or replaced it.

Earlier this year, Congress moved the expiration date up to September 30, following a proposal by Senate Republicans and reflecting the Trump Administration’s push to end clean energy and EV tax incentives.

Congress also voted to block California’s ban on selling gasoline-powered vehicles from 2035.

Detroit automaker General Motors, which is reshifting its focus towards internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, told employees that it was opposing the EV mandate.

According to an email, “emissions standards that are not aligned with market realities pose a serious threat to our business by undermining consumer choice and vehicle affordability.”

GM reportedly wanted a national emissions policy instead of separate rules for each state.

The company also pointed out that demand for EVs is falling, even as the overall auto market grows, and that EV manufacturing costs are rising to record levels.

In July, GM halted its plans to produce EVs in Orion, telling its employees it will produce internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in the site instead.

According to a recent Reuters report, General Motors will halt production of two electric Cadillac SUVs in Spring Hill, Tennessee, in December.",https://i0.wp.com/eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/Screenshot-2025-09-23-at-15.07.54_converted.webp?fit=1200%2C602&ssl=1,N,,2025-09-23 11:01:19.918692

Job market

Clean energy jobs have grown three times faster than overall U.S. workforce since 2020, but federal obstruction puts job growth at risk, according to a recent report from E2. In 2025, job growth slowdowns and investment cancellations persist. E2 research shows that since January 2025, businesses cancelled more than $22 billion of planned clean energy factories and projects that were expected to create 16,500 jobs. Analysis by Energy Innovation suggests that more than 830,000 jobs could be lost due to policy rollbacks created by the Trump Administration’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act.

The U.S. clean energy workforce now stands at 3.56 million. In 2024, 7% of all new jobs in the United States were in clean energy, and clean energy represented 82% of all new energy sector jobs. However, approximately 50,000 fewer jobs were created in 2024 as compared to 2023.

“What these numbers show is that this was one of the hottest and most promising job sectors in the country at the end of 2024,” said Bob Keefe, E2’s executive director. “Now, clean energy job growth is at serious risk – and with it, our overall economy.”

Positive value chain

Positive choices

These key pillars are supported by sub-goals targeting core areas impacting production:

Agriculture

Water

Packaging

Climate

Nutrition

PepsiCo says it is “focused on innovating, scaling solutions and sharing results to continue driving meaningful changes.”

""pep+ is not a sustainability strategy. It's an ongoing transformation that powers our whole business, from innovation to production, marketing to distribution,"" says Ramon Laguarta, PepsiCo's Chairman and Chief Executive Officer.

""When we rolled out pep+ in 2021, we knew it would be important for the long-term strength of our company.

“Since then, we have worked towards creating value for our shareholders, customers and communities, while aiming to make PepsiCo more resilient and overcome systemic barriers that limit progress.

“I look forward to continuing this critical journey with our associates and partners, as we strive to prove that growth and sustainability go hand in hand.""

Key progress in manufacturing and sustainability

For PepsiCo, 2024 marked a year of important developments in its sustainability journey.

The company’s ESG summary details initiatives in regenerative agriculture, protective practices, and the achievement of significant nutritional milestones affecting food and beverage production.

""Our progress in 2024 shows that when we embed sustainability into the heart of our company, we not only help strengthen our communities and our planet, we also make our business more resilient,"" says Jim Andrew, PepsiCo's Executive Vice President and Chief Sustainability Officer.

""At the same time, we know our sustainability journey will not always be linear.

“There are a number of obstacles that stand in the way of the systemic changes needed to continue making progress at scale.

“To overcome these obstacles, the world needs more collaboration and engagement from business, governments and civil society.

“We will continue our efforts to lead, to learn from our progress and to share those learnings to help build a more sustainable and resilient food system.""

Through implementing regenerative agriculture and protective practices across 3.5 million acres, PepsiCo has improved soil health, air quality and crop yields, strides that incorporate sustainability into its manufacturing ethos.

The company is progressing towards its 2030 target of 10 million acres, equivalent to an area the size of Switzerland.

Additionally, PepsiCo satisfied 89% of the electricity needs for its company-owned operations, approximately 3,900 GWh, from renewable sources, including renewable energy credits.

Meanwhile, it achieved an 18% reduction in Scope 1 and 2 greenhouse gas emissions from its 2022 baseline.

A Guide to the Last-Minute $7,500 Federal EV Credit

One of the most frequent questions I’ve been asked lately is a pressing one: “Which electric vehicles are still eligible for that $7,500 federal tax credit before it simply disappears on September 30?” It’s a valid query, given the ever-shifting goalposts of government incentives. The answer is, there are still a few contenders, and they come from some of the biggest names in the game. From Kia’s design-forward electrics to GM’s all-American offerings and even Tesla’s market dominators, a surprising number of cars are still on Uncle Sam’s good list, provided you act quickly.

Why does this matter right now?

The clock is ticking. The $7,500 EV tax credit, a substantial incentive for anyone considering a shift to electric power, is set to undergo another change on September 30. For many prospective buyers, this credit is the difference between a purchase and a postponement. The list of eligible vehicles has been in a constant state of flux, primarily due to complex requirements around battery component sourcing and final vehicle assembly location. This deadline acts as a final call, offering a window for buyers to secure a significant discount on a new electric car, truck, or SUV.

Kia, for example, is hitting home runs with its E-GMP platform. The Kia EV6 is more than just a crossover; it’s a statement piece built on their “Opposites United” philosophy. The flat floor creates a surprisingly spacious cabin, fronted by a sleek, curved display panel. With up to 282 miles of range, it’s a practical daily driver, but the high-performance GT model is a different beast entirely, a rocketship that does 0 to 60 in a blistering 3.4 seconds. For larger families, the EV9 is essentially a living room on wheels, one of the few three-row EVs that comfortably accommodates adults in the back. Its available second-row swivel seats are an innovative touch for creating a social space while parked. Built with sustainable materials and offering up to 304 miles of range, the EV9 is a versatile and compelling family machine, made even more appealing by that credit.

General Motors is stacking the deck with its Ultium platform, with the Blazer EV, Equinox EV, and Silverado EV all still on the eligible list. While the SUVs are strong contenders, the main event for Chevrolet is the Silverado EV. This is GM’s moonshot for electrifying America’s heartland, and the specs are staggering. The work truck trim boasts a massive 450-mile maximum range, while the RST model unleashes 754 horsepower in its ‘Wide Open Watts’ mode. The Silverado’s genius, however, lies in its utility. The Multi-Flex Midgate is a true game-changer, allowing you to fold down the back of the cab to haul items over ten feet long. The lockable eTrunk provides weatherproof storage, and the PowerBase system offers up to 10 outlets with 10.2 kilowatts of power, enough to run a construction site or power your home in a blackout.

Even Cadillac, known for its luxury, has surprisingly made the cut. The Lyriq is the leader here, a luxury SUV with a serene ride, a stunning 33-inch curved display, and up to 314 miles of range. It will soon be joined by the smaller Optiq and the three-row Vistiq, both expected to deliver around 300 miles of range and the high-end features Cadillac is known for. Not to be outdone, Hyundai has managed to sneak in a couple of models, including the award-winning Ioniq 5, with its retro-futuristic design, ultra-fast 800-volt charging, and 303 miles of range. It will soon be joined by the highly anticipated Ioniq 9, a full-size, three-row SUV.

How does it compare to rivals?

The vehicles on this list present a compelling mix of practicality, performance, and luxury that directly challenges traditional internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles. The F-150 Lightning, for instance, packages its impressive technology, including the Pro Power Onboard generator system, into the familiar body of America’s best-selling truck, the 2025 Ford F-150. The extended-range battery offers up to 320 miles of range. It’s a direct response to the Silverado EV, and the competition between these two electric trucks is fueling innovation at a breakneck pace.

The Jeep Wagoneer S, with its promise of a 3.4-second 0-60 time and over 300 miles of range, takes direct aim at luxury performance EVs from brands like Tesla and Porsche. Meanwhile, the Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid stands alone as the only PHEV on this list, offering a unique “best of both worlds” proposition for families not ready to go all-in on a full EV. It provides 32 miles of pure electric driving for daily errands, with a gas engine for long-haul peace of mind.

Honda and Acura have also entered the fray, leveraging GM’s proven Ultium platform. The Honda Prologue is a clean, family-friendly SUV with a 281-mile range, while its sportier cousin, the Acura ZDX, boasts up to 313 miles of range and an available 500-horsepower Type S model. The fact that established Japanese brands are now joining the EV party with these models, even if they’re not fully homegrown, is a massive shift in the EV transition. The competition is stiff, but each of these vehicles carves out a distinct niche for itself.

Who is this for, and who should skip it?

This list is for the savvy consumer who was already considering an EV and understands the financial significance of a $7,500 tax credit. If you’re a family looking for a practical, spacious ride, the Kia EV9, Chevrolet Equinox EV, or Hyundai Ioniq 9 are perfect candidates. For those who need a workhorse that can handle everything from a construction site to a cross-country trip, the Chevrolet Silverado EV and Ford F-150 Lightning are purpose-built for you. And if you want luxury with a side of zero emissions, the Cadillac Lyriq or Genesis Electrified GV70 fit the bill. The Genesis, assembled in Alabama, is a true luxury SUV with a stunning interior and a potent 429 horsepower.

However, this list is not for everyone. If you aren’t in a financial position to make a car purchase, a tax credit won’t magically make it happen. The credit is non-refundable, meaning you only get the full amount if you have a tax liability of at least $7,500. It’s a key detail that many forget. And if you are still hesitant about the switch to electric, the September 30 deadline won’t change your mind. But for those who have been on the fence, weighing the pros and cons, this final window is your cue to act.

What is the long-term significance?

The disappearance of this specific tax credit is part of a larger, ongoing shift in government policy aimed at encouraging domestic EV production. This particular deadline is a moment of reckoning for both consumers and automakers. For consumers, it marks the end of a very generous, albeit complex, incentive. For automakers, it means they must now rely on the inherent value, performance, and features of their vehicles to attract buyers, rather than a government subsidy.

Tesla remains a significant player on this list, with wide eligibility across its Model 3, Model Y, Model X, and even the Cybertruck, provided they stay under the price caps. This continued eligibility, while others have been dropped, speaks to their early and decisive investment in a domestic supply chain. Their Model Y, with up to 310 miles of range, remains a best-seller for a reason.

The long-term significance is that the market is maturing. It’s moving beyond simple incentives and into a phase where the best products, the ones that are most practical, powerful, and affordable, will win. The fact that a single plug-in hybrid like the Chrysler Pacifica made the cut is also a signal that the government is still hedging its bets, acknowledging that for some families, a PHEV remains the most logical transition point. This final list of eligible vehicles is a snapshot of an industry in transition, a market that is quickly evolving from a subsidized niche to a competitive mainstream segment.

So, there you have it, the complete list, from Kia and ​Chevrolet to Tesla and everyone in between. The deadline is September 30. If any of these vehicles were on your radar, now is the time to act. Waiting will cost you $7,500, a sum that could buy a great holiday, or perhaps even a lifetime supply of correctly priced avocado toast.",https://myfox8.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/17/2025/09/download-2025-09-23T083228.146.png?w=1280,N,,2025-09-23 16:03:26.574447

In the prior week, Tesla stock surged 12.85%, racing out of a consolidation buy point of 367.71, according to MarketSurge charts.","Tesla (TSLA) announces global third-quarter deliveries next week and the EV giant just posted its strongest weekly China vehicle registrations of the quarter, signaling a big improvement compared to Q2 but still lagging behind last year. TSLA shares are just 12% below record highs entering Tuesday's stock market.

Tesla insurance registrations in China totaled 17,300 for the week of Sept. 15 to 21, up nearly 13% from 15,350 the previous week, marking its highest weekly total so far in Q3, according to data compiled Tuesday by independent China auto industry trackers.

Along with Tesla's China insurance registrations jump last week, other major Chinese electric vehicle manufacturers also broadly saw increases. Registrations tend to ramp up at the end of the quarter.

Of Tesla's total vehicle registrations, there were 10,340 Model Ys, 850 of the newly released six-seat Model Y L and 6,060 Model 3 vehicle registrations, according to CnEVPost.

During the prior week, 1,030 new Model Y L vehicles were registered while 894 were registered three weeks ago. The new, slightly longer wheelbase Model Y variation appears to be having an incremental boost to sales since deliveries Sept. 2.

Twelve weeks into Q3, Tesla registrations in China, a rough gauge for deliveries, are now up 33% compared to Q2 but down around 8% to Q3 2024. So far this year, Tesla vehicle registrations in China have declined 6%.

Tesla Q3 Deliveries Upcoming

Investors will get another China vehicle registrations report next week before Tesla reports third-quarter global vehicle deliveries. The EV giant will then announce Q3 earnings on Oct. 21.

Officially, analyst consensus has global Tesla Q3 vehicle deliveries coming in around 446,000, according to FactSet. That would be about 16% above the second-quarter total but still down 4% vs. Q3 2024. Few analysts have updated Q3 delivery targets since late July, however.

Piper Sandler on Sunday projected 495,000 Q3 deliveries while GLJ Research forecasts 467,000. Meanwhile, Kalshi prediction market has been pegging deliveries at 510,000 units.

UBS analysts on Tuesday predicted that Tesla Q3 deliveries will come in at 475,000, up from its prior view of 431,000. For Q4, UBS forecasts 428,000 deliveries, down 14% vs. a year ago and down 10% quarter over quarter. UBS has a sell rating and a 215 price target on TSLA shares.

Mizuho also on Tuesday raised its Tesla stock price target to 450 from 375, noting that U.S. tariffs should have a minimal impact on new vehicle prices and that consumers appear to be buying EVs before the tax credit ends.

After the U.S. tax credit expires on Sept. 30, deliveries are likely to fall significantly in the U.S.

The EV giant updated its website over the weekend showing that customers can still take advantage of the tax credit if they order a vehicle by Sept. 30, not if it is delivered by that date. The IRS revised guidance about expiring EV tax credits in late August.

Tesla Stock Performance

TSLA edged up around 0.5% to 436.50 at Tuesday's stock market open after gaining 1.9% to 434.21 on Monday. Tesla stock jumped 7.6% last week to 426.07, following Musk's disclosure of $1 billion worth of share buys.

In the prior week, Tesla stock surged 12.85%, racing out of a consolidation buy point of 367.71, according to MarketSurge charts. At Monday's market close, Tesla was just 12% below December's all-time high of 488.54.

Baird analyst Ben Kallo on Friday upgraded Tesla to outperform from neutral with a price target of 548, up from 320. Kallo wrote that Tesla's vehicle volumes will likely decline again in 2025 and near-term fundamentals ""will be choppy,"" but that TSLA could outperform as Tesla is increasingly viewed as the leader in physical artificial intelligence.

At this point, investors looking to start a position should see if Tesla pulls back or perhaps forges a handle to a consolidation going back to end of last year.

""We'd wanted to get rooftop solar, but it's so expensive,"" Milner said in the story.
Milner's system — referenced in the industry as ""plug-and-play solar"" — comes at a fraction of the cost of the larger rooftop arrays.
""It fixes our energy cost a little bit, because rates keep rising,"" he said in the story.
The combination of solar energy and smarter tech can lower utility expenses even more.","Rooftops are no longer the lone domains of household solar, as budget-savvy homeowners are taking advantage of improving technology to gather cleaner energy from a growing number of surfaces.

California public radio station KQED recently highlighted Berkeley hills resident Matthew Milner's foray into solar with an easily installed array that he attached to the side of a fence.

""We'd wanted to get rooftop solar, but it's so expensive,"" Milner said in the story. ""This allows us to dip our toe in a little bit.""

It's part of an amazing time for suncatchers, as they are being installed under train tracks, on public infrastructure, and on balconies.

Milner's setup is a fresh take on the latter concept. The small, portable array was assembled in a couple of hours, plugged into his house, and offsetting potentially dirty energy coming from the grid, according to KQED.

Solar is one of the best ways to lower, and sometimes eliminate, utility bills. But the price can be a detriment for many people. Rooftop arrays can cost up to $30,000, depending on the size and applicable incentives, according to EnergySage. It's a free resource that can help you compare quotes and find the right professional installer for a quick job. Fast action is important to land 30% tax credits that expire at the end of the year due to federal policy changes.

Milner's system — referenced in the industry as ""plug-and-play solar"" — comes at a fraction of the cost of the larger rooftop arrays. KQED reported that two panels and accessories from San Francisco's Bright Saver cost about $2,100 and can power lights, electronics, and maybe even an efficient refrigerator. It will take Milner less than five years for his energy savings to pay for the setup, which he got at a discounted price of $1,700. His power bill was running at up to $80 a month, all per KQED.

""It fixes our energy cost a little bit, because rates keep rising,"" he said in the story.

Thinner, smaller, and cheaper portable versions are in development by other companies with the goal of lowering costs through self-installation, KQED's report added. Leasing panels through programs such as Palmetto's LightReach is another option gaining traction.

The onus is surging power bills that are outpacing inflation. That's partly due to heat waves and data center energy demand, which requires loads of electricity for cooling and computing.

EnergySage's mapping tool compares costs and incentives by state. Its overall guidance can save customers up to $10,000. Experts there can even help with an HVAC upgrade via heat pump guidance. The combination of solar energy and smarter tech can lower utility expenses even more. The tech can reduce household electricity costs for heating by up to 75%, according to the government.

It all limits heat-trapping air pollution generated by fossil fuels that are burned to make power. The lung-troubling fumes are linked by NASA to extreme temperatures that could soon force people from certain parts of the world.

For plug-in solar's part, KQED reported that safety standards, rules, and even laws easing its use would help with adoption.

Republican Utah state Rep. Raymond Ward wrote legislation to make it easier for folks to use the lower-cost, convenient suncatchers.

""I'm interested in anything that helps move toward more abundant energy,"" he said in KQED's story.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/plug-and-play-solarimage-rec72HqBoRvBBETlz-1.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 12:07:57.012865

The federal Clean Vehicle Credit, worth up to $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used one, is set to expire at the end of the month.
Joe Craig, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, said the end of the credit could reshape demand.

The federal Clean Vehicle Credit, worth up to $7,500 on a new EV and $4,000 on a used one, is set to expire at the end of the month.

Buyers have two options for claiming the incentive: filing for the credit on their tax return or transferring it directly to the dealer for an immediate discount. But to receive the full federal benefit, an eligible vehicle must be purchased or delivered bySept. 30, 2025.

The program was created under the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and was originally expected to run through 2032. However, a recent tax and spending-cut package passed by Congress shortened that timeline, making this the final week to take advantage of the federal incentive.

Joe Craig, an economics professor at the University of Colorado Colorado Springs, said the end of the credit could reshape demand.

“We’ve seen a huge surge in people buying electric vehicles the last two months. We should absolutely expect that EV sales will drop. I would be shocked if that didn’t happen after the tax credits went away,” Craig told News5.

Colorado drivers also have access to a state-level tax credit of up to $6,000 this year. That benefit will shrink starting in 2026, when credits drop to between $750 and $2,000.

Evidence beyond scientific dispute The endangerment finding has long been a target of conservative lawmakers and fossil fuel companies.
You may think that repealing the Endangerment Finding will better our economy or our society.","Catholic and other faith-based organizations submitted nearly 10,000 comments opposing the Trump administration's attempt to revoke the bedrock environmental policy underpinning federal regulations on polluting emissions that drive climate change and harm human health.

The comments come in response to efforts by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to repeal its 2009 ""endangerment finding,"" in which the agency determined through scientific review that heat-trapping greenhouse gas emissions — released primarily from burning coal, oil and gas — pose a danger to public health and welfare.

The endangerment finding is seen as the legal linchpin in the federal government's ability to regulate emissions, from sources like vehicles and power plants, that are driving climate change. EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin has challenged the finding and called its attempted reversal part of the largest deregulatory push in U.S. history.

In all, nine faith organizations collected more than 9,400 comments as of Sept. 19 in support of retaining the endangerment finding. Staff members delivered the boxes of comments Sept. 17 to EPA headquarters in Washington, D.C. Catholics accounted for roughly 4,400 of those comments, with a quarter submitted by women religious.

EPA issued the endangerment finding after the U.S. Supreme Court in the 2007 landmark case, Massachusetts v. EPA, ruled that greenhouse gas emissions, including carbon dioxide and methane, are considered air pollutants under the Clean Air Act.

The EPA's determination that greenhouse gases endanger public health was seen as a major development in how the U.S. — the largest cumulative source of emissions and world leader in oil and gas use and production — could address climate change at the federal level.

A public health and moral crisis

On Aug. 1, the EPA under President Donald Trump began the process of repealing the endangerment finding. As part of its proposed rule, it also sought to roll back pollution standards on cars and trucks.

Any new proposed rule or regulatory revision requires a public commenting period as part of the process. Public comments on the endangerment finding closed Sept. 22.

The nearly 10,000 comments were collected by the Catholic Climate Covenant, Laudato Si' Movement, Franciscan Action Network, Ignatian Solidarity Network, the Sisters of Mercy, Maryknoll, women religious lobby NETWORK, Jewish climate group Dayenu and the National Religious Partnership for the Environment. The comments included nearly 4,400 from Black church leaders, who also issued a joint statement opposing the EPA action.

At a virtual public hearing Aug. 22, Archbishop Thomas Zinkula of Dubuque, Iowa, said the proposed rollback of the endangerment finding jeopardizes the moral responsibility humans hold to protect life, care for creation and defend the most vulnerable.

""Strong [pollution] standards save lives,"" the Iowa archbishop said. ""They prevent billions of tons of climate pollution, reduce smog and soot, and mean fewer cases of asthma and premature death. Families save thousands of dollars on fuel and healthcare costs. These protections are good for people and good for God's creation.""

""Repealing the [Endangerment] Finding is like tossing out the Ten Commandments,"" Rabbi Jennie Rosenn, Dayenu founder and CEO, said in a statement. ""[Zeldin] is not only denying something that's fundamentally true about the world, but he is eliminating what enables our government to live and act in alignment with our core values.""

In its own 15-page comment, the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops urged EPA to abandon its plans to revoke the endangerment finding, which it said would ""rewind any progress the nation has made in combating the dangerous effects of climate change."" The letter, written by the conference's legal counsel, including general counsel William Quinn, said EPA was attempting to manipulate the Clean Air Act and ignoring scientific evidence on the impacts of climate change on the health of people and the planet.

""Our concerns with the Reconsideration are founded on the Catholic Church's commitment to environmental justice and care for creation, as it is an integral component of Catholic faith,"" the bishops' letter said.

""Repealing the [Endangerment] Finding is like tossing out the Ten Commandments,"" Rabbi Jennie Rosenn, Dayenu founder and CEO, said in a statement.

In their statement, the Black church leaders called climate change and emissions pollution ""one of the greatest public health and moral crises facing not just our communities but our country.""

“The cost of this decision by the EPA will be paid for in human lives — and Black bodies will bear the brunt of the burden,"" they said, citing data showing Black Americans are more likely to live near highly polluted areas, such as highways and industrial facilities.

Evidence beyond scientific dispute

The endangerment finding has long been a target of conservative lawmakers and fossil fuel companies. It underpins many of the other limits on emissions and pollution the Trump administration has sought to eliminate.

Zeldin has questioned climate change and the reliability of EPA's 2009 scientific review that led to the endangerment finding, and has suggested new evidence casts doubt on its conclusions.

Representatives of Catholic and other faith organizations delivered boxes of public comments to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Sept. 17 in Washington, D.C. The groups collected nearly 10,000 comments from people of faith opposing the Trump administration's plans to reverse EPA's 2009 ""endangerment finding."" (FranciscanAction Network/Robert Christian)

In response, the U.S. National Academies of Sciences, Engineering and Medicine, which provides independent analysis to the government and policymakers, commissioned a new review of science and evidence around climate change. The 137-page report issued Sept. 17 concluded EPA's 2009 finding was accurate and has been reinforced since.

""The evidence for current and future harm to human health and welfare created by human-caused GHGs is beyond scientific dispute,"" the nation's leading scientific bodies wrote in the report.

""The United States faces a future in which climate-induced harm continues to worsen and today's extremes become tomorrow's norms,"" they said.

The past 10 years have been the hottest on record. Extreme weather events levied nearly $183 billion in damage in 2024 alone, while heat-related deaths in the U.S. have doubled since 1999.

In comments, many Catholics emphasized the ways human health — especially among already vulnerable populations like children, low-income families and the elderly — is put at risk through impacts of climate change, such as intensifying extreme heat and storms and increasing exposure to pollutants from wildfires and industrial plants burning fossil fuels.

""Rescinding the Endangerment Finding would erode life-saving public health protections and set the stage for irreversible harm to God's creation,"" said Franciscan Br. Jacek Orzechowski, associate director of the Laudato Si’ Center for Integral Ecology at Siena University in New York.

""All people living in the US are harmed by pollution in our air and water. You may think that repealing the Endangerment Finding will better our economy or our society. But it will not. … My Catholic faith compels me to urge you to leave the Endangerment Finding in place,"" wrote Patricia Sills-Trausch, a staff member at the Franciscan Renewal Center in Scottsdale, Arizona.

""Do the right thing, Mr. Zeldin. Protect the air we all breathe. Think about your daughters, and your daughters' children, and your daughters' children’s children,"" wrote Lindsay Nugent, a parishioner at St. Francis Xavier Church in Missoula, Montana.

A current and ongoing threat

During one of three public hearings in August, Dan Misleh, executive director of Catholic Climate Covenant, called the endangerment finding a moral issue for the Catholic community and the basis of air quality regulations protecting human health and the planet.

""The dumping of excess carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases into our atmosphere is, despite some who would deny it, a current and ongoing threat to our way of life and will subject future generations to untold suffering,"" he said in his Aug. 21 testimony.

In April, Misleh witnessed firsthand how emissions from petrochemical facilities harm local communities during a Catholic health conference in southern Louisiana's ""Cancer Alley,"" which has seen inflated rates of cancer and birth complications.

""It's clear that if states and the federal government don't regulate these industries properly, particularly for health impacts, they will just continue to operate in business as usual, and which means that they'll continue to pollute the neighboring communities,"" Misleh said in an interview.

""For the U.S. to pull back on that core [endangerment] finding basically allows polluters to just run wild,"" he said.",https://www.ncronline.org/files/styles/facebook_ratio/public/2025-09/9.23.25%20climate%20SOS.JPG?h=82f92a78&itok=KVcTpP_n,N,,2025-09-23 13:01:27.778948

These declines were not reflected in Germany, however, where average PPA prices increased by 1% between July and August.

While the consultancy has not yet published composite figures for September, it notes that the pace of new PPAs has increased significantly.

The company has around 500 employees at its base just outside Dallas working on development, manufacturing, distribution and more.

As of March 2025, EG4 assembles power inverters at the site, and has plans to further scale its US production footprint. Key to these plans is a new partnership with LG Energy Solution (LGES), comprising a six-year, multibillion-dollar contract for the supply of 13.275 GWh of lithium-iron phosphate battery cells, manufactured in the United States at LGES facility in Holland, Michigan. “Our partnership with LG Energy Solution is more than a supply agreement — it’s a commitment to possibility,” said James Showalter, CEO of EG4 Electronics. “Together, we are creating a future of renewable, reliable, and affordable energy that puts customers and communities first.”

At a time when various tariffs, domestic content requirements and other trade restrictions are coming to the US energy storage market, and many still rely on Chinese suppliers for battery cells, EG4 has been able to react and quickly move to an American made cell. With expected 60% import tariffs along with other additional costs for made in China products factored in, the cells from the LGES Michigan facility will be among the best priced on the US market. “When you calculate the actual value delivered to the site, the LG solutions just dominate. We feel they will be the best value into next year by a long shot,” said Showalter.

And tariff resilience is not the only advantage: The cells are backed by a 15-year warranty, offering improved terms compared to many other suppliers. “That’s something we’re looking to leverage in the market,” said Showalter. “It’s a concern that insurance companies have been pricing in, and we are very happy to be approaching the market with an American made product and seeing how this affects conversations around regulation and reliability.”

Much of EG4’s success to date has come from its ability to tap new markets. While residential energy storage development in the US has so far concentrated in California, the state represents only 13% of EG4’s revenue, and the company has seen strong performance elsewhere, including in Texas, Florida, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Illinois, among others.

With made-in-America supply secured, it expects to keep bringing a value prospect where residential storage has yet to take off, and is also eyeing the United States’ underdeveloped commercial battery market. “The missing spot has been that small and medium commercial sector. They have their tax credit on batteries protected until 2032, so that’s definitely a strong lane to be operating in.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/eg4-photo-1200x800.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 11:01:32.970271

Accretive Transaction Improves Sempra's Financial Strength

Efficiently Funds 2025–2029 Capital Plan without Equity Issuances

Reached Final Investment Decision for Port Arthur LNG Phase 2

Hosting Conference Call at 11 a.m. EST

SAN DIEGO, Sept. 23, 2025 /PRNewswire/ -- Sempra (NYSE: SRE) today announced several strategic actions that advance Sempra's corporate strategy. The company is executing on five value creation initiatives designed to simplify Sempra's business model, improve financial performance and reduce risk. The company expects these initiatives to strengthen its ability to deliver improved earnings growth while driving enhanced benefits for customers and communities across its service territories.

""The transactions announced today further Sempra's corporate strategy by advancing the company's capital recycling program and transition to a leading U.S. utility growth business,"" said Jeffrey W. Martin, chairman and CEO of Sempra.

Sale of Equity Stake in Sempra Infrastructure Partners

Sempra announced that it has agreed to sell a 45% equity interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, one of North America's leading energy infrastructure platforms, to affiliates of KKR, a leading global investment firm, with Canada Pension Plan Investment Board (CPP Investments).

Subject to adjustments, the transaction proceeds of $10 billion implies an equity value of $22.2 billion and an enterprise value of $31.7 billion for Sempra Infrastructure Partners.

Before adjustments, Sempra is expected to receive 47% of the cash at close, 41% by year-end 2027 and the balance approximately seven years after closing. This schedule helps Sempra generate attractive post-closing interest income as it efficiently reinvests proceeds over time in capital expenditures at its U.S. utilities.

The transaction is expected to close in Q2 – Q3 2026, subject to necessary regulatory and other approvals and closing conditions.

Upon closing, a KKR-led consortium will become the majority owner of Sempra Infrastructure Partners, holding a 65% equity stake, while Sempra will retain a 25% interest alongside Abu Dhabi Investment Authority's (ADIA) existing 10% stake. Under the terms of the agreement, Sempra and ADIA will have certain minority rights in Sempra Infrastructure Partners.

""The transaction announced today underscores our commitment to extend our strategic partnership with KKR, with whom we have a shared vision of improving America's position as a global leader in LNG exports,"" said Martin. ""It also directly supports our five value creation initiatives designed to simplify our business, efficiently fund strong utility growth in Texas and California and improve our financial strength.""

""Over the past four years, we have developed a close relationship with the Sempra Infrastructure Partners team and a deep understanding of their business,"" said Raj Agrawal, Global Head of Real Assets at KKR. ""We are excited to grow this strategic partnership and are pleased to welcome CPP Investments alongside us as we work to expand Sempra Infrastructure Partners' assets to help meet growing global demand for energy.""

The transaction also helps strengthen Sempra's credit profile, deconsolidates Sempra Infrastructure Partners, improves Sempra's business mix with a goal of approximately 95% earnings from regulated U.S. utilities and eliminates the need for equity issuances in the previously announced 2025-2029 capital plan.

Key expected benefits from the transaction announced today:

Sharpens focus on building a leading U.S. utility growth business

Reduces business risk by lowering exposure to non-utility investments

Strengthens balance sheet

Improves credit profile and FFO-to-debt

Adds five-year average annual accretion of $0.20 of earnings per common share (EPS) starting in 2027

Highlights value of LNG franchise

Eliminates planned common equity needs in previously announced 2025 – 2029 capital plan

Port Arthur Phase 2 Final Investment Decision

Sempra also announced today that Sempra Infrastructure Partners has reached a final investment decision to advance the development, construction and operation of Port Arthur LNG Phase 2. This new phase will include two natural gas liquefaction trains, one LNG storage tank and associated facilities with a nameplate capacity of approximately 13 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) of U.S.-produced LNG. Incremental project capital expenditures at Phase 2 are estimated at $12 billion, plus an approximate $2 billion payment for shared common facilities, with commercial operations expected in 2030 and 2031 for Trains 3 and 4, respectively.

Funding for Phase 2 is supported by an equity investment led by Blackstone Credit & Insurance, together with an investor consortium including KKR, Apollo-managed funds and Private Credit at Goldman Sachs Alternatives. Together these investors have acquired a 49.9% minority equity interest for $7 billion. Sempra Infrastructure Partners has retained a 50.1% majority stake in the project.

In addition to securing 100% equity financing, Sempra Infrastructure Partners has contracted with global engineering, construction and project management firm Bechtel Energy Inc., which has received full notice to proceed for the project. Bechtel's continued involvement from Phase 1 into Phase 2 is expected to drive favorable economics and help mitigate execution risk by leveraging efficiencies and learnings across phases.

Phase 2 is subscribed with long-term offtake under 20-year sales and purchase agreements with strategic partner ConocoPhillips as anchor, and high-quality counterparties EQT, JERA Co. Inc. and Sempra Infrastructure Partners. Consistent with industry practice, Sempra Infrastructure Partners expects to enter into additional offtake agreements from time to time to enhance the overall economic value of the project.

Earnings Guidance

Sempra is updating its full-year 2025 EPS guidance range prepared in accordance with Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (GAAP) to $3.29 to $3.69, reflecting actual results through the second quarter and certain estimated tax impacts related to the equity sale transaction announced today that are expected to be recognized in the third quarter, and affirming its full-year 2025 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.30 to $4.70. With the Sempra Infrastructure Partners equity sale transaction expected to close in Q2 — Q3 of 2026, Sempra is affirming its full-year 2026 adjusted EPS guidance range of $4.80 to $5.30. The company is also affirming its guidance to the high-end or above its projected long-term EPS compound annual growth rate of 7% to 9% for 2025 through 2029. Sempra intends to provide an update to its five-year capital plan during its fourth-quarter earnings call in February 2026, subject to completion of the base rate review at Oncor.

Non-GAAP Financial Measures

Non-GAAP financial measures include Sempra's adjusted EPS guidance ranges and net debt, which is used in the calculation of implied enterprise value. See Table A for additional information regarding these non-GAAP financial measures.

SEMPRA ADJUSTED EPS GUIDANCE RANGE

Sempra 2025 and 2026 Adjusted EPS Guidance Ranges are non-GAAP financial measures. These non-GAAP financial measures exclude significant items that are generally not related to our ongoing business activities and/or infrequent in nature. These non-GAAP financial measures also exclude the impact from foreign currency and inflation on our monetary positions in Mexico and net unrealized gains and losses on commodity and interest rate derivatives, which we expect to occur in future periods, and which can vary significantly from one period to the next. Exclusion of these items is useful to management and investors because it provides a meaningful comparison of the performance of Sempra's business operations to prior and future periods. Non-GAAP financial measures are supplementary information that should be considered in addition to, but not as a substitute for, the information prepared in accordance with GAAP.

RECONCILIATION OF SEMPRA 2025 ADJUSTED EPS GUIDANCE RANGE TO SEMPRA 2025 GAAP EPS GUIDANCE RANGE

Sempra 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance Range of $4.30 to $4.70 excludes items (after the effects of income taxes and, if applicable, noncontrolling interests) as follows:

$(25) million impact from regulatory disallowances related to the recovery of coronavirus disease 2019 costs at Sempra California for the six months ended June 30, 2025

$(89) million impact from foreign currency and inflation on our monetary positions in Mexico for the six months ended June 30, 2025

$(10) million net unrealized losses on commodity derivatives for the six months ended June 30, 2025

$(8) million net unrealized losses on interest rate swaps related to the Port Arthur LNG liquefaction project (PA LNG Phase 1 project) for the six months ended June 30, 2025

$(526) million tax items related to assets held for sale at Sempra Infrastructure, which such amounts could change in future periods until the dates of sale:

$(500) million income tax expense that will be recognized in the third quarter of 2025 to adjust deferred tax liabilities related to our outside basis differences in Sempra Infrastructure Partners, LP (Sempra Infrastructure Partners), changes to state income tax apportionment, and valuation allowances against certain tax attribute carryforwards

$(26) million income tax expense that was recognized in the second quarter of 2025 due to the recognition of a Mexican deferred tax liability on our outside basis difference in Ecogas México, S. de R.L. de C.V. (Ecogas)

Sempra 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance Range should not be considered an alternative to Sempra 2025 GAAP EPS Guidance Range. The table below reconciles Sempra 2025 Adjusted EPS Guidance Range to Sempra 2025 GAAP EPS Guidance Range, which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP.

SEMPRA 2026 ADJUSTED EPS GUIDANCE RANGE

We are unable to reconcile Sempra 2026 Adjusted EPS Guidance Range of $4.80 to $5.30 to Sempra 2026 GAAP EPS Guidance Range, which we consider to be the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with GAAP, because we cannot reasonably estimate the forward-looking amount or range of amounts of reasonably estimable GAAP amounts for, or the probable significance of, each of the following future events:

impact from foreign currency and inflation on our monetary positions in Mexico

net unrealized gains and losses on commodity derivatives

net unrealized gains and losses on interest rate swaps related to the PA LNG Phase 1 project

any potential gain from the proposed sale of Ecogas

any potential gain from the agreement to sell an equity interest in Sempra Infrastructure Partners to KKR Partners that was entered into in September 2025, as the purchase price is subject to closing adjustments, post-closing adjustments, and tax items related to our outside basis difference in Sempra Infrastructure Partners that is subject to adjustments based on changes in carrying value, foreign exchange rates and inflation until the date of sale

SEMPRA INFRASTRUCTURE PARTNERS ENTERPRISE VALUE

Management and external users, such as industry analysts and investors, use Enterprise Value (EV) as a supplemental measure of valuation of Sempra Infrastructure Partners. EV is calculated using an implied equity value based on transaction proceeds adjusted for Projected Proportionate Net Debt at December 31, 2025, which represents a non-GAAP financial measure. This non-GAAP financial measure should not be considered in isolation or as a substitute for the amount prepared in accordance with GAAP.

Projected Proportionate Net Debt includes Sempra Infrastructure Partners' proportionate ownership interest in expected net debt at unconsolidated equity method investees and excludes such amounts attributable to noncontrolling interests.

Rising competition, higher costs, and a bruised brand thanks to CEO Elon Musk's political involvement are all putting pressure on the company.

Some investors are hopeful for a turnaround. Tesla's stock recently got a bump after Musk purchased $1 billion worth of shares. The purchase was likely a way for Musk to signal to Tesla's board that he's committed to the company as he seeks a pay package that's worth up to an eye-popping $975 billion, if certain goals are met.

But Tesla faces serious challenges. Declining profits and shrinking cash reserves limit its ability to reinvest just as Musk is pushing the company to expand into new growth areas, including robotics and autonomous vehicles (AVs). Without the profits and cash to do so, it's a big question whether the company will be able to pivot to these new industries -- or even if it should.

While Rivian's success is nowhere near guaranteed -- especially given the difficult EV environment -- I think it's the better EV stock right now. Tesla's falling profits and shrinking cash availability put it in a tough spot as it tries to transition to robotics and AVs. Investors will still need to be patient with Rivian, though, as the company navigates a challenging period for the EV industry.

While thousands of publications discuss indoor agriculture, only 748 identified through bibliographic search reference energy use, among which 116 provide adequate data for analysis and intercomparisons. The 154 evaluated locations span a broad range of climates and potential solar energy resources (latitudes −0°S to 71°N) in 40 countries and Antarctica, with few located in lower-income countries (Fig. 1) (Table S1). These studies emerge from diverse research communities, the earliest dating from 1993 followed by low publication levels throughout the ensuing 25 years, after which activity increased markedly.

In reviewing the literature, no limitations were placed on geography, cultivation scale, or type of crop. Some were research or demonstration facilities, but all were represented as relevant to commercial production. Inclusion of studies in the compilation required sufficient data to determine aggregate energy use and yields for an entire year (often involving multiple cultivation cycles) and to compute normalized energy per unit yield (MJ/kg) or energy per unit production area (MJ/m2 growing surface). Cases were excluded where major fuels or uses were omitted, seasonal variations not accurately captured, energy needs reported only indirectly in terms of greenhouse-gas emissions, or commercial “on-farm” energy use combined with that of labor, solar gains, or off-farm uses. Some sources were excluded where authors confused energy use with peak electricity demands and/or results were expressed in terms of loads, i.e., not accounting for on-site conversion efficiencies.

The identified literature includes measured or modeled energy use for 486 cultivation trials and 23 crop types, with 57% of the estimates being model-based and 43% measurement-based, the latter cohort representing 1686 production sites with an aggregate cultivation area of 14.6 million m2. Of all cases, 59% were in greenhouses and 41% in plant factories. Energy use values for open-field cultivation use were offered for comparison in only 12 of the studies.

Orders-of-magnitude variation in energy use

The compiled energy intensities exhibit extraordinary variability (Figs. 2a, b and 3a–h). Differences are evident among and within crop types, facility types, and geographies. Other potential causes of divergence include yields per unit of growing area, energy efficiency, and various lighting factors including type, contribution of daylight, illuminance levels (PPFD), and artificial lighting on-times (photoperiod).

Lettuce and tomatoes exhibit loosely overlapping energy intensities, while herbs and leafy greens tend to be somewhat more energy intensive, cucumbers the least energy-intensive, and cannabis the most energy-intensive crop by orders of magnitude (Fig. 4a, b). Approaching the lower bound of cannabis are soybeans and wheat (gray and black markers) which are both found to be uneconomic given the high required energy inputs–despite use of LED lighting, high-efficiency heating and cooling systems, and a well-insulated facility envelope in the case of wheat. Microgreens are also among the more energy-intensive crops.

When grouped by facility type (Fig. 4c), greenhouses are the least energy-intensive (median 27 MJ/kg), followed by plant factories (127 MJ/kg) which includes 23,300 MJ/kg for cannabis and 78 MJ/kg for non-cannabis crops. While not always identifiable in the source literature, less-mechanized “open” greenhouses appear to operate between 1.5 and 5 MJ/kg. Yield intensities (kg/m2-y) in greenhouses fully overlap with those of plant factories, with far less energy input, an observation that has been made by others20. For comparison, the median value for open-field crops is only ~1 MJ/kg.

Depending on metric, median energy intensities of facilities without identified energy-efficiency measures are only 1% (MJ/kg) and 3% (MJ/m2-y) higher than those with one or more efficiency features (Fig. 3a–f) although the variation is expectedly greater for those not identifying the presence of energy efficiency features (Fig. 2a, b). While individual side-by-side studies clearly show energy savings from efficiency measures, many other factors appear to have more influence on the overall sample outcomes. Energy intensities are uncorrelated with facility size for both metrics (Fig. S1).

No substantial differences between energy use for modeled and measured results are evident (Fig. 3g, h). Detailed validations of models against measured data for a given facility are uncommon. Model results appear to assume systematically higher annual yields — which translates to lower energy intensities — perhaps reflecting idealized conditions and neglecting real-world factors such as crop losses.

Energy consumption at the end-use level is disaggregated in 191 cases (Fig. 4). This information is valuable for understanding drivers of energy use and identifying opportunities to improve energy efficiency. For example, dehumidification represents more than half of total energy use for cannabis cultivation in hot and humid locations while heating is negligible compared to cold climates where dehumidification is minimal and heating represents about two-thirds of total energy use. Wide variations in end-use shares are notable even for a given crop or facility type.

This large and diversified sample reveals findings not captured by less-comprehensive studies, and distinguishes energy intensities by crop and facility type. It also provides a counterpoint to claims based on far smaller samples that energy use is largely insensitive to climate13,21,22,23,24. End-use analysis also helps scrutinize rules-of-thumb, e.g., that all plant factories have the same end-use breakdowns23 or the assumption that a multiplier of 1.25 can be readily applied to lighting energy to obtain total energy use25,26,27. In practice, per Fig. 4, artificial lighting can constitute between ~0% and ~95% total energy use.

Extreme CEA: Arctic and Antarctic applications are particularly energy-intensive

CEA facilities are operated by five countries in Antarctica28 to produce food and conduct research for space-based applications. Interestingly, despite minimum temperatures of −43.5 °C, greenhouses with ultra-high-efficiency envelopes are employed in some cases to take advantage of daylight and minimize fuel use or costly solar installations. Measured energy intensities of ~17,000 MJ/kg for mixed vegetables7 are among the highest in the meta-analysis, and more than 200-times greater than the median for food production.

Energy intensities of ~6000 MJ/kg occur for cucumbers in container farms in the Canadian arctic8, where fresh produce must otherwise be flown into Inuit villages. Despite the waste heat from lighting and dehumidification meeting nearly all heating needs, nearly 50 kW of on-site renewable energy and battery storage, plus diesel generator backup, is needed to support this modest 6.7 m2 growing area.

In Icelandic greenhouses, heat is required year-round, with supplemental lighting much of the year, along with summertime cooling29. Significant additional energy use is associated with melting snow from greenhouse glazing. Energy intensities are 2600–5800 MJ/kg for low-calorie crops such as lettuce and tomatoes.

The cannabis conundrum: the most energy-intensive crop

Cannabis emerges as the most energy-intensive crop (Figs. 2 and 3), and represents approximately 95% of present-day US CEA crop value30,31. About 63% of this cannabis (legal and illicit) is produced in CEA facilities, representing 17% of the country’s overall CEA facility footprint. Little data on cannabis cultivation is available for other countries.

Likely drivers for the relative energy inefficiency include the yield being measured in dry- rather than wet-weight, high crop losses from interdiction and other factors, high proportions of unused and woody biomass (low harvest index), long cultivation cycles (~70 days) and photoperiods (12–18 h/d), higher lighting intensities (PPFDs up to 1323 micromoles/m2/s) creating corresponding elevated cooling needs, lower tolerable humidity levels (50–60%), unsuitability for multi-layer vertical farming, higher air-circulation rates, and higher levels of CO2 enrichment than most food crops (1000–1200 ppm are common).

In the U.S., cannabis has become the largest cash crop, while releasing CO2 emissions at the rate of ten million cars with an energy expenditure of $11 billion each year31. While there is general debate about the environmental merits of urban agriculture11, the expansion of factory-farm cannabis cultivation into cities has raised distinct secondary energy issues, including strain on power grids, significant power outages, and environmental justice concerns31.

Notably, the broader literature on CEA crop production is virtually devoid of reference to cannabis, while that on cannabis rarely provides comparisons to other crops. LCA analyses for cannabis are rare31,32,33.

Energy is a constraint to producing essential staple crops

Multiple studies find that because fruits, cereals, legumes, seeds, root crops, and other high-protein/high-calorie staple crops are significantly more energy-intensive than crops such as lettuce and herbs they cannot be cost-competitively produced under CEA15,20,29,34,35. For example, even at scale, strawberries from CEA facilities are priced at ten-times that of their field-grown equivalents4.

In another study, soybeans had among the highest energy intensity26 of all food crops in this meta-analysis. While yields were up to six-times greater than open-field soybeans, energy intensity was 1000- to 2000-times greater, even with energy-efficient LED lighting.

Asseng et al.34 model a hypothetical 18,225 m2, 10-story wheat-production facility with high energy efficiency (insulation, heat pumps, LED lights, and heat-recovery ventilation). To maximize yields (63-times greater than field-grown wheat), very high illuminance levels (5- to 10-times that of most other studies in this compilation) are assumed to be delivered 24 h per day, with natural background levels of atmospheric CO2 tripled (to 1200 ppm) to accelerate plant growth. Estimated energy costs for the facility are $16 M/y based on an inexplicably low assumed price of $0.02/kWh – versus an average US industrial price of $0.09/kWh in summer 202436 – representing 77% of total operational costs, or $13/kg yield, greatly exceeding the value of the commodity.

Prospects for greater adoption of energy efficient technologies are constrained

In a global survey of greenhouse and plant-factory operators37, two thirds report not employing any energy efficiency strategies. Providing insight as to why uptake is low, another industry survey identified multiple barriers, in order of decreasing severity: upfront costs (compounded by narrow profit margins), access to capital and financing, lack of knowledge, skepticism and lack of trust in the performance of efficient technologies, lack of executive support, and insufficient training38. Cultivators of even the most energy-intensive crops demand, on average, a rapid 4-year payback time on their energy efficiency investments39. While some qualitative assessments are optimistic9, model studies document a limited cost-effective energy savings potential of <10% for most measures in cannabis farms40, which should be among the most promising applications given the high energy use and expenditures.

The benefits of LED lighting have been found to be highly variable. In field trials, Leichleiter et al.41 found energy savings ranging from negligible to substantial depending on cultivar. Measurement-based studies for tomato production found LED lighting required augmentation with less-efficient high-pressure sodium (HPS) lighting42. The efficacy of LED products appears to also be an issue, given the 2.2-fold variance in yields of microgreens per unit of energy depending on LED manufacturer43.

Facility energy efficiencies among the sites included in the meta-analysis vary widely, with some having single-glazing, combustion heating systems, minimal insulation, low-efficiency lighting, and deficiencies in system operation44. However, compared to the aforementioned industry surveys, a disproportionate number of studies in the meta-analysis involved one or more energy-efficiency measures (Fig. 3e, f). Such measures were reported in 50% of the studies and 70% of the cases (individual measurement trials or model runs), including 60% with LEDs, 24% with heat pumps, 15% with insulation, 3% with evaporative cooling, 2% with economizer cooling, and 1% with multiple glazing. The potential for energy efficiency – within a given CEA facility type – is thus already partly captured, while facility operators perceive many barriers to further adoption.

For indoor agriculture (and all other industries) the primary path to full decarbonization requires conversion of all energy uses to electricity, and then producing that electricity with renewable energy. Electrification also offers unique opportunities for energy efficiency (e.g., heat pumps instead of combustion heating). Just under 60% of the facilities reviewed here are all-electric. If not provided for at the time of construction, capital requirements for such conversions are substantial.

Process change can reduce or increase energy efficiency

The choice of CEA facility type (greenhouse instead of plant factory) is perhaps the single-most impactful determinant of energy efficiency. A few studies document other promising forms of process change. These include measures such as reducing photoperiod and light intensity in the case of Stevia45, growing strawberry runners outdoors before bringing them into the controlled environment for flowering and fruiting35, and varying fertigation techniques, light levels, lighting location, and greenhouse operation46. Light deprivation is commonly used in plant-factory and greenhouse operations to compress cultivation times for cannabis and certain other crops, thereby reducing energy requirements. Pennisi et al.47 varied the spectrum of LED lighting, finding variations in energy use for lettuce (1.5x) and chicory (1.2x). Field tests in Australia48 found that optimizing planting dates can yield energy savings in cool winters. Increasing yield was found to improve efficiency for tomatoes bred to also thrive at slightly lower temperatures49. One particularly effective case study utilized root-zone cooling for cucumbers in the extreme United Arab Emirates climate, lowering energy use by 20-fold while maintaining yields50. While AI may play a role in attaining operational benefits24, it also requires substantial energy inputs.

Cultivar choice can also impact energy use, yet only one-quarter of cases in this review identify the exact cultivar, and few of these explore the energy implications. Almeida et al.51 attribute some of their observed differences in energy intensity to the choice of tomato cultivars. Leichleiter et al.41 found a 6-fold difference in energy intensity of different types of cannabis cultivated in otherwise identical plant factories. It is proposed that genetic engineering can develop cultivars that grow better under energy-efficient LED lighting52.

Site selection is also a key variable. One study53 found that the most energy-efficient approach to cucumber greenhouse cultivation in Norway was summertime cultivation in the southern part of the country, with moveable glazing insulation and no artificial lighting. Replicating that same method in the north increased energy intensity by 51%, with 11% reduced yields.

Conversely, efficiency losses can arise from efforts to increase yields. Early efforts to increase yields in the Netherlands included increased CO2 enrichment, which was produced by burning fossil fuels on site54. Elevating CO2 levels requires increased light levels to support amplified photosynthesis, which, in turn, boosts transpiration and dehumidification energy needs. In another example, reducing temperatures for tomato greenhouses in a hot desert climate resulted in an 18% increase in energy use for a 0.35% increase in yield55. Some studies found that yields level off or even decline appreciably with increasing light inputs, and, conversely, in some cases greenhouses without artificial light achieve less energy input per unit of yield without sacrificing product quality20,42,46,56,57. Microgreen yields declined by 23% in Chile as light application was increased by 144% while energy intensity increased 72%58. Qualitatively similar results were observed in Russia59. In southern Norway, while intensified cucumber production with artificial lighting, cooling, and year-round cultivation tripled yields, it also increased energy intensity by 88%53.

In a further complication, certain efforts to reduce non-energy environmental impacts can increase energy use. For example, water recovery from exhaust air is energy intensive20 and steam-cleaning soils for re-use rather than disposal60 can double on-farm energy use.

Shifting to renewable energy can negate the land-use benefits of intensive indoor cultivation

The elevated yields of CEA facilities are often credited with creating “freed” or “spared” land that can ostensibly be returned to a wild state4. In response to concerns about energy use, it is also commonly stated that CEA facilities can become more sustainable if fully powered with renewable energy to achieve net-zero emissions – yet these propositions rarely quantify the associated land requirements.

Individual case studies8,34,61,62,63,64,65,66,67 report that on-site solar electricity would require land areas ranging from 2- to 100-times the facility’s floor area – often more than that needed for open-field cultivation. A techno-economic optimization for US-based greenhouses (which are significantly less energy-intensive than plant factories) found the approach not to be cost-effective except in the mildest climates68. Moreover, diversion of renewable energy for discretionary indoor cultivation is problematic given the current need to dramatically reduce global emissions in other sectors in order to manage rising climate risk, while the practical constraints on renewable energy expansion are many, ranging from ecological to cultural conflicts17,20,31.

Figure 5 shows the standardized area required to meet all on-farm energy needs with solar photovoltaic (PV) power for cases in the meta-analysis. In all cases, the array area exceeds the building footprint. The average ground-mounted PV area (panels in excess of what will fit on the roof) required for food-producing greenhouses is 4-times their building footprint, 48-times for food-producing plant factories, and 122-times for cannabis-producing plant factories. In the best cases, highly energy-efficient greenhouses (envelope, lighting, and equipment) in an ideal solar climate (Turkey) required an array area equal to building footprint, but this outcome is rare. The largest solar arrays are required for energy-intensive crops and vertical-farming facilities for food crops with multiple cultivation layers and/or multiple-stories. The extreme case, a skyscraper lettuce-production greenhouse in a sunny Los Angeles location would require a PV array ~600-times its footprint to meet target lighting levels beyond what daylight provides. Inconveniently, multi-layer vertical farming ostensibly spares the most land (albeit before counting the solar requirements)4.

In the US, typical ratios of CEA to open-field yields per unit of land area include: cucumbers 22:1, lettuces 12-21:1, peppers 6-12:1, 4.9:1 for cannabis, tomatoes 4:1, and strawberries 1.4:110,69. As can be seen in Fig. 5, the required additional solar land areas are generally much higher than these multiples. Not included in the analysis is land area for electrical transmission lines, fossil fuel mining and processing, or other renewable energy land uses (hydroelectric, wind, etc.). While no all-electric open-field cases were identified, such farms would only require a minor fractional expansion of land area to achieve net-zero emissions with solar PV. Moreover, the ratios shown above compare conventional open-field results rather than best practices (which use less land area), suggesting that optimal open-field cultivation could be even more competitive on a land-use basis.

Energy-determinative dynamics of controlled environment agriculture: technologies and markets

Narratives describing advantages of CEA compared to open-field agriculture inform the assessment of energy needs and environmental impact4,9,45,70,71. Key stated benefits include control of environmental factors (temperature, light, humidity), shortened crop cycles, an extended growing season, and increasing output with high predictability. The degree to which yields exceed those of open-field farming varies widely as a function of cultivar and practices, and outdoor conditions where competing open-field cultivation would occur10. Other stipulated benefits include reduced transportation energy in delivering crops to market, exposure to pests and natural hazards, land-area requirements, soil degradation and erosion, fertilizer use, water use, soil-derived greenhouse-gas emissions, odor nuisance, food-safety risks, and commodity shrinkage and spoilage if facilities are located closer to markets. These technical aspirations are often rhetorically tied to broader goals including environmental protection, public health, and affordable and equitable availability of food for a growing land-constrained population.

For each of these stated advantages are caveats and countervailing concerns15. In some cases, unique collateral problems are associated with energy and mechanization and bringing cultivation closer to population centers, including light pollution and odor nuisance72. Reduced transport distances do not predictably lower overall carbon footprints15. More broadly, in an intrinsic contradiction, greenhouse-gas emissions from CEA’s energy use—which can exceed that of open-field cultivation—exacerbate the very climate risks the practice is hoped to shield against11. Disaster-resilience is an oft-cited benefit73, although CEA has acutely greater vulnerability to utility disruptions (power and water) than open-field agriculture, more costly potential damage to cultivation infrastructure, and substantial added capital cost for backup electricity generation and nuisance while in operation. The advantages of CEA in terms of water and land requirements only hold when moderate open-field yields are assumed and system boundaries omit the land and water required for energy production69.

Nonetheless, CEA has high appeal and is well-established for certain crop types and geographies. For example, most microgreens and commercial mushrooms are grown in plant factories. Geographically-isolated Iceland imports about two-thirds of its vegetables, by calorie count29, while the land-constrained island state of Singapore imports 90% of its food74. Greenhouses provide one-third of fresh vegetables imported to the US from Mexico10, ~60% of vegetable production in Iran75,76, and virtually all non-summer cultivation in Siberia77. In Norway, virtually all tomatoes, 90% of cucumbers, and 13% of lettuce are grown in greenhouses78. The highest-value crops are the most viable, as in the case of cannabis for which US wholesale prices are ~$2000/kg, yet, energy costs remain a concerning factor and one-third of production continues to be conducted outdoors31.

The scale of CEA practices is increasing. Globally, greenhouses occupy an estimated land area of 1.3–3.7 million ha – an unknown fraction being heated or artificially illuminated – of which closed glass houses comprise ~70 kha79,80. No reliable estimates have been identified for plant factories, but they likely number in the low thousands of hectares. As an illustration at the national scale, CEA production in the US occurs in in ~11,000 greenhouse farms, spanning 19.4 Mm2 plus 3.1 Mm2 for mushrooms30 and 4.6 million m2 for cannabis cultivation in a mix of greenhouse and plant-factory settings81 (Table S2).

On-farm energy use is a leading determinant of overall climate impacts from crop production (Table 1). Energy uses include electricity, diesel, natural gas, propane, coal, biofuels, on-site renewable energy, and industrial waste heat76,82,83,84,85,86,87 Energy needs are driven by artificial lighting, heating, space cooling due to solar gains in greenhouses and substantial waste-heat from lighting, and dehumidification. For certain crops and geographies, greenhouses can avoid the need for artificial lighting, but since artificial lighting can increase yields, and provide sometimes-useful waste heat, many greenhouses rely heavily on it87. Secondary energy-using activities include ventilation, irrigation water temperature control, crop drying, water pumping and irrigation, snow-melting, carbon-dioxide enrichment, post-harvest soil steaming for disinfection, water recovery and on-site treatment, harvesting and other on-site crop handling or processing, cold storage, robotics or other automation, and AI or other computing associated with process control.

In addition to technical issues are energy-related market challenges. CEA capital costs–much of which trace to energy infrastructure–far exceed those for open-field agriculture and are reported to range from $550–$1600/m2 for greenhouses and $1600–$4300/m2 for plant factories88. Some authors note that capital costs are orders of magnitude higher for CEA than for open-field operations, and a single facility can cost hundreds of millions of dollars4,89. Land costs are also higher in urban and peri-urban areas, which is where CEA is often proposed as a means of reducing food-transportation distances.

As a reflection of these costs, many CEA producers fail to attain profitability89. Operating costs for energy constitute a larger share of expenses than most other industries (Table 2) – and were at the root of early vertical farming start-up bankruptcies5,9,15,20,67,90. A late-1970s effort known as Phytofarms was abandoned by General Mills in 1982, purchased by another entity (for $20 M in today’s dollars), and operated until 1992, with utility costs named as a major factor in its ultimate bankruptcy4. Other well-capitalized companies (Google, General Electric, GTE, Sylvania, and Weyerhaeuser) also abandoned early efforts4. The current-day cannabis industry also faces solvency issues, tied in part to energy intensity31. Energy costs are ultimately borne by consumers in the form of elevated commodity prices, which can negate socioeconomic benefits of growing nearer to the point of demand, particularly for lower-income consumers35,91,92.

Contextualizing aggregate energy demand for indoor agriculture

It is helpful to put the energy intensity of CEA in context with other uses, and to similarly assess the aggregate energy demand. As an illustration, the median energy intensity (MJ/m2-y) for food crops grown in plant factories is 5-times that of the average US office building, while for the most intensive food crops the ratio is 90-times greater. Righini et al.26 estimate of 16 MWh to provide a year’s worth of protein per person with soybeans grown in plant factories is on par with the requirements of an all-electric home with two electric vehicles. Moreover, while the energy embodied in producing 1 kg of usable protein from open-field soybeans ranges from 1.5 to 3% that of producing that same protein from beef, soybeans grown in plant factories require 4500- to 9000-times more energy than open-field farming and thus 60- to 120-times more than producing protein via beef (Table S3).

The literature review revealed no prior estimates of aggregate national energy use associated with CEA, aside from cannabis31,93. Results of this meta-analysis enable the determination that current on-farm energy use for 15 primary CEA food crops (representing 7.4% of all yields of those crops) is 735 PJ/year, exceeding that to produce all crops under open-field conditions (Table S4)94. Approximately half this energy use is attributable to cannabis cultivation. The total CEA food- crop production is <1% of all US food-crop supply (~7% of vegetables), by weight, and much less by calorie content. The cultivation area represented in this analysis is only about one-fifth the total protected area when including crops such as bedding plants, florist products, hemp, nursery plants, and sod (Table S2).

CEA energy demand is currently ~1% of the US total (all sectors). In a scoping estimate in which all applicable crops are produced in plant factories (Fig. 6), this would increase to up to 7% of all US energy consumption (10-times current energy use for all open-field crops) (Table S5), exceeding that of many other segments of the economy (Fig. 7). The hypothetical land area required to produce this CEA energy with solar photovoltaic arrays would be triple that currently used for outdoor production of these same crops.

Improving assessment practices: Nuances of energy analysis and benchmarking

The choice of energy metrics is critical to meaningful performance benchmarking16,95. In the energy literature, CEA facilities are typically rated in terms of energy per unit of floor area44,62,67,68,87,96, a metric useful for energy-infrastructure planning, assessing burdens on the grid, etc. The choice of net cultivation area or gross facility area (e.g., including aisles or office areas) can have a marked effect on computed intensities, but the distinction is often not made in the CEA literature. Metrics based on yield are standard in the agronomy and LCA literature – and in the agricultural industry itself – illuminating the energy-efficiency of the cultivation process while being insensitive to definition of planted area or cultivation periods. Occasionally, other functional units are used, e.g., sweetener metabolite for Stevia45, kilocalories for mushrooms97, protein for soybeans26, or potency for cannabis41.

Defining a system boundary that articulates which energy-using processes are considered is essential to achieving clear and usable metrics. In practice, the literature is often imprecise in these definitions or otherwise quantitatively or conceptually ambiguous, e.g., regarding inclusion of energy inputs during production of seedlings or clones. Some studies omit specific energy types such as fuel for heating, end uses such as cooling, on-site electricity generation by diesel generators, or energy used on-site to produce CO2, post-harvest processing, cold storage, etc. Others normatively include only single energy uses, e.g., heating98,99, or lighting27,100, or only measure total energy use while lighting is on13,101,102, heating and cooling103,104, during only part of the cultivation cycle105, only seasonally106, or during even briefer periods of monitoring thus missing the seasonal effects of fluctuations in weather and daylighting107. Test facilities are sometimes located inside other buildings47,108, with studies failing to measure the heating and cooling provided from the surrounding conditioned space.

The literature can also present incommensurate values with respect to the system boundary. For example, in some cases a portion of the injected CO2 is made on-site and part off-site53,109. Similarly, one study counted irrigation energy and substantial post-harvest weight loss due to commodity shrinkage during transport for open-field operations but not for CEA operations91. In an assessment of mushroom cultivation, the most energy-intensive process (composting) was conducted on-farm in one case and off-farm in another, resulting in a ten-fold difference in energy intensity between facilities that reflected energy accounting rather than actual energy efficiency110. Some assessments include energy input from human labor and sunlight (in the form of heat as well as illumination).

Other nuances arise from study duration and net yields. Most CEA crops can be grown multiple times each year. To extrapolate annual energy use from a single reported cycle one must know the cycle duration and any possible seasonal limitations or yield variability. The energy use embodied in pre- and post-harvest crop losses should also be added to the calculations, but rarely is. Cannabis is particularly impacted in this latter respect through a combination of losses due to disease (mold outbreaks are common), interdiction, and product destruction or recalls due to consumer safety testing failures that can collectively result in 20% losses nationally31.

Studies reporting only carbon footprint19,111,112 have limited usefulness for energy analysis since the underlying energy intensity and types of constituent fuels and electricity are obscured, which is important when evaluating tradeoffs between fossil-fuel transport and electrified cultivation. Even studies providing both views show that emissions comparisons can obscure differences in underlying energy use91. This is particularly problematic when outcomes from countries with low-emissions electricity are compared to those with more carbon-intensive grids113. An emissions focus can mask caveats to conclusions and policy recommendations, as in a study set in Sweden which found lower CO2 emissions for vertically-farmed lettuce and basil than for field-grown lettuce commonly imported from southern Europe108. As Sweden’s grid is almost entirely based on zero-emissions nuclear and hydroelectric power, recalibration of those results to US conditions results in a 20-fold increase in total CEA emissions. Another Swedish study found domestic emissions below those of crop imports only in summer, excluding cooling energy114.

A model-based assessment of tomato production in Norwegian greenhouses further illuminates how assumptions can shape findings. Surprisingly, summertime cultivation in un-lit greenhouses was found to be more carbon-intensive than year-round cultivation. This arose from inappropriately comparing summer heating at low efficiency with fossil fuels and in some cases less facility insulation to heat pumps and lighting in winter at high efficiency powered with carbon-free hydroelectric electricity82. Wintertime heating is thus decarbonized and waste heat from electric light further substitutes for fuel. The comparisons also appear to involve variations in the mix of CO2 produced on-site with fossil fuel vs. purchased CO2 canisters for which the embodied energy and carbon is outside the system boundary and thus not counted. The evaluation of facility characteristics and seasonality are thus conflated with the influences of fuel, heating efficiencies, lighting, and perhaps varying system boundary conditions. With identical heating fuels and efficiencies, seasonal summer production would have the lowest carbon footprint per unit yield.

Improving assessment practices: Joint of measurement and modeling

Some CEA energy estimates are measurement-based while others are modeled. Measurement provides a “ground-truth” of sorts, albeit often with caveats, and helps identify potentially unmodeled uses (e.g., snow-melting on greenhouses). Modeling allows explicit articulation of system boundaries; annualized estimation under long-term average weather; and assessment of sensitivity to interior climate setpoints, building geometry, and outdoor climatic conditions while accounting for energetic trade-offs between factors such as lighting and cooling loads as a function of solar gains. Co-modeling of energy together with evapotranspiration, photoperiod, and other crop dynamics captures implications for energy-using processes such as dehumidification or lighting needs and how yields may vary as a function of energy inputs (Table 3).

Model studies also offer advantages insofar as they control for or at least make transparent the “noisy” drivers underlying measured data, and enable rapid and less costly parametric analyses and scenario studies44,67 but are also susceptible to specification error and unrealistic assumptions. Energy-agronomy interactions are complex and challenging to model, while empirical data intrinsically captures the effects.

Comparing model results to measured data can help design, validate, and calibrate models and ensure realism35,44,67,68,115,116,117,118,119,120. Measurement and modeling can be combined to achieve more comprehensive assessments8,31,56. While estimating the benefits of energy efficiency measures is far easier with modeling – especially for ensembles of measures — some studies44,46,121 have done so in actual facilities, providing added confidence in the findings.

Assumptions often favor CEA over open-field cultivation and transport energy use

The literature occasionally compares CEA outcomes to open-field practices (Fig. 3c, d), often citing values for different crops and geographies and comparing optimized and high-tech indoor methods to average open-field practices (rather than best practices). CEA yields for “protected” practices are reported to be 1.5 to 20-times greater than open-field cultivation, depending on crop10. More intensive open-field methods have been documented to increase yields by 2- to 3-fold122,123 above standard practices, which would reduce the yield gap by half to two-thirds and correspondingly widen the differences in energy intensity in favor of open-field cultivation. It is rare that analyses offer sensitivities to baseline open-field energy use or emissions reductions as a function of energy efficiency or renewable energy.",https://media.springernature.com/m685/springer-static/image/art%3A10.1038%2Fs44264-025-00091-z/MediaObjects/44264_2025_91_Fig1_HTML.png,N,,2025-09-23 14:01:44.029304

Commenting in a release was Ben Hertz-Shargel, global head of grid edge for Wood Mackenzie: “Utility programme caps, capacity accreditation reforms, and market barriers have prevented capacity from growing as fast as market activity.”

Market maturation continues

The share of VPP wholesale market capacity from residential customers increased to 10.2%, from 8.8% in 2024, still reflecting market barriers to small customers. Third-party data access for enrolment and market settlement are the primary blockers.

Leading markets

California, Texas, New York, and Massachusetts are the leading states, representing 37% of VPP deployments. Meanwhile, PJM and ERCOT, the regions with the greatest utility commitments to data centre capacity, also have the greatest disclosed VPP offtake capacity.

“While data centres are the source of new load, there’s an enormous opportunity to tap VPPs as the new source of grid flexibility,” said Hertz-Shargel.

Offtake growth

The top 25 VPP offtakers procured over 100MW each this year, while over half of all offtakers increased the number of deployments under them by at least 30% compared to last year, showing the breadth of the market.

An ‘independent distributed power producer’ business model has emerged, whose thesis is that energy arbitrage and grid service revenue can finance an electricity retailer’s third-party-owned storage offering.

Regulatory pushback

A majority of VPP aggregators and software providers do not support utilities rate basing DERs, a key plank of the Distributed Capacity Procurement model for utilities. “This model is seen as limiting access of private capital and aggregators from the DER market, rather than leveraging customer and third-party-owned resources,” says Hertz-Shargel.

“Meanwhile, there is broad consensus among experienced wholesale market participants that FERC Order 2222 was a missed opportunity and will not have a significant impact on market access.”",https://www.smart-energy.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/09/US-virtual-power-plant.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 11:01:01.764270

“I don’t know that anyone really thought they would issue FEOC [guidance] within 45 days, because, these rules are very, very complicated,” explained Crouse.
“It goes without saying that clean energy tax incentives is less of a priority” for the Trump administration, Hanlon said during his September 8 remarks.","The One Big Beautiful Bill (OBBB, P.L. 119-21) imposes complex foreign entity of concern (FEOC) restrictions on clean energy credits – but practitioners are still awaiting clarity on the new provisions. Tax experts weighed in on when guidance might begin to trickle out, and which credit will likely be addressed first.

FEOC restrictions already applied to some tax credits, including the IRC § 30D Clean Vehicle Credit and IRC § 48D Advanced Manufacturing Investment Credit. Those restrictions were put in place by the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and CHIPS and Science Act, respectively.

But the OBBB applies new and expanded FEOC restrictions to several other clean energy credits, namely the IRC § 45X Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit, IRC § 45Y Clean Electricity Production Credit, IRC § 48E Clean Electricity Investment Credit, IRC § 45Q Carbon Capture and Sequestration Credit, IRC § 45U Nuclear Power Production Credit, and IRC § 45Z Clean Fuel Production Credit.

Under the OBBB, credits are subject to two types of entity-level restrictions – those applicable to “specified foreign entities” and to “foreign-influenced entities.” The Sections 45X, 45Y, and 48E credits are also subject to new “material assistance” provisions.

NYU’s Tax Law Center describes the provisions as “a thicket of new and complex prohibited foreign entity rules that will, at minimum, impose significant compliance burdens on taxpayers.” The Tax Law Center’s Kyle Sweeney, Seth Hanlon, and Michael Kaercher delve into the details in a July post.

Guidance Watch

With a maze of new statutory requirements, the clean energy sector and tax practitioners are watching for implementation guidance from Treasury and the IRS. “There’s a huge amount of uncertainty around those rules and how this administration will apply them,” Hanlon explained during a September 8 American Tax Policy Institute webinar.

While clean energy credits aren’t loved by most Republicans, Holland & Knight’s Elizabeth Crouse said that “Treasury kind of needs to deliver on some guidance so that people can run their businesses.” That’s because “no matter what anyone thinks of the renewable energy industry, it is an industry that employs hundreds of thousands of people in this country – millions, depending on how you count,” Crouse told Checkpoint.

The Tax Law Center included the FEOC provisions in its OBBB implementation watch list. The group takes a more skeptical view than Crouse, cautioning of the “risk that the Administration will implement these provisions in ways that impermissibly restrict access to clean energy tax credits or will not issue guidance at all.”

A July 7 executive order, issued in the wake of the OBBB, directed Treasury to “take prompt action … to implement the enhanced Foreign Entity of Concern restrictions.” The executive order had called for action within 45 days of the OBBB’s July 4 enactment – but guidance has yet to be released.

Crouse said she’d be “pleasantly surprised” to see FEOC guidance trickle out by the end of this year – and having no guidance until the first quarter of 2026 “isn’t out of the question” to her. “I don’t know that anyone really thought they would issue FEOC [guidance] within 45 days, because, these rules are very, very complicated,” explained Crouse. She thinks of it as “domestic content turned on its head.”

But FEOC guidance is needed, because the statutory language of OBBB is “vague, in part” and leaves “gray areas to fill in,” Crouse said. However, FEOC is not the only area in need of guidance, and “it’s entirely possible that the FEOC rules are just not as high a priority” to Treasury and the White House as some other areas, Crouse explained.

“It goes without saying that clean energy tax incentives is less of a priority” for the Trump administration, Hanlon said during his September 8 remarks. The OBBB is a “sweeping law,” he added, with other high priority tax provisions such as “no tax on tips” and “no tax on overtime.”

But more than that, Hanlon is concerned about the loss of “sources of expertise within the government.” That includes not only Treasury and the IRS, but also “many of the technical agencies … like the Department of Energy and the EPA.”

Hanlon, who served as Treasury Deputy Assistant Secretary for Tax and Climate Policy in the Biden administration, explained that when implementing the Inflation Reduction Act, Treasury and the IRS relied on those technical agencies to produce guidance. With recent federal workforce reductions, “I think it’s going to be more difficult to tackle these extremely complicated issues,” said Hanlon.

What Will Come First?

Crouse suspects that when the Trump administration does release FEOC guidance, the Advanced Manufacturing Production Credit under Section 45X “has to be the first focus.” That’s because “everything under 45X becomes more pertinent more quickly,” she added.

More specifically, Crouse elaborated, “the material assistance rules are really the thing that’s causing people to lose sleep in the 45X context.”

The OBBB restricts three credits where a prohibited foreign entity provides “material assistance” to a taxpayer. For Sections 45Y and 48E, the restriction applies for facilities and energy storage technology where construction begins after 2025. However, for Section 45X, the restriction applies for components sold in tax years beginning after the OBBB’s date of enactment.

Crouse said that one implementation challenge is that “the rules for 48E, 45Y, and 45X are kind of smushed together when it comes to material assistance, which makes them a bit more difficult to interpret.” To understand the requirements “you kind of have to untangle the threads” – but then “you end up with some questions, some little knot that you’re not quite sure exactly how to untangle.”

Crouse seemed confident, however, that the IRS and Treasury can address Section 45X separately from Sections 48E and 45Y.

For Section 45X, production must happen in the U.S. “It’s pretty clear” that manufacturers will need to look at some “thing” or component “beyond the thing that qualifies for 45X,” Crouse explained. What’s not clear, she said, is whether manufacturers will “have to look down to the itty-bitty stuff.”

For Sections 48E and 45Y, however you “pretty clearly, are supposed to be looking at the prior domestic content notice first,” she explained.

Crouse also stressed that guidance on material assistance for purposes of Sections 48E and 45Y is “not as pressing,” because plants can “begin construction by the end of this year in order to avoid the material assistance rules.” And “there will be other plants that safe harbor during the first half of next year,” she added. Although those plants will have to qualify for material assistance, “they’re not going to start procuring equipment until probably into 2028.”",https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/wp-content/themes/tac/assets/media/favicon.png,N,,2025-09-23 11:00:49.400488

LONDONDERRY, Pa., September 23, 2025--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Constellation’s announcement to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 against a backdrop of rising demand for energy to support economic growth and surging public and policy support for nuclear energy across America. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center (Crane), the plant will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a new source of emissions-free energy to the grid. A top-performing plant at the time of its retirement for economic reasons in 2019, Crane’s restart is made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, marking a symbolic turning point for America’s nuclear industry by demonstrating growing market recognition of nuclear energy as uniquely valuable energy resource.

Since last year’s announcement, Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made significant progress. The project has given momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

""Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,"" said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. ""Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future. As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes.""

Constellation is also pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. Together, it could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro applauded the milestone, stating, ""In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power.

The mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire has said he is ""all for"" cleaner air and green energy.

At a Hull and East Yorkshire Combined Authority (HEYCA) meeting, councillors questioned Luke Campbell's stance on renewable energy.

Reform UK has pledged to scrap the UK's net-zero target and introduce taxes on the renewables sector.

But former Olympic boxer Campbell said at the meeting he is ""all for creating jobs in any sector"" and added: ""Who doesn't like cleaner air and green energy?""

Campbell has openly supported parts of the region's renewables sector by visiting and offering support to Vivergo Fuels, the bioethanol plant that was shut down.

He also said he was ""delighted"" after HEYCA secured £700k from the government's mayoral renewables fund to cut energy costs in Hull and East Yorkshire over the next 25 years through solar panel projects.

But Campbell later warned renewable energy firms to act ""at your own risk"" in response to Boston and Skegness MP Richard Tice's letter stating a Reform UK-led government would ""reassess all net zero-related commitments"".

'Stand for the people'

According to the Local Democracy Reporting Service, at the HEYCA meeting, Labour councillor Shane McMurray asked Campbell: ""Is there anything you can say now to give reassurance to people who work at Siemens, who want to get a career in wind farms and jobs like that?""

Campbell replied: ""The mayor of Hull and East Yorkshire should stand for the people, it was the people that elected Luke Campbell into place so I'll stand up and represent them the best I can.

""If that's creating jobs in any sector I'm all for it. Who doesn't like cleaner air and green energy? I do and I'm all for that.""

McMurray said the mayor's response ""will give a lot of reassurance to a lot of workers and a lot of people who want to work in the industry in this region"".

And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models.","(CNN) — Sales of electric vehicles in the United States are almost certain to tumble when the $7,500 federal tax credit for EV buyers expires on October 1, leaving automakers and car buyers wondering where prices will go.

The tax credit, which was passed in 2022 as part of the Biden administration’s legislative push to support EVs and green energy, is going away as part of President Donald Trump’s broad spending and tax bill that passed in July. The move came after US EV sales in 2024 rose 7% to 1.6 million, according to the Bureau of Transportation Statistics (BTS).

The end of the tax credit means demand for EVs is expected to fall, which means prices in real terms will rise — a concept not lost on the many consumers who rushed to buy EVs in August and September. But that surge is likely to result in plunging sales in the final three months of the year and could lead to somewhat lower EV prices ahead.

With fewer people buying EVs in the coming months, automakers are weighing where to set sticker prices and incentive levels to maintain some baseline of demand. But it’s not clear how much savings that will provide buyers, and it likely won’t make up for the money lost from the end of the tax credit.

Automakers either didn’t respond to CNN’s request for comment on their pricing plans or said they would monitor market conditions.

But history can be a guide. In 2019, when a previous version of the EV tax credit was phased out for Tesla and General Motors because both hit a prescribed sales target, those two automakers responded by cutting prices.

EV sales have been growing steadily for years, and at a much faster pace than traditional gas-powered cars. US electric vehicles rose more than three times as fast as the 2% rise in non-electric passenger vehicles, according to data from the BTS.

But sales of EVs in the United States began to slow earlier this year, rising only 1.5% over the first six months of the year and actually falling 6.3% in the second quarter compared to a year earlier, according to Cox Automotive. That had prompted automakers to offer attractive deals, especially over lease terms.

With the tax credit loss, even more attractive offers are likely on the way, predicted Ivan Drury, director of insights at car buying site Edmunds.

“If you already can’t sell the vehicles at current prices, there’s no way you are going to sell them at today’s prices with this credit going by the wayside,” he said.

Automakers are also likely to respond to a drop in demand by cutting production of EVs. That could mean limited availability of some vehicles on dealer lots, and therefore less pressure to lower prices, said Stephanie Valdez Streaty, director of industry insights at Cox Automotive.

Drury believes the price relief will either come through a lower sticker price, or better financing terms or cash-back offers for buyers.

But she also said automakers will face pressure to cut their prices to maintain some basic level of sales of their EV models.

“I think we’ll see some of that (price cuts and incentives) to keep the buying going,” Valdez Streaty said, adding that the loss of the tax credit won’t kill all demand.

Cox found that 65% of car buyers intending to purchase an EV in the next two years said they’ll go ahead with those plans, even without the tax credit. Only 20% said they would purchase a hybrid or traditional gas-powered car instead.

The same survey from Cox found that vehicle performance, fuel and maintenance savings, as well as concerns about the environment, were all more important factors than the tax credit itself.

And the EV tax credit doesn’t apply to all models. It’s not eligible for vehicles with a manufacturer’s suggested retail price (MSRP) of greater than $80,000, so the expiration won’t necessarily affect the demand of many of the larger trucks or luxury models.

Also, unless Americans buy a vehicle from Tesla, which sells directly to consumers, most buyers will go through a dealership. Dealerships negotiate the transaction price with a buyer, which means what EV buyers will eventually pay will be something of a “moving target,” said David Green, industry analyst for Cars.com.

“I think there’s going to be a little bit of turmoil in the market for quite some time,” Green said.

About Troutman Pepper Locke","New insights gathered by law firm Troutman Pepper Locke reveal a sector bruised but buoyant amid regulatory and tariff uncertainty

NEW YORK – The U.S. energy storage sector remains optimistic after a turbulent year marked by increased regulatory and tariff-related risks, according to findings from law firm Troutman Pepper Locke.

Its latest industry report, “Brave New World: What’s Next for US Energy Storage After OBBBA and Amid Continued Tariff Risk?“ highlights how developers, investors, and lenders across the Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) landscape have prepared to face escalating risk profiles in 2025, and why they remain confident about the sector’s overall growth trajectory.

Co-author and Troutman Pepper Locke partner Vaughn Morrison said, “Energy storage’s versatility of use cases has untethered it from the fate of wind and solar to a meaningful degree.”

Across the shifting U.S. energy landscape, the strategic value of storage is widely recognized. It is seen as much as a service for grid resilience and power price stability as it is for decarbonization. Andrew Waranch, CEO of Spearmint Energy, points to this as a source of industry confidence: “So much of the power market and power price is set by expensive and old generators that only need to operate during ramp times in the morning and evening. In contrast, batteries can solve that quickly and cheaply with extremely high reliability.”

As the implications of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA) and tariffs become clearer, the report finds that project owners expect to be better placed to plan for risks and move their projects forward.

John Leonti, partner and chair of the Energy Department at Troutman Pepper Locke, said, “Although the impact of the OBBBA on energy storage is less severe than some feared, the ambition to onshore battery component manufacturing and the attendant Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) provisions issue significant supply challenges for the industry moving forward. The most prepared in the sector have acted nimbly to restructure supply chains, and key stakeholders are strengthening their close working relationships to share risk and collaboratively revise strategies.”

Many see reasons for continued optimism. While the energy storage sector navigates supply strain, demand for its services is set to rise sharply due to the country’s exploding load growth and aging grid infrastructure. The burgeoning data center industry requires high uptimes and short- and long-term reliability from energy providers in order to grow, making energy storage an increasingly essential solution.

However, the report also emphasizes that uncertainty remains one of the primary barriers to progress and attracting investment.

Market actors report a complicated and tumultuous chapter in the ongoing rollout of utility-scale energy storage, with a number of critical obstacles unresolved.

Foremost among these are the tariff hikes on China — the source of the majority of the world’s battery components — and compliance with FEOC rules, which exclude entities linked to adversarial nations, particularly China, from the benefits of U.S. energy tax incentives. Investors underlined the difficulty of forecasting scenarios given that the supply chain capacity needed for U.S. energy storage currently far exceeds what can realistically be manufactured domestically. Tom Cornell, CEO of BESS supplier Prevalon, described the FEOC rules as “handicapping the industry pretty significantly.”

Still, tailwinds such as robust demand for grid flexibility, supportive federal incentives, and growing bipartisan recognition of the strategic value of energy storage are helping the sector push forward. Its clear value proposition for grid reliability, economic development, and national security has meant energy storage retains an integral role in the U.S.’ energy future. For these reasons, energy storage has — and will continue to — march on.

California Governor Gavin Newsom has announced that the state will not replace the federal $7,500 EV tax credit that is set to expire this month. Newsom cited the state's budget deficit and criticized Detroit's mainstream automakers for opposing California's ban on new gasoline-powered vehicles. The governor's office said California may revive an EV credit next year using funds from a carbon-trading program.

Newsom stated during a press conference in San Francisco, ""We can't make up for federal vandalism of those tax credits."" The state will support expanding EV infrastructure but will not provide direct subsidies that it cannot afford. This decision reverses an earlier pledge by Newsom to restart California's own EV subsidies.

The federal tax credit, which was part of the major tax-and-spending bill passed by Congress, is set to expire on September 30. This move ends years of federal support for EV buyers. Newsom's announcement has dashed near-term hopes among EV makers such as Rivian Automotive Inc., Hyundai Motor Co., and Volkswagen AG, which had urged the governor and state leaders to create a $5,000 EV incentive.

Newsom last year vowed that California would step in if the Trump administration followed through with campaign threats to eliminate the federal $7,500 EV tax credit. However, the governor's plan encountered difficulties due to California's budget deficit.

Newsom also took aim at Detroit's mainstream automakers, stating that General Motors Co. and its CEO, Mary Barra, ""sold us out."" This comment comes after Congress voted earlier this year to block California's ban on the sale of new gasoline-powered vehicles set to take effect in 2035.

The governor's office noted that California could still revive an EV credit next year, using funds from a carbon-trading program that boosts environmental programs. California's previous EV tax credit program ended in 2023, leaving it currently outside of a group of 17 states that currently offer some form of EV purchase tax credit, according to an August report from the nonprofit Tax Foundation.

Despite the lack of state-level incentives, California accounted for about 27% of all EV sales in the country, according to the Alliance for Automotive Innovation. This market position made California the best alternative for EV incentives.

Renewing the incentive also has support from the California Air Resources Board, which joined five other state agencies in August to recommend that the state backfill the $7,500 federal tax credit for EVs with whatever resources are available.",https://cdn.ainvest.com/kamisAssets/og-image-news-20240226.50i1a1wtwa2.png,N,,2025-09-23 12:07:48.200665

Car shopping experts report a surge in consumer demand for EVs as the deadline approaches.

Some analysts predict a significant drop in EV sales once the federal incentive is no longer available.

Car shopping experts say consumers are rushing to buy electric vehicles as the clock winds down to just seven days before the federal EV tax credit expires on Sept. 30.

But some warn that once the incentives are gone, EV sales will all but halt.

As part of the mega-tax bill signed into law in July, the expiration date of the federal clean vehicle tax credit was pushed up to Sept. 30 from its original expiration date of 2032. That means the deadline for snagging a tax credit of up to $7,500 on a qualifying new EV, and up to $4,000 on a used EV is closing in.

New data from car-shopping website Cars.com released on Sept. 18 showed that nearly half of consumers considering buying an EV are now accelerating their purchases. Cars.com said demand on its site is up 33% for new EVs compared with this time a year ago. And demand for used EVs is up by 22% compared with the year-ago period.

Cars.com said nearly three-fourths of consumers surveyed said the federal credit is a ""major or contributing factor"" in their decision to purchase an EV. Cars.com said it conducted the survey Aug. 25-26 and said it got 950 respondents.

Cars.com said its research showed that 70% of EV and plug-in hybrid shoppers are aware of the federal tax credit, and just over half, or 53%, know when it ends.

How long will incentives last?

The federal EV tax credit helped make EVs more affordable. While its expiration at the end of the month might slow demand in the near term, it doesn’t mean the end of affordable EVs, said Aaron Bragman, Detroit bureau chief at Cars.com.

“Shoppers are moving quickly to lock in savings, and Cars.com’s Top EV Picks, including the Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Ioniq 5, Kia EV9 and Chevrolet Equinox EV, show there are strong options for every type of buyer,"" Bragman said in a statement. ""And even after Sept. 30, deals won’t disappear — many state and local incentives remain, and automakers like Nissan, Chevrolet and Hyundai have already announced new lower-priced models. ”

Karl Brauer,executive analyst with iSeeCars.com, said once the federal tax credit ends, EV sales are ""going to crater. It’s going to be quite the whipsaw effect. You’ve got the rush to the dealership to take advantage of these incentives now ... but what’s going to happen in the next three to six months? There’ll be almost no buyers.”

Brauer said EVs comprise about 8% of the total U.S. new vehicle marketshare, he expects that to drop to 1% to 3% by year's end and settle in at 4% of total marketshare by early next year.

""The consumer is going to think, 'I don’t get $7,500 off the car and it already is priced more than a gasoline vehicle ... and it loses range in cold weather so, why am I buying this car?' "" Brauer said.

Edmunds.com's Director of Insights Ivan Drury said his data also showed that as the EV tax credit deadline nears, shoppers are beginning to at least research EVs at a higher rate than all last year. He said there is still rich inventory for buyers to choose from if they do decide to go electric.

""Availability shouldn't be too much of an issue, EVs still make up 4.2% or roughly one out of every 25 pieces of inventory on dealer lots,"" Drury said, citing that data as of Sept. 21. ""This is down from the same time last year at 5.6%, but needless to say, past the 30th, there will certainly be inventory, the only question is what kind of deals will there be?""

Affordability the key to adoption

Many automakers have said the key to accelerating mass adoption of EVs is to offer more EVs for a cheaper price point, especially if the automakers are to compete with the Chinese globally for EV marketshare. The Chinese automakers are known for making high-quality and affordable EVs.

According to Cox Automotive, the average transaction price of a new EV in August was $57,245, a slight decrease of 0.1% year-over-year. The average transaction price is what car buyers paid after incentives and trade-in amounts were deducted from the manufacturer's suggested retail price. Cox Automotive said EVs carry an average price premium of $9,000 above the average transaction price of gasoline-powered vehicle.

Ford Motor Co., which saw sales of its EVs soar in August driven largely by the nation's car buyers hurrying to get ahead of the expiration of the federal EV tax credit, announced in August the creation of a new electric vehicle production system and a new EV platform that will allow the automaker to more efficiently bring several lower-cost EVs to market in the future. The first of those will be a midsize, four-door electric pickup that seats five, to launch in 2027. That vehicle is expected to be priced at about $30,000.

Dealers expect slower sales going forward

At Cox Automotive, spokesman Mark Schirmer said, ""While we don't have a shareable measure on September yet, the activity in August was strong and total new EV sales blew past the previous monthly all-time sales record by 7.5%.""

Schirmer said the previous EV sales record was in December 2024 when the industry sold about 135,000 new EVs. In August, the industry sold 146,000.

Schirmer said a majority of franchised automobile dealers, according to Cox Automotive's quarterly sentiment index, believe that the tax credits offered by the government are having ""a positive effect on EV sales at their dealership.""

But, similar to Brauer's prediction, dealers expect EV sales to halt after the incentives dry up.

When asked about expectation for EV sales three months from now, the majority of dealers expected sales to be declining, Schirmer said. He said third-quarter 2023 was the last time franchised dealers expected ""growing EV sales"" in the next three months, ""but the third-quarter 2025 score was the lowest we've ever seen.""

Last month, Cars.com said new EV inventory grew by 1.4% compared with August 2024, with Chevrolet and Honda scaling back supply due to five EV launches last year as most other brands expanded. They did not provide a figure for how many new EVs remain in inventory.

Sales of used EVs pick up

On the used side, inventory is moving faster this year — spending just 46 days on the lot in August, down from 66 days the same time a year ago, Cars.com said. Tesla, which makes up about one-third of used EV listings, saw average prices fall 16.2% year-over-year, pulling the overall used-EV average down 3.8%. A spokesman for Cars.com did not provide the average transaction price for used Tesla.

With 77 EV models now available, Cars.com’s editors identified the best EVs for 2026 looking at value, use, performance and technology and selected the following models for their range, affordability, family-friendliness and technological innovation as follows:

They’ve filed a complaint asking federal energy regulators to halt development of a $22 billion slate of proposed high-voltage electric transmission lines that would expand an existing network stretching from Kentucky to Minnesota and the Dakotas. They argue the Upper Midwest’s main power grid operator dramatically overstated the lines’ financial and environmental merits while improperly allocating their construction costs to states that say they don’t need them.

On the other side is a motley coalition of electric utilities, tech companies, agribusinesses, environmental groups, a Republican governor and a couple potential 2028 Democratic presidential contenders who support the investment.

The new lines are expected to be in service by 2034, strengthening links between the windy, sunny Plains states and population centers further south and east.

The fight over the transmission lines highlights a key flashpoint in the energy sphere, as cheaper renewable energy runs headlong into a lack of transmission capacity and political hostility from Republican states.

“These improvements will save customers billions by avoiding costly inefficiencies and diversifying the market of generation resources across the region,” Gov. Tim Walz, who’s running for a third term, said in a Sept. 16 letter to the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission.

Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer and Illinois Gov. J.B. Pritzker made similar arguments in letters earlier this month. Like Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois have statutory mandates for 100% carbon-free electricity — Michigan by 2040 and Illinois by 2050. Both governors are potential 2028 presidential candidates.

Gov. Kim Reynolds of wind-rich and mandate-free Iowa also pushed back on the five utility commissions’ complaint in a Sept. 5 letter hailing her state’s “all-of-the-above energy strategy” and name-checking President Trump.

The new infrastructure “will ensure continued reliability and resilience of the electric grid not only in Iowa but also across the region,” she wrote. Killing the new transmission investments, she added, could in turn stall seven nuclear reactors’ worth of new power plants in her state “by months to even years.”

The Indiana-based nonprofit that operates the electric grid in Minnesota and parts or all of 14 other states asserts the proposed lines — collectively known as LRTP Tranche 2.1 — could pay for themselves more than three times over.

That’s more than enough to qualify them as “multi-value projects” whose costs can be spread broadly across the territory of the Midcontinent Independent System Operator — known as MISO —including among ratepayers in Republican-controlled states without ambitious decarbonization goals. Stakeholders across the region had ample opportunity to weigh in on the proposed lines, a MISO spokesperson told the Reformer.

Before finalizing the tranche last year, MISO led “a collaborative process that included substantial stakeholder engagement as well as more than 300 meetings and feedback on the solutions and benefits,” MISO spokesman Brandon Morris said in an email.

Representing the public utility commissions of Montana, North Dakota, Mississippi, Louisiana and Arkansas, the complainants argued that the cost allocation effectively subsidizes the development of wind and solar farms far from population centers — and, by extension, Midwestern blue states’ clean energy goals. Instead of asking Montana and North Dakota to share the burden, they said states like Minnesota, Michigan and Illinois should build more clean energy and transmission within their own borders.

North Dakota’s GOP congressional delegation said much the same in a Sept. 11 letter urging regulators to grant the complaint and undo the cost allocation framework.

“The current approach to cost allocation is a subsidy scheme that alleviates certain states of the costs of their most aggressive energy policies…while out-of-state ratepayers bear the costs,” U.S. Rep. Julie Fedorchak and Sens. Kevin Cramer and John Hoeven wrote.

Belying the complaint, Minnesota is building plenty of clean energy on home soil. Renewables supplied 33% of the state’s electricity in 2024, according to Clean Energy Economy Minnesota, and a state law that accelerates permitting for wind, solar and other energy infrastructure took effect in July. Solar power projects approved by the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission since then will supply nearly a nuclear reactor’s worth of energy as they come online over the next few years.

But regardless of how it’s produced, experts say high-voltage transmission is needed to move electricity across longer distances.

“One of the key concepts of a renewables-based system is you want the grid to be bigger than the weather,” said Mike Schowalter of Fresh Energy, a St. Paul-based clean energy nonprofit.

Transmission lines built to deliver coal-fired power from North Dakota to Minnesota now catch a fair amount of wind, which supplies more than one-third of North Dakota’s electricity. North Dakota officials said during MISO’s stakeholder engagement process — before the utility commissioners’ July complaint — that they’d like to see more of that, Schowalter said.

East of the Rockies, power generally moves from west to east, but the prevailing flow often reverses during winter storms and other extreme weather events, Schowalter explained. To ensure everyone has enough power under the circumstances, utilities can either build lots of transmission and some power plants or lots of power plants and some transmission.

“The latter is far more expensive,” Schowalter said.

Building lots of new gas-fired power plants — something that’s already likely to happen as more AI data centers come online — could push up natural gas prices, Schowalter said. Because gas plants often set the local price of electricity, and fuel represents a significant fraction of their operating expenses, that means costlier power.

“The world that the complainants envision is one of more expensive electricity, and our AI industry is going to be at risk,” he said. “We are shooting ourselves in the foot.”

MISO appears to agree.

“The complaint jeopardizes the ability of MISO and its state partners to support the anticipated growth in electricity demand and would increase costs to customers within the MISO region by replacing an efficient, regional solution with a piecemeal one,” the grid operator said in a Sept. 9 filing that called the utility commissioners’ proposal “haphazard and unrealistic.”

Schowalter said a setback for Tranche 2.1 would mess with the delicate grid planning process and delay the arrival of new power plants that MISO, utilities and big customers were counting on.

Ironically, those delays could slow deployment of the the very gas plants meant to stabilize the grid as AI data centers multiply.

The Data Center Coalition, a tech industry trade group, made this point in a Sept. 9 filing.

Though Schowalter said MISO allocated less than 2% of total Tranche 2.1 costs to North Dakota and Montana, their utility commissions’ complaints make sense: They don’t want to pay at all for investments they believe benefit others.

The other three commissions’ motivations are less obvious because federal energy regulators have prevented MISO from allocating Tranche 2.1 costs across its southern region.

Colby Cook of the Louisiana Public Service Commission told the Reformer that LPSC “has always supported the MISO regional transmission planning processes” but joined the complaint for two main reasons.

The first was “the unreasonable underlying assumptions relied upon to justify these projects as (multi-value projects),” Cook said in an email. Beyond decarbonization benefits, the complaint objected to MISO’s estimates of how cost-effectively the new high-voltage lines could be built and the extent to which they would improve grid reliability and reduce the need for new power plants.

Second was the concern that Louisiana — though not currently required to pay the proposed new costs — could be on the hook later.

Legal representatives for the other four commissions did not respond to a Reformer request for comment.

Perhaps recognizing the need for a speedy resolution, the complainants themselves have asked federal regulators to expedite the complaint. It’s unclear whether the feds will agree.

In the meantime, a key piece of the Midwest’s future power grid is in limbo.

“If the complainants are successful, MISO would have to redo at least a year’s worth of work,” Schowalter said.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-87/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/tariffphoto2025-1024x6831758625706.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=lMil5Ej-,N,,2025-09-23 11:02:26.755308

Constellation’s restart announcement stands as a defining moment for American nuclear power, riding a wave of public support and launching widespread commercial interest in nuclear energy to power the digital economy and strengthen grid reliability

LONDONDERRY, Pa.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Constellation’s announcement to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 against a backdrop of rising demand for energy to support economic growth and surging public and policy support for nuclear energy across America. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center (Crane), the plant will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a new source of emissions-free energy to the grid. A top-performing plant at the time of its retirement for economic reasons in 2019, Crane’s restart is made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, marking a symbolic turning point for America’s nuclear industry by demonstrating growing market recognition of nuclear energy as uniquely valuable energy resource.

Since last year’s announcement, Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made significant progress. The project has given momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

“Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. “Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future. As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes.”

Constellation is also pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. Together, it could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro applauded the milestone, stating, “In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power. As an all-of-the-above energy Governor, I hope to produce even more energy here in Pennsylvania from all sources – from natural gas and solar to geothermal to nuclear. I’m excited for projects like the Crane Clean Energy Center that will bring even more energy onto the grid because by creating more energy, we will create more opportunity for Pennsylvanians.”

Project Milestones Achieved in the Past Year

Workforce and Site Development

The facility is nearly 80% staffed, with 500 full-time employees on-site and dozens more pending. A second Initial License Training class will begin in early 2026 to allow reactor operators to train and obtain an NRC license to operate the plant.

Inspections of steam generators, main generator, emergency diesel generators, and underground piping have been completed or are near completion, alongside significant enhancements to the training center and control room simulator.

Technical and Regulatory Progress

Constellation’s interconnection request to PJM, the regional grid operator, received accelerated approval, clearing the path for grid integration and allowing Constellation to accelerate the restart to 2027.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing and regulatory filings remain on track, supported by a dedicated Restart Panel overseeing comprehensive review and inspections. Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center” to honor the late nuclear energy industry titan. A video on his legacy can be viewed on our website.

Continued progress with state and local environmental agencies to secure permits for water usage and environmental protection.

Economic Impact and Community Engagement

An independent economic study confirmed the plant will result in approximately 3,400 direct and indirect jobs, over $16 billion added to Pennsylvania’s GDP and more than $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

Constellation is making good on its commitment to community investment, including more than $1 million in charitable giving over five years to support workforce development and local organizations. In 2025, the company donated $200,000 to more than a dozen local charities, nonprofit organizations and workforce development programs.

Crane’s community engagement manager Dave Marcheskie has been meeting frequently with residents and community groups to gather feedback and offer philanthropic support. Follow Crane’s progress on our website and recently launched Instagram channel @CraneUnit1.

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.
“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

At stake is not only Indonesia’s climate future, but also which superpower sets the terms for the next generation of energy in the developing world.

Like much of the developing world, Indonesia faces a choice between two stark energy futures.

Chinese companies signed more than $54 billion in agreements in 2023 with Indonesian state utility PLN, while Indonesian President Prabowo Subianto’s 2024 Beijing visit added $10 billion in commitments. Chinese firms are now rapidly embedding themselves in Indonesia’s clean-energy supply chain, from solar and critical mineral mining to electric vehicles, also known as EVs.

These investments dwarf the $20 billion Just Energy Transition Partnership, or JETP, signed in 2022 between Indonesia and a group of wealthy nations to help the country shift away from coal, which contributes 3.6% of the country’s GDP.

The program was faltering even before U.S. President Donald Trump’s administration formally withdrew in March. Only $1.2 billion, or about 6%, of JETP finances have been disbursed while Indonesia believes it needs over $97 billion for the transition.

The U.S. is the world’s top oil producer and has pushed liquefied natural gas, or LNG, as part of talks meant to head off tariffs for Indonesia. It touts “energy dominance” as a way to cut dependence on rivals like China. Beijing is betting on big renewables to cement its role as the biggest supplier of clean energy technology.

The U.S. path risks deeper fossil fuel dependence, while China’s promises jobs and cleaner power with fewer safeguards.

“These two countries … they’re shaping two different visions of the future,” Putra Adhiguna of the Energy Shift Institute said.

U.S. exit impacts politics but not investment

The U.S. withdrawal in March didn’t derail the JETP, but impacted political leadership, analysts said.

When the deal was signed, U.S. climate envoy John Kerry said America had laid the groundwork. But after Trump dismantled Biden-era climate policies and pushed fossil fuel development, Indonesian officials questioned why they should transition if America isn’t, Adhiguna said.

Early JETP conversations “set expectations unrealistically high,” raising goals that were hard to achieve regardless of U.S. policy changes, he added.

The U.S. pledged $2 billion, with roughly half still accessible via loan guarantees, said Jordan Lee of the Tony Blair Institute for Global Change in Jakarta. The JETP always was meant to cover only a portion of the roughly $97 billion needed. Foreign investment was critical given Indonesia’s tiny solar and wind sector, accounting for 0.24% of total energy compared with 3.8% in the Philippines and 13% in Vietnam.

Lee said the JETP also provided a unifying platform for stakeholders and helped Indonesia partner with new countries like the UAE and Saudi Arabia.

Indonesia’s JETP secretariat didn’t respond to a request for comment from The Associated Press.

China offers a new model

China offers a “different version of energy security,” replacing imported fossil fuels with solar panels that generate electricity for decades, Adhiguna said.

Major Chinese projects in Indonesia include a $6 billion supply-chain venture by battery giant CATL with local partners in 2022 and BYD’s $1 billion EV plant announced in 2024 will produce 150,000 cars annually and employ 18,000 workers.

China’s BTR New Material Group launched a $478 million factory in 2024 that will make anode materials for EV batteries and create around 8,000 jobs, while a solar panel factory unveiled in 2025 by LONGi has an annual capacity of 1.6 gigawatts.

“It’s a whole-systems change,” said Dinita Setyawati, an energy analyst focused on Southeast Asia at the think tank Ember. She noted this meant a country could buy solar panels from China and charge their Chinese-built electric cars with clean electricity.

These projects are deployed quickly, which is crucial for Indonesia’s five-year political cycles, even if Western investors offer more safeguards. POWERCHINA built a 100-megawatt solar park in just seven months in 2024.

“If a U.S. company takes four years to do a feasibility study, Chinese companies will already have invested by then,” Adhiguna said.

But Chinese investments often have come with high environmental costs.

Most of Indonesia’s nickel mines, for instance, are Chinese-owned. The country has the biggest reserves of the mineral needed to build EV batteries and the mines rely on captive coal-fired power plants, built on-site to supply electricity.

A 2024 study by the Centre for Research on Energy and Clean Air on the impact of nickel mining in three Indonesian provinces found pollution from smelters and the coal-fired power plants would cost the economy $2.6 billion in 2025, rising to $3.4 billion by 2030, while resulting in more than 3,800 deaths in 2025 and nearly 5,000 by 2030.

US gas could lock Indonesia into fossil fuels

Indonesia’s energy minister, Bahlil Lahadalia, said in April it would boost LNG imports from the U.S. by around $10 billion as part of tariff negotiations. LNG is natural gas cooled to liquid for storage and transport, burning cleaner than coal but still emitting greenhouse gases.

The risk is that the gas deals could further entrench Indonesia’s reliance on fossil fuels. Committing to long-term deals risks leaving countries stuck with outdated infrastructure, even as the world moves quickly toward cheaper, faster-to-deploy solar and wind power, analysts said.

Indonesia could risk falling behind in the clean energy transition and miss out on investment opportunities, such as data centers seeking renewable energy in Southeast Asia, Setyawati said.

“And once they realize it, it might be too late,” she said.

Meanwhile, Indonesia remains deeply tied to coal. It was the only country to propose building new coal plants and had the third-highest amount of coal capacity globally in 2024. About 80% of the 1.9 gigawatts of coal capacity Indonesia built was for the captive coal plants for smelters processing minerals like nickel and cobalt for electric vehicles, according to a report by U.S.-based nonprofit Global Energy Monitor.

“The Indonesian government needs to realize that this is where the world is heading, like it or not,” Setyawati said.

Had the four Democrats voted against Rulli’s bill, the vote would have failed in a 213-213 tie.
No jobs, no growth, no future.” The DOE’s most-recent annual coal report, released Oct. 30, 2024, showed the number of employees at U.S. coal mines increased in 2023 by 1,894 from 2022 to a total of 45,476 workers.
While coal production decreased by 2.8% year over year, the number of producing coal mines increased from 548 to 560, the DOE report states.
Also, more coal has been mined west of the Mississippi River every year since 1999, according to the DOE report.","The U.S. House approved a bill sponsored by Republican Congressman Michael Rulli to codify into law President Donald Trump’s executive order to reestablish the National Coal Council to provide advice on the industry.

The bill needed the approval of four Democrats to pass 217-209 because three Republicans voted against it.

The bill moves to the Senate for consideration.

Rulli, R-Salem, introduced the bill on April 24, 18 days after Trump, a fellow Republican, issued an executive order, called “Reinvigorating America’s Beautiful Clean Coal Industry.” The executive order included having Energy Secretary Chris Wright reinstate the 50-member National Coal Council that provides him guidance on the future of coal technologies and markets.

Members of the council represent coal producers, users, equipment suppliers, state and local officials, and other stakeholders across the coal value chain, according to the Department of Energy. The council had faced criticism from environmental groups that contended it favored the interests of the coal industry over the public.

While Trump’s executive order returned the council to its advisory capacity, Rulli’s legislation would have Congress codify it into law even though its elimination wasn’t done through congressional action.

The council was established in 1984 during the Republican Ronald Reagan presidential administration to provide advice on the industry to the secretary of the U.S. Department of Energy.

In November 2021, the DOE, during the presidential administration of Democrat Joe Biden, allowed the council’s charter to expire rather than be renewed. Prior to that, its charter was last renewed in 2019.

Rulli’s district, with Mahoning as its most-populous county, includes several other counties with coal production facilities.

Rulli said the council is “a powerful voice for coal and a timeless champion for American workers and American communities. Coal fuels the factories, powers our homes and helped build the greatest economy this world has ever seen. It’s ridiculous to neglect this.”

All but three Republican House members – Brian K. Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, and Nick LaLota and Nicole Malliotakis, both of New York – voted in favor of Rulli’s bill.

All but four Democratic House members voted against it. The four Democrats who voted in support of Rulli’s bill were Sanford D. Bishop of Georgia, Donald G. Davis of North Carolina, Henry Cuellar of Texas and Marie Gluesenkamp Perez of Washington.

Had the four Democrats voted against Rulli’s bill, the vote would have failed in a 213-213 tie.

Before the vote, Rulli called his bill “a Paul Revere moment where we are calling everyone to realize that the meltdown is coming and what I mean by that is the (power) grid is going to melt down. The grid is not stable.”

Rulli said: “Paul Revere would be turning in his grave if he saw the jeopardy that these (Democrats) are putting our country through by putting the grid up against the wall.”

Rulli added: “When they say that this is a meaningless bill, it couldn’t be further from the truth. This is a bill for national security.”

Rulli said there are seven or eight investors in his district “ready to build new coal capacity. They want to attract AI companies, data centers and data mining jobs to Ohio. But if there’s no energy, no one is coming. No jobs, no growth, no future.”

The DOE’s most-recent annual coal report, released Oct. 30, 2024, showed the number of employees at U.S. coal mines increased in 2023 by 1,894 from 2022 to a total of 45,476 workers. While coal production decreased by 2.8% year over year, the number of producing coal mines increased from 548 to 560, the DOE report states.

In 2018, there were 53,583 coal workers, according to DOE statistics.

Also, more coal has been mined west of the Mississippi River every year since 1999, according to the DOE report. Coal production expanded significantly in the West starting in the 1970s because of new emission regulations that restricted sulfur emissions with low-sulfur coal mostly found in the West, new large-scale surfacing mines in Wyoming’s Powder River Basin and other areas in the West, and lower freight rail shipping costs, according to the DOE.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration released a report last week showing a 30% per capita reduction in carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2023 nationwide with Ohio having a 34% reduction primarily “because less coal was burned in the electric power sector.” But the report forecasts a 1% increase in total carbon dioxide emissions this year in part because of an increase in coal production.

A July 23 EIA analysis states: “The long-term decrease in U.S. coal consumption will temporarily reverse in 2025 primarily because of rising electricity demand and coal’s increased competitiveness in the electric power sector, which accounted for more than 90% of U.S. coal consumption in 2024.”

The EIA forecasted a 6% increase this year in coal consumption followed by a 6% decrease in 2026 because of “planned coal-power plant retirements and increasing renewable capacity coming online.”",http://d14e0irai0gcaa.cloudfront.net/www.reviewonline.com/images/2016/10/12171200/fblike.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 13:02:40.387063

Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center” to honor the late nuclear energy industry titan.","LONDONDERRY, PA (Sept. 23, 2025) – Saturday marked the one-year anniversary of Constellation’s announcement to restart Three Mile Island Unit 1 against a backdrop of rising demand for energy to support economic growth and surging public and policy support for nuclear energy across America. Renamed the Crane Clean Energy Center (Crane), the plant will help strengthen grid reliability, restore jobs and add a new source of emissions-free energy to the grid. A top-performing plant at the time of its retirement for economic reasons in 2019, Crane’s restart is made possible through a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, marking a symbolic turning point for America’s nuclear industry by demonstrating growing market recognition of nuclear energy as uniquely valuable energy resource.

Since last year’s announcement, Constellation has accelerated the restart to 2027, hired hundreds of workers and made significant progress. The project has given momentum to state and federal policymakers and some of the world’s largest technology companies to partner with industry to increase investment in new and existing nuclear technology to power the digital economy and U.S. competitiveness.

“Six years ago, the closure of this plant symbolized more than a decade of policy failures that focused only on new clean energy resources that couldn’t match the reliability of nuclear energy, and both the security of our energy grid and air quality suffered,” said Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation. “Today it symbolizes the best in American innovation and an overdue recognition that we need to value and invest in existing sources of clean and reliable energy as we also build the grid of the future. As we confront the challenge of rising energy demand to support America’s economic growth, it’s critical that we look to Crane as a reminder of the consequences of not learning from past mistakes.”

Constellation is also pursuing investments in equipment and technology to increase the output from its existing nuclear plants in addition to the restart of Crane. Together, it could add up to 2,000 megawatts of new, clean and reliable baseload capacity to the grid.

Pennsylvania Governor Josh Shapiro applauded the milestone, stating, “In Pennsylvania, we’re doubling down on our energy legacy by taking big, decisive steps to build new sources of power. As an all-of-the-above energy Governor, I hope to produce even more energy here in Pennsylvania from all sources – from natural gas and solar to geothermal to nuclear. I’m excited for projects like the Crane Clean Energy Center that will bring even more energy onto the grid because by creating more energy, we will create more opportunity for Pennsylvanians.”

Project Milestones Achieved in the Past Year

Workforce and Site Development

The facility is nearly 80% staffed, with 500 full-time employees on-site and dozens more pending. A second Initial License Training class will begin in early 2026 to allow reactor operators to train and obtain an NRC license to operate the plant.

Inspections of steam generators, main generator, emergency diesel generators, and underground piping have been completed or are near completion, alongside significant enhancements to the training center and control room simulator.

Technical and Regulatory Progress

Constellation’s interconnection request to PJM, the regional grid operator, received accelerated approval, clearing the path for grid integration and allowing Constellation to accelerate the restart to 2027.

Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) licensing and regulatory filings remain on track, supported by a dedicated Restart Panel overseeing comprehensive review and inspections. Earlier this year, the NRC granted approval to rename the plant as the “Christopher M. Crane Clean Energy Center” to honor the late nuclear energy industry titan. A video on his legacy can be viewed on our website.

Continued progress with state and local environmental agencies to secure permits for water usage and environmental protection.

By Alex Mey, Owen Comstock

In our annual survey of power plant activity, we ask operators of utility-scale batteries how they are using their systems, and one use case is increasingly prevalent: price arbitrage. Arbitrage involves buying electricity when prices are relatively low and selling that electricity when prices are high.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Electric Generator Report

Data values: File 3.4—Energy Storage

Utility-scale battery systems can be used for many applications. In previous years, we asked operators to identify the ways they used their batteries. Common use cases included price arbitrage as well as frequency regulation, excess wind and solar generation, system peak shaving, load management, and more.

Beginning with the 2023 survey, we asked operators to identify the primary use case for their battery system. Last year, operators responded that 66% of all utility-scale battery capacity had arbitrage among its uses and that 41% of the total capacity was primarily used for arbitrage.

Data source: U.S. Energy Information Administration, Annual Electric Generator Report

Data values: File 3.4—Energy Storage

The next most common use case was frequency regulation, which was the primary usage for 24% of battery capacity. Frequency regulation involves maintaining the grid’s frequency of 60 cycles per second. In previous years, operators had reported that frequency regulation was the most common use case for their battery systems.

Much of the United States’ utility-scale battery capacity is in the two electricity markets that cover much of California and Texas. At the end of 2024, the California Independent System Operator (CAISO) reported 11.7 gigawatts (GW) of battery capacity, 43% of which was primarily used for arbitrage.

Watch the full livestreamed event on Food Tank’s YouTube channel.

“You can’t really talk about climate change without talking about food waste,” says Luiz Beling, CEO of Apeel Sciences.

Speakers agreed that tackling food waste is one of the most immediately effective climate solutions that countries, communities, and individuals can implement right now.

“You get food out of landfills today, and you’re saving methane emissions within the year,” says Dana Gunders, President of ReFED, who is seeing positivity around food waste solutions from both sides of the political aisle in the United States.

“It has to be a whole of society approach…We have to press upon the leaders of the world to work together on climate,” says Jamil Ahmad, Director, New York Office, UN Environment Programme.

Multiple speakers pointed to portion sizes as a low-hanging fruit in terms of reducing food waste. Research supports this: According to Gunders, 59 percent of people surveyed say they would go to a different restaurant if it offered different portion sizes.

“The most impactful thing we can do to decrease food waste is changing portion sizes…Giving consumers options like that can enable them to make changes,” says Roni Neff, Professor at Johns Hopkins University, who researches ways to reduce food waste and address climate change through food systems.

And technology plays a big role: Harry Chrispin, Senior Manager of ESG EMEA at Hilton, uses the artificial intelligence system Winnow to track food waste in hotel kitchens automatically. With Winnow, “the previously invisible food waste in the bin is now visible, and chefs can make decisions based on that,” says Chrispin. “Just changing the way we cut fruit and portion fruit, all of these small changes can make a really big difference in food waste,” without compromising the customer experience.

Many factors influence what eaters do and don’t eat, and how they dispose of their food choices: “We make at least 200 different food decisions in a day. Many of them you don’t know you’re making,” says Caleb McClennan, President of RARE. This creates opportunities throughout each day to make positive change. But while small changes like composting and repurposing leftovers and scraps are important tools for change, consumers should also go easy on themselves, says U.S. Representative Chellie Pingree.

“You’re not going to be perfect every day of the week,” says Rep. Pingree. “But the things that you do at home…changing our habits and getting into new habits…all of these things are important to do.”

Eaters can also look to their freezers to help make small but meaningful changes to reduce food waste at home.

“Take advantage of your freezer,” says Alison Bodor, President and CEO of the American Frozen Food Institute. “Whether that’s freezing your own leftovers or buying resealable packages. Be part of the solution because it will take all of us.”

Meanwhile, U.S. Congresswoman Maxine Dexter, MD, says that consumers should not forget the power of their voices: “Consumer behavior needs to drive the changes,” she says. “If we are demanding it, it’s easier for people like me to pass the laws.”

“As someone who represents about 800,000 people, getting that outreach really drives our perspective. Reaching out to your elected leaders, sharing what you want—even if you know they’re not aligned—is really important,” says Rep. Dexter. “Americans need to demand better from their government. Politicians need to demand more from themselves.”

Stacy Blondin, Behavioral Science Associate at the World Resources Institute, emphasizes that while there is a significant consumer will to reduce waste, eaters need support from the government, nonprofit, and private sectors. “A large percentage of Americans are already motivated to reduce food waste, but we need these underlying societal support systems” that will enable people to make meaningful change, says Blondin.

The Summit’s conversations continually turned to collaborations as an effective way to amplify change across sectors.

“Co-developing together a solution is truly energizing and powerful. Your coworkers have the answers and power; they meet the customers every day,” says Lorena Lourido Gomez, Head of IKEA Food, IKEA Retail Services, Ingka.

“Nobody really wants to waste food. People are looking for advice on how to do that,” says David Rogers, Director of International Development at WRAP. “And if you can reach people through the cities they live in or the shops they go to, you can really reach everyone.”

Michael Grunwald, Food & Climate Columnist at Canary Media and also a Contributing Writer for The New York Times Opinion, left the audience with a simple call to action for eaters:

“Eat less beef, waste less food. I can give you 50 things to do, and the other 48 combined wouldn’t have as much impact as that,” says Grunwald. And “right now, food waste is an area where we can actually make progress.”

Among other things, the act also established the REACH program, which automatically discounts energy bills for low- and moderate-income ratepayers in disadvantaged communities through NYPA’s renewable energy sales.
New York will likely only achieve around 45% to 61% renewable energy by 2030, a 2023 Strategen report said.
To get this number to 70%, Strategen said NYPA will have to construct and connect between 7 GW and 20 GW renewable energy projects by 2030.
The Climate Act directed peaker plants to be phased out as it progressed toward its renewable energy targets.","New Yorkers say Gov. Kathy Hochul has a choice: either build 15 GW of renewable energy or continue “embracing Trump’s energy policy.”

Rallied by New York City mayoral candidate and Assemblymember Zohran Mamdani, NYPA received more than 6,100 public comments in response to building the 15 GW of public renewables.

Madani was a strong supporter of the Build Public Renewables Act, which tasked state utility New York Power Authority (NYPA) with leading the state’s progress toward reaching a state mandate for 70% renewable energy by 2030, per the Climate Leadership and Community Protection Act. To do this, the Build Public Renewables Act granted NYPA the power to build and operate its own renewable projects so that it can step in to build enough clean energy to get the state back on track to reach 70% renewable energy by 2030.

Last month NYPA doubled the total renewable energy capacity from its inaugural plan after receiving public backlash over the 3.3 GW it initially proposed.

“That outside power that we built is how we were able to force the state to double its initial plans,” said Assemblymember Marcela Mitaynes (D). “15 GW [of renewables] means shutting down the state’s most polluting plants, the peaker plants, 5 years sooner. It means lower bills for New Yorkers. This is not just an environmental issue, but it is a racial issue.”’

NYPA closed its public comment period for its updated Renewables Updated Strategic Plan and the overwhelming majority of comments said the same: NYPA must build 15 GW of public renewable energy by 2030. “Increasing the plan to 7 GW is a step forward, but it remains a half-measure in the face of increasing climate devastation,” thousands of public comments wrote.

Under the Build Public Renewables Act, NYPA must supply customers with 70% renewable energy by 2030. New York also must have:

10 GW of distributed solar 2030 (currently 68% achieved at 6.7 GW installed);

6 GW of energy storage by 2030 (currently 7% achieved with 445 MW installed); and

9 GW of offshore wind by 2035.

Among other things, the act also established the REACH program, which automatically discounts energy bills for low- and moderate-income ratepayers in disadvantaged communities through NYPA’s renewable energy sales. It also requires NYPA to work with climate, union and community groups to create biennial plans on building public renewables, with a 60-day comment period for each plan.

New York acknowledged last summer it would likely fail to meet its 70% mandate by 2030.

“This is a life or death issue for children across the state,” Sen. Jabari Brisport (D) said.

Public Power NY said New York “relies on profoundly unrealistic projections of how much capacity is on track to come online.” Since the Climate Act passed in 2019, progress toward achieving 70% renewables by 2030 has been dire, Public Power NY said.

New York will likely only achieve around 45% to 61% renewable energy by 2030, a 2023 Strategen report said. To get this number to 70%, Strategen said NYPA will have to construct and connect between 7 GW and 20 GW renewable energy projects by 2030. According to Public Power NY, if New York can add almost 4 GW of renewable energy in the next six months, it can add enough generation to achieve its mandate.

Much of the New York City residents’ outcry for more renewable generation stem from the city’s many peaker plants, most of which are more than 50 years old.

New York City ratepayers have paid gas peaker plant owners an estimated $4.5 billion in capacity payments over the past decade to keep peakers online in case they may be needed.

The Climate Act directed peaker plants to be phased out as it progressed toward its renewable energy targets. but its ambition turned sluggish in bringing the projects to operation. Now the state has been forced to hold off on closing many of the fossil-fuel peaker plants spread around the city.

New York has about 7.2 GW of solar capacity installed across the state, representing less than 0.07% of the state’s electricity, according to the Solar Energy Industries Association. New York is ranked 48th per capita for its utility-scale solar.

Not only does New York City have a notable number of peaker plants, but most of them are more than 50 years old, so they emit even higher levels of pollutants relative to the electricity they generate.

Not to mention, rising electric costs. Replacing NYPA’s fossil-fuel plants with renewables by 2030 could save New Yorkers up to $1.2 billion through 2050 compared to fossil-fuel plant operation, according to Public Power NY.

In 2022, NYPA commissioned a study to determine the feasibility and economics of replacing its gas-fired peaker plants with renewable generation. The study found each of its plants could either be completely replaced, or almost completely replaced with 4-hour energy storage.

Residents from Long Island were opposed to more battery energy storage systems, however, demanding the systems in their community be mandated to have at least a five-mile buffer from residential and commercial districts on the island, which is about 23 miles at its widest point.

Most comments, however, did not share this opposition.

“One hundred years from now people are going to look back at this time period and be absolutely flabbergasted that we dragged our feet for so long towards this obvious truth,” Maria Huff said in a public comment. “Change is tough and it’s not always easy or cheap but it’s necessary.”",https://pv-magazine-usa.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2025/09/Credit-Ken-Schles-1-1200x800.jpeg,N,,2025-09-23 12:06:54.043607

These kinds of home improvement projects will pad your wallet in the long run and also make your house more resilient as rising global temperatures threaten communities around the world. More frequent and severe extreme weather events are one consequence of the changing climate, and that leads to power outages and increases strain on the electric grid. Clean energy solutions bolster neighborhoods and cut the production of heat-trapping gases that drive these shifts, as well as unstable dirty energy prices.

Installing solar panels is the ultimate home energy hack, slashing your energy costs to or near $0. Like LG, EnergySage provides a free service that makes it easy to compare quotes from vetted contractors, helping you save up to $10,000 on a solar system.

It's Not As Rosy[ 1 ], its broader financial performance reveals a mixed picture. This analysis examines Volvo's capital allocation strategies and their implications for long-term shareholder value, highlighting both the opportunities and risks inherent in its U.S. EV expansion.

Capital Allocation Strategies: Local Production and Cost Optimization

Volvo's approach to the U.S. EV market hinges on two pillars: localized production to mitigate tariff impacts and aggressive cost-cutting measures. The company has announced a $1.86 billion (SEK 18 billion) cost and cash action plan to offset financial pressures, including U.S. tariffs and development delaysHow U.S. Tariffs and EV Delays Caused a 64% Profit Crash at Volvo[ 2 ]. A key component of this strategy involves shifting production to its U.S. facilities, particularly in South Carolina. By 2026, Volvo will begin manufacturing its best-selling XC60 model at the Ridgeville plant, a move designed to avoid tariffs on imported vehicles and reduce costsVolvo Shifts to US Production Amid Tariffs, CEO Warns[ 3 ].

The South Carolina plant, which has already received $1.3 billion in investments over the past decadeVolvo to build its most popular car in Ridgeville[ 4 ], will also introduce a next-generation hybrid model by 2030 to cater to U.S. market preferences. This dual focus on electrification and hybrid technologies reflects Volvo's adaptability to regulatory and consumer dynamics.

Volvo projects an EBIT margin of 7–8% by 2026, supported by cost reductions and improved cash flowVolvo Cars adjusts core business ambitions for 2026 and beyond[ 9 ]. However, the path to profitability is fraught with headwinds. Tesla's dominance in the U.S. EV market (46% share in Q2 2025Electric Vehicle Sales and Market Share (US - Q3 2025 Updates)[ 10 ]) and regulatory changes affecting tax credit eligibility for Volvo's EVs—due to battery sourcing restrictions—pose significant challengesVolvo’s Ambitious Plans for US Electric Vehicle Production Expansion[ 11 ].

This geographic imbalance raises questions about the sustainability of relying heavily on the U.S. market. Additionally, the company's revised electrification strategy—allowing for mild hybrids—may dilute its brand's premium positioning in the EV space.

The program includes $500 in charging credits and six months of complimentary Greenlane Edge™ subscription access for every qualifying light-, medium-, and heavy-duty electric truck sold. Velocity Truck Centers, a major North American dealer for top commercial vehicle brands, is the first partner to sign up for the program.

“One of the biggest challenges our customers face when considering electric trucks is figuring out charging—where to charge, how to support it, and how to pay for it all,"" said Scott Zeppenfeldt, COO of Velocity. ""Greenlane's ‘Charge On Us’ program removes those hurdles by letting our customers rely on public infrastructure instead of investing time and money in their own charging setup. We're excited to run pilot programs out of their flagship Colton facility and utilize other sites on their network, which gives us a real-world proving ground to show customers how straightforward electric can be when the charging piece is handled.”

Dealers participating in the program benefit from a turnkey solution that includes sales enablement support, marketing resources, and customer service, all backed by Greenlane’s growing public charging network and technology suite. For signing up, dealerships also receive a number of subscriptions to the network, which enables them to run pilots out of Greenlane facilities, simplifying customer billing and eliminating the need for expensive and complicated infrastructure. The Greenlane Edge™ subscription ensures access to discounted charging rates, advanced reservation tools, and a robust software ecosystem to help reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) and streamline billing and electric freight operations. Members benefit from real-time charging data, flexible technology integrations, and consolidated billing. Greenlane Edge™ can enhance route planning and reduce downtime.

“As more heavy-duty fleets shift to electric, we need to address the real concerns holding them back: where to charge, cost, and how to deploy charging infrastructure day one,” said Patrick Macdonald-King, CEO of Greenlane. “Our program tackles these issues by providing immediate charging credits, access to high-speed chargers and our technology ecosystem that delivers a seamless charging solution. Partnering with Velocity helps us scale that impact and make electrification easier for more companies by lowering the cost of entry and complexity of procuring power and deploying infrastructure.”

In April, the company opened its flagship Greenlane Center™ in Colton, California, featuring more than 40 high-speed chargers, including 12 pull-through and 29 bobtail lanes for medium- and heavy-duty electric vehicles, amenities such as restrooms and wifi, carports, 24/7 security, and additional offerings like office space and parking. The Colton site, located at the intersection of I-215 and I-10, is part of Greenlane’s I-15 charging corridor from Los Angeles to Las Vegas and I-10 corridor which will include new sites to be developed in Blythe, California, and Greater Phoenix, Arizona.

The future of Texas data center development is somewhat contingent on the availability of power and water.
Texas data centers used nearly 22 million MWh of electricity in 2023, 4.6 per cent of the state’s electricity consumption.
In a state that often faces drought conditions, this could set up conflicts between proposed data centers and agricultural and industrial users and residential communities.","The Texas construction industry has lots of work to look forward to, according to analysis by Twisted Nail, a Texas-based construction aggregate supplier.

The company analyzed national and state-level data from the U.S. Census Bureau and found that today, Texas leads the nation in commercial construction spending at nearly $90 billion annually. That’s more than double any other state.

The continued vitality of the state’s construction industry is fueled by federal incentives, low state taxes, manufacturing investments and population growth, with clean energy, semiconductor and advanced manufacturing projects accounting for much of that activity.

Further goods news comes from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics which projects job growth of 5.8 per cent for skilled trade workers through to 2034, and even higher levels for other construction workers. This is encouraging given how construction employment has flat lined across the country over the past six months to August.

One of the largest and most interesting data facilities planned is the 50,000-acre data center hub near Laredo, dubbed “Data City, Texas,” announced by Houston-based Energy Abundance Development Corporation this past March.

“Data City offers a unique solution, achieving the holy grail of hyperscalers’ clean energy ambitions, delivering low-cost 100 per cent 24/7 green energy at scale,” the company said in a news release.

Although powered initially by Texas-produced natural gas, Data City proposes to shift to green hydrogen sourced from the company’s adjacent 2TWh Hydrogen City salt dome storage facility. Wind, solar and batteries are also part of the plan. In this way, Data City will be fully self-powering and isolated from ERCOT, the state’s energy utility.

Data City will be built in phases, with the first 300 MW and one-million-square-feet of data center space set to launch in 2026, and could expand quickly to 5 GW and over 15-million-square-feet of leasable space, the announcement says.

Even more ambitious is a $300 billion AI campus near Amarillo, Texas, called HyperGrid, planned by Fermi America. If plans move forward, the 18-million-square-foot facility could generate 11 GW of IT capacity, powered by a combination of natural gas, solar, wind and nuclear energy, making it the world’s largest energy and data complex.

Texas is getting a good piece of the $375 billion estimated by investment bank UBS that will be spent globally in 2025 on AI infrastructure. As much as $500 billion of data center investments are projected in 2026 and an estimated $3 trillion by 2028. In fact, nearly 20 data center projects are underway or planned in the Austin area alone.

Smaller rural communities become excited about the economic prospects surrounding new data centers proposed for their area. But while massive data centers mean short term construction jobs and add revenue to local municipal tax rolls, the longer-term employment picture is not as rosy. Completed data centers don’t require a high number of long-term workers.

As reported in the Wall Street Journal, some 1,500 people, including site workers, electricians and engineers, are involved in the construction of Stargate Project’s data center covering 1,100 acres near Abilene, Texas. The Abilene facility is part of the $500 billion nationwide AI infrastructure venture involving OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and the investment firm MGX.

However, Abilene’s economic development agency says the Stargate facility will hire only about 100 full-time employees, a fraction of the number of people who might work in a similarly-sized commercial development like an office park, factory or warehouse.

Nevertheless, the booming data center market is good news for the building industry should other areas of construction in Texas take a pause due to economic uncertainty.

Even if all the planned facilities don’t get built, data center expansion is likely to continue due to demand.

According to Jones Lang LaSalle, a global commercial real estate and investment management company, vacancy rates in existing data centers are at a record low of 2.3 per cent nationwide and virtually zero in Texas. Strong preleasing through 2027 is expected to keep vacancy rates at low levels.

However, it isn’t all clear sailing. The future of Texas data center development is somewhat contingent on the availability of power and water.

Texas data centers used nearly 22 million MWh of electricity in 2023, 4.6 per cent of the state’s electricity consumption. ERCOT projects that by 2031, the state grid will need to more than double its 2024 capacity, mainly due to the growth of data centers. This suggests the importance of new data centers having some self-powering capability.

What is even more challenging is the water supply required to cool processing servers, amounting to millions of gallons every day for each facility. In a state that often faces drought conditions, this could set up conflicts between proposed data centers and agricultural and industrial users and residential communities.

Building new data centers may be critical to the future success of the state’s construction industry. However, the limited long-term, large scale employment potential, alongside the required power generation and water supply demands, present complex realities that need to be recognized over the coming years.",https://cc-production-uploads-bucket.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2025/09/Inside-data-center-uncreditedMainWEB-US-01.png,N,,2025-09-23 11:02:06.388130

After talks with UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, the two leaders have made a bilateral trade agreement targeting nuclear power development to meet the energy demands of AI infrastructure.

The Tech Prosperity Deal, unveiled by President Trump and Prime Minister Keir Starmer, positions nuclear energy as the backbone for powering AI data centres.

Keir Starmer describes the agreement as a “landmark nuclear partnership” that would power economic growth, saying the commitments would set Britain “well on course to a golden age of nuclear that will drive down household bills in the long run, while delivering thousands of good jobs in the short term.”

Google, Nvidia and Microsoft have also committed to expanding UK operations as part of the broader agreement.

Why nuclear power?

AI data centres consume hundreds of megawatts of power continuously to run the parallel processing systems that enable machine learning (ML) applications.

Chris Wright, the US Energy Secretary, frames nuclear power as essential for supporting America’s AI ambitions.

He says that America has been looking to commercial nuclear power to “fuel the AI revolution.

“Meeting this demand will require strong partnerships with our allies around the world and robust collaboration with private sector innovators.”

The partnership promises to slash regulatory red tape through the UK-US Atlantic Partnership for Advanced Nuclear Energy, which aims to halve licensing times to approximately two years.

Both countries will accept each other’s safety assessments, eliminating duplicative approval processes that have historically slowed nuclear deployment.

Why the nuclear push will be at a former coal plant

The centrepiece of the nuclear push is an ambitious US$11bn project at the former Cottam coal-fired power station in Nottinghamshire.

Nuclear technology company Holtec International will partner with EDF Energy and property developer Tritax to build small modular reactors specifically designed for AI data centres.

These smaller nuclear units produce between 50 and 300 megawatts of power, compared with traditional plants that generate over 1,000 megawatts.

The modular approach allows components to be manufactured in factories and transported to sites, potentially reducing both construction times and costs.

EDF Energy, which operates Britain’s existing nuclear fleet and supplies electricity to 5.8 million customers, sees the partnership as its entry into next-generation nuclear technologies targeting AI infrastructure.

Meanwhile, nuclear startup Last Energy will team up with ports operator DP World to develop micro-modular plants at the London Gateway port and business park, where automated cargo systems require reliable power.

Ed Miliband, the UK’s Energy Secretary, says: “We’re kickstarting a golden age of nuclear in this country, joining forces with the US to turbocharge new nuclear developments and secure the technologies of the future.”

The promise of thousands of new jobs

Beyond the headline projects, energy supplier Centrica will partner with reactor developer X-energy to build up to 12 advanced modular reactors in Hartlepool.

The project could create 2,500 jobs in England’s North East, where traditional heavy industries have declined.

The Hartlepool facility alone is expected to generate enough electricity to power 1.5 million homes.

By 2028, the new reactors could collectively provide up to 6 gigawatts of power across the UK – matching the country’s current nuclear output.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/cb07a9369b5485698aa27a0263963fed:a89409712449ba76344d3b50347516d6/54354197632-dc2a4f2c65-b.jpg.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 07:01:36.780266

Why it matters: The numbers indicate some success in reducing emissions to curb climate change, but the Trump administration's pro-coal, anti-wind-and-solar attitude could jeopardize that progress as it gets harder to start new clean energy projects.

Driving the news: Energy-related emissions per capita fell 30% nationwide in the time frame, according to U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) figures.

Raw emissions fell 20%, while the population grew by 14%.

Between the lines: The nationwide emissions decline was primarily a result of less coal being burned to generate electricity.

An uptick in natural gas use, plus clean wind and solar energy, ""offset the decrease in coal generation,"" per the EIA.

Zoom in: Maryland (-49%); Washington, D.C. (-48%) and Georgia (-45%) saw the biggest decreases in energy-related emissions per capita.

BISHOPVILLE, S.C.–(BUSINESS WIRE)–#RECs–Ever.green today announced their support for a 28-megawatt (MW) solar project in Lee County, South Carolina, enabled through a long-term purchase of High-Impact Renewable Energy Certificates (RECs) by Wells Fargo, proving that corporate energy buyers can tangibly accelerate the deployment of new clean energy projects. The solar installation, developed by Headwater Energy, will generate approximately 50,000 MWh of electricity annually—enough to power 3,000 homes.

“High-Impact RECs are making it easier for companies to directly support new, impactful projects,” said Cris Eugster, CEO of Ever.green. “This project is a powerful example of how forward-thinking buyers can accelerate the energy transition while advancing grid resilience.”

Ever.green’s High-Impact RECs are renewable energy certificates sourced from yet-built clean energy projects via long-term, fixed-price forward contracts that are material to the project’s financeability. Projects are selected for their ability to maximize climate impact, minimize environmental harm, and deliver social benefits.

The Bishopville project uses low-carbon, domestically manufactured solar panels, helping to create new U.S. manufacturing jobs while strengthening the domestic energy supply chain. The panels use thin-film technology, which performs well in hot and humid climates, and they are both sustainably constructed and designed to be recycled at their end-of-life.

A comprehensive environmental assessment of the project ensured compliance with biodiversity and land use protections, including the safeguarding of wetlands and floodplains through best management practices. Non-reflective panels and habitat preservation efforts have helped minimize impacts on 12 migratory bird species. At the end of its useful life, the site will be fully restored with native vegetation to preserve local ecosystems.

Astroelectricity: America’s national energy security imperative

In July, President Donald J. Trump announced a trade deal with the European Union (EU) in which they will purchase $750 billion of US energy resources over the next three years. At a price of $60 per barrel of oil, this would buy about 12.5 billion barrels of American oil. In terms of energy content, this would roughly equal one year’s worth of consumption of oil and natural gas used in America. With the presumption that this purchase will predominantly be oil and natural gas, it would substantially increase the demand on US oil and natural gas production—and this is without adding any other exports such as to Japan, South Korea, and China.

If oil and natural gas were renewable energy sources, this would be a tremendously beneficial trade deal. Recognizing that the geopolitics surrounding this trade deal is very complicated, it is important to recognize that exporting American oil and natural gas accelerates the depletion of affordable supplies of these non-sustainable fuels—the very fuels of which just a generation earlier, America was dangerously short of.

Periodically, the US Geological Survey publishes estimates of the amount of “technically recoverable” coal, oil, and natural gas remaining in the US. Technically recoverable means that portion of the remaining identified in situ resources that “can be produced using currently available technology and industry practices.” Importantly, market price is not a consideration in determining how much technically recoverable resources remain.

Figure 1: US technically recoverable crude oil and dry natural gas resources as of 1 January 2020. The energy unit “BOE” is an abbreviation for barrels of oil equivalent. References: US Energy Information Administration National Energy Modeling System’s Oil and Gas Supply Module, Tables 1 and 2, dated March 2022.

Oil and natural gas now supply about 70% of the total energy used in America. Based on the pre-COVID-19 use of these two fuels—and prior to these recent trade deals—at the 2019 consumption rate of 12 billion BOE, the technically recoverable oil and natural gas resources would last about 75 years. Should US oil and natural gas exports be substantial and ongoing, then this lifetime estimate would obviously be shorter—perhaps, much shorter! Within the lifetime of today’s young children, these vital energy resources will likely be exhausted, leaving America dangerously energy insecure.

Figure 2: The late-1973 oil embargo caused shortages of gasoline. To moderate demand, rationing was implemented in the form of odd and even number days, based on the number in the license plate, when gasoline could be bought.

America has been down that dangerous road before. In 1970, after 111 years of generally steadily growing production, conventional US oil production peaked, making America oil insecure. Within three years, America’s first oil supply crisis hit when some Middle East nations attempted to squeeze the US president to align with their foreign policy priorities. That crisis dramatically increased oil prices and caused a substantial US recession.

Figure 3: History of US domestic oil production and imports from 1900-2023 with the author’s illustration of the likely decline of conventional oil production through 2100.

Within a decade, as America’s oil insecurity grew to the point that America was importing over half of the oil used, President Jimmy Carter declared protecting American access to foreign oil a national security priority. Within another decade, America was engaged in full-out conventional warfare in the Middle East to protect US access. It took nearly another 30 years for the US to finally be rescued —yes, rescued—from that quagmire by the practicable technological breakthrough of guided drilling and hydraulic fracturing known as “fracking.”

The US Department of Energy (DOE) was formed in 1977 by President Carter. He consolidated several existing federal agencies—many arising out of the Manhattan Project and civil nuclear power—into a department level organization focused on energy conservation and renewable energy sources, with a “side hustle” of managing much of the government’s nuclear weapon and nuclear power activities. (None of which have proven to reduce America’s persistent conventional oil insecurity.) Yet, buried deep in that organization when it was formed was federal research and development financial support for what became the fracking that rescued America three decades later and has now enabled the world to enter a period of energy insecurity dormancy led by the US.

The chart above shows the history of US domestic oil production. Specifically, the chart shows the sustained rise in production of conventional oil wells until the peak in 1970 followed by the decline that is still underway. This bell-shaped production curve is representative of all natural resources in demand. It was seen in the production of both wood fuel and coal in the US. Hence, we know that it will repeat with the production of fracked oil and natural gas.

As everyone should acknowledge, fracking is only a “band-aid” fix to America’s need to be permanently energy secure. Knowing this, it is only common sense that the US Department of Energy should have (by now) established a national energy security strategy to undertake America’s orderly transition to sustainable energy before, once again, America becomes energy insecure. However, this has not happened, even as the necessity for America undertaking this transition has been readily apparent for decades.

Responding to this need, I began to quantitatively model America’s energy use and evaluate its sustainable energy transition needs in 2008. Over the years, I have refined my analysis. In 2022, I summarized my findings in an article here in 2022. (See “Evaluating America’s green energy options including astroelectricity (part 1)”, The Space Review, November 14, 2022.) Recently, I updated and published my analytical assessment on ResearchGate. In this article, I summarize my updated results to reemphasize the point that pursuing the development of space solar power (SSP)-supplied astroelectricity should now be America’s (and DOE’s) national energy security imperative.

What will it take for America to “go clean”

The failed Green New Deal efforts make very clear that successfully transitioning to sustainable energy is not a trivial undertaking. Difficulties arise in two areas. First, the type of sustainable energy must be able to be scaled up sufficiently to make a difference. Second, the implementation of the solution must provide an orderly transition path while being practicable to be built. To better understand these two considerations, I will begin by explaining how much total energy America now needs and then show the equivalent amount of entirely sustainable energy needed for America to “go clean.”

America’s current energy use

The starting point is to refresh our understanding of pertinent energy units. For the use of primary combustible fuels in America —coal, oil, and natural gas—the primary energy unit is the British Thermal Unit (BTU). This unit originated two centuries ago to aid in designing steam engines. A BTU is the amount of thermal energy (heat) needed to raise one pound (16 fluid ounces) of water by one degree Fahrenheit. For perspective, when heating 16 fluid ounces of tap water to make tea, around 130 BTU of heat must be used. A BOE is defined as having 5.8 million BTUs of thermal energy.

For the following discussions, I use America’s energy use in 2019 as the baseline. That was the year prior to the COVID-19 pandemic when the impact of the pandemic and later national energy policy changes suppressed energy use. Thus, in terms of per-person energy use, the 2019 value indicates what is needed during generally prosperous economic times.

Reflecting the fact that fossil carbon fuels still predominate US energy use, America’s national energy use is often reported using a unit called the “Quad”. This is an abbreviation for 1 quadrillion BTUs or 1 × 1015 BTUs. The chart below shows America’s sources of energy and how energy use “flows” through the US economy. In 2019, according to this chart, America used 100.2 Quads of energy from all sources. Coal, petroleum (oil), and natural gas provided about 80 Quads or 80% of the primary energy, with just oil and natural gas providing nearly 70 Quads. Further, electricity use consumed about 37 Quads or 37% of the primary energy.

Figure 4: Diagram of how the sources of energy used in the US, shown on the left, “flow” through America’s economy to yield the goods and services consumed. Essentially, this entire energy flow needs to be made sustainable.

One Quad equals 172.4 million BOE. Thus, from the above chart, the 100.2 Quads used in 2019 equaled 17.3 billion BOE, with the petroleum and natural gas consumption supplying nearly 12 billion BOE—the value shown in the earlier Figure 1 table.

An oil supertanker will carry two to three million barrels. Thus, in 2019, Americans used the equivalent of around 7,000 supertankers of oil—nearly one supertanker worth of energy every hour of every day. Of these, four of every five supertankers would be non-sustainable energy that must be replaced by new sustainable energy sources. Supplying 10–12 million BOE of new sustainable energy every day illustrates the challenge that America must solve to undertake an orderly transition to practicable sustainable energy. Clearly, this will require a well-developed “engineering” solution, not an impractical political solution as has been tried for the past several decades.

America’s possible sustainable energy source options

Figure 5: The four possible sustainable energy sources that are sufficiently scalable to substantially replace fossil carbon fuels.

While there are many possible sources of terrestrial sustainable energy for America to use, biomass, hydroelectricity, geothermal electricity, and wave- and tidal-generated electrical power cannot be scaled up to become a primary source of sustainable energy to replace fossil carbon fuels. This leaves only wind power, ground solar power, and nuclear fission power as the remaining terrestrial options for America to possibly use to “go clean.” For this assessment, I added the option of SSP-supplied astroelectricity. Wind power and ground solar power are, obviously, intermittent power sources while nuclear fission power and astroelectricity are baseload power sources, meaning that they are assumed in this assessment to be able to operate continuously.

American current per person use of energy

The starting point to determine how much sustainable electrical energy America will need to go clean is to start with America’s current average energy use per person—specifically per resident. Using updated consumption and population values for 2019, the following chart shows how much energy per person was used on average and how this was consumed in the form of electrical energy and fuels.

In 2019, 12,545.8 kilowatt-hours (kWh) of electrical energy and 31.1 BOE of fuels were used per person on average. In total, the equivalent of 50.584 BOE of energy was used per person. (By using the BOE unit, this provides an appreciation of how much energy is actually being used per person in America today.)

Figure 6: US average total energy used per person in 2019 showing the breakdown into electrical energy and fuels use.

Introducing two new energy units

In America’s new sustainable energy infrastructure, electrical energy will be the primary type of sustainable energy used. The two electrical energy units used that will replace the BTU and BOE are the kilowatt-hour (kWh) and the gigawatt-hour (GWh). However, with kWh and GWh not having any real world physical meaning—as the BTU and BOE do—two new energy units are needed to help appreciate how much sustainable electrical energy will be needed per person and nationally.

From the above chart, 12,545.8 kWh of electrical energy was used on average per person in 2019. This was the electricity used directly (e.g., air conditioning) as well as that used to produce the goods and services consumed. There are 8,760 hours in a year. Thus, 12,545.8 kWh ÷ 8,760 hours = 1.43 kW of electrical power being used continuously throughout the year, on average. We can conveniently express 12,545.8 kWh as 1.43 kW-continuous or 1.43 kWc.

A typical microwave oven uses 1 kW of power when operating. Thus, in 2019, each American consumed enough electricity to operate 1.43 microwave ovens continuously. We can think of the per person electrical energy use in terms of microwave ovens just as we thought of the total energy use in terms of the barrel of oil equivalent.

In 2019, the US used 4,130,574 GWh of total electrical energy, or 472 GW continuous, GWc. The Hoover Dam can generate 2 GW when operating at full power. If the Hoover Dam could operate continuously, it would be rated at 2 GWc. We can use this to express the 472 GWc generated in 2019 as being equivalent to 236 Hoover Dams operating continuously.

When mentioning that the US was generating the equivalent of 472 GW of continuous power, most people would have little appreciation of how much energy that was. However, if this is stated as the US was producing the equivalent of 236 Hoover Dams operating continuously, this can readily be understood. Just as I will use the number of microwave ovens operating continuously to illustrate how much clean energy will be needed per person, the number of Hoover Dams operating continuously will be used to illustrate how much total sustainable energy for America will need to go clean.

Figure 7: A microwave oven and the Hoover Dam are used to provide a perspective on how much sustainable energy America will need per person and nationally to “go clean”.

(Note: Before continuing, take a guess at how many Hoover Dams operating continuously would be needed for America to fully transition to sustainable energy.)

Modeling America’s needed new sustainable energy infrastructure

Figure 8: Diagram of the model used to estimate the total primary sustainable electrical power (kWc) needed to go clean.

The sustainable energy transition model I used is shown in the diagram above. The complexity of energy use in America—as shown earlier in the energy flow diagram—and the need for carbon-based fuels and industrial feedstocks makes an all-electric or an electric-hydrogen energy infrastructure impracticable to use. Therefore, in this model, both clean hydrogen and CO₂-neutral (clean) carbon fuels are supplied to replace the use of fossil carbon fuels. By producing clean carbon fuels and industrial feedstocks, the transition from the use of fossil carbon fuels to an entirely sustainable energy infrastructure is seamless, making it generally transparent to the end-users. This is what I call an “orderly” transition.

(Note: All carbon used to produce synthetic carbon fuels and industrial feedstocks comes from the CO₂ either extracted from the atmosphere or captured in the exhaust of industrial plants, power plants, and waste disposal incinerators. In this manner, no net CO₂ is added to the atmosphere. This is necessary for undertaking an orderly transition to sustainable energy.)

I used this model to estimate the total primary sustainable electrical power (kWc) needed per person to supply 12,545.8 kWh of sustainable dispatched electrical power and 31.1 BOE of sustainable fuels. This model was run separately using only intermittent primary power and then using only baseload power.

(Note: For this top-level estimate of sustainable energy needs, only synthetic methane is assumed to be produced to supply the needed replacement fuels.)

America’s total kWc and GWc needed to have already “gone clean” in 2019

Figure 9: Estimated total kWh of primary electrical energy and kWc of primary electrical power needed per person on average in the US in 2019 to have already transitioned to sustainable energy.

Recall that in 2019, the average end-user, directly and indirectly, used 1.43 kWc of utility-dispatched electrical power. This was generated using 38.5% of the total energy used. If all energy consumed had been used to generate electricity, then the total would have been 3.71 kWc.

From the above table, to transition fully to sustainable energy using the baseload-methane case, 16.47 kWc would be needed per person. Thus, for the baseload-methane case, America’s new sustainable energy infrastructure needs to supply roughly 4.4 times more energy per person. When using intermittent sources, this increases to 21.14 kWc, 5.7 times more energy. Using the microwave oven metaphor, the energy need increases from about 4 microwave ovens to about 16 for the baseload case and about 21 for the intermittent case. Hopefully, this is making clear the magnitude of the challenge of America successfully transitioning from fossil carbon fuels.

Figure 10: Comparison of the total GWc of primary electrical power needed in 2019 along with the equivalent number of Hoover Dams operating continuously to supply that power.

The total GWc needed for America to have already transitioned to sustainable energy can easily be calculated by multiplying the above table’s kWc values by the US 2019 resident population. These results, along with the equivalent number of Hoover Dams operating continuously, are shown in the table above. When using baseload primary power, the equivalent of 2,476 two-gigawatt Hoover Dams operating continuously, supplying 5,424 GWc of electrical power, would have been needed. For the intermittent case, this increases to the equivalent of 3,481 Hoover Dams supplying 6,962 GWc.

Was your guess anywhere near this number?

(Note: The 2019 resident population used was about 329 million. Each additional million adds the need for 7.5 additional Hoover Dams operating continuously.)

Assessing America’s four possible scalable sustainable power options

As noted earlier, America has only four possible sufficiently scalable options to enable its transition to sustainable energy. The intermittent options are wind power and ground solar power, while the baseload options are nuclear fission power and space solar power-supplied astroelectricity. In my assessment, I examined each to determine if it was a practicable solution at the scale needed to fully meet the GWc need.

Wind power

Figure 11: Possible wind farm locations in the contiguous US for wind turbines with a hub height of 110 meters.

The above map was created by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) as part of their assessment of the wind power potential in the contiguous US. The blue areas are where commercial wind farms could be built with the darker blue areas where the annual wind energy potential is greatest.

The NREL study found that about five million square kilometers (1.9 million square miles) of the contiguous United States could be used to build commercial wind farms. Building out this extent of wind power would require installing about 7.7 million wind turbines on nearly two-thirds of the contiguous US.

Figure 12: This chart summarizes the author’s analysis of the NREL assessment of the wind power potential in the contiguous US. It shows how the total GWc available increases as more of the land area is used for wind farms, beginning with those areas with the greatest wind power potential.

From my assessment’s results—shown in the chart above—such extensive use of commercial wind farms could yield 4,756 GWc of intermittent primary electrical power in an average wind power year. Recall that 6,692 GWc of such intermittent primary power would have been needed in 2019. Thus, in an average year, the available wind power is only 68% of what the US would have needed to transition fully to sustainable energy. In a low wind power year, this drops to 3,805 GWc, or only 55% of what would have been needed. Obviously, wind power alone is not a practicable solution since the American public is unlikely to accept covering America with a forest of wind turbines, especially without yielding a full sustainable energy solution.

Ground solar power

While obviously there is sufficient land in the contiguous United States on which to build ground solar farms, how much land would be needed? By my estimate, to supply 6,692 GWc of intermittent primary power, about 14% of the contiguous United States would need to be converted into ground solar farms. In total, the required land area, within the perimeter fence, would be 1.1 million square kilometers (420,000 square miles). As shown in the map below, this is equivalent to a square of land 1,045 kilometers on each side.

Figure 13: Representative total area of ground solar farms needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need overlaid on a terrain map of the contiguous US.

As the map above shows, a large percentage of the contiguous United States is unsuitable for ground solar farms due to terrain, especially in the sunny Southwest. Also, suitable locations for commercial solar farms require generally flat land and a location that has generally sunny skies—essentially the same requirements needed for large-scale agriculture. Thus, while needing only 14% of the total contiguous land area may not at first appear unreasonable, ground solar farms would need to be built across much of America’s breadbasket states. This is unlikely to be politically acceptable as well as being unacceptable from a food-security perspective.

Hence, as with wind power, ground solar power alone is NOT a practicable means of enabling America to transition to sustainable energy. In fact, a combination of wind power and ground solar power is also not a practicable solution as it still requires a coast-to-coast forest of turbines while only cutting the required land area for solar farms in half.

Nuclear fission power

With wind and ground solar power not enabling America to undertake a practicable transition to sustainable energy, the only remaining terrestrial option is nuclear fission power. As noted previously, the baseload-methane case would require 5,424 GWc of primary electrical power. This equates to 5,641 GW of nameplate power with the assumption that each plant would not be generating power for two weeks each year to undertake maintenance, inspection, and refueling. For perspective, the US currently has around 100 GW of nuclear power generation capacity. To fully meet the baseload sustainable energy need using only nuclear fission power, about 56 times more nuclear generation capacity would be needed.

As has been recognized since the 1950s, with natural uranium only having 0.72% of the U-235 fissile fuel needed by the reactors, breeding is needed to undertake a substantial expansion of nuclear fission power. It is estimated that about 1.2 metric tonnes of fissile fuel are needed per GW-year of generation. Thus, to fully meet the US sustainable energy need, 6,509 metric tonnes of either Pu-239 or U-233 would need to be bred each year. For perspective, from 1945 until it ended breeding in 1987, the government’s Hanford plant only produced a total of 67.4 metric tonnes of plutonium for use in nuclear weapons and to power naval reactors.

While nuclear breeding reactors were pursued in the 1960s and early 1970s, by the end of the 1970s, these were abandoned due to worries about nuclear weapon proliferation as both Pu-239 and U-233 can be used to produce nuclear weapons. Further, no enrichment is needed as with U-235. Thus, nuclear breeder reactors could covertly—or defiantly, by a rogue nation—be used to produce fissile materials to make nuclear weapons. Should the United States establish a precedent for using nuclear breeder reactors to transition to sustainable energy, this will most certainly open the door for uncontrollable nuclear weapon proliferation worldwide.

Figure 14: An already built naval reactor was used to speed up the construction of the Shippingport Atomic Power Plant.

In the 1950s, the US advocated for the peaceful use of nuclear energy. The first civilian nuclear power plant was built at Shippingport, Pennsylvania. An unneeded US Navy 60-megawatt (MW) reactor, developed for an aircraft carrier, was installed in 1956 as shown in the photograph above. The plant began to generate electrical power the next year.

This particular reactor bred fuel while producing power. During its 25 years of operation, it first bred Pu-239 and, later, was modified to breed U-233. However, doing this required a special core of weapons-grade U-235 to breed Pu-239 with a similar approach used to breed U-233. This effort spurred interest in the 1960s and early 1970s in developing more advanced breeding power reactors—efforts that were abandoned by the end of the 1970s.

The Shippingport Atomic Power Plant illustrates why there is current interest in building new nuclear fission power plants using smaller “modular” reactors. The intent is to reduce the construction cost and shorten the plant’s construction time by powering it with one or more smaller reactors that can be built on an assembly line and then installed in the plant as was done with the naval reactor. To achieve the US total GWc need, the chart below shows how many of such small modular reactors in the range of 100–500 megawatts would be needed.

Figure 15: Number of small modular reactors needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need as a function of the reactor nameplate power generation rating.

Naval reactors typically have an operating life of about 30 years. Thus, the small modular reactors will have a finite life perhaps in the range of 30 to 60 years. At the end of their life—when the reactor would likely be highly radioactive—each would need to be decommissioned, removed from the power plant, and transported to where they would be finally (somehow) rendered no longer a radioactive hazard to humanity.

While this sounds straightforward, when the Shippingport reactor was decommissioned and removed in the late 1980s, to render it safe for transport, the reactor pressure vessel and its steel and concrete filled surrounding radiation shield weighed 870 metric tonnes. It required a 320-wheel trailer to transport it the short distance to the Ohio River to be loaded aboard a special oceangoing barge for transport down the Ohio and Mississippi Rivers and then by sea to Washington state where it was entombed—meaning it is probably still there. This is what may need to be done to remove and replace the modular reactors—perhaps several hundred each year—at the end of their rated life to keep the nuclear power plants operating.

In addition to the nuclear weapon proliferation issues and the likely need for the transport and entombment of highly radioactive decommissioned reactors, many other serious concerns exist. Among these are the threat of natural disaster (such as the tsunamis that destroyed several Japanese nuclear power plants in 2011), a continuously expanding need for nuclear waste disposal (with no current politically acceptable solution), the growing threat of terrorist attacks (perhaps using drone-deployed weapons), and the threat of a space-based electromagnetic pulse attack (potentially rendering the reactors’ safety systems inoperative). As with wind power and ground solar power, nuclear fission power will not enable America to undertake an orderly transition to sustainable energy.

Astroelectricity

As the 1960s came to an end, American oil insecurity was emerging as a major political, economic, and national security issue. One proposed solution—far ahead of its time—was to collect sunlight in Earth orbit, convert this into electrical power, transmit this power via radio waves to special receiving antenna (rectenna) farms on the ground, and supply this power—what I call “astroelectricity”—to the power grid as baseload power. This is called space solar power (SSP). It was invented by Peter Glaser in 1968, perhaps building on the idea of beaming power to planets in a 1941 story by science fiction author Isaac Asimov. Glaser received a US patent for this in 1973.

Figure 16: Illustration of space solar power from Peter Glaser’s space solar power patent.

As America’s energy insecurity grew in the 1970s—and after breeder reactors were abandoned—space solar power was investigated from 1978 to 1980 by NASA and the recently formed DOE. From these efforts, a baseline five-gigawatt space solar power system was defined. This concept is shown in the following illustration. It involves using Manhattan Island-size space solar power platforms located in geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) to collect sunlight, convert this into electrical power, and transmit the power using radio waves to the ground receiving antennas (rectenna farm).

Figure 17: Illustration of the ground rectenna site that would receive the power transmitted from the space solar power platform. The transmitted power will be converted into “astroelectricity” and fed into the regional power grid just as is done with baseload powerplants today.

I refer to the ground rectenna farm as an astroelectric plant. For the baseline 5-GWc design, the ground area used by the astroelectric plant is shown in the following illustration. For a typical plant located in the contiguous US, the plant’s rectangular area would be 12.6 km  16.6 km = 209 square kilometers (81 square miles). This equates to 42 square kilometers (16 square miles) needed per 1 GWc of baseload power supplied.

(Note: The GEO SSP platforms will enter the Earth’s shadow at local midnight for about an hour each day for about a week before and after the spring and fall equinoxes. This would be at a time of minimal power demand—seasonally as well as daily. With the annual loss of energy being less than 1%, for this top-level assessment, the SSP platforms are considered to be operating continuously.)

Figure 18: Diagram of the dimensions of a typical astroelectric plant located in the mid-latitudes of the contiguous US.

I assumed that astroelectricity would supply 80% of the primary baseload power America would need. This equates to 4,339 GWc of astroelectricity needed. This would require about 182,000 square kilometers (70,000 square miles) of land in the contiguous United States for the astroelectric plants. This is less than 3% of the contiguous US. For perspective, this is comparable to the total land used for cities in the contiguous US.

For the remaining 20% of the total GWc needed, ground photovoltaic solar farms would be used. Using special rectenna panels collecting both sunlight and the transmitted power, these solar farms would be built as part of the overall astroelectric plants.

Figure 19: Representative total area of astroelectric plants needed to meet the US 2019 GWc need overlaid on a terrain map of the contiguous US.

The approximate total land area needed for this astroelectric option is shown on the map above. The 180,000 square kilometers needed for the astroelectricity option compares very favorably to the more than one million square kilometers needed for an all-ground solar power solution or with the coast-to-coast forest of wind turbines and a half-million square kilometers of ground solar farms needed for a combined solution. The space solar power option will provide America with the best form of sustainable primary power—baseload—while minimizing the land area needed to meet America’s total sustainable energy need. Also, it is the only one of the four options that provides a practicable solution for undertaking an orderly transition to sustainable energy.

Conclusion

The primary conclusions drawn from the assessment are:

At least for America, only SSP-supplied astroelectricity can provide an orderly transition to sustainable energy at the scale needed to replace fossil carbon fuels.

The magnitude of America’s transition to sustainable energy is immense requiring concerted leadership and effort by the Government to ensure that it is effectively undertaken.

To avoid a return to the geopolitical plague of energy insecurity, America must complete the transition to SSP-supplied astroelectricity before the end of this century while being ready to begin its orderly deployment by the time fracked oil and natural gas production peaks and begin their inevitable decline.

Acknowledging today’s moral obligation that we owe to future generations to ensure that their America will still be free, prosperous, energy secure, and at peace, undertaking SSP must now become America’s national energy security imperative.

""It's very tough to make an electric pickup work today,"" then-Lucid CEO Peter Rawlinson said during the company's Tech and Manufacturing Day back in September 2024, adding, ""not one that's usable and cost-effective.""

The bad news is that many of Lucid's rivals have tried and are mostly failing.

What have you done for me lately?

Let's briefly go down the list. Tesla's (TSLA 1.88%) Cybertruck, which (it is fair to say) has been a commercial flop, has disappeared from Tesla's U.S. order page as battery-electric pickups industrywide feel the pain. Tesla introduced the base model in April with a sticker price roughly $10,000 lower in the hopes of attracting buyers, but it was essentially a gutted version of the vehicle and dropped key features that made the truck compelling to the small niche of an audience it had.

Back in 2019, CEO Elon Musk announced the cheapest version of the Cybertruck would start under $40,000 before shipping, but in reality, it retailed at nearly $70,000. Musk also predicted the pickup truck would sell between 250,000 and 500,000 units. While Tesla doesn't report sales by country or model, U.S. vehicle registration data can give us an idea of the sales landscape -- and it's not pretty. In fact, year to date through July, the Cybertruck had only 15,211 U.S. registrations, per S&P Global Mobility. That was good enough for a 14% decline compared to the same period in 2024. July registrations are down 54% year over year.

Tesla isn't the only automaker with a big truck problem. Ram, a major Stellantis (STLA -1.42%) brand, canceled plans for its first full electric pickup and attributed the decision to slowing demand for electric vehicles (EVs).

Rivian (RIVN 5.98%), in the same fashion as Tesla, doesn't report sales by country or model, but U.S. registrations for Rivian's R1T fell 37% year to date through July. July registrations dropped about as severely as Tesla's, down 40% to only 588 pickups. Ford Motor Company's (F 0.47%) F-150 Lightning faced a less drastic drop, but a drop nonetheless. The F-150 Lightning recorded a 12% drop in registrations through July, with July registrations down 15%. Ford rival General Motors (GM -0.05%) was the lone bright spot in an otherwise cloudy picture: The automaker's Silverado EV, Sierra EV, and Hummer EV all posted registration gains through July.

What's the problem?

Despite GM's bright spot, the pickup EV segment failed to break 50,000 sales through July, which is the opposite of the gasoline-powered full-size truck segment that powers sales by the hundreds of thousands annually. So what gives? Why is the EV truck segment so different from the gasoline segment?

Essentially, the economics of an electric pickup flip historic truths. The dirty little secret is that gasoline-powered full-size trucks cost only marginally more to produce than sedans, yet the former can power price tags 2 to 3 times higher. That gives full-size trucks margins that are unprecedented in the automotive industry, and have powered profits in Detroit for decades.

But when it comes to EV trucks, the largest cost component is typically the battery, and those weigh down margins significantly. And there isn't much breathing room because consumers view full-size trucks, even electric trucks, as a work tool and aren't generally willing to give up performance or towing power to lower price tags. It becomes incredibly difficult to turn a profit, even a gross profit, when massive battery packs on the market can cost around $50,000.

What it all means

But all is not lost. Eventually, battery prices will come down to earth, potentially opening the door for successful EV pickups -- Ford is already on this path.

In fact, Ford essentially has doubled down on its EV ambitions. It went back to the drawing board and revolutionized its historic assembly line into an ""assembly tree,"" where three sub-lines produce their parts simultaneously before joining together. Not only is it expected to substantially improve production speed, by up to 40% compared to the current vehicles produced, but Ford also anticipates that the first EV to roll off the line will be an EV pickup that's expected to be profitable very early in its life cycle.",https://g.foolcdn.com/editorial/images/834322/2026-hummer-ev-carbon-fiber-edition-pickup.jpg,N,,2025-09-23 07:01:56.711160

Atem was formed by Meta this year and is wholly owned by the Mark Zuckerberg-run company. According to the application, it was ""formed to act as a power marketer to sell energy, capacity, and certain ancillary services at wholesale in the United States.""

The decision by Meta is predicated on skyrocketing energy demand emanating from the artificial intelligence data center market. Its planned Louisiana data center is expected to have a capacity exceeding 2GW and will be powered by three combined-cycle gas turbines with a capacity of 2.26GW, built and operated by utility Entergy.

Late last year, the company also announced a request for proposals to identify potential nuclear energy developers to support 1.4GW of new nuclear generation capacity across the US.

Following the RFP, the company signed a 20-year Power Purchase Agreement (PPA) with Constellation Energy for more than 1.1GW of power from a nuclear power plant in Clinton, Illinois.

The company has also signed numerous renewable supply agreements to decarbonize its operations. In June, the firm procured almost 800MW of renewable power from Invenergy to power its US data center portfolio.

However, its renewable strategy has come under fire due to a reliance on Environmental Attributes Purchase Agreement (EAPA) over PPAs. EAPAs do not involve the direct purchase of energy.
