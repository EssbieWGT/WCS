Still, the US energy department last week ordered the plant to remain open for another 90 days.

The Trump administration in May ordered utility giant Consumers Energy to keep the 63-year-old JH Campbell coal plant in western Michigan, about 100 miles north-east of Chicago, online just as it was being retired.

The order has drawn outrage from consumer advocates and environmental groups who say the plant is expensive and emits high levels of toxic air pollution and greenhouse gas.

The costs will be spread among households across the northern and central regional Miso grid, which stretches from eastern Montana to Michigan, and includes nine other states

“The costs of unnecessarily running this jalopy coal plant just continue to mount,” said Michael Lenoff, an attorney with Earthjustice, which is suing over the order.

Gary Rochow, Consumers Energy’s CEO, told investors in a 30 October earnings call that the Trump administration in its order stated that ratepayers should shoulder the costs, and detailed how the company should pass on the costs.

“That order from the energy department has laid out a clear path to cost recovery,” Rochow said.

The utility has said in regulatory filings that the order is costing customers about $615,000 per day. The order has been in place for around six months.

Michigan attorney general Dana Nessel filed a motion for a stay in federal court, alleging the administration’s latest order is “arbitrary and illegal”.

The coal plant is one of two in Michigan that the Trump administration has moved to keep open under the president’s controversial national energy emergency executive order, which is being challenged in court by multiple lawsuits.

The other plant is not scheduled to close for two years. The two factories emit about 45% of the state’s greenhouse gas pollution.

Trump has also used his emergency energy order to keep gas plants near Baltimore and Philadelphia online.

Consumers Energy said it did not ask for Campbell to remain open. The Trump administration did not consult local regulators, a spokesperson for the Michigan public service commission (MPSC), which regulates utilities and manages the state’s grid, told the Guardian in May.

“The unnecessary recent order … will increase the cost of power for homes and businesses in Michigan and across the midwest,” the chair of the MPSC, Dan Scripps, said in a statement at the time.

The latest figures proved Scripps correct.

In May, an energy department spokesperson insisted in a statement that retiring the coal plants “would jeopardize the reliability of our grid systems”.

But regulatory data from Miso and the MPSC over the last six months shows that statement was wrong.

The Miso grid had excess power far above what Campbell provided during peak demand this summer. And the plant often was not operating at full capacity, likely because its power was not needed, advocates say. But the plant still costs ratepayers even when not operating at capacity.

Hyperscalers — including tech giants such as Microsoft and Meta, as well as leaders in artificial intelligence like OpenAI and CoreWeave — are investing eyewatering amounts of capital into developing new energy resources to feed their power-hungry data infrastructure. Those data centers are already straining the existing energy grid, prompting widespread political anxiety over an energy supply crisis and a ratepayer affordability shock. Nothing in recent memory has thrown policymakers’ decades-long underinvestment in the health of our energy grid into such stark relief. The commercial potential of next-generation energy technologies such as advanced nuclear, batteries, and grid-enhancing applications now hinge on the speed and scale of the AI buildout.

But what happens if the AI boom buffers and data center investment collapses? It is not idle speculation to say that the AI boom rests on unstable financial foundations. Worse, however, is the fact that as of this year, the tech sector’s breakneck investment into data centers is the only tailwind to U.S. economic growth. If there is a market correction, there is no other growth sector that could pick up the slack.

Not only would a sudden reversal in investor sentiment make stranded assets of the data centers themselves, which will lose value as their lease revenue disappears, it also threatens to strand all the energy projects and efficiency innovations that data center demand might have called forth.

If the AI boom does not deliver, we need a backup plan for energy policy.

An analysis of the capital structure of the AI boom suggests that policymakers should be more concerned about the financial fundamentals of data centers and their tenants — the tech companies that are buoying the economy. My recent report for the Center for Public Enterprise, Bubble or Nothing, maps out how the various market actors in the AI sector interact, connecting the market structure of the AI inference sector to the economics of Nvidia’s graphics processing units, the chips known as GPUs that power AI software, to the data center real estate debt market. Spelling out the core financial relationships illuminates where the vulnerabilities lie.

First and foremost: The business model remains unprofitable. The leading AI companies ― mostly the leading tech companies, as well as some AI-specific firms such as OpenAI and Anthropic ― are all competing with each other to dominate the market for AI inference services such as large language models. None of them is returning a profit on its investments. Back-of-the-envelope math suggests that Meta, Google, Microsoft, and Amazon invested over $560 billion into AI technology and data centers through 2024 and 2025, and have reported revenues of just $35 billion.

To be sure, many new technology companies remain unprofitable for years ― including now-ubiquitous firms like Uber and Amazon. Profits are not the AI sector’s immediate goal; the sector’s high valuations reflect investors’ assumptions about future earnings potential. But while the losses pile up, the market leaders are all vying to maximize the market share of their virtually identical services ― a prisoner’s dilemma of sorts that forces down prices even as the cost of providing inference services continues to rise. Rising costs, suppressed revenues, and fuzzy measurements of real user demand are, when combined, a toxic cocktail and a reflection of the sector’s inherent uncertainty.

Second: AI companies have a capital investment problem. These are not pure software companies; to provide their inference services, AI companies must all invest in or find ways to access GPUs. In mature industries, capital assets have predictable valuations that their owners can borrow against and use as collateral to invest further in their businesses. Not here: The market value of a GPU is incredibly uncertain and, at least currently, remains suppressed due to the sector’s competitive market structure, the physical deterioration of GPUs at high utilization rates, the unclear trajectory of demand, and the value destruction that comes from Nvidia’s now-yearly release of new high-end GPU models.

The tech industry’s rush to invest in new GPUs means existing GPUs lose market value much faster. Some companies, particularly the vulnerable and debt-saddled “neocloud” companies that buy GPUs to rent their compute capacity to retail and hyperscaler consumers, are taking out tens of billions of dollars of loans to buy new GPUs backed by the value of their older GPU stock; the danger of this strategy is obvious. Others including OpenAI and xAI, having realized that GPUs are not safe to hold on one’s balance sheet, are instead renting them from Oracle and Nvidia, respectively.

To paper over the valuation uncertainty of the GPUs they do own, all the hyperscalers have changed their accounting standards for GPU valuations over the past few years to minimize their annual reported depreciation expenses. Some financial analysts don’t buy it: Last year, Barclays analysts judged GPU depreciation as risky enough to merit marking down the earnings estimates of Google (in this case its parent company, Alphabet), Microsoft, and Meta as much as 10%, arguing that consensus modeling was severely underestimating the earnings write-offs required.

Under these market dynamics, the booming demand for high-end chips looks less like a reflection of healthy growth for the tech sector and more like a scramble for high-value collateral to maintain market position among a set of firms with limited product differentiation. If high demand projections for AI technologies come true, collateral ostensibly depreciates at a manageable pace as older GPUs retain their marketable value over their useful life — but otherwise, this combination of structurally compressed profits and rapidly depreciating collateral is evidence of a snake eating its own tail.

All of these hyperscalers are tenants within data centers. Their lack of cash flow or good collateral should have their landlords worried about “tenant churn,” given the risk that many data center tenants will have to undertake multiple cycles of expensive capital expenditure on GPUs and network infrastructure within a single lease term. Data center developers take out construction (or “mini-perm”) loans of four to six years and refinance them into longer-term permanent loans, which can then be packaged into asset-backed and commercial mortgage-backed securities to sell to a wider pool of institutional investors and banks. The threat of broken leases and tenant vacancies threatens the long-term solvency of the leading data center developers ― companies like Equinix and Digital Realty ― as well as the livelihoods of the construction contractors and electricians they hire to build their facilities and manage their energy resources.

Much ink has already been spilled on how the hyperscalers are “roundabouting” each other, or engaging in circular financing: They are making billions of dollars of long-term purchase commitments, equity investments, and project co-development agreements with one another. OpenAI, Oracle, CoreWeave, and Nvidia are at the center of this web. Nvidia has invested $100 billion in OpenAI, to be repaid over time through OpenAI’s lease of Nvidia GPUs. Oracle is spending $40 billion on Nvidia GPUs to power a data center it has leased for 15 years to support OpenAI, for which OpenAI is paying Oracle $300 billion over the next five years. OpenAI is paying CoreWeave over the next five years to rent its Nvidia GPUs; the contract is valued at $11.9 billion, and OpenAI has committed to spending at least $4 billion through April 2029. OpenAI already has a $350 million equity stake in CoreWeave. Nvidia has committed to buying CoreWeave’s unsold cloud computing capacity by 2032 for $6.3 billion, after it already took a 7% stake in CoreWeave when the latter went public. If you’re feeling dizzy, count yourself lucky: These deals represent only a fraction of the available examples of circular financing.

These companies are all betting on each others’ growth; their growth projections and purchase commitments are all dependent on their peers’ growth projections and purchase commitments. Optimistically, this roundabouting represents a kind of “risk mutualism,” which, at least for now, ends up supporting greater capital expenditures. Pessimistically, roundabouting is a way for these companies to pay each other for goods and services in any way except cash — shares, warrants, purchase commitments, token reservations, backstop commitments, and accounts receivable, but not U.S. dollars. The second any one of these companies decides it wants cash rather than a commitment is when the music stops. Chances are, that company needs cash to pay a commitment of its own, likely involving a lender.

Lenders are the final piece of the puzzle. Contrary to the notion that cash-rich hyperscalers can finance their own data center buildout, there has been a record volume of debt issuance this year from companies such as Oracle and CoreWeave, as well as private credit giants like Blue Owl and Apollo, which are lending into the boom. The debt may not go directly onto hyperscalers’ balance sheets, but their purchase commitments are the collateral against which data center developers, neocloud companies like CoreWeave, and private credit firms raise capital. While debt is not inherently something to shy away from ― it’s how infrastructure gets built ― it’s worth raising eyebrows at the role private credit firms are playing at the center of this revenue-free investment boom. They are exposed to GPU financing and to data center financing, although not the GPU producers themselves. They have capped upside and unlimited downside. If they stop lending, the rest of the sector’s risks look a lot more risky.

A market correction starts when any one of the AI companies can’t scrounge up the cash to meet its liabilities and can no longer keep borrowing money to delay paying for its leases and its debts. A sudden stop in lending to any of these companies would be a big deal ― it would force AI companies to sell their assets, particularly GPUs, into a potentially adverse market in order to meet refinancing deadlines. A fire sale of GPUs hurts not just the long-term earnings potential of the AI companies themselves, but also producers such as Nvidia and AMD, since even they would be selling their GPUs into a soft market.

For the tech industry, the likely outcome of a market correction is consolidation. Any widespread defaults among AI-related businesses and special purpose vehicles will leave capital assets like GPUs and energy technologies like supercapacitors stranded, losing their market value in the absence of demand ― the perfect targets for a rollup. Indeed, it stands to reason that the tech giants’ dominance over the cloud and web services sectors, not to mention advertising, will allow them to continue leading the market. They can regain monopolistic control over the remaining consumer demand in the AI services sector; their access to more certain cash flows eases their leverage constraints over the longer term as the economy recovers.

A market correction, then, is hardly the end of the tech industry ― but it still leaves a lot of data center investments stranded. What does that mean for the energy buildout that data centers are directly and indirectly financing?

A market correction would likely compel vertically integrated utilities to cancel plans to develop new combined-cycle gas turbines and expensive clean firm resources such as nuclear energy. Developers on wholesale markets have it worse: It’s not clear how new and expensive firm resources compete if demand shrinks. Grid managers would have to call up more expensive units less frequently. Doing so would constrain the revenue-generating potential of those generators relative to the resources that can meet marginal load more cheaply — namely solar, storage, peaker gas, and demand-response systems. Combined-cycle gas turbines co-located with data centers might be stranded; at the very least, they wouldn’t be used very often. (Peaker gas plants, used to manage load fluctuation, might still get built over the medium term.) And the flight to quality and flexibility would consign coal power back to its own ash heaps. Ultimately, a market correction does not change the broader trend toward electrification.

A market correction that stabilizes the data center investment trajectory would make it easier for utilities to conduct integrated resource planning. But it would not necessarily simplify grid planners’ ability to plan their interconnection queues — phantom projects dropping out of the queue requires grid planners to redo all their studies. Regardless of the health of the investment boom, we still need to reform our grid interconnection processes.

The biggest risk is that ratepayers will be on the hook for assets that sit underutilized in the absence of tech companies’ large load requirements, especially those served by utilities that might be building power in advance of committed contracts with large load customers like data center developers. The energy assets they build might remain useful for grid stability and could still participate in capacity markets. But generation assets built close to data center sites to serve those sites cheaply might not be able to provision the broader energy grid cost-efficiently due to higher grid transport costs incurred when serving more distant sources of load.

These energy projects need not be albatrosses.

Many of these data centers being planned are in the process of securing permits and grid interconnection rights. Those interconnection rights are scarce and valuable; if a data center gets stranded, policymakers should consider purchasing those rights and incentivizing new businesses or manufacturing industries to build on that land and take advantage of those rights. Doing so would provide offtake for nearby energy assets and avoid displacing their costs onto other ratepayers. That being said, new users of that land may not be able to pay anywhere near as much as hyperscalers could for interconnection or for power. Policymakers seeking to capture value from stranded interconnection points must ensure that new projects pencil out at a lower price point.

Policymakers should also consider backstopping the development of critical and innovative energy projects and the firms contracted to build them. I mean this in the most expansive way possible: Policymakers should not just backstop the completion of the solar and storage assets built to serve new load, but also provide exigent purchase guarantees to the firms that are prototyping the flow batteries, supercapacitors, cooling systems, and uninterruptible power systems that data center developers are increasingly interested in. Without these interventions, a market correction would otherwise destroy the value of many of those projects and the earnings potential of their developers, to say nothing of arresting progress on incredibly promising and commercializable technologies.

Policymakers can capture long-term value for the taxpayer by making investments in these distressed projects and developers. This is already what the New York Power Authority has done by taking ownership and backstopping the development of over 7 gigawatts of energy projects ― most of which were at risk of being abandoned by a private sponsor.

The market might not immediately welcome risky bets like these. It is unclear, for instance, what industries could use the interconnection or energy provided to a stranded gigawatt-scale data center. Some of the more promising options ― take aluminum or green steel ― do not have a viable domestic market. Policy uncertainty, tariffs, and tax credit changes in the One Big Beautiful Bill Act have all suppressed the growth of clean manufacturing and metals refining industries like these. The rest of the economy is also deteriorating. The fact that the data center boom is threatened by, at its core, a lack of consumer demand and the resulting unstable investment pathways is itself an ironic miniature of the U.S. economy as a whole.

As analysts at Employ America put it, “The losses in a [tech sector] bust will simply be too large and swift to be neatly offset by an imminent and symmetric boom elsewhere. Even as housing and consumer durables ultimately did well following the bust of the 90s tech boom, there was a one- to two-year lag, as it took time for long-term rates to fall and investors to shift their focus.” This is the issue with having only one growth sector in the economy. And without a more holistic industrial policy, we cannot spur any others.

Questions like these ― questions about what comes next ― suggest that the messy details of data center project finance should not be the sole purview of investors. After all, our exposure to the sector only grows more concentrated by the day. More precisely mapping out how capital flows through the sector should help financial policymakers and industrial policy thinkers understand the risks of a market correction. Political leaders should be prepared to tackle the downside distributional challenges raised by the instability of this data center boom ― challenges to consumer wealth, public budgets, and our energy system.

This sparkling sector is no replacement for industrial policy and macroeconomic investment conditions that create broad-based sources of demand growth and prosperity. But in their absence, policymakers can still treat the challenge of a market correction as an opportunity to think ahead about the nation’s industrial future.",https://heatmap.news/media-library/eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJpbWFnZSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vYXNzZXRzLnJibC5tcy82MjIzNzI0Ny9vcmlnaW4uanBnIiwiZXhwaXJlc19hdCI6MTc5NTAzNzAyMX0.cj-cAOXxehENh2ZdO950EccuUBBZbMqAcS-OlGbh81U/image.jpg?width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C100%2C0%2C100,N,,2025-11-28 09:01:40.450016

This program would have helped poor communities access solar energy.
Unlike solar and wind energy, methane is a climate changing gas itself, and when burned, produces carbon dioxide, another climate changing gas.
Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: Solar and wind.","Unlike our neighboring states of Michigan and Illinois, Ohio’s politicians have not embraced the economic and environmental benefits that solar and wind energy provide. Instead, Ohio’s politicians passed Senate Bill SB52, where communities can effectively block solar and wind projects; something that communities cannot do when it comes to fossil fuel development. Ohio’s energy bill HB15, which passed in May, was stripped of several pro-solar provisions, including a community solar program.

This program would have helped poor communities access solar energy. During the past nine months, the Trump administration has mounted a blatant attack on renewable energy by rolling back environmental laws and policies favoring renewables, canceling incentives enacted in the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act and halting projects even when in construction.

Just when you think you’ve heard it all, Ohio’s Republican politicians have, yet again, come up with another way to kill renewable energy projects, solar and wind and promote the non-renewable fossil fuel gas: Methane. HB 294 would grant clean energy status to methane gas.

This could mean gas projects might get preferential treatment over true renewable energy projects when it comes to permits granted by the Ohio Power Siting Board.

Unlike solar and wind energy, methane is a climate changing gas itself, and when burned, produces carbon dioxide, another climate changing gas. Sen. George Lang, one of the Republican co-sponsors, said in committee that natural gas is a cleaner energy source than coal.

That’s not saying much. Sen. Mark Romanchuk, a Richland County Republican and co-sponsor, remarked that building the infrastructure needed for solar and wind produced emissions, but he conveniently failed to mention the emissions created to construct a well pad and all the infrastructure needed to support the process, along with the resulting carbon dioxide emissions from combustion.

According to a report by the World Nuclear Association, comparison of life-cycle CO2 emissions from all energy sources shows that fracked gas produces the third highest amount of CO2, with 490 grams of CO2 per kW hour. Utility scale solar produces 48 grams, residential solar produces 41 and wind (offshore and land) are the lowest life-cycle emitters, at 11 grams per kW hr. The life-cycle emissions from fracked gas include those produced from the extraction process, which includes the gas (drilling), well pad and road construction, petrochemicals used to frack, compression and transportation of gas to LNG facilities and export transportation out of the country.

Additionally, the fracking process requires enormous amounts of water and produces millions of gallons of toxic radioactive brine. Harrison County saw 853 million gallons of surface water withdrawn for fracking in 2023. That represents 78 percent of the total water usage in the county. Wind and solar energy have a significantly lower carbon and water footprint. Calling fracked gas “clean” is laughable.

At the same time Ohio politicians are wanting to declare fracked gas clean, they are working on legislation (HB 170 and SB 136) to give the Ohio Department of Natural Resources primacy over carbon dioxide capture and sequestration Class VI wells. If passed, millions of tons of carbon emissions, including those from combusting that so-called clean methane gas, will be injected underneath Ohio land. Taxpayers will be paying the tax incentives of $85 per ton of industrial CO2 captured and stored, according to the One Big Beautiful Bill passed this summer.

Both HB 170 and SB 136 tramp on private property rights by allowing forced pooling, which means that land owners could be forced into allowing the injection of carbon dioxide, a dangerous asphyxiant, under their private property. Texas landowners are finding that sequestering CO2 in the pore space of geologic formations poses an interesting legal issue regarding pore space ownership. This issue is consequential because the plume from CO2 storage operations can travel miles from the injection site through the pore spaces.

The next assault on property owners may be the construction of pipelines to carry carbon dioxide across the state from industrial facilities to the injection wells; planned for Carroll, Jefferson, and Harrison counties. (see Herald-Star, Oct. 22.) Midwestern states have already seen significant pushbacks from land owners who are being forced to allow pipelines to cross their farms and communities through the use of eminent domain. Iowa residents have been fighting Summit Carbon Solutions’ pipeline for several years. In addition, Summit Carbon Solutions planned route through South Dakota to North Dakota has been blocked, as the company was banned from using eminent domain to take property. Will Ohio’s citizens be dealing with this legal battle as Ohio politicians invite the CCS industry into the state?

Recently, S. 2975, the federal Pipeline Safety Act of 2025, passed by voice vote. It is a bipartisan effort to reauthorize the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration’s safety programs until 2030. This law would set regulations for carbon dioxide pipelines. Environmental groups worry that the industry has had too much influence on these regs and point out the deficiencies that could lead to another accident like the one that occurred in 2020 in Satartia, Miss., where 45 people were overcome by CO2 leaking from a ruptured pipeline.

These concerns included: Lack of odorization of CO2 so releases are detectable by smell; performance-based leak detection and rupture mitigation; contaminant controls to help prevent CO2 related corrosion; and prevention of the conversion of oil or gas pipelines to CO2 pipelines.

Taxpayers will foot the bills for the environmental, economic and health costs from Ohio’s refusal to embrace the real clean, green renewable energy sources: Solar and wind. The U.S. Energy Association has said, “Wind and solar power are two of the fastest-growing energy sectors in the U.S. and produced as much as 17 percent of the country’s electricity last year.” Yet, Ohio politicians continue to push dirty fracked gas down our throats. They are either willfully ignorant or out of touch with reality.

“Electric transportation stakeholders were clear in our comments: not including electric vehicles as eligible for Volkswagen settlement funding amounted to government meddling in the free market,” Cross said.
“Only electric vehicles zero out tailpipe emissions.
The state plans to wrap up the fund by 2027.","After initially excluding them, the state now includes electric trucks in Florida’s plans for about $48 million specifically meant for projects to reduce harmful emissions. Public feedback prompted the Florida Department of Environmental Protection to revise its initial plans for how to spend the money.

RELATED: Millions of dollars for “cleaner technology” shouldn’t go to electric vehicles, says Florida proposal

The $48 million is from the state’s share of so-called Volkswagen funds, paid by the car company into a mitigation trust fund after allegedly violating the Clean Air Act by selling “trick” vehicles designed to cheat federal emissions tests. States received payouts from the mitigation fund based on how many “trick” vehicles were registered in each state, according to the EPA.

Florida’s total share was $166 million. So far, most of it has gone to electric bus projects. With the state’s remaining roughly $48 million, FDEP wants to help public and private fleet operators upgrade to lower-emission freight trucks.

But up until recently, FDEP’s plans didn’t include electric trucks in the list of lower-emission options eligible for the funds. Now, after FDEP received public feedback on the plans, electric trucks are on the list.

Stan Cross is director of electric transportation for the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy, one of several electrification stakeholder groups that urged FDEP to revise its plans. He said he’s happy to see EV eligibility preserved.

“Electric transportation stakeholders were clear in our comments: not including electric vehicles as eligible for Volkswagen settlement funding amounted to government meddling in the free market,” Cross said. “Now that EVs are eligible, public and private fleet operators can choose the alternative fuel technology that best suits their needs.”

Along with electric trucks, FDEP’s plans also list trucks powered by “new diesel,” compressed natural gas and propane as eligible, lower-emission upgrade options for fleets. Cross said EVs are the best option.

“Only electric vehicles zero out tailpipe emissions. All the other alternative fuels still pollute,” Cross said. “EVs are also the most affordable vehicles in the long term, because electricity is the cheapest transportation fuel and EVs have the lowest maintenance costs.

“So an EV might be the best tool for the job, and having EVs eligible for the funding empowers fleet operators to make that decision.”

Fleet operators of vehicles used in community service, disaster management and emergency response functions will get funding priority, according to FDEP.

RELATED: Florida makes millions available for lower-emission garbage trucks

To date, nearly 70% of Florida’s Volkswagen funds have gone to electric school bus and transit bus projects, and just under 8% to electric vehicle charging infrastructure (EVCI) projects. Neither category will be funded with the state’s remaining $48 million, according to FDEP’s finalized plans.

Some of the public comments submitted to FDEP urged the state to continue to use Volkswagen funds to support electric bus and EV-charging projects. But FDEP “determined that it is in the interest of the state, the public, and the intended beneficiaries of the Volkswagen Settlement” not to do so.

Projects previously funded in both categories — electric buses and EV charging infrastructure — proved to be more lengthy and expensive than initially anticipated, according to FDEP. There were “long lead times needed to purchase eligible electric buses that meet fleet operators’ needs.” And for EV charging sites, some projects weren’t finished until more than three years after the date of the grant award to complete.

As of October, there are more than 4,000 EV-charging stations in Florida, including 42 EVCI projects funded by money from the Volkswagen settlement.

“We would have liked to see funding still made available for charging infrastructure, but are happy to see that electric vehicle eligibility is preserved,” Cross said. “Getting vehicles on the road that are driving on affordable and clean electricity is important and should be a top priority for the state.”

Compared to other states in the Southeast, Florida ranks first for EV sales, according to SACE’s latest annual report.

In August, FDEP’s draft plans estimated the state had nearly $41 million of Volkswagen funds left to spend. Between the state’s remaining project funds and interest accrued on those funds, Florida’s actual remaining balance is more than $48 million, according to the state’s new, finalized plans.

Florida has been slower than many other states to spend its Volkswagen dollars, according to energy industry members. The state plans to wrap up the fund by 2027.",https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/d4c323a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2000x1050+0+142/resize/1200x630!/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fnpr-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Ff9%2F83%2F63ea9bf849988a1c4e9aa5c11b61%2F07172025-mobility-hub-wp-duerig-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:02:58.848374

Leroy Conish, 69, owns and operates a farm in Vacherie, downriver from St. Gabriel in St. James Parish.
The St. Gabriel city council voted unanimously against the proposed expansion in April 2017.
Marylee Orr, founder and executive director of LEAN, has worked with St. Gabriel residents to advocate for cleaner air since the 1980s.
In 2023, LEAN installed air quality monitors along the Mississippi River, but was unable to do so in St. Gabriel.","The city of St. Gabriel has zero major fast food chain restaurants, pharmacies or laundromats. But there are nearly a dozen chemical facilities within city limits and at least 30 within a 10 mile radius.

“We have bad smells here at night,” said Reginald Grace, 72, a retired counselor and lifelong resident. “Like a rotten egg, like chlorine.”

The air on a regular day in St. Gabriel is acrid — but many residents seem not to notice anymore. Grace has spent the last 10 years organizing residents against the growing chemical industry. The city is located in Louisiana’s infamous “Cancer Alley” — an 85-mile stretch of land between Baton Rouge and New Orleans home to over 200 industrial facilities along the Mississippi River, where the risk of cancer from industrial air pollution is the highest in the nation.

In the past few years, Grace said several of his neighbors have been diagnosed with or died of cancer. His wife of 41 years, Rhonda, had breast cancer, ovarian cancer and leukemia, which she died of in 2023, despite having no known family history of any of the three, Grace said. He added that he is in remission from prostate cancer.

St. Gabriel is home to the Syngenta agrochemical facility, which repackages a popular but highly toxic farming pesticide known as paraquat under the brand name Gramoxone before it is distributed to other states. The plant is owned by the Chinese company SinoChem Holdings Ltd.

A report released in October by Coming Clean, Alianza Nacional de Campesinas and Pesticide Action and Agroecology Network warned of the dangers of paraquat exposure. Banned in over 70 countries, it remains one of the most commonly used chemicals by farmers in the United States for weed management — with the largest point of entry in the last eight years being the Port of New Orleans, according to Jim Vallete, a contributing researcher to the report.

The U.S. Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warns that inhaling paraquat can cause lung damage. Some research shows that exposure to the chemical is associated with Parkinson’s disease, including a 2020 Louisiana State University study that concluded there was a greater risk of the disease in areas where pesticides, including paraquat, were used. There is currently litigation in Illinois federal court involving over 5,000 people suing Syngenta for alleged development of Parkinson’s from exposure to paraquat.

An Environmental Protection Agency memo from 2017 noted that the chemical is so toxic that “one sip can kill.” The same memo said even minimal contact can cause serious injury to the eyes and skin.

The paraquat report includes several statements from farm workers across the country who have allegedly suffered harmful health impacts from exposure to the pesticide. Paraquat has also been linked to cancer and childhood leukemia, the report finds. From production to distribution to application, the report concludes that factory workers, port workers and farm laborers are all at risk of unsafe exposure.

Syngenta declined Verite News’ request to comment on its factory’s health and environmental safety regulations as well as the use of paraquat in Louisiana farming. The facility’s parent company’s home country, China, banned the domestic use of paraquat in 2016.

Human Rights Watch reported last year that Cancer Alley residents commonly suffer from respiratory issues, including asthma, chronic coughs and sinus infections. Migraines, miscarriages and dementia are also common complaints among St. Gabriel residents, according to Grace.

He added that he and other local activists — many of whom said they appreciate the close-knit community, childhood memories and laidback feel of the town — are not asking for all of the plants to close down. They just want stricter monitoring of the impact on the environment.

“I’m not advocating cutting the plants out,” Grace said. “I know they’ve invested a lot of money into it, but what are you going to do, put money over safety?”

Ongoing debate on chemical safety

St. Gabriel incorporated as a city in 1994 partially to have more of a say against the growing chemical industry. The population decreased from a peak of 7,500 in 2020 but is once again growing as of 2022 according to data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Grace said the area has become popular with retirees from Baton Rouge looking for peace and quiet. Today, the population of roughly 6,800 must travel to the neighboring cities of Baton Rouge or Gonzales for jobs and many basic necessities such as medical care and fresh groceries.

“There’s nothing in this community. It’s a city, but there are no amenities,” Grace said. “People who grew up here, the children, don’t stay.”

Following the publication of the paraquat report last month, Verite News reporters visited St. Gabriel and the surrounding area to speak with residents about their ongoing efforts to minimize the harmful effects of living in an industrial hotspot.

Leroy Conish, 69, owns and operates a farm in Vacherie, downriver from St. Gabriel in St. James Parish. He’s aware that his farm is located in Cancer Alley and said he’s never used a product containing paraquat and aims to gradually eliminate the use of synthetic chemicals on his fields.

“We don’t really need to have the amount of chemicals that we use, because we can go back to farming the way our grandfathers and great-grandfathers used to farm,” Conish said.

Of the 10 acres Conish currently farms, roughly one acre contains no chemicals at all. Conish said once he learns how to make his model cost-effective, he wants to help bring about a farming revolution that helps low-income families in the area learn to sustain themselves in a healthy way.

Conish grows plenty of okra, which he said has antioxidants that he believes fight cancer — especially important “being in an environment that is filled with cancer emissions coming from every direction,” he said. Medical research has yet to conclusively prove that antioxidants do prevent cancer.

Many of Cancer Alley’s chemical plants are located in or near poor and mostly Black neighborhoods. As a Black farmer, Conish added that he believes chemical plants in the area take advantage of the region’s poverty. He wants to see greater regulation of the plants.

“Chronic poverty is a vestige of slavery,” he said. “Without chronic poverty, they wouldn’t have the opportunity to take advantage of poor people and promise them jobs, and I use the word ‘promise’ loosely.”

In a statement to Verite News, David Cresson, president and CEO of the Louisiana Chemical Association, called paraquat “a vital chemical to our farmers.”

“Farmers around the world have moved to adopt no-till farming, but this is only possible because herbicides like paraquat are used to control weeds while keeping soil undisturbed,” Cresson wrote. “It remains a widely utilized herbicide due to its fast-acting control of resistant weeds, compatibility with conservation tillage, and lack of residual soil activity.”

Herbicides are a type of pesticide that target weeds and unwanted vegetation.

Cresson added that U.S. regulatory agencies have reviewed scientific studies on the links between paraquat use and Parkinson’s disease and have not found a causal relationship. He did not address why 70 countries have banned the pesticide for health and safety reasons.

Navigating a shared space

Jan Drinkwater, 77, moved to East Iberville, just outside of St. Gabriel, more than 40 years ago. A breast cancer survivor, she said she was not informed of the air pollution in the area beforehand and wishes the agrochemical industry was better regulated.

“We have terrible odors from time to time,” she said. “This is current and frequent. … Why can’t they put that on the news?”

Drinkwater said as a resident, she should be made aware of what she is breathing. She added that despite the health risks, she still enjoys many enrichment activities at the St. Gabriel senior center and does not mind the lack of businesses in the city.

“I didn’t really move here for restaurants,” she said. “I wish it could remain rural … I would never want to go anywhere else.”

Melvin Craige, 75, has known Grace since childhood. Previously the director of St. Gabriel’s community center, Craige said he’s seen how the chemical industry contributes to the community by making investments such as refurbishing the community center’s weight room.

“When I was a director, they did all of the equipment and everything in the community center. They did a heck of a lot of programming,” he said.

YOU MAKE OUR WORK POSSIBLE.

But Craige said he is also aware of scientific research pointing to links between the industry and medical problems facing residents.

“We just buried one of my cousins here Saturday who died of cancer,” he said.

Craige said he would like to see the community and the industry cooperate even more to monitor emissions to ensure better health conditions for the people of St. Gabriel.

One forum that the community and the industrial sector use to communicate on employment opportunities, safety and environmental concerns and industry expansion is the local community advisory panel. The East Iberville Community Advisory Panel has existed since at least the 1990s, and it currently meets every other month on Syngenta property, according to advisory panel members who spoke with Verite News.

Alex Robertson, 56, who has lived in St. Gabriel since his childhood, has been attending the panel’s meetings for about a year.

“We always sit back and complain, and we say what somebody is not doing, but the question is, ‘What are you doing?’” Robertson asked.

Robertson said he worked at the Koura plant in St. Gabriel for 30 years. Now retired, he remains a youth pastor at the Iberville Christian Center. He said his professional success is a testament to the industry providing well-paying jobs. He also said chemicals produced in the city contribute to everyday products Americans use to make their lives better.

But a recent Tulane University study showed Black Louisiana residents live in areas most affected by industrial pollution, yet make up the smallest portion of the industry’s workforce. Iberville Parish, where St. Gabriel is located, was shown to be home to the third largest share of the highest-paying manufacturing jobs in the state — but people of color were underrepresented among these positions.

Robertson joins the advisory panel’s meetings as a volunteer and liaises with the St. Gabriel City Council at public meetings on matters pertaining to the industry. He said he believes in the importance of the industry being a “good steward” to the community, by providing more high-paying jobs to local residents and offering educational opportunities — such as having plant engineers tutor kids at the local schools.

Good stewards should also not pollute the city, he said, and if they do, they should be upfront about it with the community.

‘The fight is not over with’

In addition to helping lead Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel, a local advocacy group, Grace sits on the board of the Louisiana Environmental Action Network (LEAN), an environmental not-for-profit.

Grace said one of his biggest wins against the chemical industry was in 2017, when he and Citizens for a Better St. Gabriel members successfully fought against Adsorbent Solutions, a local carbon reactivation plant that had sought to expand its operations.

“We told the council, if y’all do this, you’re killing your own people,” Grace said.

The St. Gabriel city council voted unanimously against the proposed expansion in April 2017. Adsorbent Solutions closed down its facility shortly after the vote.

Marylee Orr, founder and executive director of LEAN, has worked with St. Gabriel residents to advocate for cleaner air since the 1980s. In 2023, LEAN installed air quality monitors along the Mississippi River, but was unable to do so in St. Gabriel.

“We tried, we waited, we went through all the right authorities,” she said. “But the experience with St. Gabriel was that the public entities did not want the stationary monitor on their property.”

Orr said LEAN plans to expand the air monitoring project and has not given up on installing sensors in St. Gabriel.

Lionel Johnson has been St. Gabriel’s mayor since 2011. Despite multiple requests, he did not schedule an interview to talk about public health, the economy and the proliferation of chemical facilities.

“He’s a coward,” Grace said. “He doesn’t mix well with people, but he’s highly educated, and he talks at people instead of talking to them.”

Grace’s son Kyle ran against Johnson in the last mayoral election in 2023, losing by only a slim margin. Kyle Grace’s platform centered on bringing more businesses to St. Gabriel, while Johnson focused on expanding city services.

Reginald Grace said he finds that much of the city has become “complacent” to the harmful health effects of the chemical industry.

“A lot of people are not educated to the fact that they can demand more,” he said. “They’re just trying to live from day to day.”

Grace said despite the health risks, he has remained in St. Gabriel all these years because of his family’s ties to the area and the difficulties of starting over somewhere new.

“I hope I live a few more good years,” he said. “Whatever damage has been done, it’s been done.”

Although the chemical industry has only grown in St. Gabriel, Grace said he urges the younger generation not to pack up and leave or cease their advocacy efforts.

“We’re trying to help the young people understand they have to get involved, they have to be educated and they have to work toward self-improvement,” he said. “The fight is not over with.”",https://lailluminator.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/DSC_7250-copy-2048x1367-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 09:03:03.911577

Now, the precious metal that South Africa hosts in greater abundance than any other country on earth could also find that its remarkable catalytic qualities are utilised by battery electric vehicles (BEVs) as well.

This is because platinum group metals (PGMs) have been found by Florida International University to be able to extend the life of lithium-sulphur batteries for the betterment of not only sustainable mobility but also for renewable-energy storage, and to have potential to be a significant efficiency and sustainability boost for electricity grids as well.

New York- and Toronto-listed Platinum Group Metals Limited reiterates this in its latest 2025 annual results, in which the Canada-based company makes clear that it is continuing to advance the use of PGMs in lithium battery technologies by way of Lion Battery Technologies, which is highlighting the benefits that PGMs can bring to the lithium battery space.

Interestingly, Platinum Group Metals Limited spelt out in a media release to Mining Weekly that it is also continuing to take the Waterberg project on the northern limb of South Africa’s PGM-rich Bushveld Complex in Limpopo province towards a development and construction decision.

While this is underway, the company, headed by CEO Frank Hallam, is continuing to collaborate with an affiliate of South Africa’s Johannesburg Stock Exchange-listed Valterra Platinum and Florida International University to take PGMs to the next level. Valterra, it should be noted, is the company that last week chauffeured B20 and G20 delegates around Johannesburg in Toyota Mirai cars, which are FCEVs.

Valterra led a mine-to-market FCEV display, which involved South Africa's Sasol providing the hydrogen, Air Products dispensing the hydrogen, Bambili Energy providing the South Africa-manufactured membrane electrode assemblies for the fuel cells, and Bosch, providing the fuel cells.

On top of this, it is envisaged that the use of PGMs in BEVs will be achieved by allowing the catalytic contribution of PGMs to extend the life of lithium-sulphur batteries significantly, through the addition of nanoparticles of platinum to the sulphur side of the battery so that the tiny particles can work at molecular scale to ensure a cleaner, greener and healthier tomorrow.

This comes against the background of diversified demand for PGMs having already extended well beyond the automotive, jewellery, investment, and hydrogen sectors into the fibreglass, semiconductor, health and even food preservation sectors in what many see as “only the beginning”.

Interestingly, research and development by Florida International University is repeatedly pointing to the lighter weight and higher energy density of lithium-sulphur batteries as important competitive advantages engendered by PGMs.

“The unique properties of PGMs as powerful catalysts are being applied to various technologies as possible solutions for more efficient energy generation and storage, which may create new demand for PGMs.

“The company's battery technology initiative through Lion with partner Valterra represents one such new opportunity in the high-profile lithium battery research and innovation field,” Platinum Group Metals Limited stated, while also pointing out that the investment is creating a vertical integration with a broader industrial market development strategy to bring new PGM-using technologies to market.

Lion’s reiterated target is to develop batteries with specific energies that are 20% to 100% higher than current technologies while meeting or exceeding their present cycle lives though the unlocking of chemistries for use in BEVs.

As reported by Mining Weekly, Lion has engaged the Battery Innovation Center in Newberry, Indiana, to help accelerate commercialisation efforts for its next-generation PGM-enhanced battery chemistries.

The Battery Innovation Center’s scope of work is to conduct independent small- and large-scale trials to validate Lion’s proprietary PGM-based electrode composition, slurry, and films in lithium sulphur cells.

There is little doubt that PGMs will provide BEVs with additional kilowatt hours per kilogram. Catalysts based on PGM nanoparticles offer a potentially rapid solution to many of the current battery problems and have been shown to improve the performance of the batteries.

WATERBERG PROJECT

The Waterberg project is being planned as a mechanised, shallow, decline access palladium, platinum, gold and rhodium, or four-element, mine. Platinum Group Metals Limited is the operator of the project, as directed by a technical committee also including representatives from joint venture partners Implats, Mnombo, and HJ Platinum Metals. The Japan Organisation for Metals and Energy Security has established the special purpose company, HJ Platinum Metals, to hold and fund their future equity interests in the Waterberg project.

Being assessed are commercial alternatives for mine development financing and concentrate offtake.

As a part of the investigation of smelting and base metal refining options, discussions with all South African integrated producers, including Implats, are taking place, with a view to negotiating formal concentrate offtake arrangements.

To date no terms have been agreed and as an alternative, the possible establishment of smelting and base metal refining facilities in either Saudi Arabia or South Africa is still being studied.

“Before any processing of materials in Saudi Arabia could occur, South African government authorisation for the export of concentrate or matte would be required,” the company restated in the latest report.

In September, the board approved a sixth stage of work in the amount of R92.1-million for fiscal year 2026 to allow for the continuation of work programmes underway.

The interim budget, which covers the period to the end of August next year, includes components of a $21-million pre-construction work programme approved in principle for the Waterberg project.

During the fiscal year to August 31, a net loss of $4.54-million was incurred. General and administrative expenses during the period were $3.66-million. Share based compensation was $1.19-million. The foreign exchange gain recognised in the current period was $95 000, well up on last year’s $4 000 owing mainly to the US dollar increasing in value over the Canadian dollar during the financial year.",https://cdn.creamermedia.com/assets/articles/images/resized/0001241809_resized_platinummesh21022.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 08:03:11.443272

While she is not necessarily in the same age group as many other beekeepers in North Carolina, Walker has still formed various connections.","Story by Rebecca Savidge

On a warm day in the spring, when you look at a bright flower and see a bee dancing around on the inside of the plant, that creature is likely just making a stop on a long journey before it returns to its home — its hive. But odds are, that hive might not be the structure in a tree you are thinking of. It very well might just be the result of someone’s hard work right in their backyard.

Apiculture — the technical term for beekeeping — is a major industry across the state of North Carolina. Many counties — over 80 out of the 100 in North Carolina — and the state as a whole, have their own beekeeping associations.

The North Carolina State Beekeeping Association has over 4,000 active members across the state, making it the largest organized association for beekeepers in the country. And North Carolina, in general, has somewhere close to 15,000 beekeepers — whether it be a person growing a new hobby, an individual understanding the science behind the craft or someone attempting to make a living out of the process — according to North Carolina State University.

Because of the multitude of motivations behind beekeeping, NCSU even has an extensive apiculture program to further the understanding of honey bee biology and to improve bee management.

Jennifer Keller, research specialist and apiculture technician at NCSU, said there are still a lot of mysteries surrounding beekeeping — like why some colonies excel in their lifespan more than others — that scientists are still trying to understand in their research. However, Keller and her colleagues see the clear necessity of honey bees in our world.

“Honey bees, as well as other native bees, are very important for pollinating to produce good crops, and even some of the crops that are not dependent on bees will have an added benefit from the pollination of bees,” she said. “If there are no honey bees around, they may still produce a crop, but with honey bees, they’ll produce more of that same crop, so that’s better for farmers. Without bees, things wouldn’t be as good — there’s some crops that are dependent on bees that just would not be able to happen as much.”

The importance of honey bees, as well as the niche interest of the craft, is part of why thousands of individuals across the state participate in beekeeping, whether as a hobby or a commercial business.

Beekeeping as a hobby

Lisa Vogel has always had a piece of bees in her life.

When she was a child growing up in the mountains of North Carolina, she remembers her dad — a self-proclaimed honey aficionado — bringing in different kinds of honey for her to try, from sour wood to whipped, all the result of a bee’s hard work.

Then, 10 years ago, out of pure curiosity, she visited the home of a friend who was a beekeeper to see her process.

“I was hooked immediately,” Vogel said. “It was like, I feel like I did this in another life or something. I mean, it was crazy. You know, when you find a hobby that you just instantly love? It was that feeling.”

Now, a decade later, Vogel cares for nine hives on the property of her home in Orange County, North Carolina. And whether she is harvesting the honey-filled frames from her hives or protecting her bees from the common risk of varroa mites, she has several tricks she has learned over the years.

Bee risk and tricks

Though a beekeeper should not constantly interfere with their hive, when the bees are at risk, the keeper might have to step in. One of the main risks facing bees right now is the presence of varroa mites, an external parasitic mite that attacks and feeds on honey bees.

While each beekeeper has a different method to protect their hive from this parasite, Vogel said that she checks for the issue once every five weeks during the warm months — which is often one of her only reasons for going into the hive at all.

After doing an inspection, if she finds a significant number of mites, Vogel will treat her hive with a mite medication or an alcohol wash. She said she learned this trick from a North Carolina beekeeper and apiary inspector, Lewis Cauble.

In addition to keeping her hive safe, Vogel has a trick for ensuring the queen bee is alive by looking for eggs on frames. Because while the whole hive is important, the queen has her title for a reason.

“If the queen dies, then the hive dies, possibly — especially if they don’t have any eggs to raise a new queen,” Vogel said. “If they don’t have a queen, they don’t have eggs, and they’re doomed.”

And if that were to occur, one would have to purchase a new queen from a beekeeping shop — like Bailey Bee Supply in Hillsborough — to maintain the integrity of a hive and reduce the risk of losing more bees. Thus, the maintenance of a hive is critical. Having the knowledge to do so is, too, which is why Justin Maness created his Durham-based company, Buddha Bee Apiary.

Maness’s business is built around the idea of him and his employees, like Claudia Roller, managing beehives in clients’ yards and educating individuals on proper practices.

“We just focus on the education and the experience of people getting the opportunity to come out and be in hives with us and see what it’s all about,” Roller said.

Roller studied chemistry at Goucher College in Maryland, and when she first started working for Maness, she had never even seen a hive in her life. But she was intrigued by the scientific aspect of apiculture, and over the past several years, she has become a beekeeper herself, inspecting hives and making sure the pollinators are cared for. She is now even interested in going to school to get a master’s degree in apiculture from somewhere like NCSU to further her knowledge and the research of beekeeping.

Buddha Bee does not sell any honey from their business, but rather focuses on that education aspect and growing the beekeeping industry, as a whole.

“We only harvest honey if the hive is able to handle us taking some,” Roller said. “And then we give it right back to the people who are hosting a hive. So if you have a hive in your backyard, you’re getting your honey right from your backyard.”

Honey production

But while Buddha Bee does not profit from its production, the sticky, sweet golden substance is a major aspect of beekeeping, and keepers like Vogel do share their hive’s product.

“I sell it at different places around Orange County,” she said. “This year I’ll be selling it mostly to friends, and I do a Holiday Market where I sell it as well.”

However, this venture is not about making money for Vogel; in fact, she said she does not make much of a profit at all, especially since she does not extract her own honey — which is a different process entirely.

Extraction is the process of separating honey from beeswax combs to harvest it for use. When Vogel needs this done, she takes her frames to an extractor in Mebane, North Carolina, before she bottles the product.

Vogel said she does not do extraction, not only because she does not have the equipment for it, but because, with her age, the process is too heavy a task for her. For Phil Crump, though, extraction is just another step in his beekeeping process as a whole.

Bees and the economy

Crump has been beekeeping for almost 50 years and, according to Vogel, is a salesman extraordinaire. He primarily sells honey at events through Plant Delights Nursery, a small business in Wake County, North Carolina, and begins the honey process from step one.

From suiting up in protective covering to having hands-on time with the buzzing creatures to harvesting the golden frames, Crump does it all. Then, when he finally reaches the extraction element, Crump has a honed-down method.

“You’re going to take your knife, and it saws, kind of, and you can see how I’m just taking those cappings off,” Crump said as he started the process. “And then I’m just going to go down, and I like to not damage the comb any more than necessary. Some people just get in there and they’ll start digging it. There’s another method that you can use that uses a hot knife and it melts the wax off. But I just think this is the least destructive method, and that’s what I like to do, is not to damage this any more than necessary, so that the bees can repair it or utilize it.”

The harvesting and extraction process allows Crump to produce a profit from selling products at events.

He said that he typically sells a bottle of honey for around $30, and while that might seem like a steep price, with the effort and time that has been put in, at the end of the day, that outcome makes sense and people will buy it.

“I can market my honey in a location where people are already coming to spend money,” Crump said. “They’re already anticipating buying something. This is a nursery that sells rare and unusual plants, so they’re not inexpensive plants. They’re not going to Lowe’s [Hardware]. So that’s a unique component. I can’t make money at the farmer’s market because people from Eastern North Carolina come and they’re selling their honey so cheap I can’t even compete.”

Crump said that the honey production business is hard, but what makes it harder is when these individuals sell their honey for a lower price than what other keepers see fit. This practice hurts people like Crump who try to support themselves through their sales. This way of selling and overharvesting can also create poor beekeeping practices.

Overharvesting occurs when beekeepers remove too much honey from a hive. This leads to colony collapse by depleting a hive’s food stores, forcing beekeepers to rely on supplemental feeding, which can add stress and is not a sustainable practice for the colony’s long-term health — which though is not especially common, it is something Crump tries to avoid entirely.

The community

But Crump said that beyond just the honey harvesting and business of beekeeping, the people make it what it is.

“My interest is honey production, but I’d say at least half of what interests me about beekeeping is the fellowship,” he said. “[I] really enjoy the people. It’s a great group of people. They’re real.”

Vogel said that many of the practices she has learned have been through personal research or from the greater beekeeping community, in general. It is this community that truly defines beekeeping in North Carolina.

And it is that community that has also grown Eva Walker’s interest in the craft, despite being a standout among her peers.

Walker is a senior at Durham Academy Upper School and has been a beekeeper for almost four years. She has a hive at her home in Durham that she maintains with her father, as well as one that she set up at her high school that she uses to help educate other students about beekeeping.

While she is not necessarily in the same age group as many other beekeepers in North Carolina, Walker has still formed various connections. She said that the community is so tight-knit across the state that everyone seems to know each other or is able to bond over this niche hobby.

“Being young, I’m sort of at an advantage, because people want to hear [about it],” she said. “There’s questions of like, ‘Wow, you’re so young, how’d you get into this?’”

So while the motivation behind beekeeping varies for each person — whether for education, a fun hobby, a profession or anything else — the root of the enjoyment of the craft lies in the community and the opportunity to protect, preserve and promote the lives of the creatures that keep nature so bright.

Stories from the UNC Media Hub are written by senior students from various concentrations in the Hussman School of Journalism and Media working together to find, produce and market unique stories — all designed to capture multiple angles and perspectives from across North Carolina.

The Oct. 22 Post and Courier article, ""Proposed SC Gas Plant's Pollution Could Affect 2 Million People,"" which referenced a Southern Environmental Law Center study produced by Harvard University researchers, was timed perfectly just before Halloween.

Like costumed characters at a haunted house, the study aimed to instill fear in South Carolinians. It was also an admonishment to any of us South Carolinians who have chosen to use natural gas or propane in our homes, stood around a burn barrel or a fireplace, grilled out, barbecued a hog, lit a brush pile, or cranked a tractor, truck or car.

Ironically, the Massachusetts-based researchers at Harvard have the third-highest electricity prices in the nation according to Choose Energy. Only California and Hawaii customers pay more. The same report said South Carolina has the country’s 18th-lowest electricity prices. South Carolina leadership balances affordability, economic development and environmental responsibility to protect the best interests of our customers and the energy future of our state.

A major indication of this leadership is the recent passage of the S.C. Energy Security Act. While it does authorize Santee Cooper to evaluate a jointly owned natural gas generation facility with Dominion Energy at Canadys Station – Dominion Energy’s former coal-fired generation site in Colleton County – the law’s overall intent is to advance an all-of-the-above energy strategy to benefit South Carolina.

For decades, environmentalists in South Carolina urged Dominion Energy to convert the coal-fired boilers at Canadys to natural gas. We are proposing a much more efficient and cleaner solution. With state-of-the-art environmental protections, the air-cooled, closed-cycle facility will be one of the most efficient generating plants in the Southeast. In fact, it will reduce water use by over 90% compared to traditional cooling systems. And, it will offer the best pairing for additional solar.

Although our combined solar capacity is greater than any single generating unit on either of our systems, non-dispatchable solar power is limited by variability in weather, particularly cloud cover and the natural progression of day into night. The following chart shows solar at its best and worst on two days here in South Carolina. Solar is unavailable as sunset approaches until after sunrise. Even if you doubled or tripled the amount of solar capacity, that would still be the case.

So why are we proposing to build a natural gas generating plant at Canadys?

Canadys provides the most efficient, dispatchable, flexible energy source to meet the future energy needs of South Carolina. As such, it will pair optimally with the sporadic, intermittent availability of solar energy and will accommodate the continued growth and development of non-dispatchable renewables.

Canadys has an established footprint. As a remediated site of a former coal generation plant, Canadys eliminates the need to acquire and clear large swaths of new land. It is also strategically positioned at the energy intersection of the Lowcountry of South Carolina, located in the immediate vicinity of well-established transmission corridors for Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy.

Canadys will support well-paying jobs in Colleton County and surrounding communities, help attract new industry and contribute to a substantial increase in needed property taxes for the benefit of citizens, students and infrastructure.

Additionally, pipeline provider Kinder Morgan, Santee Cooper, and Dominion Energy will work with the ACE Basin Task Force to create a wildlife corridor for participating landowners. This will complement the 420-acre Canadys environmental mitigation area adjacent to the Edisto River that has already been returned to its indigenous state with flora and fauna.

These facts alone clearly justify the Canadys project. However, the greatest source of energy for Santee Cooper and Dominion Energy emanates from our combined family of approximately 4,000 dedicated employees who live throughout South Carolina, including in the Lowcountry. We are your neighbors who are committed to providing the true power to collectively serve our beloved Palmetto State.","https://www.blufftontoday.com/gcdn/authoring/authoring-images/2025/11/22/NAUG/87420028007-keller-kissam-headshot.jpg?crop=2328,1310,x0,y116&width=2328&height=1310&format=pjpg&auto=webp",N,,2025-11-28 08:02:48.270603

The solar EV charging market can be segmented based on charger type (Level 1, Level 2, DC fast charging), application (residential, commercial, public charging), and system type (on-grid, off-grid, and hybrid). Among these, the commercial segment is witnessing robust growth due to rising installations in workplaces, parking facilities, and retail spaces. Hybrid solar EV charging systems are also gaining traction owing to their reliability and ability to operate even during low solar generation periods.

On the basis of charging level, the Level 2 segment accounted for the largest revenue share and is projected to register the highest CAGR of 8.1% from 2022 to 2031. Level 2 chargers are widely used in residential settings and are preferred for their ability to recharge EV batteries quickly. Their simplicity, cost-effectiveness, and compatibility with solar-powered setups make them a popular choice in the solar EV charging market.

Based on system type, the off-grid segment dominated the market in terms of revenue and is expected to expand at a CAGR of 8.3% from 2022 to 2031. Off-grid solar EV charging systems help reduce dependence on the grid, eliminate power outage issues, lower electricity costs, and offer easy installation. These advantages drive their adoption in highway charging projects, city-based charging units, and rural areas where they serve as a reliable alternative power source.

By application, the private EV charger segment held the leading revenue share and is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 8.0% from 2022 to 2031. The longer charging duration of EVs fuels demand for solar-powered private chargers in the residential segment, where vehicles are typically charged overnight. Solar private EV chargers reduce household electricity expenses, further driving their adoption.

Phillip Stafford has been converted. After two years of driving a Tesla, he says there’s no going back to gasoline — the money he saves on fuel alone makes that clear. And since his work as a crisis counselor takes him all over Richmond, Virginia, he charges often.

That’s made him picky about where he buys electrons. On a crisp fall afternoon last month, Stafford had his Model 3 plugged in at a Sheetz. A red-and-white Wawa sandwich wrapper on the seat hinted at where his heart lies in that convenience-store rivalry. Still, brand loyalty goes only so far when the battery is running low. Given a choice between the two, Sheetz wins. ​“It has more watts, so it charges a little faster,” he said.

The seemingly small question of where to spend 20 or so minutes topping off a battery reveals the transformation taking hold among fuel retailers. For more than 50 years, chains like Wawa, Sheetz, and Love’s Travel Stops have defined when and where people refuel. As EVs reshape mobility, these retailers are among those embracing charging.

Their challenge goes beyond providing power to turning the time that drivers spend plugged in into profitable foot traffic. Selling electricity alone won’t pay the bills; the real money lies in selling snacks. Making that work requires reimagining what a pit stop looks and feels like, even as costly infrastructure upgrades and shifting federal policies complicate the transition.

Wawa and Sheetz are two of the furthest along. The Pennsylvania-based companies have built out hundreds of chargers and enjoy fervent fanbases that make them two of the most popular convenience stores in the country. Their made-to-order sandwiches, vast array of snacks, and clean restrooms have made them regular stops for road trippers and commuters alike — and now, for EV drivers looking to recharge their cars and, often, themselves.

They offer a glimpse of the road ahead. As electric vehicles move ever further from niche toward norm, the focus for retailers like these could shift from which one offers the cheapest fuel to which one can make waiting for the car to fill up the best experience.

“The problem with a lot of current gas stations is [they’re] not that nice of a place to spend 15, 20, or 30 minutes,” said Scott Hardman of the Institute of Transportation Studies at the University of California, Davis. ​“Hopefully in the future, we’ll see more of them turn into coffee shops, cafes — places you actually want to be.”

That future is slowly coming into focus. Retailers like Wawa and Sheetz have spent the past few years exploring what the transition from selling gasoline to selling electricity might look like. Even with the headwinds EVs face, at least 26 percent of cars on U.S. roads could be electric by 2035, and some projections suggest they could account for 65 percent of all sales by 2050.

The two chains offer a place to plug in at over 10 percent of their locations. Wawa has installed more than 210 chargers, while Sheetz provides more than 650 at 95 locations that have logged at least 2 million sessions. Clean amenities and expansive menus with offerings like Wawa’s turkey-stuffed Gobbler and Sheetz’s deep-fried Big Mozz have placed them near the top of convenience store satisfaction rankings.

Both say embracing cars with cords builds on what already attracts customers. Wawa frames it as an extension of its ​“one-stop” model for food and fuel. Its competitor calls charging ​“a seamless extension of the Sheetz experience.” The language differs, but the message is the same: Selling electricity works if it brings people like John Baiano inside.

The New York resident owns two Tesla Model Ys and travels throughout the northeast for his two businesses — a Bitcoin consultancy and a horse racing operation. He plugs in at Wawa because the stores are clean, offer plenty of amenities, and provide a comfortable place to check in with clients. ​“I use the bathroom, maybe get a snack,” he said. (He prefers the turkey pinwheel.) ​“I was a little nervous about the charging aspect of things. Once I started experiencing this, it was seamless.”

At the moment, most public quick chargers are tucked away in the far corners of shopping centers, inside parking garages, and other functional but hardly inviting places to spend 20 minutes. They’re fine when you’re out and about running errands, but not terribly appealing at night and not particularly conducive to a road trip.

Tesla dominates the space with its Supercharger network, which provides over half the country’s quick chargers, with Electrify America, EVgo, and ChargePoint together accounting for another 25 to 30 percent. Retailers like Love’s Travel Stops, Pilot Flying J, and Buc-ee’s are joining Sheetz and Wawa in working with those networks and others to add chargers alongside gas pumps. Their efforts signal how a system built for gasoline is starting to evolve for electricity.

Everything Stafford and Baiano like about plugging in at a convenience store reflects an Electric Vehicle Council study that ranked security, lighting, and 24/7 access as the three things drivers want most in a charging station. Another survey found that 80 percent of them will go out of their way to get it. Reliability is another concern — and a frequent complaint with the nation’s current charging infrastructure. As EVs become more common, drivers are going to be less willing to put up with malfunctioning or broken chargers than the early adopters were.

Ryan McKinnon of the Charge Ahead Partnership, which pushes for a comprehensive charging network, sees fuel retailers as a logical place to build out such a system because they already have the right locations and amenities. ​“What EV charging needs is a competitive and lucrative marketplace where folks can actually make money selling EV charging,” he said.

Therein lies the challenge. Buying and installing a quick charger can cost more than $100,000. Beyond that lie fluctuating prices from utility companies, which one leading charging provider said is a key factor in deciding where to locate the devices. Retailers won’t recover that by selling electrons alone, given that the machines might generate just $10,000 in revenue each year, Hardman said. EVgo noted in its second-quarter earnings report that it earned just under $12,000 per stall.

Making this work for retailers requires getting people out of their cars and into the stores. Just as gas retailers earn two-thirds of their profit selling sandwiches, snacks, and sodas, those selling electricity can expect to do the same. Researchers at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology found that installing an EV charger increased spending by 1 percent, which would cover 11 percent of the cost of installing the charger. (Other studies have found similar benefits for surrounding businesses; Tesla Superchargers can boost revenue by 4 percent.)

For some retailers, chargers are a loss leader meant to pull customers into stores, said Karl Doenges of the National Association of Convenience Stores. Others see them as a way to secure increasingly scarce electrical capacity while it’s available. Some are moving ​“forward on a charging station, even though they don’t think [the market is] 100 percent ready,” he said.

Even the strongest business cases for installing the devices depended on Washington’s help to pencil out. Incentives that the Biden administration created through the Inflation Reduction Act and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law provided billions in grants, tax credits, and matching funds to help expand the fueling infrastructure of tomorrow, particularly in rural and low-income communities that a free market might overlook.

When Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, there was little doubt federal support for this ambitious effort would change. Yet the upheaval was more dramatic than expected. In February, the Trump administration paused the $5 billion National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure, or NEVI, program, the backbone of Washington’s effort to build a nationwide charging network. Fuel retailers, which have been some of the effort’s biggest beneficiaries, expressed concern.

The administration reluctantly reinstated NEVI, which had installed just 126 charging ports by the time Trump won his second term, in August. ​“If Congress is requiring the federal government to support charging stations, let’s cut the waste and do it right,” Transportation Secretary Sean Duffy said at the time. But with most of the funding allocated, the program will likely expire in 2026.

When it revived NEVI, the Trump administration updated recommendations for states, which administer the funds, in a way that seems to favor a national network run by big chains with highway operations. The Federal Highway Administration’s guidance explicitly recommended building charging infrastructure near fuel retailers.

Nonetheless, at least some of those companies see this as a difficult moment for EV charging.

The Global Static Var Compensator and STATCOM Market size is expected to be worth around USD 5.0 Billion by 2034, from USD 2.0 Billion in 2024, growing at a CAGR of 9.6% during the forecast period from 2025 to 2034. In 2024, North America held a dominan market position, capturing more than a 32.5% share, holding USD 3.2 Billion revenue.

Static Var Compensators (SVCs) and STATCOMs sit at the core of modern grid-stability strategies. SVCs are thyristor-based systems that inject or absorb reactive power on high-voltage AC networks to hold voltage within tight limits over long transmission lines. STATCOMs are the next generation: voltage-source-converter FACTS devices that provide very fast reactive current support and voltage regulation at the connection point.Together, they form a critical flexibility layer as grids become more dynamic and decentralized.

The industrial backdrop is a rapid build-out of transmission and distribution infrastructure. REN21 estimates global investment in power-grid infrastructure rose 5.3% in 2023 to about USD 310 billion, with the United States investing USD 86.5 billion and China USD 78.9 billion. An IEA grid study notes that dedicated transmission spending alone reached roughly USD 140 billion in 2023, within total energy investment of USD 2.8 trillion, of which USD 1.7 trillion went to clean energy.These figures signal sustained demand for high-performance reactive-power solutions in both new and upgraded lines.

The main structural driver for SVC and STATCOM adoption is the surge in variable renewables. IRENA reports global renewable power capacity reached about 4,448 GW in 2024, after a record annual addition of 585 GW. A separate analysis finds that clean energy met just over 40% of global electricity demand in 2024, with solar near 7%, wind above 8% and hydro around 14% of generation.

Policy commitments further underpin the opportunity. The IEA projects that by 2028 renewables will account for around 42% of global electricity generation, with wind and solar alone providing 25%. IRENA’s 1.5 °C roadmap suggests that annual renewable capacity additions would need to average roughly 1,066 GW per year from 2023–2050. Delivering and integrating this volume safely requires advanced voltage-control and congestion-management technologies, giving SVC and STATCOM suppliers a long growth runway in both mature and emerging grids.

National grid-investment programmes are already translating this need into concrete projects. In China, State Grid Corporation announced transmission investments of about USD 77 billion for 2023, and plans roughly USD 329 billion over the 2021–2025 14th Five-Year Plan; China Southern Power Grid adds around USD 99 billion, bringing total planned grid spending close to USD 442 billion. Such programmes typically bundle FACTS, SVC and STATCOM installations with new ultra-high-voltage corridors and regional interconnectors. Similar though smaller-scale incentives appear in US and EU grid-modernisation and resilience schemes.

By Type Analysis

Static Var Compensators (SVC) dominate with 59.8% share driven by strong grid stability needs

In 2024, Static Var Compensators (SVC) held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 59.8% share. The strong uptake of SVC systems was supported by their widespread use in high-voltage transmission networks, where voltage stability and reactive power control continued to be critical.

The demand for SVC solutions was further strengthened by ongoing grid modernization programs across developing and developed regions, as utilities prioritized technologies capable of improving power quality and minimizing transmission losses. In 2025, the adoption of SVC systems is expected to remain steady as grid reinforcement projects expand and as power utilities focus on improving system reliability in response to rising electricity demand from industrial and renewable energy sources.

By End-User Analysis

Power utilities lead with 53.4% as they prioritized grid reliability and large-scale reactive power management.

In 2024, Power Utilities held a dominant market position, capturing more than a 53.4% share. This dominance was driven by continued investments in transmission and distribution networks where large-scale reactive power compensation was required to maintain voltage stability and reduce losses. Utility projects were favored because SVC and STATCOM installations were viewed as effective solutions for integrating renewable generation, managing peak loads, and improving overall system resilience.

Procurement was often influenced by long-term grid reinforcement plans and regulatory incentives that prioritized reliability and power quality. In 2025, utility demand was expected to remain substantial as network upgrade programs progressed and as the need to accommodate variable renewable output continued to shape investment decisions.

Emerging Trends

Hybrid STATCOM–storage hubs and digital grids reshape VAR compensation

A clear latest trend for Static Var Compensators and STATCOMs is their shift from stand-alone voltage-control devices to part of hybrid “flexibility hubs” that combine power electronics, battery storage and digital control. Grid planners are no longer buying only reactive-power support; they are designing multi-service nodes that can manage voltage, congestion and short-term balancing in one place, especially around big renewable clusters and urban load pockets.

This change is closely tied to the boom in grid-scale batteries. REN21 reports that global battery storage capacity grew by 120% in 2023 to reach about 55.7 GW, with batteries accounting for 83% of all new utility-scale storage additions and pumped hydro still holding 179 GW of installed capacity. Source: REN21 – Renewables 2024 Global Status Report, Energy Storage module. As developers co-locate batteries with wind and solar plants, grid operators increasingly specify STATCOMs at the same node to provide fast fault current and voltage support that pure storage inverters alone may not deliver.

According to REN21, global battery-storage investment rose 76.8% in 2023 to about USD 36.3 billion, with China investing USD 14.5 billion, the United States USD 9.6 billion and Germany USD 3.3 billion. Source: REN21 – Energy Storage module. These figures sit alongside rising grid investment and show that the money is moving toward flexible, electronics-rich infrastructure. For SVC and STATCOM suppliers, that means more projects where their systems are integrated from day one into storage plants, rather than added later as corrective measures.

Policy is reinforcing the trend. REN21 notes that by the end of 2023, 43 jurisdictions had specific energy-storage policies and 11 had explicit battery-storage targets. Source: REN21 – Energy Storage module. In parallel, the IEA’s Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions report highlights that system-flexibility needs are set to double between 2022 and 2030, with at least 3,000 GW of renewable projects waiting in grid-connection queues, making grids a bottleneck. Source: IEA – Electricity Grids and Secure Energy Transitions.

Drivers

Rapid renewable growth and grid decarbonisation push SVC and STATCOM demand

A major driving force behind the Static Var Compensator (SVC) and STATCOM market is the fast growth of renewable electricity and the pressure to keep grids stable while cutting emissions. Wind and solar plants inject power that changes quickly with weather, which makes voltage control and reactive power support more critical at transmission and large distribution levels.

According to the International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA), the world added about 473 GW of new renewable power capacity in 2023, raising total renewable capacity by 13.9%, with renewables making up 86% of all new power additions that year. IRENA’s 2025 update shows another 585 GW added in 2024, taking global renewable capacity to 4,448 GW and accounting for over 90% of total power expansion. Such volumes force grid operators to invest in dynamic VAR devices so that voltage remains within safe limits as renewable output swings.

Policy commitments reinforce this trend. At COP28, more than 130 governments, including the EU, agreed to work towards tripling global installed renewable capacity to at least 11,000 GW by 2030. This creates a long pipeline of new renewable projects that must be connected to grids that were mostly designed around synchronous thermal plants, not inverter-based generation.

At the same time, grid investment is rising, but still needs to grow. The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that about USD 400 billion per year is currently spent on electricity grids worldwide, compared with roughly USD 1 trillion on generation assets. In its Net Zero by 2050 pathway, the IEA says annual clean-energy investment must more than triple to around USD 4 trillion by 2030

Restraints

High upfront cost and slow grid investment approvals limit SVC and STATCOM adoption

One major restraining factor for the Static Var Compensator (SVC) and STATCOM market is the high upfront capital cost, combined with slow grid-investment approvals. These systems are technically advanced and custom-engineered for each grid location, which makes utilities cautious, especially in cost-sensitive or regulated markets.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) explains that global electricity grid spending is currently around USD 400 billion per year, while it needs to rise to nearly USD 600 billion per year by 2030 just to keep pace with clean-energy expansion and electrification goals. When grid investment falls short, utilities often delay or scale down advanced technologies like STATCOMs and SVCs, choosing lower-cost or short-term solutions instead. This directly slows deployment, even when technical need is clear.

Cost pressure is strongest in developing economies. According to the World Bank, more than 70% of electricity network investment growth required this decade must occur in emerging and developing countries, yet many utilities in these regions face weak balance sheets and limited access to low-cost capital.

Another challenge is long approval and procurement timelines. Grid-scale projects involving FACTS devices often require environmental clearances, land permits, and multi-year regulatory reviews. The IEA notes that average transmission projects in advanced economies now take 5–10 years from planning to commissioning, even before adding power-electronics systems.

Opportunity

Digital-load growth and grid expansion open new roles for SVCs and STATCOMs

A big growth opportunity for Static Var Compensators and STATCOMs comes from how fast electricity demand is changing shape, not just growing in size. Electric vehicles, AI-heavy data centres and electrified industries are all clustering around specific nodes on the grid. That creates local voltage stress and reactive-power needs that traditional equipment cannot handle alone.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that global electricity demand will grow by about 3.3% in 2025 and 3.7% in 2026, among the highest rates seen in the last decade. Within that total, new loads are especially disruptive. In its Global EV Outlook 2025, the IEA reports that electric vehicles used around 180 TWh of electricity in 2024 and could reach roughly 780 TWh by 2030, more than a four-fold jump. Every fast-charging corridor or urban depot connected to the high-voltage network becomes a candidate site for STATCOM-based voltage support.

Data centres add another layer. The IEA’s Energy and AI analysis projects that total electricity use by data centres could rise to about 945 TWh by 2030, nearly double today and close to 3% of global electricity demand. Many of these facilities are concentrated in a few regions, which makes local voltage and flicker control critical. Utilities have started to specify dynamic VAR systems in grid-connection agreements for large clusters of cloud or AI infrastructure.

All of this sits on top of a historic wave of grid investment. The IEA notes that to stay on track for national climate targets, annual grid spending must nearly double to over USD 600 billion per year by 2030, with a strong focus on modern, digital distribution networks. A complementary assessment by the Global Renewables Alliance suggests cumulative grid investment of about USD 21 trillion by 2050, with yearly outlays exceeding USD 700 billion by 2030 to meet climate goals.

Regional Insights

North America dominates with 45.90% share (USD 0.9 Bn)

In 2024, the North American region was observed to lead the Static Var Compensator (SVC) and STATCOM market, accounting for a dominant 45.90% share and an estimated regional value of USD 0.9 billion. Market leadership in the region can be attributed to a concentrated programme of grid modernization, increased transmission investments, and utility-scale renewable integration projects that required rapid reactive power support and dynamic voltage control.

Regional incentives and tighter grid-code requirements accelerated replacement and upgrade cycles for older compensation equipment, and the rollout of HVDC interconnections further stimulated demand for fast-acting reactive power solutions. Project pipeline data showed that utility-scale wind and solar tie-ins, together with electrification of transport and industry, contributed to near-term capacity additions and sustained aftermarket service revenues. Supply chain resilience and local engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) capacity supported faster project execution times for large transmission projects, thereby reinforcing North America’s leading position.

The first poles for the $5bn HumeLink project went up this week at Gregadoo, near Wagga Wagga, marking a major milestone for the 365km transmission line that will pump renewable energy from Snowy 2.0 into the national grid.

Under the project more than 700 Aussies will work across the site, adding 832 power poles to help power the country.

On Wednesday, official Australian Bureau of Statistics figures showed electricity prices have skyrocketed 37.1 per cent over the past 12 months, as state and federal rebates are unwound.

There was some relief in October, with energy prices dropping 10 per cent nationally and 19 per cent in Sydney alone.

Transgrid CEO Brett Redman said HumeLink would unlock the full capacity of Snowy 2.0 and other new renewable energy generators, and help deliver cheap, clean power to homes across NSW.

”Transgrid and our delivery partners are getting on with the job of delivering this once-in-a-generation investment in our energy system, critical to realising the Commonwealth and NSW governments’ shared clean energy vision,” Mr Redman said.

The project is also providing an economic boost to regional communities, creating up to 1,600 construction jobs and delivering $6.3 billion in direct and indirect investment in local economies along the project alignment.

HumeLink West Project director Tim Burns said the infrastructure would deliver more than $1 billion in net benefits to Australian households and businesses through access to cheaper, more reliable renewable energy.

”Our team will keep engaging, connecting and listening to communities to make sure we’re doing what we can to support their needs, while also ensuring new economic opportunities such as local jobs and local spend with regional business continue to be created,” he said.

The project is also set to create hundreds of regional jobs and inject millions into local economies.

Senator Watt had indicated earlier this week an intention to strike a deal either with the Greens or the Coalition to secure support in the Senate.","Amendments to the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act returned to the lower house on Friday morning after receiving support from the Greens in the Senate on Thursday.

The reforms will establish a federal environmental protection agency, national environmental standards and higher penalties for the most significant breaches of environmental law.

They also give the federal government oversight over native forest logging.

After a contentious early-morning sitting on Friday, the Bill passed 89 to 34 at 9.40am,prompting cheers from the crowd.

Mr McCormack mirrored comments from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry chief executive Andrew McKellar on Thursday, calling the reform package “Frankenstein’s monster”

‘(It) is going to be unleashed onto the Australian economy at a time when we’re already paying higher power prices, at a time of cost of living costs,” Mr McCormack, a former deputy Prime Ministers said.

“I mean, this is nuts.”

Mr McCormack denied that the Coalition was ineffective on the reforms and said the party would be “fighting ard over summer”, including over power prices.

‘Proud day’: Labor passes sweeping green reforms

Addressing the Bill, Anthony Albanese accused the Coalition, who had been in talks with the government over a deal as late as Wednesday night, of being a “mess … incapable of coming up with plans that were consistent”.

“They changed their decision from hour to hour,” he said.

“The final documentation from the Coalition said: ‘Oh, and there’s more’. This is yesterday afternoon.

“They couldn’t tell us what their amendments would be.”

Mr Albanese said it was a “proud day for me as Labor leader” to pass the reforms.

“This was a yes-olition,” he said.

“People who wanted reform, making a big difference on housing, energy, critical minerals, and resources.

“Projects that make a difference, unleashing our nation’s capability and backing our economy, because the stronger economy and cleaner environment depend on each other, and with these laws, our government is delivering both.”

Mr Albanese said the reforms would provide certainty to businesses, with “quicker yeses and quicker nos”, and would speed up delivery of renewable energy projects and housing.

Sussan Ley said the “Greens alliance is well and truly back in business”.

“Because, we listen to you Prime Minister every question time laying into the Greens, but today, the Greens are amazing, so nice to the Greens,” the Opposition Leader said.

“This is economy wrecking.”

Ms Ley said the Bill could have been pushed until next year.

“We know a political fix when we see one,” she said.

“This piece of rubbish was pulled out of the hat because this could have gone on to next year.

“Fifteen-hundred pages of legislation could have been properly consulted, done systematically.”

Ms Ley said energy producers claimed the Bill would put “all approvals in the slow lane”.

“That’s what’s really going to happen here if you want approvals for resources, projects, for gas,” she said.

“I thought, Prime Minister, you had a future gas strategy.

“You have no gas strategy now, nothing to provide and the affordability to bring people’s energy prices down.

“Energy producers said this will delay the new gas that has to come online to keep our electricity grid functioning.”

Greens MP Elizabeth Watson-Brown credited her party for having negotiated an end to the regional forestry agreement exemption for native forest logging.

“It shouldn’t have to be like this. We shouldn’t have to fight like this, but we do,” she said.

“If Labor had their way under the original Bill, big logging corporations would still be destroying our native forests.”

Environment Minister Murray Watt went on to deny the Bill entailed an end to regional forestry agreements or native forest logging.

Instead, he said the Bill meant the same environmental standards applied to other industries would apply to logging.

“I can categorically assure your listeners that we have not agreed to shut down native forestry in Tasmania or any other part of the country,” he told ABC Radio Hobart.

“Now, we all know that that is what the Greens have wanted to do, but we stared them down on that and rejected their demand to do that.”

He claimed the Coalition and the Greens had been “running around Tasmania telling people that we’re going to be shutting down native forestry, and that’s because that’s just a political scare campaign that works for both of them”.

Coalition environment spokeswoman Angie Bell took a swipe at Ms Watson-Brown, describing her as “the new deputy prime minister”.

The Bill also received support from independent Wentworth MP Allegra Spender, though she said it was “imperfect”.

The reforms stem from a 2020 review by Professor Graeme Samuel into the EPBC Act.

While the Agency's broader PFAS agenda and stringent state regulations will continue to drive compliance and enforcement, EPA's proposed exemptions to the one-time TSCA reporting rule are a welcome development for impacted stakeholders.

In October 2023, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (""EPA"") adopted a rule requiring per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (""PFAS"") manufacturers and importers to""submit information to EPA regarding PFAS uses, production volumes, byproducts, disposal, exposures, and existing information on environmental and health effects"" from PFAS or PFAS-containing imported articles between 2011 and 2022. The stated rationale was that it would allow EPA to ""better characterize the sources and quantities"" of ""PFAS in the United States.""Toxic Substances Control Act (""TSCA"") Reporting and Recordkeeping Requirements for Perfluoroalkyl and Polyfluoroalkyl Substances, 40 C.F.R. § 705 (2023). The reporting rule's lengthy lookback period and the breadth of information and activities it covers have presented challenges for regulated entities, including spending resources to determine whether they are subject to the rule and what information is reportable. EPA has twice extended the initial reporting deadline, most recently to April 2026.

Earlier this month, the EPA under the Trump administration proposed several significant exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule to reduce compliance costs and burdens for regulated entities. The proposed exemptions would include:

De Minimis. PFAS in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1 percent.

Imported Articles. PFAS imported as part of a manufactured item, such as a textile, that has an end-use function dependent on its shape or design and that does not have any commercially relevant change of chemical composition during use.

Byproducts, Impurities and Non-Isolated Intermediates. Typically, PFAS that emerge as byproducts of a manufacturing process (not used for commercial purposes).

Research and Development (""R&D"") Chemicals. PFAS manufactured (including imported) in small quantities for R&D purposes.

The EPA's Proposed Rule is open for public comment until December 29, 2025.

The environmental rollbacks came one after the next last week, potentially affecting everything from the survival of rare whales to the health of the Hudson River.

On Nov. 17, the Environmental Protection Agency proposed to strip federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, narrowing the reach of the Clean Water Act.

Last week, federal wildlife agencies announced changes to the Endangered Species Act that could make it harder to rescue endangered species from the brink of extinction.

The Interior Department moved to allow new oil and gas drilling across nearly 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters, including a remote region in the high Arctic where drilling has never before taken place.

If the Trump administration’s proposals are finalized and upheld in court, they could reshape U.S. environmental policy for years to come, environmental lawyers and activists said.

“This was the week from hell for environmental policy in the United States,” said Pat Parenteau, a professor emeritus and senior fellow for climate policy at Vermont Law and Graduate School. “Unless stopped by the courts, each of these proposed rollbacks will do irreparable harm to the nation’s water quality, endangered species and marine ecosystems.”

The quick pace of these proposals was notable, even for an administration that has enacted President Donald Trump’s agenda at breakneck speed.

While the administration was working in Washington to dismantle environmental protections, 3,300 miles to the south, negotiators from nearly 200 nations were trying to improve the planet’s health at the United Nations climate summit in Brazil.

A White House official, who declined to be identified, said the timing was unrelated to the U.N. climate summit, which the Trump administration boycotted this year. It was the first time since the annual summits began 30 years ago that the United States was not present.

“The Trump administration unveiled many historic announcements this week to further President Trump’s American energy dominance agenda,” Taylor Rogers, a White House spokesperson, said in an email. “President Trump serves the American people, not radical climate activists who have fallen victim to the biggest scam of the century.”

A range of industries supported the changes, including groups representing farmers, oil drillers, chemical manufacturers, homebuilders and real estate developers.

“The developments this week were definitely major steps toward the administration’s goal of achieving and restoring American energy dominance and manufacturing dominance as well,” said Chris Phalen, vice president of domestic policy at the National Association of Manufacturers, a trade group. “We’re definitely very pleased with what came out.”

The EPA kicked off the wave of deregulation Nov. 17, when it proposed to significantly scale back the Clean Water Act, which Congress passed in 1972 to protect all “waters of the United States” from pollution or destruction.

The agency said it would more narrowly define “waters of the United States” to exclude many wetlands and streams across the country. The changes could strip federal protections from up to 55 million acres of wetlands, or about 85% of all wetlands nationwide, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council, an environmental group.

Sen. Cynthia Lummis, R-Wyo., said the changes would prevent people with the smallest of waterways on their properties from needing to obtain federal permits if they wanted to fill them in or dump pollutants. “Farmers, ranchers and landowners shouldn’t have every puddle or gully regulated by D.C. bureaucrats,” she said in a statement.

The deregulatory spree picked up Wednesday, when the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service announced changes to the way the Endangered Species Act, the bedrock environmental law intended to prevent animal and plant extinctions, is applied.

The proposals would allow the government to assess economic factors, such as lost revenue from a ban on oil drilling near critical habitat, before deciding whether to list a species as endangered. At the moment, the government considers only the best available science when awarding that designation, which triggers protections against killing or harming the species and interfering with its habitat.

It was easy to miss the announcement about endangered species, which came on the same day that Trump signed legislation calling on the Justice Department to make public its files on convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.

But the move was worth attention, said Andrew Mergen, an environmental law professor at Harvard Law School.

“It’s really hard for the public to keep track of this news, but it’s really important that they do,” Mergen said. “We’re going to lose species and their habitats in a death-by-a-thousand-cuts way, but there are things that can be done to right the ship and help these species recover.”

On Thursday, as the news cycle was dominated by Trump’s insult of a journalist, the Interior Department announced a plan to hold as many as 34 sales of leases in federal waters spanning roughly 1.27 billion acres, an area more than half the size of the United States.

The plan would require six sales of leases off the coast of California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom, a Democrat and critic of Trump, has promised to block any new drilling. It also would mandate seven auctions of leases in the Gulf of Mexico, which Trump calls the Gulf of America, and 21 auctions of leases off the coast of Alaska, including in an isolated region called the high Arctic stretching more than 200 miles offshore.

Analysts said oil companies may not rush to snap up leases off California, where Newsom could reject permits for the infrastructure on land, such as pipelines and terminals, that is needed to support offshore drilling. Companies may also avoid the icy high Arctic, given the severe weather conditions and the lack of existing infrastructure.

Instead, oil industry interest could be concentrated in the Gulf, where drilling rigs are already plentiful. “The Gulf has the infrastructure, workforce and expertise that make it uniquely productive,” said Erik Milito, the president of the National Ocean Industries Association, a trade group that represents offshore drilling companies as well as offshore wind firms.","https://static.wixstatic.com/media/a793f9_708ac866d084491fa9a728e2b9bfb04f~mv2.jpg/v1/fill/w_922,h_670,al_c,q_85/a793f9_708ac866d084491fa9a728e2b9bfb04f~mv2.jpg",N,,2025-11-28 02:58:11.960373

The move gives Hyroad ownership of the largest Nikola fleet and a base to accelerate the deployment of zero-emission hydrogen-fuelled trucks in North America.

A key part of the plan involves bringing Nikola trucks back online. From December 2025, Hyroad Energy will launch a subscription service to restore full truck-to-cloud connectivity for all Nikola Tre BEV and FCEV trucks.

This follows the shutdown of all cellular lines to production trucks in July 2025, which left fleets without live data or digital vehicle management capabilities.

Acquiring hydrogen truck technology and IP

The deal provides Hyroad with a foundation to deploy zero-emission trucks. It covers 103 brand-new Nikola Tre hydrogen fuel cell electric trucks alongside the supporting software systems and operational infrastructure IP.

Hyroad also aims to establish maintenance and parts facilities to support the fleet, which will primarily operate in California, where Hyroad Energy continues to develop its hydrogen refuelling infrastructure.

""This acquisition advances Hyroad's mission to provide turnkey hydrogen trucking solutions that reduce the complexity and risk typically associated with adopting zero-emission technologies,"" says Dmitry Serov, CEO and Founder of Hyroad Energy.

Dmitry adds: ""These trucks and the corresponding equipment and systems represent immediate capacity to put proven hydrogen fuel cell technology on the road to meet demand for zero-emission trucks.""

A service-based model for zero-emission fleets

This development marks a new chapter for the hydrogen trucking industry. As the new owner, Hyroad's subscription service will give users access to the Nikola Fleet web app, the Drive mobile app, and continuous cellular data service.

This service-based approach is central to Hyroad Energy’s model, which combines technology infrastructure and service into a single ecosystem.

Through its hydrogen trucks-as-a-service model, Hyroad Energy offers fleets an all-inclusive solution. This package covers the trucks, maintenance, hydrogen supply, and refuelling stations under a simple pay-per-mile structure.

The approach could eliminate the complexity and high upfront cost often associated with adopting clean transport. By integrating vehicle provision, hydrogen production, and refuelling under one umbrella, Hyroad aims to ensure high asset utilisation and competitive operating costs.

“I am thrilled to help put the remaining trucks to work and support all the ones already out in the wild providing zero-emission moves to shippers,” says Robert Kelly, Vice President of Business Development at Hyroad Energy, on LinkedIn.

Integrating sustainable manufacturing processes

Nikola has long been involved in zero-emission vehicle innovation. Nikola's 2023 Sustainability Impact Report noted milestones, including the commercial launch of its Tre FCEV, which was the first hydrogen Class 8 truck assembled in the US, alongside the introduction of its HYLA hydrogen energy brand.

Nikola’s sustainability strategy extended beyond its vehicles and into its production methods. Its Arizona manufacturing facility is powered in part by solar energy, and according to its report, it achieved a 45% waste diversion rate.

Through initiatives such as battery recycling and remanufacturing, Nikola reclaimed 95% of lithium-ion battery materials. This focus on the manufacturing lifecycle is a key component of creating a sustainable transport ecosystem.

By scaling hydrogen production, reducing its carbon intensity, and aiming for cost parity with diesel, Hyroad aims to fast-track the decarbonisation of heavy transport. The integration of Nikola's manufacturing and operational IP will be a key part of this strategy moving forward.",https://assets.bizclikmedia.net/1200/9df01b05177c82a4915f45b3c39c911e:e186b754216b5c49bcbc7841f9593222/nikola-fcev-biagi.webp.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 08:01:50.535924

The market reached USD 1,080.0 million in 2024, and is projected to surge to USD 4,179.1 million by 2033, reflecting a CAGR of 16.22% during 2025–2033. This robust growth underscores a structural shift in how Australia approaches energy, mobility and storage — moving from fossil-fuel dependence toward electrification, renewable integration and a battery-driven energy ecosystem.

Why the Market Is Growing So Rapidly

Several converging drivers are fueling Australia’s lithium-ion battery boom:

Electric Vehicles & Clean Mobility

As Australia accelerates EV adoption and considers electrifying more segments—including passenger cars, two-wheelers, and commercial fleets—the demand for high-capacity lithium-ion batteries rises sharply. Battery-powered mobility is becoming more attractive as lithium-ion battery pack prices drop, improving affordability for consumers.

Renewable Energy Storage & Grid Integration

With increasing uptake of rooftop solar and utility-scale solar and wind projects, there is a rising need for energy storage to manage intermittency and supply peaks. Lithium-ion batteries are widely used in grid-scale storage, battery-energy-storage systems (BESS), microgrids (especially in remote or mining regions), and residential solar-plus-storage setups.

Rich Mineral Resources and Local Value-Chain Potential

Australia’s abundant deposits of lithium, cobalt, and nickel give it a strategic advantage. Supported by national and state-level strategies (e.g., critical-minerals policy, battery-industry incentives), there is growing investment in refining, component production, and even cell-assembly within the country. This downstream value-chain development strengthens supply security and supports long-term industry growth.

Price Reduction & Technological Improvements

Global price pressure on battery raw materials and intensified manufacturing competition have led to significant reductions in lithium-ion battery pack costs. According to recent reports, pack prices dropped around 20% in 2024 — boosting affordability for EVs, storage systems and consumer electronics alike.

Surge in Grid-Storage, Remote & Industrial Use Cases

Beyond consumer electronics and mobility, batteries are increasingly used in industrial, mining, remote-area power supply, backup power and off-grid applications. As companies and utilities seek to decarbonize and improve energy resilience, lithium-ion storage becomes a favourable solution.

What the Opportunities Are

For investors, manufacturers, energy firms and policymakers, the rapidly growing lithium-ion battery market in Australia presents multiple opportunities:

1. EV Battery Production and Automotive Value-Chain Development

As EV adoption grows, demand for battery packs, battery cells, battery-management systems (BMS), and associated supply-chain infrastructure (manufacturing, recycling, assembly) will rise. Firms that build local EV-battery manufacturing stand to capture long-term value.

2. Grid-Scale Storage and Utility Battery Systems

Utilities, independent power producers, and renewable-energy firms can invest in large-scale battery-energy storage systems to stabilize grids, integrate renewables, and provide frequency regulation — a critical need as renewable penetration rises.

3. Residential & Commercial Solar-Plus-Storage Solutions

Homeowners and businesses adopting solar are increasingly bundling with battery storage — offering energy independence, lower bills and resilience. Solar-plus-battery installers, storage providers, and energy-management services stand to benefit.

4. Remote, Mining & Off-Grid Power Solutions

Remote mines, regional communities and off-grid settlements (including Indigenous and rural communities) require reliable power. Lithium-ion battery-based microgrids—possibly combined with renewables—offer clean, cost-effective alternatives to diesel generators.

5. Domestic Value-Chain Development & Exports

Australia’s mineral wealth positions it to build a full battery value chain — from mining to refining to cell-assembly — reducing dependence on imports and potentially exporting battery components or finished systems to the Asia-Pacific.

6. Battery Recycling, Second-Life Storage & Circular Economy

As battery deployment scales, so does the need for recycling, repurposing and managing end-of-life batteries. Developing recycling infrastructure, second-life storage applications, and sustainable supply chains offers new revenue streams and environmental compliance benefits.

Recent News & Developments in Australia Lithium-ion Battery Market

• Mid-2025: Reports indicate that lithium-ion battery pack prices fell by roughly 20%, the largest drop since 2017 — a key factor improving cost-effectiveness for EVs and storage applications nationwide.

• 2025 (ongoing): Under the national and state-level battery initiatives, several government grants and incentives have been announced to promote domestic battery manufacturing, processing and a full battery value chain — making Australia a more attractive base for battery-related investments.

• 2025: Rising orders have been recorded for stationary battery-storage systems and solar-plus-storage installations — as households and businesses seek energy security amidst rising electricity prices and a push for clean energy transition.

Why Should You Know About Australia Lithium-Ion Battery Market?

You should know about Australia’s lithium-ion battery market because it sits at the intersection of multiple critical transitions — energy, mobility, renewables, and manufacturing. The shift toward battery-powered systems is reshaping how Australia generates, stores and consumes energy.

As we said to the inquiry hearing in Canberra:

“This parliament could fail to pass legislation and leave us with the failed Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act (EPBC Act) for another five or 10 years, which would take us past the 2030 targets and get us closer to the extinction deadline for koalas.

“The second option is that this parliament could pass these bills as proposed unamended or even weakened, as recommended by industry. That risks this parliament actually having the legacy of making a failed EPBC Act worse for nature.

“Both of those options are unthinkable.

“The only viable option is for this parliament to draft amendments to strengthen these bills to protect nature and actually deliver outcomes for nature, climate and community.

“We have really talented people in Parliamentary Counsel. We have a list of amendments and solutions right here. So it has to be option three.“

EDO is relieved that option three prevailed, with an historic deal made between the government and the Greens to amend the broken EPBC Act. The Bills have now passed the parliament.

The wins

The amendments passed through last-minute negotiations included the following significant steps forward for nature protection.

Setting an end date to the exemption from Regional Forest Agreements (RFAs) from the EPBC Act

For over 25 years, logging of Australia’s native forests has been exempted from the protection and oversight of the EPBC Act.

The amendments to the Act passed this week have legislated an end date for this exemption: 1 July 2027.

This means that any native forest logging that is likely to have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance (MNES) that occurs after that date must be subject to the EPBC Act.

This is a momentous change, one that legal and ecological experts have long called for and is a significant improvement to the integrity of the EPBC Act as Australia’s national environmental protection law.

However, the government has stated its intention to work with affected states to accredit forestry operations to enable those operations to take place without needing approvals for each individual operation, for example through strategic assessments, bioregional plans, or devolving approval powers for these activities.

This will require close and ongoing scrutiny to ensure the government’s stated intention to ensure that forestry operations comply with National Environmental Standards is effective and enforced.

Tightening land-clearing loopholes for the Great Barrier Reef catchment and for regrowth vegetation

Australia is a global deforestation hot spot. Until the amendments passed this week, most of that deforestation was undertaken with no effective federal oversight under the EPBC Act.

In the past decade, much of this deforestation has occurred in NSW and Qld, including in the catchment of the Great Barrier Reef, which has led to sedimentation and other pollution impacts on the World Heritage-listed treasure.

The amendments made this week make it clear that the “continuation of use” exemption does not apply to certain land clearing.

Specifically, vegetation clearing will be subject to the EPBC Act assessment where it will or may have a significant impact on a matter of national environmental significance and:

the vegetation is within 50m of a Great Barrier Reef catchment watercourse, wetland or drainage line; or

the vegetation is anywhere across Australia and has not been cleared for 15 years or more, where it is not a forestry operation.

Both amendments will commence immediately from royal assent, to reduce the risk of panic clearing.

The “continuous use” exemption has until now allowed vegetation clearing to continue without EPBC Act assessment where the vegetation was cleared prior to the EPBC Act commencing.

This has meant that vegetation areas of any size that have recovered and become important regrowth and habitat for other species could be cleared without federal oversight.

The amendments will finally remove this exemption to better protect regrowth vegetation and vegetation near waterways in the sensitive Great Barrier Reef catchment.

However, laws can only be as effective as their enforcement.

We welcome the minister’s confirmation in parliament yesterday that “the new provisions regarding agricultural land clearing and the enforcement of those provisions will certainly be a priority for the new National Environmental Protection Agency”.

Water trigger prevented from being devolved to state and territory governments

The exemption that has prevented the “water trigger” being devolved will remain in the Act. This trigger applies when large-scale coal mining and unconventional gas projects will or may be likely to have a significant impact on water resources.

It is an important safeguard to ensure federal oversight of impacts to our water resources from these highly impactful activities.

This trigger has ensured federal oversight and stronger regulation of the water impacts of some of the largest fossil fuel projects applied for in Australia, including the Adani Carmichael coal mine and fracking in the Northern Territory Beetaloo Basin.

The original Bills had proposed to remove the exemption in the Act to allow this trigger to be devolved for assessment and approval by states and territories.

Since water laws under state and territory governments have not provided sufficient protection against the unsustainable impacts of coal and unconventional gas projects, this would have been catastrophic for the sustainability of Australia’s water resources for all water users.

But the amendments yesterday prevented this move, ensuring the powers remain with the federal government.

Some new safeguards around devolution of EPBC Act powers

The amendments require that accreditation of assessment processes must be in place before approval powers are devolved to a state or territory government or other entity.

This ensures that there will be a process of reviewing and hopefully strengthening state and territory assessment processes to meet the accreditation requirements before approval powers are devolved.

This new requirement will not apply where the activities subject to devolution are under a Regional Forest Agreement, in which case the approval powers can be devolved without accreditation of assessment powers first.

Bilateral agreements must also now include a power for the minister to “call in” specific activities for assessment by the minister instead of being assessed under a devolved pathway by a state or territory government or other entity.

There is also a new requirement for the CEO of the National EPA to review bilateral agreements where the accredited framework has been amended to ensure that the National Environmental Standards and other criteria are still being met.

The CEO must advise the minister of their review and whether they recommend any variations, suspensions or cancellations of the agreement are necessary because the criteria are no longer met.

Exclusion of fossil fuels from streamlined assessment, national interest approval exemptions and bioregional planning pathways

Fossil fuel activities are prohibited from moving through the new streamlined assessment pathway and the bioregional planning pathway as a priority activity in a “go zone”.

There is also a prohibition on applying the new national interest approval exemption to fossil fuel activities.

The new national interest approval power allows an activity to be exempt from parts of the EPBC Act where it may be considered in the “national interest”.

Fossil fuel activities are defined to include coal, gas and petroleum extraction and production activities, and Minister Watt confirmed in the Senate when the Bills passed that this includes exploration activities.

This will prevent any government allowing the fast-tracking of coal and gas activities without adequate assessment or public consultation.

However, these pathways still lack sufficient guardrails to ensure adequate environmental assessment and public oversight.

They can still be used to fast-track all other activities, including other resource activities, large-scale vegetation clearing, critical mineral mining, and renewable energy projects in inappropriate locations.

Amendments are needed via regulations and the Standards to put in place guardrails to ensure adequate environmental assessment and consultation around impactful activities, ideally limiting fast-tracking to only low-risk activities.

The “preliminary documentation” assessment pathway has also been maintained in the EPBC Act, where the original Bill proposed its removal.

This provides a pathway between the streamlined assessment and environmental impact statement pathways.

Less discretion when applying National Environmental Standards

The application of National Environmental Standards will now have to meet a positive test of a decision being “consistent with” rather than “not inconsistent with” the Standards.

This will apply when assessing individual projects at the federal level, as well as when the minister is assessing whether state or territory frameworks meet the Standards to allow for devolution of EPBC Act powers.

The discretionary test of the minister’s “satisfaction” remains in all decisions.

However, this is a step forward in requiring a more positive duty for each of the elements of the Standards to be met.

Offsets via “pay to destroy” restoration fund not possible for specified threatened species

Amendments were made yesterday with respect to the application of the new Restoration Contributions Special Account, which allows developers to “pay to destroy” by providing money (a “restoration contribution charge”) into the account rather than securing actual offsets that meet all offset principles.

The amendments enable impacts on specific matters (e.g., threatened species) to be excluded from being offset through payment into the account.

This will occur through the use of a new power to make declarations that certain matters cannot be offset via payment.

It is uncertain at this stage which matters will be declared under this new power.

There is still work needed and it is possible to strengthen the proposed Offsets Standard (currently on public exhibition).

For example, this could be done by ensuring all offsets, including those created through payments in a restoration contribution fund, must meet all offset principles.

Methods for calculating restoration contribution charges will also be developed.

Protection statements can also provide information on threatened species and communities that can help identify unacceptable impacts that cannot be offset.

This may help ensure impacts to these matters are not being allowed on the basis of a fallacy that they can be offset.

Review of the EPBC Act now every five years

The EPBC Act will now be subject to review every five years, changed from the current requirement of a review every 10 years.

This will be helpful in providing greater insight into whether the Act is meeting its objects.

It will also creates a helpful impetus for more frequent further amendments where changes are needed.

The concerns

Unacceptable impacts test subject to higher bar

The Environment Protection Reform Bill as introduced provided unacceptable impacts criteria applicable to all matters of national environmental significance.

While these definitions were criticised for needing to be more specific or scientifically founded, they are helpful in providing more guidance as to when impacts should be considered unacceptable for each environmental matter.

Significantly, where it is established that there are unacceptable impacts, the minister will not be able to approve an action.

Unfortunately, during the amendments to the Bill, the test that needs to be met to consider an impact unacceptable was weakened.

These criteria are now subject to a higher bar of certainty that the impact will occur, for example by removing the language that an impact may “be likely to have” an unacceptable impact.

The definitions otherwise remain in place as unique criteria for each matter of national environmental significance, despite many submissions from industries that sought to reduce the criteria to a single provision to be applied to every different matter of national environmental significance.

Climate impact assessment remains the same

No amendments were secured with respect to strengthening the assessment of climate impacts, and so companies will still only be required to disclose scope 1 and 2 emissions in their applications under the EPBC Act and to provide a plan for managing those impacts.

However, under the EPBC Act currently scope 1, 2 and 3 emissions can be considered in assessment of the impact of activities on matters of national environmental significance and this has not changed under the reforms.

Companies often have provided disclosure of all emissions in their EPBC referral applications over the past few years, and so responsible companies may still provide disclosure of their scope 3 emissions, particularly where this is required by jurisdictions such as NSW and Qld.

Stop-work environmental protection order powers curtailed

The power to provide environmental protection orders to address urgent illegal environmental impacts has been limited, with the orders now to expire 14 days after provision. This can be extended by a maximum further 14 days.

Further, the CEO of the EPA must now provide a level of evidence to support their reasonable belief that an environmental protection order is required.

This could slow the ability for the EPA to provide orders to stop serious imminent environmental harm.

New National EPA needs greater independence

The Bills finally introduce the long-awaited National Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), a key commitment of this government.

The EPA will have legislated enforcement powers but will only have assessment and approval powers when delegated by the minister.

When acting in a delegated power, the EPA can be subject to the direction of the minister, impacting their independence.

However, when acting in a legislated power, the EPA is not subject to the direction of the minister and must simply provide a Statement of Intent in response to the minister’s Statement of Expectation.

There will be no independent board to govern the EPA. The CEO will be appointed by the Governor-General on the minister’s satisfaction that they meet the required criteria.

EDO recommended the EPA have sufficient independence to ensure it could administer the EPBC Act without political influence.

The Bills do not remove this risk, however, the EPA as created does have some level of independence, which is a step forward, and from here its independence can hopefully be strengthened.

The process

The arbitrary deadline that the Bills must be passed before Christmas, while the Senate inquiry was still receiving submissions, was a political decision.

It meant that 1500 pages of technical legislation was rushed through without time for proper scrutiny, not only by parliamentarians voting on amendments, but also by experts, stakeholders and community members wanting to provide input on these critical Bills through the Senate committee inquiry process.

This is highly regrettable and a blight on Australia’s federal environment laws.

It increases the risk of drafting errors and unintentional consequences of rushed amendments.

Australia’s environmental laws, and their importance in protecting Australia’s most precious species and places, should be handled with more respect and consideration than was the case this year.

The unfinished business – what happens next?

The passing of the Bills is a pivotal moment. The reforms promise to deliver some significant gains and some safeguards for nature and communities, but it’s not over yet.

The Senate inquiry that was commenced to scrutinise the Bills will continue but will turn its attention to the oversight of the National Environmental Standards.

This is good news because it means there will be an opportunity to give the Standards the consideration they warrant given their significance in strengthening the Act, as proposed by Professor Samuel’s review.

Two draft National Environmental Standards are currently open for consultation until 5pm, Friday, 30 January 2026:

Draft MNES Standards – to provide more guidance on the assessment of impacts to matters of national environmental significance; and

Draft Offsets Standard – focused on providing improved criteria for offsets, to ensure they are effective at achieving their aims. This draft also introduces criteria around the new restorations contribution fund.

Find the draft Standards and guidance documents and details of how to have your say here.

There will also be a need for amendments to the regulations that sit under the EPBC Act to ensure safeguards are placed on key risks, like the new streamlined assessment pathway, and other policies to support the changes, including the development of methods to determine offset charges.",https://www.edo.org.au/wp-content/uploads/2025/07/shutterstock_757121674-1-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-28 05:59:00.098007

See, e.g., U.S. Department of Energy, Office of Nuclear Energy, Commercial AI & Energy Generation Infrastructure Program at Idaho National Laboratory, Request for Application Number: DE-FOA-0003578 Amendment 07 (11/05/2025).","The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) is accelerating efforts to transform sections of its federal land portfolio into strategic hubs for artificial intelligence (AI)-enabled data centers and advanced energy infrastructure.

These priorities respond to surging demand for digital and computational power and the critical need for secure, resilient baseload electricity and support President Trump's priorities to maintain and enhance American leadership in AI and energy generation.1 In pursuit of this national agenda, DOE began by soliciting industry feedback with a spring 2025 Request for Information (RFI for AI Infrastructure) on siting AI infrastructure on DOE-owned or DOE-managed land assets, focusing on improving and accelerating data center construction, energy technologies, and operational partnerships and building out the nation's readiness for and competitive advantage in AI innovation and infrastructure.2

Of the 16 potential federal sites explored in the RFI for AI Infrastructure, Secretary Wright selected four ""winning"" sites in a July 24th announcement for U.S. companies to build and power AI data centers. Shortly thereafter, DOE moved forward with requests for proposals (RFPs), requests for offers (RFOs), and requests for applications (RFAs) for these four sites.

On September 9, DOE's Idaho Operations Office issued an RFA seeking applications by November 7, 2025, for projects at Idaho National Laboratory (INL).

On September 30, DOE's Office of Environmental Management and Office of Science issued an RFP seeking proposals by December 1, 2025, for projects at the Oak Ridge Reservation.

On September 30, the National Nuclear Security Administration issued an RFP seeking proposals by December 6, 2025, for projects at the Savannah River Site in South Carolina.

On October 31, 2025, DOE's Office of Environmental Management issued an RFO seeking proposals by January 30, 2026, for projects at the Paducah Gaseous Diffusion Plant (PGDP) in Kentucky.

For each solicitation, DOE has focused on three configurations of project proposals: Integrated Data Center and Energy Projects, Phased Integrated AI Data Center and Energy Projects, and Energy Infrastructure Projects.3 Each solicitation expresses a preference for innovative energy technology, including nuclear and geothermal technologies, for potential generation sources and requires that new sources be incorporated either directly into the project design or indirectly through a partnership between the AI data center operators and new energy generators.

DOE's latest solicitation centers on the site of the PDGP, a legacy facility on a 3,555-acre reservation that was devoted to uranium enrichment from the early 1950s until its closure in 2013.4 The RFO identifies approximately 785 acres available for development; the Paducah site itself is capable of supporting up to 3 gigawatts of energy production in the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) power market, in addition to large-load data centers employing that power. The site boasts abundant water resources, positioning it as a practical host for large-scale, energy-intensive data centers with water cooling systems.

In addition to the Paducah site, three other DOE-managed sites are active targets for major data center projects: the INL site in Idaho underwent a similar RFP process earlier in the fall. Bids for the INL site were due on November 7, with selections expected to be announced by December 19. The RFP offers 44,000 acres prioritized for rapid deployment,5 significantly more than the other sites. Like all the selected sites, the INL site has deep ties to the nation's history of nuclear development. Notably, DOE already has performed extensive site characterization and permitting activities for new nuclear reactors at INL for the National Reactor Innovation Center.6

The Savannah River site offers a portfolio of developable land tracts totaling over 3,100 acres within a much larger legacy nuclear site. DOE anticipates leasing approximately 250 to 450 acres of the total acreage. Its solicitation seeks to leverage the site's grid access and onsite transmission resources,7 established water infrastructure, and long-haul fiber corridors. At the same time, the Savannah River site presents unique regulatory and environmental challenges due to its long and complicated history of nuclear production and environmental remediation, requiring careful coordination with and integration of any future projects into ongoing federal operations.

Among the potential development sites, the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and Reservation, which comprises appropriately 245 acres across two distinct areas, stands out for its proximity to the flagship research institution and skilled workforce, as well as extensive preexisting infrastructure and Tennessee Valley Authority 500kV transmission lines. The solicitation for the Oak Ridge site is well-suited to public-private technology partnerships but introduces complexity due to overlapping scientific missions and important but potentially burdensome safety protocols.

All four sites provide substantial baseload power capabilities and appealing physical layouts and scale to support substantial data center construction, but each features distinct advantages and operational hurdles and a unique and complicated history of nuclear fuel development and usage, along with potential site remediation challenges, requiring careful coordination with and integration of any future projects into ongoing federal operations. For this reason, bidders are encouraged to consider the ""as is, where is"" nature of the government's proffered lease terms. Project owners will be responsible for building, operating, and decommissioning each infrastructure project and must secure utility interconnection agreements. Proposals will be competitively evaluated for technological readiness, financial viability, and detailed plans to complete regulatory and permitting requirements.

Key Takeaways for Clients

The speed with which DOE has pushed this initiative forward through the stages of federal procurement during the course of 2025 indicates the degree to which the current administration is leveraging the resources of the federal government, including its vast real estate holdings and opportunities to leverage multiple funding sources,8 to prioritize AI buildout and construction of new sources of energy generation. Although DOE has focused on four initial sites, more could follow, and companies seeking to develop large-scale data center projects co-located with generation should consider whether any other federal sites, especially those with built-in interconnection facilities, might be suitable for productive reuse.

DOE's initial focus on four sites with nuclear history bespeaks a clear desire to revitalize the nation's nuclear energy industry and enlist it in the service of AI buildout. The push to make productive use of decommissioned industrial sites predates the current administration, meaning that even as this initiative reflects the priorities of the current administration, it also advances longer-term, bipartisan policy goals.

With several previously closed nuclear power plants announcing plans in recent months for renewed operations to serve large data center offtakers,9 the need for vast quantities of reliable energy production makes nuclear a great fit for AI companies and other data center operators. Even so, with construction timelines for new nuclear power stretching far beyond near-term data center buildout, smaller modular nuclear reactors with shorter construction horizons may meet with more success in the near term, including as bidders for these sites.

At the same time, DOE's focus across all four solicitations on geothermal energy reflects a desire to support recent breakthroughs in geothermal technology that make it possible for more widespread buildout. With active support from the current administration that has been absent in its treatment of other renewable technologies, as well as steady, reliable energy flow and a light environmental footprint, geothermal seems uniquely well-suited to the needs of AI companies and data center operators.

DOE has advanced these procurement processes rapidly, but once projects are awarded, they will still need to negotiate leases with the federal government, which will be complex. It remains to be seen whether the terms and conditions of these leases set forth in each solicitation will prove commercially acceptable to developers. Projects will also need to move through federal permitting, including the National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA), the National Historic Preservation Act, the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act, and other applicable regulatory requirements. Absent substantial exemptions from federal permitting, which do not appear to be contemplated within the terms of these solicitations, aggressive construction timelines may become challenged, particularly in light of the rescission of the Council on Environmental Quality and DOE's NEPA regulations and the reliance instead only on DOE's new NEPA implementation procedures. With that in mind, the extent of federal fast-tracking remains a critical unanswered question.10 Even with the government's active support, the fundamentals of large infrastructure project development still apply. That means that issues like electrical interconnection and access to transmission remain the largest potential vulnerabilities for large new generation sources. That makes the Paducah site particularly appealing as a prime location for high-capacity, energy-intensive projects, benefiting from MISO market access and other built-in resources.

Finally, it is worth noting that the federal government's stake in AI buildout is multifaceted. It has an interest in furthering American industry, a national security interest as China and other nations race for AI supremacy, and an interest as a potential client of advanced AI systems. Here, although no DOE procurement of goods or services is included as a component of any of the open solicitations, the close proximity of many of these sites to the ongoing advanced nuclear research operations at various National Laboratories makes the latter potential relationship particularly intriguing.

In today’s RBN blog, we’ll discuss the controversy and how we think it’s likely to be resolved.
The EUMR is part of the EU’s long-term effort to achieve carbon neutrality and its “Fit for 55” program, an effort to reduce the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030.
(See our A Whole New World blog and five-part Time Has Come Today series for more on “certified,” “differentiated” or “responsibly sourced” gas.)
As shown in Figure 1 below, the U.S.’s share of total LNG imports to Europe (top row) has doubled over the past four years, from 28% in the first half of 2021 to 57% in the first half of 2025.","For months, the Trump administration and energy industry groups have been pressing the European Union (EU) to either scrap or significantly ease its regulations on methane emissions. They assert the methane monitoring, reporting and verification (MRV) requirements, set to ratchet up in 2027, 2028 and 2030, would be impossible for U.S. natural gas producers to meet and result in a sharp decline in — or even an end to — U.S. LNG flows to the EU. In today’s RBN blog, we’ll discuss the controversy and how we think it’s likely to be resolved.

As we said in The Times They Are a-Changin’, the 27-member EU in May 2024 approved the European Union Methane Regulation (EUMR), legislation that, among other things, established methane emission reporting requirements for EU energy producers and LNG importers and a timeline for setting a methane intensity (MI) target for imported LNG. The EUMR is part of the EU’s long-term effort to achieve carbon neutrality and its “Fit for 55” program, an effort to reduce the EU’s greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions by 55% by 2030. Starting in January 2027, the methane regulation will require the companies importing LNG into Europe to prove that the MRV practices of gas producers in the LNG-exporting countries they deal with are at least as stringent as those followed by energy producers within the EU. In August 2028, LNG importers will need to start providing the MI of their gas and starting in August 2030 they will have to prove that their gas’s MI does not exceed a yet-to-be-established MI cap.

Methane is the second-most-impactful GHG — only carbon dioxide (CO2) has a greater heat-trapping effect on the atmosphere — and U.S. gas producers have been working for many years to reduce methane emissions from their operations by phasing out flaring, implementing leak detection and repair (LDAR) programs and replacing gas-powered pumps with electric ones. (See our A Whole New World blog and five-part Time Has Come Today series for more on “certified,” “differentiated” or “responsibly sourced” gas.) These efforts to minimize emissions have been motivated both by economics and the pursuit of operational excellence — after all, natural gas is typically more than 90% methane; why waste it? — and by the expectation that future U.S. and international regulations, including those now being implemented by the EU, will mandate lower and lower MIs for their gas.

Our understanding is that at least 25%, and possibly more than one-third, of total U.S. natural gas production is already being assessed based on methane emissions, mostly by the not-for-profit MiQ but also by other independent certification entities. Expand Energy, the largest U.S. gas producer, noted in its Q3 2025 earnings presentation that 100% of its gas production is now independently certified (mostly by MiQ), and that its companywide MI is only 0.2% — well below the 1% to 2% MI that had been more typical among gas producers in the late 2010s. Similarly, EQT Corp., the #2 gas producer in the U.S., said in June that its Marcellus/Utica-focused production (also independently certified by MiQ) has achieved an MI of only 0.007%, “significantly surpassing its 2025 target of 0.2%.”

This might suggest that U.S. gas producers and LNG exporters would have no problem complying with whatever MI-related rules the EU puts in place, and that the U.S. could continue to provide EU members and other countries in Europe with the substantial volumes of LNG they need to keep the lights on. As shown in Figure 1 below, the U.S.’s share of total LNG imports to Europe (top row) has doubled over the past four years, from 28% in the first half of 2021 to 57% in the first half of 2025. That’s more than 4X the 13% share provided by Russia (which the EU is phasing out as a gas supplier by the end of 2027), 7X Qatar’s 8% share, and 8X Algeria’s 7% share in the first half of this year.",https://rbnenergy.com/sites/default/files/styles/social_image/public/single-use/2025-11/Fig1_Share%20of%20European%20LNG%20Imports%20by%20Supplying%20Country%2C%202021-25.png?itok=D0gFfBnc,N,,2025-11-28 02:58:20.911240

“Planning to build a new pipeline in 2025 is fundamentally irreconcilable with the International Court of Justice’s opinion affirming states’ duties to prevent further climate harm,” said David Suzuki Foundation climate director Sabaa Khan.
“The federal government can’t claim to respect its climate commitments under international law while underwriting fossil fuel expansion that locks Canada into decades of avoidable emissions.
“The notion that Canada can meaningfully shift toward sustainability while doubling down on fossil fuel infrastructure is simply unrealistic,” Khan said.

VANCOUVER — UNCEDED xʷməθkʷəy̓əm (MUSQUEAM), Sḵwx̱wú7mesh (SQUAMISH) AND səlilwətaɬ (TSLEIL-WAUTUTH) TERRITORIES (November 27, 2025)

Prime Minister Mark Carney and Alberta Premier Danielle Smith dealt a devastating blow to climate and nature by signing a memorandum of understanding for a new Alberta-to–British Columbia bitumen pipeline while scrapping environmental policies. The David Suzuki Foundation vehemently opposes this proposed pipeline and calls on the federal government to stand firm on environmental standards and advance Canada’s clean energy transition.

“Planning to build a new pipeline in 2025 is fundamentally irreconcilable with the International Court of Justice’s opinion affirming states’ duties to prevent further climate harm,” said David Suzuki Foundation climate director Sabaa Khan. “The federal government can’t claim to respect its climate commitments under international law while underwriting fossil fuel expansion that locks Canada into decades of avoidable emissions. This is not only a moral and legal contradiction; it is a massive financial risk.”

The Foundation denounces the prime minister’s misleading comment that this pipeline represents an “energy transition” when it aims to scrap hard-fought environmental protections. “The notion that Canada can meaningfully shift toward sustainability while doubling down on fossil fuel infrastructure is simply unrealistic,” Khan said. “A true energy transition can’t be built on expanded oil pipelines, liquefied natural gas exports or increased fossil fuel production — even with unproven ‘carbon capture’ tacked on.”

Every dollar invested in new oil and gas infrastructure today is a future stranded asset tomorrow, and a pollution legacy that Canadians will be forced to clean up long after profits have left the country. “Burning fossil fuels is the main cause of climate change. Canadians deserve a government that protects them from climate and liability risks, not one that sacrifices environmental standards to prop up a declining, high-pollution industry. This pipeline is legally indefensible,” Khan said.

Indigenous communities are most at risk from climate change because of their close ties to the natural environment, the injustices and burdens of colonialism, and the effects of industrial resource extraction. “This proposed pipeline is a massive economic and health threat that takes us further away from true reconciliation,” Khan said.

“B.C.’s north coast is rugged, wild and priceless. Home to iconic species and sensitive ecosystems, its waters are famous for fierce storms and treacherous passages,” said Erin Roger, nature director at the David Suzuki Foundation. “A new pipeline will destroy habitats, displace species and increase the risk of oil spills, which would be catastrophic for the region. Weakening the tanker ban with ‘appropriate adjustments’ for increased tanker traffic defeats the purpose of the ban. We need our political leaders to focus on projects that protect and restore natural spaces — not roll back environmental safeguards.”

The Foundation argues that Canada should be using this political moment to focus on real nation-building projects.

“More than wasting precious time and money on a pipeline that will never be built, this MOU is also a death blow to Canada’s clean electricity regulations, adding to the abandonment of climate action from this federal government,” said Stephen Thomas, clean energy manager at the David Suzuki Foundation. “Low-cost renewable energy and a strengthened east-west grid are among the strongest opportunities we have to save Canadians money on their energy bills, create good jobs and position Canada for the future.

At the center of this legislative shift is “Iryna’s Law,” a high-profile Republican-backed measure inspired by the death of Iryna Zarutska, a Ukrainian woman killed on a Charlotte city bus, a case that drew national attention and pressure from federal leaders. State lawmakers fast-tracked the bill earlier this year, framing it as a direct response to what they called failures in how the state handles violent offenders before trial.

House Speaker Destin Hall (R-Caldwell) has described the law as a “first step to ensure what happened to her never happens again.”

Governor Josh Stein, who signed the bill in October, offered mixed praise — supporting the tighter pretrial release rules, while calling the death penalty provisions “barbaric” and urging lawmakers to invest more heavily in mental health resources.

Stricter Pretrial Release Rules & New Oversight of Magistrates

Under “Iryna’s Law,” people charged with violent offenses will now face significantly tougher release conditions. Instead of being able to secure quick release through a magistrate, defendants accused of certain crimes must receive:

A secured bond, or

GPS-monitored house arrest

The law is designed to eliminate low-level release options for repeat or high-risk offenders and shifts greater responsibility onto the judiciary. Court magistrates, who often oversee the earliest release decisions, are now subject to suspension by Chief Justice Paul Newby if they fail to follow the law’s requirements — a level of oversight not previously in place.

Death Penalty Process Tightened — New Methods Could Be Required

“Iryna’s Law” also aims to streamline parts of North Carolina’s long-stalled death penalty process. Lethal injection remains the state’s default method, but executions have been paused for nearly 20 years due to ongoing legal battles and regulatory challenges.

Under the new statute:

If lethal injection is ever ruled unconstitutional,

North Carolina must adopt a new method — potentially including the electric chair or firing squad.

‘Public Safety Act of 2025’: New Felonies & Tougher Penalties for Drugs and Repeat Offenders

Also taking effect December 1 is the Public Safety Act of 2025, a wide-ranging criminal justice package that alters several parts of state law — from drug offenses to domestic violence protections and firearm release rules.

Key changes include:

New Felony Crimes

Exposing a child under 16 to controlled substances

A new “habitual domestic violence” felony for people with repeated DV convictions

Online solicitation of minors now upgraded to more severe felony levels

Stronger Drug Penalties

Penalties increase for possession, trafficking, and sale of:

Fentanyl

Carfentanil

Firearms Release Changes

Sheriffs may now release surrendered firearms back to defendants without a court order — if a background check shows they are legally eligible.

Tightened Post-Conviction Deadlines

Defendants must file motions for relief within seven years of a qualifying event related to their conviction.

Out-of-State Protective Orders

People who live in another state can now pursue North Carolina protective orders if the abuse occurred within NC.

More North Carolina Laws Taking Effect Dec. 1

The December legal rollout includes dozens of additional changes. Some of the most notable:

New Criminal Penalties & Enhancements

Illegal sale/possession of embalming fluid

Larceny of gift cards

Higher penalties for mail theft

Longer sentences for assaulting utility or communications workers

Online Sexual Exploitation Protections

Websites hosting content must adopt procedures to remove pornographic images upon request. The Attorney General can pursue violators — including users and site operators.

The law also requires the state registrar to keep earlier versions of birth certificates when individuals request sex-marker changes.

A controversial section defining “male,” “female,” and “biological sex” will take effect Jan. 1, following a veto override of Gov. Stein.

Expanded Auditor Powers

State Auditor Beth Wood’s office can now investigate any entity receiving state or federal funds. Gov. Stein vetoed the measure, but lawmakers overrode it.

Disaster Recovery Non-Discrimination

Discriminating based on political affiliation during disaster recovery assistance is now a felony — legislation sparked by a reported incident involving a FEMA supervisor after Hurricane Milton.

Faster Squatter Removal

Property owners can now initiate an expedited process for removing squatters.

Changes to Tinted Window Rules

Window tint is no longer part of the state’s safety inspection checklist. Drivers must simply roll down their windows when stopped by law enforcement.

The Hardware Treadmill: A high-end CPU might last 5-7 years in a data center.","The Cloud"" might be the greatest branding trick in history. It sounds fluffy, ethereal, and notably light.

It implies that our digital lives…our emails, our crypto wallets, our endless scrolling…exist in some vaporous layer of the atmosphere, detached from earthly constraints.

But if you actually drive out to Loudoun County, Virginia, or stare at the arid plains of Altoona, Iowa, you realize the Cloud is actually just a very big, very loud, and very hot factory.

We’ve been telling ourselves a lovely story about the energy transition. We were retiring coal plants, building wind farms, and decoupling economic growth from carbon emissions. It was all going according to plan.

For years, the tech sector achieved relative decoupling…

Moore's Law kept server efficiency gains ahead of the curve, allowing internet traffic to surge while power demand grew slowly.

The exponential curve of AI, however, has shattered this delicate balance. AI workloads are so compute-intensive that demand is now skyrocketing faster than efficiency gains can compensate.

This is a re-coupling with physics..and the defining narrative of the next decade isn't about supply anymore.

Now it's about a structural shift in demand that almost nobody priced in: The thermodynamics of Artificial Intelligence.

According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), global electricity demand from data centers is projected to more than double by 2030. This is the same as the entire annual electricity use of a country like Japan.

The invisible hand is hitting a concrete wall.

The question is no longer if the grid can handle it, but what is making the demand curve look like a rocket launch. The answer isn't better software or smarter algorithms; it's the raw physics happening inside a rack that now demands the power of a city block.

The Thermodynamics of ""Thinking""

To understand why the grid is struggling right now, you have to look at the silicon.

For a long time, we ran the internet on CPUs (Central Processing Units). These are the general managers of the chip world. Efficient, predictable.

But Generative AI doesn't want a manager. It wants a battalion of mathematicians. It runs on GPUs (Graphics Processing Units), specifically monsters like Nvidia’s H100.

Here’s what that actually means for power draw:

Traditional server rack: Draws about 5 to 10 kilowatts (kW).

Modern AI rack (H100s/Blackwell): Draws 50 to 100 kW.

We have effectively moved from powering a toaster to powering a neighborhood, all inside the same metal box. Air cooling…fans blowing over hot metal…doesn't work anymore. Air just isn't physically dense enough to move that much heat away.

We are now plumbing data centers like chemical refineries, running liquid coolant loops directly to the silicon die.

This is the new reality of Direct-to-Chip (DTC) cooling. It is already happening in cutting-edge AI centers because it is the only way to manage the extreme heat density of chips like the H100.

Liquid cooling saves energy compared to air conditioning. While the chip itself still draws 100 kW, the overall cooling system…the pumps and chillers…consumes far less power than running massive air handlers for the whole room. This makes it an efficiency measure born of necessity.

The next step is Immersion Cooling, where entire server racks are submerged in a non-conductive fluid. This is also being deployed now, often in pilot programs and specialized facilities.

This shift from fans to specialized plumbing and chemically inert fluids is the physical realization of the industrialization of thought.

Just like the industrialization of textiles or steel, it requires massive inputs of raw power and exotic, specialty materials. This industrial intensity demands something traditional renewable sources…intermittent solar and wind…struggle to provide: reliability.

When an AI training run costs tens of millions of dollars, a 1% flicker is an existential threat.

The Dirty Secret of the ""Green"" AI Boom

Every major tech CEO is currently on a podcast tour talking about their ""Net Zero"" 2030 goals. And sure, they are buying a lot of paper credits.

But physics doesn't care about carbon offsets. The reality is that AI needs baseload power. It needs to run 24/7/365 with ""five nines"" (99.999%) of reliability.

You know what provides that?

Nuclear (which takes 10 years to build).

Batteries (which we don't have enough of).

Fossil Fuels.

According to IEA data, coal still accounts for about 30% of global data center power. And in the U.S., natural gas is doing the heavy lifting, covering over 40% of demand.

The irony is palpable. We spent billions trying to kill coal, only to have the most futuristic technology on earth, AI, throw it a lifeline.

In places like Virginia or Kansas, utilities are delaying the retirement of coal plants. They simply cannot risk the grid instability when a gigawatt-scale data center comes online.

The ""future"" is being powered by the ""past.""

The need for this reliable baseload power, combined with the sheer gigawatt-scale hunger of these new facilities, is now fundamentally reshaping the American power landscape. Capital always flows to the path of least resistance—and right now, that path runs right through communities that have never seen a single dollar of tech prosperity.

The New Geography of Power (and Inequality)

This energy hunger is redrawing the map. We are seeing a ""K-shaped"" geography of infrastructure.

In the U.S., ""Data Center Alley"" in Northern Virginia supposedly handles 70% of the world's internet traffic. But the grid there is tapped out. You can't get a new hookup for years.

So, the capital is fleeing to places with looser regulations and cheaper land: Texas, Ohio, Arizona.

But this brings us to the friction point. These facilities are neighbors. And they are often bad neighbors. They are loud, they consume massive amounts of water for cooling, and they raise local utility rates.

There is also a significant Environmental Justice component here. Industrial infrastructure is rarely sited in wealthy neighborhoods.

According to the NAACP's ""Fumes Across the Fence-Line"" report:

African Americans are 75% more likely than white Americans to live in ""fence-line"" communities (areas adjacent to industrial facilities).

A disproportionate number of fossil-fuel peaker plants, which fire up when data centers max out the grid, are located in low-income areas and communities of color.

This directly contributes to higher rates of asthma and respiratory issues.

While the ""invisible prosperity"" of AI stock gains flows to portfolios in San Francisco and New York, the ""visible decay""...the pollution, the water usage, the hum of the cooling fans…is localized in communities that often see none of the upside.

Even if a community were willing to bear the cost, the industrial machine that once smoothly supplied the electrical grid is choked.

The problem is no longer just where to put the data center, but how to physically connect the massive, power-hungry factory to the existing grid infrastructure. This process is crippled by a global bottleneck of essential, non-digital hardware.

The Great Transformer Shortage

Let’s say you have the money, the land, and the permits. You still have a problem. You can’t get the gear.

The lead time for a high-voltage power transformer used to be 12 months. Today? It’s 3 to 5 years.

We are trying to rebuild the electrical grid at the exact moment everyone else is trying to electrify cars and heat pumps. The supply chain is fractured.

We are also running out of the raw stuff: Copper. Lithium. Neodymium for the magnets in the cooling fans.

We are dependent on China for the processing of nearly all these critical minerals. As I explained in this “Data Center Guide,” we are realizing that the digital economy is actually a material economy.

If China restricts graphite or gallium exports (which they have started doing), the Cloud stops growing.

The ""Trust Me, Bro"" Efficiency Pitch

The counter-argument from Silicon Valley is the ""Handprint"" theory. The pitch goes like this: Yes, training the AI uses a lot of energy, but the AI will make the rest of the world so efficient that it pays for itself.

The IEA models suggest that AI could optimize logistics, manage smart grids, and reduce building energy usage by 10-20%.

And honestly? It’s a compelling argument. If AI can figure out how to drive a truck platoon 5% more efficiently, that saves more carbon than the data center emits.

But this is a long-term bet against a short-term, guaranteed withdrawal of power.

The core efficiency problem is two-fold:

Training vs. Inference: Training a colossal model takes a massive, months-long burst of power. The resulting AI is then put to work performing inference…answering questions. While inference is far cheaper per interaction than training, its global volume is exponentially growing, turning tiny energy costs into a massive, persistent drain.

The Hardware Treadmill: A high-end CPU might last 5-7 years in a data center. The new AI GPUs are considered obsolete in as little as two years. This brutal, accelerated hardware cycle…the constant replacement of power-hungry H100s with even more power-hungry Blackwells…means that the embodied carbon and raw materials tied up in the silicon are never given a chance to pay back their energy debt over a reasonable lifespan.

We are spending the carbon now in hopes of efficiency later. While the industry is working on ""smarter"" silicon, efficient ASICs for inference, that transition won't arrive fast enough to save the grid from the current exponential surge.

What Comes Next?

We are moving from an era of Generation Constraints to Connection Constraints.

The most valuable asset in the world right now isn't the H100 chip; it’s a signed interconnection agreement with a utility company. The ""queue"" to get on the grid is the new velvet rope.

This is going to force a few things:

Off-Grid AI: Tech giants will stop waiting for the utility. They will build their own SMRs (Small Modular Nuclear Reactors) or massive solar farms with battery storage, effectively taking their ball and going home.

Sovereign Compute: Nations will realize that ""compute"" is a strategic resource like oil. You will see countries hoarding power to feed their own AI models rather than exporting it.

The Efficiency Wall: We will hit a point where the cost of power makes brute-force AI training uneconomical, forcing a shift to ""smarter"" chips (ASICs) and maybe, eventually, neuromorphic or photonic computing.

The invisible hand is dealing cards, but the laws of thermodynamics are calling the bluff. The virtual world requires real power, and for the first time in a long time, we are realizing that ""unlimited data"" was a temporary illusion.

In 2021, the federal Liberals promised a 75% reduction in oil and gas methane by 2030.
Asian countries including Japan and South Korea have already taken steps to improve supply chain transparency of methane emissions for LNG exporting countries, signaling a preference for low-emission energy.
The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) — comprised of 12 of the world’s largest oil and gas companies that represent more than 40% of global oil and gas production — recommitted, in January 2025, to reducing climate emissions, including by pursuing a near-zero methane emissions by 2030.
Delaying methane regulations will stall the many economic benefits that methane reductions produce.","(OTTAWA, ON) The Canadian federal and Alberta governments announced a Memorandum of Understanding today to develop the energy sector. Among other measures, the MOU pledges to “Enter into a methane equivalency agreement on or before April 1, 2026, with a 2035 target date and a 75% reduction target relative to 2014 emissions levels.”

Groups who are concerned about the climate and health impacts of methane pollution issued the following statement:

At a time when we need to move faster on climate, it is disappointing to see Canada tapping the brakes.

Oil and gas is responsible for the largest share of Canada’s emissions, and it is the industry whose emissions are rising fastest. Methane is the least expensive and easiest way to reduce these emissions at scale. It is extremely disappointing to see that Canada is failing to harvest the lowest-hanging fruit.

What’s more, this unnecessary delay will lead to more wasted energy that already totals over $2 billion since the federal methane target was announced, as well as potentially threaten the creation of tens of thousands of jobs in the growing methane mitigation industry.

In 2021, the federal Liberals promised a 75% reduction in oil and gas methane by 2030. After four years of delay in passing the regulation, the government is now proposing yet another five years of delay for its implementation.

It is five years we can’t afford to waste, given the dramatic increase in climate-related impacts such as wildfires, floods and drought, as well as an ever-widening gap between what Canada is doing to address climate change and its fair share of the GHG reductions needed.

Background

After 10 years of global leadership on oil and gas methane, this is Canada’s first major climb down on its efforts to control this pollutant that’s responsible for 30% of emissions that are causing the climate crisis.

The MOU means the federal government is failing to keep up with other jurisdictions on many fronts:

Mere weeks ago, Canada and several allies (e.g., the UK, Japan, Germany and France) agreed to a near-zero oil and gas methane target, “including clear policies to end routine venting and flaring by 2030 and hold operators accountable.” This MOU will likely preclude Canada from meeting this recent commitment.

BC has committed to meet a near-zero emissions standard by 2035.

Major U.S. states like New Mexico (2nd-largest oil producing state, and 4th-largest gas producer) and Colorado (4th-largest oil producing state and 8th-largest gas producer) have had regulations in place for many years that are stronger than Canada’s draft 2030 regulation.

In May 2024, the EU approved new import standards on natural gas for 2030. (This would apply to potential LNG imports from Canada.)

Asian countries including Japan and South Korea have already taken steps to improve supply chain transparency of methane emissions for LNG exporting countries, signaling a preference for low-emission energy.

The Oil and Gas Climate Initiative (OGCI) — comprised of 12 of the world’s largest oil and gas companies that represent more than 40% of global oil and gas production — recommitted, in January 2025, to reducing climate emissions, including by pursuing a near-zero methane emissions by 2030.

And a new Tesla Model ""Y"" averages around $50,000, but the 2024 model can be found for around $30,000.

She said that currently, EVs only account for about 2.5% of the overall used vehicle sales market. But she added that since 2023, 1.1 million EVs have been leased, and many will expire soon.

That surge of expiring leases is bringing used prices down and allowing for big bargains.

""I think it's going to be a huge opportunity and huge growth engine in the next few years,"" she said.

Valdezy-Streaty said wider EV adoption has been hindered by price, battery concerns, and trepidation about an insufficient charging infrastructure.

The Lynas Texas project in limbo exemplifies broader tensions between economic efficiency and strategic autonomy that characterise contemporary critical mineral markets.","Strategic Mining Developments Reshape Critical Mineral Supply Networks

The global rare earth processing landscape undergoes fundamental transformation as geopolitical priorities increasingly override traditional market efficiency considerations. With China maintaining dominance over approximately 60-70% of global rare earth processing capacity according to the International Energy Agency's Critical Minerals Market Review, Western nations face mounting pressure to establish independent supply chains for materials essential to modern defense systems, renewable energy infrastructure, and advanced manufacturing. Furthermore, the establishment of a critical minerals reserve has become a strategic imperative for many nations seeking supply chain independence.

Heavy rare earth elements such as dysprosium and terbium represent particularly critical strategic materials due to their irreplaceable roles in high-temperature permanent magnets, military-grade systems, and aerospace applications. The U.S. Department of Energy's Critical Materials Strategy identifies dysprosium as one of the highest-priority rare earth elements for national security applications, yet domestic processing capability remains virtually nonexistent.

This strategic vulnerability has catalysed unprecedented government intervention in rare earth markets, fundamentally altering competitive dynamics and investment patterns across the sector. The implications extend far beyond individual projects to encompass broader questions about industrial policy coordination, supply chain resilience, and the balance between strategic autonomy and economic efficiency.

Industrial Infrastructure Dependencies Create Strategic Vulnerabilities

The complexity of establishing rare earth processing capabilities in Western markets extends beyond technical challenges to encompass regulatory coordination failures and infrastructure dependencies that create systemic vulnerabilities. These factors have converged to create significant obstacles for foreign operators seeking to establish processing facilities in strategic markets.

Wastewater Treatment Partnership Collapse Exposes Coordination Gaps

The February 2025 withdrawal of Dow Chemical's permit amendment application for wastewater treatment partnership revealed critical weaknesses in U.S. industrial policy implementation. This regulatory setback directly impacted the Lynas Texas project in limbo, as the planned Seadrift facility required Dow's industrial wastewater processing infrastructure to meet environmental compliance standards for Texas operations.

Rare earth processing generates acidic wastewater containing lanthanides and other chemical residues requiring sophisticated treatment protocols including pH neutralisation, rare earth element recovery, and heavy metal removal. The Lynas partnership strategy leveraged existing industrial infrastructure rather than constructing dedicated treatment facilities, reducing capital requirements but creating operational dependencies that proved vulnerable to regulatory shifts.

Critical Timeline Breakdown:

2021-2023: U.S. Department of Defense allocated $288 million in funding to support project development

2024: Offtake agreement negotiations with DoD began experiencing delays

February 2025: Dow Chemical permit withdrawal created regulatory bottleneck

August 2025: CEO Amanda Lacaze signalled project uncertainty in earnings communications

November 2025: Project status remains unlikely to proceed under current conditions

The regulatory infrastructure misalignment exposed fundamental coordination gaps between federal strategic objectives and state-level environmental permitting processes. While DoD funding commitment demonstrated federal support for supply chain diversification, Environmental Protection Agency and Texas state regulatory frameworks created contradictory incentives that undermined project viability.

Government Partnership Preferences Reshape Competitive Landscape

Washington's July 2025 strategic pivot toward MP Materials fundamentally altered rare earth processing competition through unprecedented government support mechanisms. The multibillion-dollar partnership elevated the U.S. government to MP Materials' top shareholder position whilst providing price floor guarantees and $150 million loan commitments for heavy rare earth separation expansion.

Comparative Government Support Analysis:

Company Government Investment Equity Position Production Guarantees Heavy RE Capability MP Materials $150M+ loans Top shareholder Price floor guaranteed Expansion planned Lynas (Texas) $288M DoD funding None Offtake negotiations stalled Primary strategic focus

This support package created asymmetric competitive advantages that foreign operators cannot overcome through market mechanisms alone. MP Materials operates the Mountain Pass facility in California, representing the only active rare earth mining and processing operation in the continental United States, providing both operational experience and domestic political advantages.

The policy preference shift reflects explicit prioritisation of wholly U.S.-based critical minerals infrastructure over foreign partnerships, regardless of comparative operational efficiency or technological maturity. Moreover, recent developments surrounding the critical minerals order have further emphasised the strategic importance of domestic supply chains.

Alternative Supply Chain Architecture Emerges

The stalling of major Western processing projects accelerates development of alternative supply chain configurations that bypass traditional geographic and regulatory constraints. These emerging models demonstrate how market participants adapt strategic approaches when conventional pathways encounter systematic obstacles.

Malaysia-Focused Processing Strategy Gains Momentum

Lynas Corporation's strategic recalibration toward Malaysian operations represents the most viable near-term pathway for maintaining Western supply chain independence. The company's Kuantan facility, operational since 2014, processes Mount Weld concentrate from Western Australia using established solvent extraction technology for both light and heavy rare earth separation.

Operational Advantages of Malaysian Expansion:

Established infrastructure eliminates greenfield capital expenditure risk

Proven regulatory compliance framework reduces permitting timelines

Lower operational costs relative to U.S. industrial wage structures

Existing processing capabilities for dysprosium, terbium, and other strategic elements

CEO Amanda Lacaze indicated in August 2025 earnings communications that the company will prioritise expanding Malaysian processing capacity rather than pursuing unfavourable U.S. arrangements. This approach leverages existing infrastructure investments whilst securing long-term offtake agreements with private-sector customers rather than relying exclusively on government procurement.

The geographic supply chain extends from Mount Weld mining operations in Western Australia through Kuantan processing facilities to end-user markets across Asia, Europe, and North America. While transportation distances to U.S. West Coast ports exceed 6,000 nautical miles, established logistics networks and operational experience provide supply chain reliability advantages over greenfield development projects.

Accelerated Domestic Processing Development Pathways

The Pentagon's increasing focus on supply chain resilience through Defense Logistics Agency strategic materials programmes has catalysed expanded private sector investment in domestic rare earth processing capabilities. Multiple U.S. states have initiated critical minerals processing incentive programmes, including Texas state-level tax incentives, Colorado processing development support, and Wyoming rare earth infrastructure initiatives.

Technology Transfer and Innovation Acceleration:

Venture capital investment in rare earth separation technologies increases following foreign project delays

Defence contractors secure direct rare earth procurement partnerships with domestic suppliers

Research focus shifts toward alternative processing technologies including supercritical fluid extraction and ionic liquid-based separation methods

Recycling technology development gains priority for recovering rare earths from end-of-life permanent magnets and electronics

Defence procurement agencies historically prioritise supply security over cost optimisation, reflecting institutional preferences for vertical integration and domestic control over efficiency considerations. This approach may accelerate domestic processing development by reducing foreign technology dependencies and incentivising proprietary U.S. processing innovations.

Geopolitical Supply Chain Fragmentation Accelerates

The convergence of strategic competition and industrial policy preferences drives fundamental restructuring of global rare earth markets toward regionalised supply chains that prioritise geopolitical alignment over economic optimisation. Consequently, this transformation affects investment flows, technological development priorities, and long-term market structure, particularly as US‑China trade war impacts continue to reshape global commerce.

Regional Bloc Formation Patterns

Critical mineral supply chains increasingly organise around geopolitical spheres rather than purely economic considerations, creating distinct processing and distribution networks aligned with strategic partnerships.

Emerging Regional Configurations:

Western Alliance: Australia-Malaysia-U.S. processing corridor with shared security frameworks

Chinese Integration: Vertically integrated mining-to-magnet supply chain encompassing domestic and partner nation operations

Alternative Partnerships: Saudi Arabia processing arrangements and African mineral development projects create additional supply options

The U.S. government's recent announcement of major processing outsourcing arrangements with Saudi Arabia demonstrates how strategic partnerships extend beyond traditional alliance structures when critical material access requires diversification. These developments suggest that supply chain security considerations now override conventional trade relationship patterns.

Investment Capital Reallocation Dynamics

Capital previously allocated toward cross-border processing partnerships increasingly flows toward domestic champions or alternative technologies that reduce strategic material dependencies. This reallocation affects both public and private investment priorities across the rare earth value chain.

Investment Flow Redirection Indicators:

Government funding consolidates behind domestic operators with equity participation

Private equity and venture capital increase investment in rare earth recycling and alternative separation technologies

Defence contractors develop direct supplier relationships that bypass traditional commodity markets

Sovereign wealth funds prioritise critical mineral assets within allied nation jurisdictions

The investment reallocation reflects broader recognition that rare earth supply chains represent strategic infrastructure requiring long-term planning horizons that exceed typical market-based investment cycles. This approach may reduce short-term efficiency whilst building resilience against supply disruption scenarios.

Investment Strategy Implications for Rare Earth Exposure

Market participants must navigate increasingly complex risk environments where geopolitical considerations fundamentally alter traditional investment evaluation frameworks. The intersection of industrial policy and strategic competition creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities that require sophisticated analysis approaches.

Portfolio Risk Assessment Framework

Direct Investment Considerations:

Lynas Corporation faces strategic pivot requirements following U.S. market access challenges

MP Materials benefits from reduced competition and comprehensive government backing

Downstream manufacturers encounter potential supply chain disruption risks

Alternative technology developers gain strategic importance through government prioritisation

Sector-Wide Risk Evaluation Matrix:

Risk Category Impact Level Mitigation Strategies Supply Disruption High Diversified sourcing, strategic stockpiles Geopolitical Shifts Medium-High Multi-jurisdiction operations Technology Obsolescence Medium R&D investment, recycling capabilities Regulatory Changes High Compliance infrastructure, government relations

The evaluation framework must account for non-market factors including government policy preferences, strategic partnership evolution, and technological development priorities that increasingly influence commercial outcomes. Additionally, developments in energy transition minerals continue to reshape investment priorities across the sector.

Market Psychology and Behavioural Dynamics

Investor sentiment toward rare earth investments reflects broader uncertainty about the balance between strategic autonomy and economic efficiency in critical material markets. Government intervention through equity participation and price guarantees creates market distortions that complicate valuation methodologies whilst potentially reducing private sector risk exposure.

Behavioural Investment Patterns:

Flight to quality favours companies with government backing over technically superior alternatives

Strategic premium valuations emerge for domestic processing capabilities regardless of cost structures

Private sector partnerships with defence contractors command valuation premiums

International operators face systematic valuation discounts despite operational advantages

These psychological factors suggest that traditional fundamental analysis approaches require modification to account for policy preference impacts on competitive positioning and long-term profitability prospects.

Long-Term Strategic Market Evolution

The current period of supply chain restructuring establishes precedents and institutional frameworks that will influence rare earth markets throughout the remainder of the decade and beyond. Understanding these trajectory implications provides essential context for long-term investment planning and policy development.

Industrial Policy Integration with National Security Planning

The Lynas Texas project in limbo experience demonstrates how critical mineral supply chain development increasingly integrates national security planning with industrial policy implementation. This integration creates permanent changes in how government agencies evaluate and support private sector projects in strategic material sectors.

Policy Evolution Indicators:

Expanded use of Defense Production Act authorities for critical mineral infrastructure

Integration of supply chain considerations into defence procurement planning cycles

Increased screening of foreign investment in rare earth and critical mineral sectors

Development of strategic reserves and stockpile management programmes

Future rare earth processing projects will likely face enhanced scrutiny regarding ownership structure, technology transfer implications, and supply chain resilience contributions. This regulatory environment favours domestic operators whilst creating additional compliance requirements for international partnerships.

Technology Development and Innovation Priorities

Supply chain diversification pressures accelerate research and development investment in alternative rare earth processing technologies, recycling capabilities, and substitute materials that reduce strategic dependencies. Government funding priorities increasingly support these innovation pathways as strategic priorities rather than purely commercial ventures.

Innovation Acceleration Areas:

Advanced separation technologies that reduce processing complexity and environmental impact

Recycling systems for permanent magnet and electronics applications

Alternative magnet compositions that reduce heavy rare earth requirements

Supply chain traceability and verification systems for strategic material sourcing

The technological development trajectory suggests that current supply chain challenges may catalyse innovations that fundamentally alter rare earth market structures over longer time horizons. Furthermore, broader trends in mining industry innovation are creating new opportunities for efficiency gains across the sector.

Strategic Landscape Navigation Framework

The resolution of supply chain restructuring challenges will significantly influence global rare earth market development through 2030 and beyond. Market participants require comprehensive analysis frameworks that integrate geopolitical risk assessment with traditional financial evaluation methodologies.

The Lynas Texas project in limbo exemplifies broader tensions between economic efficiency and strategic autonomy that characterise contemporary critical mineral markets. Whilst immediate impacts focus on heavy rare earth processing capacity, longer-term implications encompass fundamental questions about industrial policy coordination and supply chain resilience in strategic material sectors.

Key Strategic Considerations:

Government policy preferences increasingly override pure market efficiency considerations

Supply chain regionalisation creates both opportunities and vulnerabilities for international operators

Technology development acceleration may fundamentally alter market structures within current planning horizons

Investment evaluation frameworks require integration of geopolitical risk assessment with financial analysis

The ultimate resolution of current supply chain challenges will establish precedents that influence critical mineral market development throughout the coming decade. Whether through alternative processing pathways, policy coordination improvements, or technological innovations, the outcome will significantly affect global rare earth market trajectory and investment opportunity structures.

Market participants who successfully navigate this transition period by developing sophisticated risk assessment capabilities and strategic positioning approaches will be best positioned to capitalise on opportunities created by supply chain restructuring whilst avoiding vulnerabilities associated with geopolitical market fragmentation. However, the evolving landscape requires continuous adaptation to changing regulatory frameworks and international partnership dynamics.

Greeting the Mayor were Highview’s CEO Richard Butland and Chairman, Colin Roy, who also welcomed Andrew Western, MP for Stretford and Urmston.

The Carrington plant will deliver 300 MWh of storage and an output of 50 MW for six hours, enough clean, renewable energy to serve 480,000 homes. The facility will connect to existing substation and transmission infrastructure in the local area and will also include a stability island, designed to stabilise the local grid, ensuring energy security against outages and blackouts.

Speaking at the ceremony, Mayor of Greater Manchester, Andy Burnham, said: “Storing renewable power so it’s there when people need it will be essential for Greater Manchester in the years ahead. This project is an important step in that direction, and it’s already supporting jobs and skills in the area through its construction and supply chain. It’s also significant that this is the first development on the Trafford Low Carbon Energy Park, setting the tone for what we hope will become a major centre for clean energy in Greater Manchester.”

Highview’s liquid air energy storage system captures excess renewable energy when demand is low, and stores it as liquid air, for hours, days, or even weeks. When it is needed, the air is expanded to generate electricity, delivering 100% clean, dispatchable power.

Unlike other storage technologies, LAES can operate without degradation for between 40 and 50 years and is fully locatable and modular. It is ideal for firming intermittent renewables, reducing curtailment and supporting the transition from fossil fuels to wind and solar.

Highview last year raised £300 million from the National Wealth Fund, Centrica, and a syndicate of investors including Rio Tinto, Goldman Sachs, KIRKBI and Mosaic Capital to build the plant at Carrington.

Richard Butland, CEO at Highview commented: “This is a hugely important moment for Highview, as we kick-start work on our first LAES facility in Carrington, and we are delighted that Mayor Andy Burnham and Andrew Western MP were with us to mark the occasion. This site is the first in our planned program of energy storage plants across the UK, and we expect the first phase to be up and running by the second half of next year.

BBC News reports that the new EV tax is about half the fuel-duty rate paid by drivers of petrol cars.
There were smaller emissions reductions from underground coalmines, heavy industry, farming and households burning gas for heating and cooking.
However, it adds that the country is not on track for its 2035 goal of cutting emissions by 62-70%.
The Guardian reports that temperatures in Queensland and northern New South Wales will remain up to 8C above average up to next week.","There is widespread UK media coverage of the Labour government’s new budget, which was announced by chancellor Rachel Reeves yesterday. The Guardian reports that electric vehicles will face a 3p-per-mile charge from 2028. According to the newspaper, Reeves “pledged to accelerate the rollout of public EV charging and exemptions from business rates, but disappointed some by not lowering VAT on public charging to meet the domestic rates for electricity”. It adds: “The new EV pay-per-mile charge is expected to raise £1.1bn in 2028-29, rising to £1.9bn in 2030-31. Electric vans, buses and HGVs will not be liable.” Bloomberg reports that, according to the Office for Budget Responsibility, “the change will lead to 440,000 fewer electric car sales over the coming years”. BBC News reports that the new EV tax is about half the fuel-duty rate paid by drivers of petrol cars. The Financial Times reports that fuel duty will increase from September, for the first time in more than 15 years. It says: “Fuel duty, which at present is 52.95p per litre for petrol and diesel, is supposed to rise every year in line with inflation, but the last increase came into effect on January 1 2011 as successive chancellors curried favour with motorists.” (See Carbon Brief’s analysis of the emissions impact of this long-term freeze.)

Bloomberg reports that Reeves is implementing measures to cut annual energy bills by £150 per household on average, by “cutting some green levies that support renewable electricity and abolishing a scheme funding home efficiency upgrades”. The outlet says: “Labour has promised to cut energy bills by £300 over the course of this parliament, banking on renewable generation to provide cheaper energy for the country. Chancellor Rachel Reeves plans to shift 75% of the cost that energy suppliers pay for renewable electricity certificates from customers’ bills to general taxation saving an average of £2.3bn a year, according to Treasury documents.” BusinessGreen reports that Reeves is also scrapping the Energy Company Obligation (ECO) energy efficiency scheme. The Daily Mail quotes Reeves, who said: “[The ECO] costs households £1.7bn a year on their bills and for 97% of families in fuel poverty, the scheme has cost them more than it has saved. It is a failed scheme.” The newspaper adds that Reeves “also increased funding for the warm homes plan by £1.5bn to ensure those households don’t lose out”. Separately, BusinessGreen says: “Green groups warn [the] decision to axe ECO energy efficiency scheme and plans for [the] new pay-per-mile EV levy are sending mixed signals to the green economy.”

The government has released a strategy paper, confirming its intention “ban drilling licences and end offshore exploration in new oil and gas fields in the North Sea”, reports BusinessGreen. The outlet continues: “Published in response to a consultation on the future of the UK’s energy sector, the North Sea Future Plan aims to make good on Labour’s manifesto pledge to halt the issuance of licenses for new oil and gas field, while also confirming an end to new onshore licences in England in support of a commitment to end fracking. The government said the plan would implement the manifesto promise to manage existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan and not issue new licences to explore new oil and gas fields. However, it also confirms the government will allow new drilling that is either in or connected to existing fields.” The Guardian says: “The government hopes that by allowing ‘tie-back’ projects that are linked to existing schemes it can strike a balance between protecting thousands of North Sea jobs and meeting the UK’s climate commitments.” The newspaper adds the government will maintain the windfall tax on oil and gas producers. It says: “Greenpeace said that holding firm on the oil and gas windfall tax, despite fierce industry lobbying, would support the transition to clean energy.” The Financial Times reports that trade group Offshore Energies UK “criticised the government’s decision not to end the windfall tax on oil and gas drillers, which it warned was leading to cuts in investment and jobs”.

MORE ON OIL AND GAS

The Financial Times reports that the National Energy System Operator has warned that there is a risk of gas shortages in the UK, if the UK moves to lower carbon energy “slower than planned”. The newspaper continues: “While supplies were expected to be sufficient to meet demand under normal weather conditions, stress testing for poor conditions had revealed an ‘emerging risk to gas supply security’ in the early 2030s, it said.”

Australia’s greenhouse gas emissions fell by 2.2% last financial year, the Guardian reports. The newspaper continues: “About half of the 9.9m tonnes reduction was due to an increase in solar and wind generation pushing coal-fired power out of the system, according to new government data to be released on Thursday. Pollution from power generation dropped 3.3%, or 5m tonnes, as the proportion of electricity from renewable energy across the year reached more than 40%. It reversed a brief rise in climate pollution from the power sector in the previous year. There were smaller emissions reductions from underground coalmines, heavy industry, farming and households burning gas for heating and cooking. But pollution from transport continued to increase due to greater use of diesel-power vehicles and more people taking domestic flights.” Reuters reports that Australia is on track to cut emissions by 42% from 2005 levels by 2030, in line with the government’s target. However, it adds that the country is not on track for its 2035 goal of cutting emissions by 62-70%. Bloomberg notes that the forecast “doesn’t take into account new action planned under the nation’s net-zero plan”. Agence France-Presse says that climate change and energy minister Chris Bowen told parliament that it was “normal” to have a gap between projections and a decade-long target.

MORE ON AUSTRALIA

Bloomberg reports that Australia is “set to pass a landmark bill that will overhaul its environmental laws” after the Labor government struck a deal to secure support from the Green party. BBC News says: “The changes include more protections for native forests, stricter rules for land clearing and a limit on fast-tracking of coal and gas projects but critics say more is needed.”

Former US secretary of state John Kerry is calling on Australia to “gather the world’s 25 biggest greenhouse gas emitting countries and push them to draw up a roadmap to end the era of fossil fuels” ahead of COP31, the Guardian reports.

Bloomberg says that some parts of Australia are “at risk of elevated [fire] danger after persistently warmer-than-average conditions dried the landscape throughout much of 2025”.

The Guardian reports that temperatures in Queensland and northern New South Wales will remain up to 8C above average up to next week.

Around 200 retail electricity companies across China exited the country’s power market between August and October this year due to increased “regulatory oversight”, business news outlet Jiemian reports, citing calculations by industry outlet BJX News. It notes that interprovincial power transmission and market-based pricing reform for renewables have brought both “new opportunities” and “greater challenges” for power generators, adding that “intense low-price competition among new energy sources has driven electricity prices down”. The outlet quotes an unnamed manager at a private electricity company saying that profitability has “become difficult” for many retailers.

Meanwhile, power news outlet Dianlian Xinmei publishes an article by He Yang, deputy director at the National Energy Administration, on the need for managing “power reliability”, arguing that China’s energy transition means ensuring reliability is a “significant responsibility” and “faces new challenges” requiring “innovative” solutions. It says renewable energy is “characterised by high uncertainty and low controllability”, increasing volatility and “making the supply-demand situation increasingly complex”. China’s data also currently “only covers medium-voltage users”, with only 36% of wind power and 14% of solar power represented in statistics, making it “difficult to accurately reflect” the actual user experience, it adds.

MORE ON CHINA

An article in the print edition of People’s Daily says COP30 “injected confidence and momentum” into climate action. Xinhua says “Xi [Jinping] takes China to [the] forefront of global climate governance.”

The recent trend of Chinese manufacturers building “ever-larger wind turbines” may slow due to insufficient data, lengthy required testing time and challenges transporting blades, Bloomberg reports.

China has banned manufacturing products such as refrigerators or freezers that use certain super-pollutants, including for export, reports Science and Technology Daily.

The UK plans on stockpiling critical minerals widely used in sectors such as electric vehicles (EVs), to reduce its reliance on China, Reuters reports.

Xinhua says China is developing new ways to extract “dispersed” minerals, such as gallium and germanium, from sources such as coal and copper.

Volkswagen says the EVs it makes entirely in China can be “half the cost” of those it makes elsewhere, Financial Times reports. An article in Global Times under the byline “GT Voice” says “protectionist traps” that raise the price of EVs would be “counterproductive” for the EU.

Adam Morton, the Guardian Australia’s climate and environment editor, writes that “the Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation (EPBC) Act changes are an improvement, but the rush to pass them was purely political”. Morton lists benefits of the deal. For example, he says “the creation of a national Environment Protection Agency with the power to enforce compliance and apply beefed-up penalties is a step forward”. He adds: “The commitment to tighten loopholes that made state-sanctioned native forest logging and agricultural land-clearing effectively exempt from national laws is a significant and necessary win for nature…The Greens’ demand that fossil-fuel projects cannot be fast-tracked in the way other developments can – renewable energy and housing, for example – makes obvious sense as far as it goes.” However, he says the new laws “lean heavily on the use of offsets”, noting that these schemes “have repeatedly not delivered anything like what has been promised”. He concludes: “Finally, the laws go close to ignoring what will ultimately be the greatest threat to much of the environment – the climate crisis. Developers will have to disclose their expected emissions, but this information will have no bearing on whether a project goes ahead.”

Experts say that technology and data centers are expected to have massive impacts on the electric grid in the years ahead.
Meanwhile, the government is also warning of potential issues in the future due to data centers.
Meanwhile, environmental advocates see a problem not only for climate change but also for clean air, especially as some data centers use diesel-powered backup generators.","The Trump administration’s data center push is spurring concerns about energy prices and environmental impacts.

The administration has embraced data centers, which house the computers and infrastructure used by tech companies, including for artificial intelligence, as well as the AI they power.

White House officials argue it’s important for the U.S. to win the global “AI race” and outcompete rivals including China in the emerging tech space.

Just this week, President Trump announced a new initiative seeking to expand AI’s use in scientific research. The administration is also considering a move to block “onerous” state-level regulations on AI.

Earlier this year, the administration also floated shielding data centers from environmental impact scrutiny and fast-tracking approvals of the centers and associated energy projects as part of its AI framework.

And they are not alone. Many Democrats and Republicans alike have expressed support for the build-out of data centers, though Democrats have been more likely to back some restrictions on the technology.

Experts say that technology and data centers are expected to have massive impacts on the electric grid in the years ahead.

“Utilities are expecting a lot of this load to land around 2030,” said Ben Hertz-Shargel, who leads research about the electric grid at Wood Mackenzie.

“That is the period when the reliability uncertainty will come to a head, and that’s when things will get tighter. So I think it’s that time frame … of three to five years from now that we’re looking at to start seeing the material cost and potentially reliability impacts of AI demand,” Hertz-Shargel said.

Electricity prices are also relatively high at the moment. In September, electricity prices were about 5.1 percent higher than they were a year ago, outpacing general inflation, which was at 3 percent.

Hertz-Shargel said that prices are currently high for other reasons, including the aging electric grid and extreme weather that creates storm damage.

Meanwhile, the government is also warning of potential issues in the future due to data centers.

An Energy Department report from July said that increasing power demand, including from AI, was increasing risks of blackouts.

The Energy Information Administration, the nation’s independent energy statistics agency, has forecast new highs in electricity usage in 2025 and 2026, saying increases in the commercial sector will be driven “largely by more demand from data centers.”

The Trump administration has argued that data centers can actually help bring down electricity prices over time.

Asked about the issue, a White House official recently told reporters that the additional infrastructure needed to power data centers will ultimately lead to more supply of electricity and power lines, and therefore lower prices in the long term.

Hertz-Shargel said that this can be true in “limited situations” but that overall, data centers are expected to raise prices.

He said that in these limited cases, data centers “consume power when others are not and that does allow better utilization of grid infrastructure, which can, in certain cases, lower energy prices for a certain amount of data center and demand contribution.”

“However, once you get to anywhere near the levels of demand … that are being planned for, you’re way past that regime, and you’re in a regime where now utilities are needed to build much bigger and newer and much more expensive infrastructure, including expensive gas plants … so you’re spending much more money and you’re significantly raising the cost of electricity, both the cost of the electricity itself as a commodity and also the cost of the infrastructure that must be recovered,” he added.

Higher demand, and therefore higher prices, are expected to keep more fossil fuels, particularly coal and natural gas, on the grid for more time. In the case of gas, the increased demand is likely to result in more investment.

“It looks like we have a setback in our climate and decarbonization trajectory here, as we build a lot of new gas plants and some pipeline capacity and drill more. It looks like our emissions are going to go up for a while and old coal plants are being retained on the system,” said Rob Gramlich, founder and president of consulting firm Grid Strategies LLC.

Grid Strategies has recently projected that electricity demand in 2030 could grow massively over the next several years, with 55 percent of the demand increase coming from data centers.

Hertz-Shargel agreed that a data center boom could increase the nation’s planet-warming emissions, particularly through the expansion of gas plants.

“There always was going to be some degree of natural gas build, but it is far greater than it would have been,” he said, noting that there have been “commitments by some of the natural gas turbine manufacturers to increase their production capacity to satisfy this need.”

However, others, including those who are more supportive of data centers, argue that the build-out could make other, lower-emissions technologies such as nuclear energy cheaper and easier to scale in the long run.

“For nuclear to become a really important energy source and help to address climate, it has to scale up, and in order to scale up, it has to get the first reactors built and then start building an order book quickly,” said Robin Gaster, research director at the Information Technology and Innovation Foundation’s center for clean energy innovation. The foundation has received donations from tech companies, among others.

“Data centers can provide the demand that will get nuclear over the hump,” Gaster added.

Meanwhile, environmental advocates see a problem not only for climate change but also for clean air, especially as some data centers use diesel-powered backup generators.

“For these diesel backup generators, it’s very high emissions for soot particulates and sometimes even mercury [and] sulfur dioxide,” Jeremy Fisher, a principal adviser for climate and energy at the Sierra Club, told The Hill last month.

Mercury is a neurotoxin; soot can cause premature death, heart attacks and asthma; and sulfur dioxide can harm the respiratory system.

“No other industry compares with the amount of backup generation that these data centers insist on having on site, so it becomes a very local pollution issue,” Fisher said.

China has a near-monopoly over rare earth mining (70%), refining (85%), and magnet production (90%), creating critical vulnerability for automakers.

Recent export controls by China have caused production disruptions at Ford and inventory depletion across Tier-1 suppliers.

Electric vehicles require 3-5 kg of NdFeB magnets per vehicle, which is 30-50 times more than conventional cars.

94% of EV traction motors still depend on rare earth permanent magnets, even though some automakers are exploring magnet-free alternatives.

A projected 70,000-100,000 tonne NdPr deficit by 2035 is driving automakers to:

Diversify through upstream investments such as the GM-MP Materials partnership.

Pay premiums of 10-30% for non-Chinese supply.

Develop AI-optimized designs that reduce rare earth intensity by 24%.

The global automotive industry is deeply intertwined with rare earth elements (REEs) — from the metals mined out of the ground to the permanent magnets that power modern vehicles. These 17 specialty metals (including neodymium, praseodymium, dysprosium, and terbium) are tiny in volume but outsized in importance. They enable essential components across both electric and conventional vehicles, yet their supply chain is alarmingly concentrated.

Automakers (OEMs) and their Tier-1 suppliers (the companies that make motors, actuators, electronics, and major subsystems) now face a stark reality: China’s near-monopoly over rare earth mining, processing, and magnet production presents a strategic vulnerability. This article summarizes at a high level the industry’s dependence on rare earth-based products, how OEMs and suppliers procure these critical materials, and the risks and responses shaping the road ahead.

Rare Earths in Cars: Essential and Everywhere

Rare earth elements sit quietly behind many features in today’s vehicles. NdFeB rare-earth magnets enable small electric motors that power mirrors, seats, pumps, and sensors. A typical gas or hybrid car contains about 100 grams of REE magnets, scattered across dozens of small systems.

In electric vehicles (EVs), however, magnet demand skyrockets. Each EV typically contains 3–5 kg of NdFeB magnets, largely in the traction motor that converts electricity into motion. As of 2025, an estimated 94% of EV traction motors use permanent-magnet architectures due to their efficiency and power density.

A minority of automakers have introduced magnet-free alternatives:

BMW, Renault: externally excited synchronous motors

Mercedes, Audi: induction motors

Tesla: stated an intention for a next-generation rare-earth-free motor, though the company later clarified that complete elimination of REEs is not guaranteed.

Today, these REE-free systems remain the exception. The vast majority of EVs and hybrids still rely on rare earth magnets — anchoring global automotive growth directly to REE availability.

OEMs and Tier-1 Suppliers: Shared Dependence, Different Roles

OEMs (Ford, GM, Toyota, Volkswagen, etc.) ultimately need REE-based components for their vehicles. Tier-1 suppliers (Bosch, ZF, Denso, BorgWarner, Marelli, Schaeffler) are the ones integrating magnets into motors and electronics. Together, they have long depended on China.

As of 2025:

70% of global REE mining occurs in China

85% of refining capacity sits in China

~90% of REE alloys and magnets are made in China

This dominance delivered low-cost supply for decades. But it also created a single-point-of-failure risk. A senior Toyota North America sourcing executive was quoted in industry accounts saying China could “shut us down in two months.” That comment reflects a pervasive fear among OEMs: Beijing’s policy decisions could halt production in Detroit or Stuttgart.

This fear became real in 2025. When China tightened export rules and licensing requirements for key magnet materials, supply slowed to a trickle. According to Reuters, Ford experienced production disruptions at its Chicago SUV facility due to rare earth magnet shortages — with CEO Jim Farley describing operations as “hand-to-mouth.” Tier-1 suppliers for Hyundai reported that inventories “had already been depleted,” demonstrating how quickly shortages propagate downstream.

Procurement Strategies: From Stockpiling to Supply Chain Re-Engineering

Stockpiling & Non-China Premiums

OEMs and suppliers responded to China’s export controls by:

placing rush orders,

building buffer stocks,

and shifting purchases to Europe or ASEAN even at 10–30% premiums.

Neo Performance Materials’ new Estonia magnet plant — one of the few outside China — reported customer demand “surging overnight.” Industry sources noted that European Tier-1 suppliers, including Schaeffler, were among the early buyers. Some Korean companies say their clients now willingly pay 15–20% more for Vietnamese magnets to avoid Chinese exposure.

Upstream Investments

OEMs are also rebuilding supply chains:

GM + MP Materials: U.S. mine-to-magnet strategy in California and Texas

GM + Vacuumschmelze: additional U.S. magnet facility

Toyota: long-term partnerships with Australian REE projects and reduced-dysprosium magnet formulas

Stellantis/Ford: exploratory REE deals and startup investments

Government Intervention

The U.S. and Australia jointly backed an $8.5 billion package of critical mineral financing and commitments. Europe’s Critical Raw Materials Act is pushing for domestic magnet production. Renault is piloting REE recycling from France’s ~400,000 annual end-of-life vehicles, though recovered volumes remain small for now.

Technology Substitution

Automakers explore:

magnets using less Dy

advanced ferrites

AI-optimized designs cutting REE intensity by ~24%

rare-earth-free motor architectures for mid-2030s mass production

But NdFeB magnets still dominate for performance-critical EV applications.

China’s Near Monopolistic Leverage

China not only dominates mining and processing — it possesses the world’s largest REE reserves and decades of state-directed industrial maturity. In 2010, it cut off exports to Japan. In 2023–2025, it introduced sweeping export licensing rules. Draft rules even signaled extremely low REE-content thresholds for export review.

China also wields price power. It can depress magnet prices to keep foreign competitors unprofitable, stalling new non-Chinese mines and magnet plants. Analysts estimate NdPr needs to sustain $75–$105/kg to incentivize new supply, but China can push prices toward $60/kg to squeeze rivals.

Rising Demand, Looming Shortfalls

Some estimates lead to approximately 70,000 to 100,000-tonne NdPr deficit by 2035, roughly equivalent to China’s entire 2021 output. The IEA notes that even if current global projects succeed, China’s share may only drop to ~60% by 2030 — still overwhelming.

The U.S. could theoretically meet 95% of its magnet REE demand domestically or via allies — but only if complex separation plants, including the uncertain Lynas Texas project, actually come online.

Final Thoughts

As vehicles become high-tech electric machines, automakers must think like high-tech manufacturers securing critical inputs. Rare earths sit at the center of this transformation. For at least the next decade, OEMs and Tier-1 suppliers will be juggling:

diversification,

stockpiling,

upstream investment,

alternative technology development,

and constant geopolitical risk assessment.

The road to electrification runs straight through rare earth territory — and securing these elements is now as important as designing the cars themselves.

Pierson (19.000 dwt) briefly became stranded diagonally across the Detroit River overnight on November 26. Reports are blaming the grounding on strong winds that were disrupting shipping all along the Great Lakes overnight and into today.

Built in 1974, the vessel is part of the ""river class"" of self-unloading bulk freighters operating in the region owned currently by Rand Logistics. At 630 feet (190 meters) in length, the vessel was specifically designed to sail the winding Cuyahoga River.

The vessel loaded 18,000 tons of stone in Windsor, Ontario, Canada, and was heading for Loraine, Ohio, in the United States. CBC reports the vessel attempted to drop anchor on Wednesday evening due to the strong winds to wait out the storm. However, it reports the vessel was dragged down the Detroit River. Around 10:30 p.m. local time, the ship grounded and became stuck in a diagonal position in the river not far from downtown Detroit.

The U.S. Coast Guard reports it was notified around 1:15 a.m. this morning of the incident. It was working with the operators to review a refloating plan. Yesterday, the Coast Guard issued a warning for high winds and waves across the Great Lakes. It reported that the Welland Canal in the east connecting Lake Ontario to Lake Erie had suspended navigation due to the high winds. The canal was expected to reopen this afternoon.

Media reports spotted two tugs alongside the Pierson at midday. CBC reports the ship was freed around noon local time. It was moved to a berth for an inspection. The Coast Guard is saying that low water levels contributed to the grounding.

The reports are highlighting that it was the second grounding in less than a month in the same area of the Detroit River. At the beginning of November, the Canadian vessel Rt. Hon. Paul J. Martin had also attempted to anchor to discharge a sick crewmember. CBC reports that when the vessel tried to get back underway, it was blown off course and grounded.

Working on a Superfund site Tare describes Superfund sites as “extremely sensitive”, and suggests that considerable time and attention is required for an EPC to install a solar project on land with such a designation.
Instead, Tare says that the discovery of asbestos underground, while excavating the site, was a surprise that necessitated the most remedial action.
“I’d never done asbestos cleaning before,” he says, highlighting the relative rarity of unexpected asbestos pollution at a solar site.
The demand for new land for solar projects has also encouraged development of technologies to make better use of land, even water, not considered idea for solar project deployment.","Earlier this month, US independent power producer (IPP) Syncarpha Capital and engineering, procurement and construction (EPC) firm Distributed Energy Infrastructure (DEI) completed construction work at the Acton project on the site, combining 7.1MW of solar PV capacity and a co-located 4.1MW battery energy storage system (BESS).

This week, the project cleared the final milestone, receiving permission from local utility Eversource to enter operation and completing the area’s rehabilitation from chemical plant to polluted brownfield site to renewable energy project.

“Acton has successfully passed witness testing with Eversource for both PV and ESS circuits, and has received permission to operate at full capacity,” Prateek Tare, EVP and founder at DEI tells PV Tech Premium exclusively this week. “As the project begins post-energisation commissioning and testing to achieve substantial completion, we’re proud to have safely and responsibly brought this site back to life.”

The successful transformation of a Superfund site to a functional solar-plus-storage project that is a contributor of major significance to the brownfield power generation industry is good news for the US solar sector, which is aiming to significantly expand its operational capacity in the coming years, and will require far more land, and a far wider variety of land types, in order to realise these goals.

Working on a Superfund site

Tare describes Superfund sites as “extremely sensitive”, and suggests that considerable time and attention is required for an EPC to install a solar project on land with such a designation.

“Generally, projects like these are extremely sensitive,” he says. “They go through years of review before they come to fruition, so they’re sensitive with neighbours, towns and everyone. With Acton, the fact that it was a Superfund site added three or four more parties … specifically for health and safety.”

The presence of these additional parties, which include local authorities such as the Acton town planning board and the federal-level EPA, meant that the process for securing permits for the project was not necessarily more complicated, but more involved, as there were more parties to satisfy prior to the start of construction.

“Generally, for EPC practice, we have a health and safety programme, and then we create a site-specific safety plan and an environment plan for that site,” he explains. “When it comes to Superfund sites like Acton, you’ve got the town planning board, the town conservation board, the town health board, the facility itself, the state—Mass DEP—and then federal—which is EPA—and all their consultants.

“A lot of it is logical—there’s a lot of overlap sometimes in the logic—but they all have their own requirements; one says ‘test the soil every 300 cubic yards’, one will say ‘500 yards’, so you’ve got to go through that whole programme and spend a lot of effort to figure out how you’re going to do the job months and months before you set foot on site.”

Tare ads that DEI worked with “a third party” in addition to the various levels of permitting organisations, to audit the company’s own work and make sure that it was completing work to as high a standard as possible. He says that while construction at the Acton project only took about six months, working on brownfield sites in general, and Superfund sites in particular, can add to the project construction time as working at these sites tends to create more moving parts for an EPC to work through.

“You might not be able to do it at the pace that you do [for] regular greenfield sites,” he explains. “Every agency has the right intent in mind, and obviously they have the plans in place, but there are so many cooks in the kitchen, so to speak, [and] there’s only enough hours in the day to be on top of things to make sure that the project keeps moving because the project has deadlines.”

Responding to the discovery of asbestos

While the Superfund label brings additional complexities for project development, Tare notes that this was not the most challenging aspect of working on the Acton project. Indeed, even pollution stemming from the site’s original use as a chemicals plant was not a significant challenge, as DEI completed testing for poisonous gases in the area “every day”, and found nothing to impede its work.

Instead, Tare says that the discovery of asbestos underground, while excavating the site, was a surprise that necessitated the most remedial action.

“I’d never done asbestos cleaning before,” he says, highlighting the relative rarity of unexpected asbestos pollution at a solar site. “I know what it is … but as an EPC this was my first experience.

“There was a possibility—the documents in our due diligence told us that something could come up eventually—so as soon as we saw there was something here, we had the third party consultants, the testing consultants and the people who make the plan [and] we knew who we were going to go to as soon as something happened.”

Tare goes on to say that responding to the presence of asbestos did not require wholesale reconsideration of the project, but making smaller changes to the placement of electrical components and wires, putting them above ground to eliminate the need for digging into soil contaminated with asbestos to install them.

Also, looking more long-term, this placement removed the need for operations and maintenance (O&M) staff to get close to asbestos-polluted land to complete their work, as they can instead perform routine checks from the relative safety of ground level.

“Generally you try to design your way around [the challenges],” he says. “Once you have built the plant, your disturbance activities are done … so for this project we put everything above ground and put our wires in such a way that everything is above ground and visible to the O&M folks, the ones who are going to maintain this facility for 20-30 years.”

“Here, because there was no gas issue—it was a physical material issue—material selection wasn’t a big deal. We were designing for mostly above ground, you’re designing for a code and an engineering standard for that, but the pollution-specific point wasn’t an issue.”

Tare points out that actually removing the asbestos, to the point where planned work could continue, took just three days, compared to “six or seven months” to get the plans approved by all of the various stakeholders and government authorities involved in permitting the project, showing how the discovery of asbestos created a greater bureaucratic challenge than a purely engineering one.

Conversely, he notes that dealing with “abandoned buildings” at the site proved to be a greater engineering challenge than dealing with the asbestos. While the buildings themselves had been removed, many of their underground foundations remained in place, limiting the options for the deployment of components that had to be buried underground, such as racking units.

The appeal of brownfield sites

Ultimately, DEI’s work can largely be considered a success. The project has reached commercial operation, and despite delays in the construction work caused by the asbestos issue, Tare notes that Eversource gave the company a fairly “broad” timeline in which to connect the project to the grid, meaning that these delays were not critical to the project’s operation.

This success raises a question, then, as to whether other brownfield sites, and even Superfund sites, should be considered appropriate land for new solar PV installations as the US looks to dramatically increase its operational solar capacity. The trade body, the Solar Energy Industries Association (SEIA), expects the US to add 246GW of new capacity between 2025 and 2030, meaning more land will need to be given over to solar deployments.

The demand for new land for solar projects has also encouraged development of technologies to make better use of land, even water, not considered idea for solar project deployment. In August, Noria started construction at the first US floating PV (FPV) project to use trackers, as developers look to install solar capacity on water as well as land, and in September, Sol Systems completed construction at an agrivoltaics (agriPV) project in Illinois, with agriPV emerging as an efficient way to deploy PV projects without compromising other land uses.

“Superfund sites, landfills [and] brownfields have been around … for a long while, because everyone is trying to make use of land that is unusable,” explains Tare, suggesting that the growing demand for solar capacity will require the deployment of solar projects on a greater range of land types, including brownfield and Superfund sites.

However, he notes that there are likely to be “commercial risks” associated with deployments on brownfield sites that are absent in other project types, as it will cost a developer time and money to dig into an area such as a landfill to properly assess the construction risks present at the site.

“The risks are on the developer, which is there on any project, but [is] a bit more nuanced with these brownfield sites, as you’re not working with virgin land so you’re potentially going to find stuff at the project,” says Tare. “That’s why they take so much longer to perform [inspection] too.”

Yet there is cause for optimism, as the demand for new solar projects, and the fact that, according to Tare, brownfield developments neatly sidestep some of the local opposition that can hamper greenfield developments, could generate waves of support for a new generation of solar projects.

“The good thing is that everyone wants to use the sites,” he says. “[We don’t have] some of the constraints that we have with regular farmland or sites in a town, as people generally don’t come up and say: ‘Hey, don’t take this land away!’",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/prateek-tare-headshot.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 18:01:30.035784

If nuclear projects fall behind schedule, gas will fill the gap, the Pembina report says.
The existing Ontario nuclear fleet uses Canadian uranium, but the new SMRs rely on a source elsewhere, likely the US and possibly Europe.
Pickup says wind, solar and battery storage can be built in a few years while nuclear projects often take more than a decade.
Pickup says if nuclear projects are delayed and gas usage continues to rise, Ontario will struggle to cut emissions fast enough.","“Electricity is hugely important across society and in everyone’s homes. The cost and affordability is so critical in energy,” Pickup said. “The Ontario government actually says ‘affordability first’ in their own plan, which is why it is confusing to us that there is such a big bet on nuclear projects, which today are already significantly more expensive than other options such as wind and solar.”

The Pembina report warns Ontario is “making quite a risky bet” by leaning on natural gas in the short term and new nuclear in the long term, while missing low-cost opportunities in wind, solar and energy storage.

Delays and higher costs

According to the Pembina analysis of nuclear projects worldwide, new developments have been finished an average of six years late and at double their original cost. If Ontario follows that trend, the Darlington small modular reactors (SMRs) could be delayed from 2036 to 2042 and cost more than $40 billion, instead of $20.9 billion.

“When you put that much stock in an expensive technology that also has delivery risk, the question becomes whether that is something you should be relying on for 70 per cent of your system in 2050,” Pickup told Canada’s National Observer. “To be clear, if you build a technology that delivers expensive energy, that will increase bills.”

Ontario currently gets about half its power from nuclear, about one quarter from hydro, roughly 16 per cent from gas, nine per cent from wind and just over two per cent from solar.

Electricity prices in Ontario have already risen 29 per cent this year, partly tied to nuclear spending.

More dependence on US gas

Ontario relies heavily on imported gas, with about 70 per cent coming from the US and the rest flowing through pipelines from Alberta.

“Cheaper US gas means one of the Canadian pipelines (TCMainline) runs at around half its capacity. This leaves Ontario with a difficult decision if it increases gas use to meet short-term electricity needs,” the report says. “It can either import more gas from the US, which risks energy security during a time of uncertain trade relations, or increase the flow through the Canadian pipeline, which would raise costs for consumers and industry.”

Greater use of gas also brings more price volatility because gas costs swing with global markets.

If nuclear projects fall behind schedule, gas will fill the gap, the Pembina report says. That would raise emissions and extend dependence on imported fuel. In a worst-case scenario, Ontario could still be using as much gas in 2050 as it does in 2030.

The existing Ontario nuclear fleet uses Canadian uranium, but the new SMRs rely on a source elsewhere, likely the US and possibly Europe. “We are essentially locking in for 60 plus years importing fuel to power our growth and power the province’s economic engines,” Pickup said.

Missed chances on renewables

The Pembina analysis says Ontario is overlooking major chances to expand low-cost renewables. Solar costs have fallen 88 per cent since 2009 and wind costs have dropped 74 per cent, it added.

Pickup says wind, solar and battery storage can be built in a few years while nuclear projects often take more than a decade. He also says renewables strengthen energy independence because they do not rely on imported fuel.

“You compare that to something like wind and solar where, yes, you do have to import the technology, but then the systems are going to run for 30 plus years without any imports of any fuel,” he said.

The province’s plan says the role of renewables will grow over time. Starting in 2025, Ontario will add nearly 3,000 megawatts of energy storage.

The government plan argues nuclear power is more cost-effective and land-efficient than wind and solar, but analysis from the Ontario Clean Air Alliance says solar does not need large areas of land. More than half of Toronto’s electricity needs could be met with rooftop and parking lot solar alone.

Studies show electricity from new nuclear reactors could cost up to eight times more than onshore wind, almost six times more than solar and about 2.7 times more than offshore wind in the Great Lakes.

Pickup says if nuclear projects are delayed and gas usage continues to rise, Ontario will struggle to cut emissions fast enough.

The Pembina report recommends opening the door to more private sector investment in clean power.

The scene raised a question back home in California: Why did Newsom recently veto climate solutions that would have made electricity cleaner and more affordable for Californians?

For decades, California has shown the world that states and regions can drive climate and economic progress, even when national governments lag.

Now the world’s fourth-largest economy, our state has paired consistent cuts in emissions with sustained economic growth and set a standard for clean car rules that is copied worldwide. It also built the nation’s first economy-wide “Cap and Invest” program, the cap-and-trade energy credit program recently reformed and extended under Newsom’s watch.

Yet as the climate crisis escalates, even that legacy faces scrutiny. While Newsom was preparing for COP30, his administration was delaying or diluting key domestic reforms and quietly expanding in-state oil and gas drilling.

In Brazil, Newsom urged fellow Democrats to start framing climate as an affordability issue — of course, it is. This rhetoric earned him praise abroad.

But Newsom has balked at several recent opportunities to address climate and cost-of-living challenges together.

Just weeks ago, the governor vetoed three bipartisan bills that would have advanced virtual power plants, which are systems that deliver clean power back to the electrical grid during peak hours by aggregating power from devices many of us already have in our homes — such as smart thermostats, rooftop solar panels, home and electric vehicle batteries and electric heat pumps.

Managing strain on the grid with virtual power plants helps avoid blackouts, reduces reliance on gas powered plants and saves electricity customers money on their utility bills, including those not participating in a virtual power plant program.

One recent study predicted virtual power plants could save Californians up to $13.7 billion on electricity over the next five years. That is the kind of climate-forward and affordability-focused policy that California voters and global climate champions want.

But all three bills were doomed because investor-owned utilities like PG&E continue to work against local-scale electricity solutions like virtual power plants, and they know they can count on Newsom as an ally.

It’s time for Newsom to start treating climate like a winning issue here in California — not just on the international stage in the lead-up to the 2028 presidential race. Investing in solutions like virtual power plants creates jobs, lowers electricity bills and builds resilience to wildfires and floods.

Californians pay twice the national average for electricity and yet still endure frequent planned blackouts. We want solutions that work, protect our families and save money, and we want our governor to champion them.

Newsom is right to emphasize affordability as a pillar of climate progress, creating further contrast between himself and President Donald Trump. That’s good politics and good policy — but it’s also puzzling when his administration vetoes the most cost-effective clean energy solutions available today.

After his time in Brazil, Newsom needs more than rhetoric to cement his legacy as a true climate champion. In his final months as governor, he should advance policies that combat the climate crisis and economic relief to hardworking Californians. Here are two ways he can show the world how to tackle climate change while lowering the cost of living.

First, knock down state barriers to local, clean, affordable energy. Newsom must stop deferring to corporate utilities like PG&E and mobilize the state to support rooftop solar, virtual power plants and other clean, decentralized electricity solutions.

Second, eliminate fossil fuel subsidies and make corporate polluters pay for climate disasters. California hands billions to the oil and gas industry while communities bear the costs of extreme weather and fossil fuel pollution. Making polluters pay their fair share would help finance the transition to a cleaner economy, improve public health and take the burden off taxpayers.

These solutions can be replicated around the world. And, thanks to Newsom’s strong showing in Brazil, the world will be watching.",https://smdp.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/21/2025/08/unnamed-92.webp,N,,2025-11-27 17:01:12.920767

Why the Offshore Wind Energy Market Is Gaining Momentum

As the world intensifies its efforts to shift toward sustainable energy systems, offshore wind energy is emerging as a cornerstone of the global clean-power transition. With stronger and more consistent wind speeds offshore compared with onshore sites, wind farms at sea can deliver high-capacity electricity generation to support rising demand, while cutting greenhouse gas emissions and reducing dependence on fossil fuels.

The Offshore Wind Energy Market as defined by Acumen Research And Consulting encompasses installation of wind turbines offshore — in seas or oceans — along with all associated infrastructure. The increasing appetite for renewable power, climate-change commitments, and technological improvements make offshore wind an attractive and increasingly viable option for governments, utilities, and investors worldwide.

Offshore Wind Energy Market Size & Growth Forecast

According to the Acumen Research And Consulting report, the global Offshore Wind Energy Market was valued at approximately USD 29 billion in 2021.

Looking ahead, the offshore wind energy market is forecast to expand to USD 137 billion by 2030 — reflecting a robust compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 19% over 2022-2030.

This offshore wind energy market growth trajectory points to a dramatic shift: from a relatively modest offshore wind sector to a multi-billion-dollar global industry — capable of delivering large-scale clean energy and transforming how electricity is produced and supplied.

What's Driving the Offshore Wind Energy Market Surge: Key Market Drivers

1. Rising Global Demand for Renewable Energy

With mounting concerns over climate change, pollution, and energy security, countries worldwide are accelerating their transition away from fossil fuels — boosting demand for renewable energy. Offshore wind — with its high yield and lower intermittency compared to some renewables — is becoming an integral strategy in national energy plans. The ARC report identifies ""growing investments in renewable energy"" and ""increasing global demand for renewable sources in power generation"" as primary growth drivers.

Government policies — including clean-energy targets, favorable regulation, tax credit schemes, and investment incentives — further support offshore wind deployment globally.

2. Technological Advancements in Wind Turbines & Infrastructure

Technological progress is playing a decisive role in making offshore wind more competitive. Advances in turbine design — larger rotor diameters, higher capacity units, better blades and foundations — increase energy output per installation, improve reliability, and lower levelized cost of electricity (LCoE). These improvements make offshore wind projects financially and operationally more feasible than ever before.

Furthermore, fixed-structure installations remain popular due to their lower cost and relative ease of deployment — an advantage in many shallow-water coastal regions. According to Acumen Research and Consulting, fixed-structure installations generated significant revenue in 2021 and are likely to continue dominating in the near term.

3. Deepening Investments and Capital Flows

As offshore wind becomes more attractive, both public and private investors are channeling capital into large-scale projects. This surge in funding — supported by favorable policies and long-term demand signals — is allowing for more projects to move from planning to execution, thereby accelerating capacity build-out. The growing number of planned wind farms, backed by credible funding and supply-chain momentum, feed directly into market growth and optimism.

4. Energy Transition & Decarbonization Agendas Worldwide

Countries adopting aggressive decarbonization targets see offshore wind as a key enabler to meet clean energy quotas while ensuring stable and scalable power supply. As coal and conventional thermal power phase out, offshore wind offers a powerful, renewable alternative — attracting attention from utilities, governments, and large enterprises.

Offshore Wind Energy Market Segments: Where Growth is Concentrated

By Water Depth & Installation Type

• In 2021, the ""up to 30 m water depth"" segment accounted for over 70% of the total offshore wind energy market share.

• Fixed-structure installations — typically suitable for shallower waters — generated notable revenue in 2021 and are expected to remain dominant through much of the forecast period owing to relative cost-effectiveness and simpler logistics.

These data suggest that many of the near-term growth opportunities lie in shallow-water coastal regions — especially in countries and geographies where coastline geography, economic viability, and regulatory frameworks align.

That said, as technology evolves — including floating foundations and deeper water-capable turbines — offshore wind could gradually expand into deeper water zones, opening up new geographies and vastly increasing potential capacity.

By Geography / Region

• Europe: In 2021, Europe held over 40% of the global offshore wind energy market share — making it the leading regional hub for offshore wind deployment.

• Asia-Pacific: This region is expected to record the fastest growth rate over the forecast period (2022-2030), driven by rising energy demand, expanding renewable capacity targets, and coastal geographies conducive to offshore wind deployment.

• North America, Latin America, Middle East & Africa: While these regions currently have smaller shares compared to Europe and Asia-Pacific, planned projects and evolving energy policies suggest emerging opportunities for growth as coastal jurisdictions look to diversify energy mix.

Opportunities & Market Potential: What's Next

According to the ARC analysis, several key opportunities could shape the trajectory of the offshore wind energy market in the coming years.

• Shallow-water coastal projects: Given the dominance of the up-to-30 m water depth segment, many countries with accessible shallow water near coasts stand to gain quickly from offshore wind deployment.

• Emerging economies: Rapidly industrializing regions with growing energy demand — especially in Asia-Pacific — are likely to invest heavily in offshore wind infrastructure, presenting significant growth potential.

• Advances toward deeper-water & floating offshore wind: While fixed structures will dominate in the near term, technological advances (floating platforms, deep-water foundations) may open up new areas for deployment — dramatically increasing the total addressable market.

• Integration with grid expansion and storage solutions: As offshore wind capacity scales up, integrating with transmission grids, energy storage, and hybrid clean-energy systems will unlock further value and reliability.

• Expanding supply chains and industrial ecosystems: Growth of offshore wind will spur demand across turbine manufacturing, foundation construction, cable manufacturing, installation services and maintenance — creating a robust value chain across jurisdictions.

Challenges & Constraints — What Could Slow Growth

Even with strong growth forecasts, the offshore wind energy market faces several headwinds:

• High Capital Expenditure & Logistic Complexities: Offshore wind projects require significant upfront investment — turbine fabrication, foundation installation, specialized vessels, cabling, grid integration — which can make capital costs high, and project execution complex, especially in remote or deep-water sites. This remains a restraint.

• Competition from Other Renewables & Energy Sources: Onshore wind, solar photovoltaics, and other renewables — which often involve lower initial costs and simpler logistics — remain competitive alternatives. In regions where renewables are mature, offshore wind may need additional incentives or policy support to justify deployment.

• Regulatory, Permitting & Environmental Challenges: Marine regulations, environmental impact assessments, coastal zoning, public opposition, and ecosystem concerns (e.g., marine life impact, noise, seabed disruption) can delay or constrain projects. Implementation complexity is nontrivial.

• Supply-Chain & Infrastructure Readiness: Manufacturing turbines, foundations, cables and deploying installation vessels — all require mature supply chains and skilled labour. In regions lacking this, scaling may be slow.

• Grid Integration & Transmission Infrastructure Needs: Offshore wind farms must be connected to onshore grids via high-capacity undersea cables and substations. Building this requires coordination with grid operators, regulatory entities, and often large-scale investment — creating logistic and financial complexity.

Key Trends Shaping Offshore Wind Energy Market Dynamics

• Accelerated Turbine Technology Innovation

Driven by demand for greater energy yield and cost-effectiveness, turbine technology is evolving at pace. Larger rotor diameters, stronger blades, advanced foundations (monopile, jacket, floating), and improved installation techniques are boosting energy output per turbine — making offshore wind increasingly competitive.

As towers, blades and support structures scale up, engineering and design innovations (including AI-driven optimization) are gaining importance to ensure structural integrity, longevity and performance — especially in harsher marine environments.

• Rising Investments & Policy Support, Especially in Asia-Pacific & Europe

Europe — currently the leader in offshore wind energy market — continues to invest heavily, underpinned by clear regulatory frameworks, ambitious renewable targets, and mature supply chains. Meanwhile, Asia-Pacific is poised for rapid growth, driven by rising energy demand, growing coastal populations and strong government commitments to diversify energy mix and reduce carbon emissions.

New investments are also flowing into supporting infrastructure — foundations, cables, turbines manufacturing — expanding supply-chain capacity and improving economics for new projects.

• Expansion Beyond Shallow Water — Deeper Water & Floating Platforms

While fixed-structure installations in up-to-30 m water depth dominate today, interest is growing in deploying offshore wind farms in deeper waters — enabled by floating platforms and advanced foundation design. These would open up vast new coastal and offshore zones previously unsuitable for fixed installations, expanding the potential deployment geography.

• Growing Integration with Grid Infrastructure & Hybrid Energy Systems

As offshore wind capacity scales up, integrating generation with onshore grids becomes vital. This includes undersea cables, substations, grid upgrades, and potentially coupling with energy storage or other renewables (like solar) for hybrid energy systems — enhancing stability and flexibility of clean power supply.

• Multi-Stakeholder Collaboration & Global Supply-Chain Development

Offshore wind requires coordination across manufacturers, utilities, governments, financing institutions, installation and maintenance providers. As supply chains mature globally — from turbine manufacturing to cable production to installation vessels — offshore wind deployment could accelerate further, driven by efficiency gains and cost reductions.

Why Offshore Wind Growth Matters Globally

The expansion of the Offshore Wind Energy Market has far-reaching implications, beyond just energy generation:

• Accelerating Global Energy Transition: Scaling offshore wind can help countries diversify away from fossil fuels, reduce carbon emissions, and meet climate-change targets — supporting global commitments under international agreements.

• Strengthening Energy Security and Resilience: Offshore wind adds significant generation capacity, reduces dependence on imported fossil fuels, and can complement other renewables — enhancing energy supply stability.

• Economic Growth & Job Creation: Building offshore wind farms, manufacturing turbines and infrastructure, deploying installation vessels, and operating maintenance fleets create employment opportunities and stimulate industrial growth across sectors.

• Enabling Clean Growth for Coastal Nations: Countries with extensive coastlines — even those lacking fossil-fuel resources — can leverage offshore wind for sustainable development, providing clean energy for domestic use or even export.

• Innovation and Technological Advancement: The challenges of offshore wind — marine environment, deep water, turbine scaling — are driving innovation in engineering, materials, design, AI-driven optimization, and offshore construction techniques. These innovations may have spillover benefits for other marine and energy sectors.

The Offshore Wind Market is Poised for a Transformative Decade

The latest analysis from Acumen Research and Consulting suggests a compelling narrative: the Offshore Wind Energy Market is not just growing — it's on the cusp of a major transformation. From USD 29 billion in 2021 to a projected USD 137 billion by 2030, the sector stands to play a pivotal role in the global transition to sustainable energy.

This growth is underpinned by multiple reinforcing factors — rising demand for clean energy, favorable policies, technological progress, and expanding investments. As offshore wind moves beyond shallow-water, fixed-structure installations to deeper-water and potentially floating platforms; as supply chains mature; and as global collaboration intensifies — the potential for offshore wind to reshape energy systems is huge.

However, realizing this potential is not automatic. It requires continued investment, regulatory support, supply-chain development, public acceptance, and technological innovation. The interplay of these factors will determine whether offshore wind remains a niche renewable source or becomes a core pillar of global power generation.

“The electricity-infrastructure-related elements of today’s energy deal could also be significant if done right.
“Indeed, Alberta would also benefit, perhaps even disproportionately, from doubling down on a clean energy future.
And until recently, Alberta led Canada and much of North America in attracting renewable investment.","TORONTO — Rachel Doran, executive director at Clean Energy Canada, made the following statement in response to the Canada-Alberta Memorandum of Understanding regarding a new energy deal:

“Today’s MOU with Alberta will require the federal government to negotiate firmly in the months ahead. Canada must work diligently to ensure it is not trading future climate promises that, as history suggests, could be reneged on in exchange for higher oil- and gas-related emissions today.

“Prime Minister Carney’s government risks trading certainty for expediency as it puts regulations with hard pollution limits—in this case, the Clean Electricity Regulations, oil and gas emissions cap, and methane regulations—on the negotiating table with provinces.

“Alberta had already agreed to increase its industrial carbon price by the terms of its last negotiation with Canada in 2018 in exchange for the Trans Mountain Expansion Project, so while today’s agreement does have some potential for good negotiated outcomes, it risks fundamentally undermining the durability of key federal regulations. If one province can be granted an exemption, any province can.

“Canadians should ensure that Prime Minister Carney holds firm on his statement that private proponents will shoulder the cost of any future pipeline in Canada. Going forward, the world will be using less and less oil after 2030, according to the International Energy Agency. Canada should therefore be putting public dollars toward the industries that will be growing, rather than those set to shrink. Globally, investment in clean energy has accelerated, and spending on renewable power, grids, and storage is now higher than total spending on oil, gas, and coal. The world now invests twice as much in clean energy as it does in fossil fuels.

“We were, however, cautiously optimistic to see potential in a number of key climate commitments integrated as part of this deal and the near-term timelines on which these need to come into effect.

“Alberta’s pledge to increase its industrial carbon price to $130/tonne could be a meaningful one, as that price would be higher than the federal backstop price currently scheduled to kick in next year ($110/tonne), but only if Alberta also works in good faith to address issues around stringency and helps ensure the market price of credits also rises. This also needs to be supported by the even bigger opportunity that a more unified industrial carbon market across Canada represents, something the federal government has promised to explore, and one that Alberta has an opportunity to lead.

“Given the importance of clean electricity to Canada’s economic future and the risk of setting a dangerous precedent where provinces can opt out of Canada’s climate regulations as they please, any deal related to the implementation of Canada’s clean electricity regulations in Alberta must be in the form of an equivalency agreement and not a provincial carveout.

“The electricity-infrastructure-related elements of today’s energy deal could also be significant if done right. Transmission interties from B.C. to Saskatchewan and a commitment to building thousands more megawatts of power could be the nation-building project Canadians have been waiting for, simultaneously building on Canada’s clean energy advantage, enhancing energy security, and lowering energy bills for Canadian households. But these new megawatts must be clean, leveraging the complementary renewables strengths and lowest-cost power sources that are already being deployed in B.C. and Alberta today—hydro, solar, and wind plus battery storage—as opposed to waiting on a future nuclear strategy that might add higher-cost power resources someday.

“Indeed, Alberta would also benefit, perhaps even disproportionately, from doubling down on a clean energy future. Modelling has shown that Alberta’s clean energy sector would be the fastest growing of any province or territory in Canada, with jobs increasing 10% every year in a net-zero future. And until recently, Alberta led Canada and much of North America in attracting renewable investment. But as a result of a moratorium and new restrictive regulations on renewables, the province has fallen to the bottom of the list in Canada on clean energy procurements, losing out on some 11 gigawatts of clean power (an amount that exceeds Alberta’s average total power demand) and tens of millions in community tax revenue.

“As negotiations on the implementation details of this MOU proceed in the coming months, Canada must keep both history and the future in mind. That means learning lessons from our past while aligning Canada with where the world is headed. It means shaping Canada into a lasting energy superpower, not just putting out the political fires of today.”",https://cleanenergycanada.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/52619404292_b82af6d790_k.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 18:01:13.598429

Until trading volume recovers significantly and large-scale investors demonstrate conviction, this recent rally remains on an unstable foundation.","A double-digit percentage surge might typically signal a powerful market breakthrough, but investors should view Wolfspeed's recent 10% climb with a heavy dose of skepticism. The impressive price action is starkly contradicted by a dramatic collapse in trading volume, which has plummeted to a level approximately 90% below its average. This divergence raises a critical question for market participants: is this the dawn of a genuine recovery, or a potential trap for retail investors as professional money remains on the sidelines?

The catalyst for this upward move appears to be a newly announced strategic shift from the company's leadership. CEO Robert Feurle aims to reduce Wolfspeed's risky dependence on the currently struggling electric vehicle (EV) sector. The new direction involves a push to expand the application of its silicon carbide technology into aviation, industrial infrastructure, and, most notably, the data centers that power artificial intelligence.

This vision has acted as a wake-up call, prompting a reassessment of the company's potential beyond automotive. However, the extremely thin trading volume suggests this is a period of high volatility rather than a phase of sustained accumulation by institutional investors. The market, it seems, is not yet fully convinced by this new strategy.

Financial Health Paints a Sobering Picture

The fundamental reality of Wolfspeed's finances stands in harsh contrast to the current price enthusiasm. Quarterly results released in October confirmed ongoing unprofitability, with a loss of $0.63 per share. While this figure slightly surpassed more pessimistic forecasts, the core issue of cash burn remains unresolved.

To ensure its survival and fund ambitious expansion plans, the company has secured a crucial $1.5 billion in liquidity through two key channels:

* A $750 million grant awarded under the U.S. ""CHIPS and Science Act.""

* An additional $750 million in private financing from a consortium led by Apollo Global Management.

Should investors sell immediately? Or is it worth buying Wolfspeed?

This capital is vital for expanding manufacturing facilities in New York and North Carolina—the John Palmour Manufacturing Center—and for financing the technological transition to more efficient 200mm wafers. Concurrently, the company is shuttering its older 150mm production line in Durham, a clear cost-cutting measure.

Analysts Forecast Significant Downside

The gap between the current share price and the consensus view of market experts is substantial. While the stock trades near $19.39, the average analyst price target sits at a stark $10.50. The prevailing recommendation is clearly to ""Reduce,"" with many observers considering the equity to be severely overvalued at present levels.

Amid the prevailing pessimism, one notable voice offers a contrasting perspective. Susquehanna maintains a ""Neutral"" rating with a $30.00 price target, implying significant potential upside. Conversely, critics like Weiss Ratings steadfastly hold a ""Sell"" recommendation. With a negative Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of -31, the company's valuation is currently supported by hope rather than concrete financial performance.

Key Data Summary:

* Price Movement: Shares advanced to approximately $19.39, reflecting a gain between 7.4% and 10.1% in a single session.

* Cautionary Signal: Trading volume registered about 90% below its historical average.

* Valuation Risk: The consensus analyst target indicates a nearly 50% downside risk.

* Financial Standing: A $1.5 billion funding package has temporarily secured the company's liquidity.

US Tariffs Shift Auto Investment Away from Mexico

Mexico is unlikely to attract new automotive investment in the short term as US tariff policies continue redirecting capital and production capacity, according to Guido Vildozo, senior manager and associate director, S&P Global Mobility. Speaking at the AMDA Automotive Forum 2025, Vildozo said the United States has secured US$50 billion in new automotive investment over an 11-month period following tariff implementation, compared to the US$40 billion Mexico captured over the past decade.

Ford Boosts After-Sales Service with 49 New Mexico Technicians

Ford has expanded its investment in Mexican talent development, as Ford de México confirmed the graduation of 49 new master technicians—an initiative aligned with its long-term strategy to strengthen after-sales operations and customer service performance. The announcement follows the commitment made during its 100th anniversary in Mexico to channel resources toward human capital and productivity-focused growth.

FOTON Unveils US$65 Million Mexico Expansion

FOTON will invest MX$1,200 million (US$65 million) in Mexico by 2026 through the opening of a third assembly plant and the expansion of its two existing facilities, according to company executives. The manufacturer confirmed that the new operation will begin in January in Tlajomulco de Zuñiga, Jalisco, where it will assemble Tunland pickups for the domestic and Latin American markets.

UAW Seeks Import Quotas, Citing USMCA Impact on Jobs

The United Auto Workers (UAW) union has formally asked the Office of the United States Trade Representative (USTR) to impose import quotas on light vehicles as part of the ongoing USMCA review. The proposal seeks to cap the number of foreign-made units entering the US market and redirect automotive production back to domestic facilities. The union argues that the current trade framework enables excessive import reliance and limits economic gains for US workers and manufacturers.

Nissan Recasts Communication as Key to Global Strategy

Nissan is reframing communication as a core strategic function that informs corporate decisions, strengthens internal alignment and guides product development across its global operations.

Mexico Hit by Blockade as Carriers, Producers Protest Security

Organizations representing freight carriers and agricultural producers will stage a coordinated national blockade on Nov. 24, targeting major highways and customs facilities across Mexico. The National Association of Carriers (ANTAC) said the action responds to growing security concerns, stating that members face “insecurity on the roads, extortion, and deteriorated federal and state routes.”

Toyota Hits 200,000 Hybrid Sales in Mexico Amid HEV Surge

Toyota has reached 200,000 hybrid electric vehicle (HEV) sales in Mexico. The company said the milestone comes 14 months after surpassing 150,000 HEVs in September 2024, reflecting sales of nearly 50,000 hybrids during that period.

Ford Warns of Growing Shortage of Skilled Auto Mechanics

Ford is warning of a deepening shortage of skilled labor in manufacturing, placing workforce availability at the center of its operational concerns. The company reports 5,000 open mechanic positions in the United States—roles that remain unfilled even though some dealers have salaries of up to US$120,000. This figure was confirmed by CEO Jim Farley during an interview on the podcast Office Hours: Business Edition, where he described the structural labor pressure facing the sector.

Tesla Says Musk Pay Ruling Could Hit Earnings for Years

Tesla is facing a potentially multi-year impact on its reported earnings as the Delaware Supreme Court weighs whether to reinstate or permanently void CEO Elon Musk’s 2018 compensation package. If Tesla loses the appeal, the company will be required to recognize a replacement stock-based compensation plan valued between US$23.7 billion and US$26 billion, according to company filings and independent financial analyses. The accounting charge would be recognized over multiple quarters and could push Tesla’s GAAP earnings into negative territory through mid-2027.

Toyota Starts Battery Production at US$14 Billion NC Plant

Toyota has begun battery production at its new US$14 billion facility in Liberty, North Carolina, marking its first battery plant outside Japan and its eleventh manufacturing site in the United States. The company said the project will create up to 5,100 jobs and serve as a core hub for lithium-ion battery development for its hybrid, plug-in hybrid, and battery-electric vehicle lineup. Toyota also announced an additional investment of up to US$10 billion over the next five years to support future mobility programs in the United States, bringing its total historical investment in the country to nearly US$60 billion.

Chinese Truck Manufacturers Rush Mexico Strategy on Tariff Fears

Chinese truck manufacturers operating in Mexico are accelerating local strategies as they brace for a possible import tariff of up to 50% on vehicles from countries without trade agreements. The proposal has not clarified whether it will apply to trucks, tractors or buses, but companies expect broad coverage. Several manufacturers have begun talks with authorities, adjusted investment plans or fast-tracked facility construction to offset potential cost increases.

Click here to subscribe to Shift Storm and get the latest updates straight to your inbox as soon as they come out.

In a recent speech, prime minister Mark Carney promised that the federal government’s forthcoming Climate Competitiveness Strategy—his government’s first emission reduction plan—will focus on “results over objectives” and “investment over prohibition.” It was a curious choice of words that reveals much about this government’s climate policy thinking.

First, while tangible results are of course the core of progress, there is no way to measure results outside the context of a broader objective. Downplaying those objectives, such as Canada’s 2030 Paris Agreement commitments, as Carney has done, muddies the waters—perhaps deliberately—about what constitutes climate action.

Is building a liquified natural gas (LNG) plant a “result”? Not if your objective is to actually reduce greenhouse gas emissions. But if you have no long-term targets or guiding principles besides economic activity in the abstract then… sure, why not?

Second, while “investment” is inoffensive enough as a priority—we do, in fact, require transformative investments in a cleaner economy—there is something both underhanded and misleading about labelling public interest regulation as “prohibition.” Many of the most successful climate policies in history, including Canada’s phase-out of coal power, have incorporated “prohibitions” of one sort or another. These policies work because they lead to an absolute reduction in the amount of pollution being produced, which is the only metric that matters from the perspective of climate change.

It does not matter how many electric vehicles we put on the road, for example, if we don’t take internal combustion engine vehicles off the road. We can’t negotiate with planetary physics.

In other words, a true climate competitiveness strategy needs to include results and objectives, investment and prohibition. Delivering half a strategy—especially one without a guiding vision and without the regulatory tools to enforce it—is no strategy at all.

The Carney climate plan was originally supposed to be a stand-alone document, but it now looks as if it will be folded into next week’s federal budget. It’s the first thing I’ll be looking for during the budget lockup in Ottawa, so stay tuned for the CCPA’s post-budget analysis.

On a related note, the latest Alternative Federal Budget was released this week, which is essential reading for progressives in Canada and the benchmark against which we will be evaluating the government’s budget. The AFB is produced each year by a committee of almost one hundred contributors and it offers a rich and compelling vision for truly progressive federal policy.

I pitched in on several chapters this year, including the AFB’s first ever chapter on artificial intelligence. It’s a topic that is absorbing more and more of my attention these days, as you’ll see in this month’s research highlights. But there is plenty of climate and labour news to dive into as well, so let’s get started.

Storm surge: this month’s key reads

Making climate action entirely about economics is missing the point

Over the past few years, the climate movement has drifted toward couching climate action entirely in economic terms rather than foregrounding any sort of moral or social imperative. Governments, corporations and households care about the bottom line, the argument goes, so if we can only explain how costly it is to keep burning fossil fuels—and how much money can be made in the clean economy—then perhaps they will acquiesce to the rationality of emissions reductions.

It’s not all wrong and I’m not pointing fingers here. Foregrounding the economics of climate change is sort of my whole thing. But losing sight of the bigger picture (i.e., human and planetary well-being) introduces some big risks that are laid bare in several recent studies.

Unjust Transition, published by Oxfam, exposes the neo-colonialism inherent to much of the global climate project. The scramble for minerals, in particular, is reproducing patterns of exploitation that are harming the Global South for the enrichment of the largest corporations in the Global North. Similar patterns are evident in the proliferation of international climate finance, which is being delivered mainly as loans (increasingly via the private sector) rather than as true aid. Instead of unlocking the climate and economic potential of developing countries, it is exacerbating crippling levels of indebtedness.

A study by the United Nations Environment Programme, Financing the Responsible Supply of Energy Transition Minerals for Sustainable Development, reaches a similar conclusion, highlighting that human rights abuses and equity issues are endemic to the global mining industry and will be perpetuated in the absence of new legal standards and financing structures.

And a report published by the Canadian Coalition of Women in Engineering, Science, Trades and Technology, Futures Under Siege, finds that climate policy across Canadian jurisdictions is systematically excluding marginalized groups, including the Indigenous and racialized communities that are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change. The report points out that emissions reductions and clean investments achieved outside of an equity framework may, in fact, make many people worse off.

The real purpose of climate action is not to reduce emissions or to increase green investment for their own sakes. It is to create a liveable world for ourselves and future generations. When we lose sight of that imperative, we risk becoming trapped in a short-sighted economic logic that may not actually improve well-being now or in the future.

Research radar: the latest developments in work and climate

The oil and gas industry is not a part of the renewable energy solution. Despite the industry’s claims to be supporting the transition to a cleaner economy, a new article in the journal Nature Sustainability finds that the 250 largest fossil fuel companies in the world account for only 1.42 per cent of global investment in renewables, and those investments account for only 0.13 per cent of the total energy produced by these companies. The idea that the fossil fuel industry is “part of the solution” is textbook greenwashing.

Canada’s oil industry is lining the pockets of foreign shareholders at the expense of Canadian workers. A new report from the Alberta Federation of Labour and Canadians for Tax Fairness, Exporting Profits, finds that oil industry profits are increasingly being distributed to foreign shareholders rather than domestic workers. The ratio of shareholder profits to worker wages is now three-to-one—the reverse of the rest of the Canadian economy—and the gap is widening over time as oil companies reduce investment and increase dividends and share buybacks. It’s hardly news, but, like greenwashing, the argument that the oil and gas industry is acting in the best interests of its workers does not hold water.

Canada violating commitment to end fossil fuel finance. In 2021, the 40 signatories to the Clean Energy Transition Partnership, including Canada, agreed to end international support for fossil fuels. Yet as a new report from the International Institute for Sustainable Development, Holding Course, Missing Speed, reveals, seven of those signatories, including Canada, continue to support the industry financially. Not only do we need to stop doing so, the report argues, we need to be rapidly redirecting international financial flows to support clean development instead.

UK plans to create 420,000 green jobs in five years. The UK’s new Clean energy jobs plan includes funding of £1.2 billion ($2.2 billion) per year for skills development in strategic sectors. It’s one of the first green skills plans I’ve seen that actually sets targets at the correct order of magnitude—a weakness of Canada’s skill training programs that I’ve long criticized. We need to be training tens or hundreds of thousands of new workers each year to meet demand in a clean economy, yet programs such as the Sustainable Jobs Training Fund only aim to support a few thousand workers per year.

Green industrial policy continues to enter the mainstream. In An Industrial Policy Renaissance, the International Institute for Sustainable Development offers a helpful primer on the history, purpose and promise of green industrial policy. The paper dives into a number of recent case studies, such as in Brazil and Korea, that weren’t on the map when the CCPA published our own guide to green industrial policy just a few years ago. An industrial policy orientation is increasingly essential for competing in the global economy.

Labour conditions are an underappreciated tool for enabling workforce transitions. In its latest report, Just Transition Conditionalities, the Scottish Just Transition Commission gets into the weeds of the policy levers available to governments for ensuring that public and private investment is producing pro-social outcomes. For example, governments can require that infrastructure projects employ a certain share of apprentices or that a certain share of profits are reinvested into communities. In Canada, our governments are increasingly requiring that developers sign community benefit agreements in order to access public funding, which is a promising trend that should be accelerated.

Just transitions are more likely to succeed when they are localized and planned in advance. A study from the Asia Investor Group on Climate Change, Place-Based Just Transition, unpacks the energy transitions underway in India, Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan. Although the paper is aimed more at investors than policy makers, it reaches the important conclusion that proactively managed transitions that are responsive to local contexts are more successful and less disruptive than reactionary, generalized transition programs.

A green bargaining toolkit for teachers unions. The U.S.-based Labor Network for Sustainability released Bargaining for Green Schools, Good Jobs, and Bright Futures, a report that provides a useful set of case studies and best practices for advancing climate action in schools through labour organizing. Decarbonizing schools offers many benefits, including reduced energy costs and improved health outcomes for students.

New book unpacks the coalitions challenging the corporate power of the fossil fuel industry. I’m really looking forward to a new book from McGill University’s Amy Janzwood, Mega Pipelines, Mega Resistance, that is set to release next month. It promises a deep dive into the activist coalitions that have opposed exploitative fossil fuel development in Canada. If I can get my hands on a copy, I’ll review it in a future newsletter.

Dark clouds: artificial intelligence on the horizon

Canadian public service especially vulnerable to AI job loss. A report from the Future Skills Centre, Adoption Ready?, finds that half of public servants in Canada are in occupations categorized as high-exposure and low-complementarity in the context of AI, which means they are more likely to be replaced by AI than augmented by it over the long term. Unfortunately, rather than calling into question the desirability of displacing such a substantial and critical part of the workforce, the paper offers only milquetoast suggestions for mitigating harm as AI inevitably washes over the public sector.",https://www.policyalternatives.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/pn_climateTargets-header.png,N,,2025-11-27 16:00:13.532484

“As physicians, we are deeply alarmed to see this thorough gutting of Canada’s climate commitments. The Federal-Alberta agreement includes an explicit commitment to expand fossil fuel production—the leading cause of climate change. It delays, weakens or entirely cancels Canada’s most important measures to tackle climate pollution, including a clean electricity grid, oil and gas emissions cap, oil tanker ban, industrial carbon price, methane emission reductions, and anti-greenwashing protections.

“It commits to build a pipeline through First Nations’ territories who oppose the project, with no mention of gaining their consent. Finally, it replaces sound strategies to tackle climate change with dangerous, untested carbon capture and storage (CCUS) projects.

“Climate change threatens the health of humanity. It is beyond the pale to be doubling down on fossil fuel expansion at precisely the moment we need to be quitting oil and gas. The health impacts of this agreement will be profound and far-reaching.”

Dr. Melissa Lem, Past President of the Canadian Association of Physicians for the Environment, said:

“Climate pollution from expanded oil production intensifies extreme weather, extreme heat, infectious diseases, and disruptions to our food supply. Increased oil extraction worsens air quality, leading to higher rates of respiratory disease, heart problems, and premature deaths in local communities. And building a new pipeline threatens the safety of First Nations and other communities in British Columbia, who are on the front lines of potential oil spills and increased tanker traffic.

“Overall, this agreement is a dangerous step backward. Canada needs bold leadership to safeguard our health and that of future generations. Our governments should be investing in clean energy solutions that will create jobs, improve air quality, and safeguard the health of all people – not granting the wishes of the sunsetting fossil fuel industry.”

The trends in the U.S. shale industry suggest it will not come to that because production would stop growing long before that.","Shale drillers are finding new and exciting ways to boost production in the Permian and elsewhere. This can make the industry more resilient to international price swings—but never fully resilient and never for very long. The pain from the prolonged price depression is beginning to bite in.

Back in October, Kpler warned that U.S. oil production could shed 700,000 barrels daily if international oil prices slid lower than $60 per barrel. The analytics firm cited drilled but uncompleted well data showing the inventory of these wells had shrunk by between 25% and 30% in the Bakken and the Eagle Ford basins since the start of 2025.

Now, Reuters is reporting that the Permian is also feeling the pinch, with towns dependent on the oil industry starting to suffer the economic consequences of a downturn. The publication interviewed industry executives and local business owners to find that the key industry of the region is retrenching, spending less, and idling rigs.

Everyone has, of course, heard about the layoffs in Big Oil majors. The majors themselves have framed it as part of a long-term strategy to become leaner. Reuters suggests that they are having trouble maintaining the workforce, citing Bureau of Labor Statistics data showing that overall employment in the U.S. oil industry declined by 4,000 between January and July this year. Over the same period, however, production of crude oil has continued to grow, creating a perhaps confusing picture.

The confusion goes away once focus shifts to those drilling efficiency gains that Bloomberg’s Javier Blas detailed earlier this month, noting supermajors’ race to lower drilling costs in the shale patch by researching cheaper proppants, for instance, and surfactants that help the oil flow more easily from the rock. The focus, he wrote, citing the industry, was to maximize recovery rates from existing wells.

“The best place to find oil is where you already know you've got oil,” Chevron’s chief executive, Mike Wirth, told Blas in an interview. “We know where the oil is. If we left 90% of the oil behind, it would be the first time in history that we didn't figure out how to do it.”

So, that’s one reason drilling rigs are down—while production keeps climbing higher—but it is not the only reason, based on what Reuters reports from the Permian. “We've had dialogue with the administration, letting them know that oil prices in the low to mid $50s make returns increasingly difficult for investment. This will eventually make current production levels unsustainable,” the chief executive of Admiral Permian Resources told Reuters.

Meanwhile, as international prices decline, the cost of drilling a well has gone up by between 5% and 10% from last year, according to the boss of Latigo Petroleum. “The economics are completely upside down from where they were just in January. It's more expensive to drill a well and you're getting 20% less for your oil,” Kirk Edwards told Reuters.

Ironically, the pervasive perception of unrelenting production growth in the U.S. shale patch has become the chief reason for bearish oil price predictions, expecting supply to exceed demand for oil for a prolonged period of time. Analysts regularly cite record-breaking output numbers as evidence that oil supply keeps growing despite price movements, suggesting that U.S. shale is more resilient than what the industry itself says it is.

“Investment returns at $55 to $60 per barrel are not what they were at the same price five years ago because the best wells have been drilled,” Admiral Permian Resources’ CEO told Reuters, which also noted a slowdown in oilfield service activity as evidence of a broader downturn in the shale industry—even if the number of barrels per day produced by that industry are still climbing.

In fairness, that trend emerged earlier in the year as reported by the biggest oilfield service providers—every one of them reported slower business in North America and stronger business abroad. The early signs, therefore, were out there for everyone to see, but instead, analysts doubled down on booming shale output, driving a global supply overhang, which kept the pressure on prices high.

“Although majors and large independents can operate below $50/bbl, this price level would enforce cautious activity for most,” Kpler analyst Johannes Raubal wrote in October. “A severe, sustained $50/bbl scenario—a view held by some agencies and banks like Goldman Sachs—would cripple US crude supply,” he warned. Yet here’s JP Morgan, predicting continued growth in U.S. shale oil production, leading to a further slump in oil prices, potentially as low as $30 per barrel.

The trends in the U.S. shale industry suggest it will not come to that because production would stop growing long before that. And the first time the Energy Information Administration reports a negative change in output, prices will rebound like there was never a danger of a supply overhang, let alone one so substantial that it could push Brent crude below $40.

Growing supply of clean electricity remains biggest opportunity for affordability, jobs, energy security, climate

VANCOUVER — JESSICA MCILROY, manager of Government Relations at the Pembina Institute, made the following statement in response to the release of the CleanBC review panel’s final report:

“Today’s review of CleanBC recognizes that the global clean energy transition is well underway, and that reducing emissions and building a strong, resilient economy that works for British Columbians go hand-in-hand.

“We were pleased to see many of the critical actions we recommended as part of the review process reflected in the expert panel’s report.

“It’s clear that B.C. should continue what’s working: growing our supply of clean electricity, strengthening industrial carbon pricing and reducing methane emissions, helping people electrify their homes and vehicles, and supporting workers transitioning to jobs in the clean economy. CleanBC has successfully positioned B.C. as a clean energy leader, showing that reducing emissions and embracing clean energy is how we build a resilient economy.

“None of this can be achieved without a ready and skilled workforce. The review rightly notes the importance of establishing a labour market outlook and development plan to help workers seize opportunities. The commitment to doubling government’s investment in skilled trades training in B.C.’s “Look West” strategy will help workers find jobs in the low-carbon economy.

“As Canada’s leader in EV adoption, and with our clean electricity grid and major investments in charging infrastructure, B.C. can be a global EV leader, if we commit. We can adjust course where needed, but weakening the overall signal would slow the introduction of new, more affordable models that would allow more British Columbians to experience the cost-savings that come with EVs. We should aim high and help push the country forward as global EV momentum accelerates.

“The expert panel recognizes that reliance on LNG remains a risky economic bet — and that the government’s plans to increase gas production and LNG exports threatens progress. We support the panel’s recommendations to prioritize other uses of our finite clean electricity supply, and ensure that all energy development in the province is based on consultation and partnership with Indigenous nations.

“CleanBC’s success should be measured in ways that are meaningful to British Columbians: how many EVs are we driving, how many heat pumps have we installed in our homes, and how much money have they saved us. Also, how much is being invested and how many jobs are being created, thanks to our economy-wide adoption of clean energy.

“B.C. has made progress to reduce emissions and prepare for leadership in the clean economy, but we must now do more, faster. British Columbians want energy solutions that save them money, that learn from our successes and respect regional differences. It’s now on government to solidly commit to these recommendations and provide the certainty the private sector needs, so British Columbians can experience the full range of benefits — from cost-savings and jobs, to energy security and healthier communities.”

The program aims to set up 6,000 metric tons per annum (MTPA) of integrated REPM manufacturing in India.

The total financial outlay of the program comprises sales-linked incentives of ₹64.5 billion (~$722.73 million) on REPM sales for five years and a capital subsidy of ₹7.5 billion (~$84.03 million).

The program envisions allocating the total capacity to five beneficiaries through a global competitive bidding process. Each beneficiary will be allotted up to 1,200 MTPA of capacity.

The total duration of the program will be seven years from the date of award, including a two-year gestation period for setting up an integrated REPM manufacturing facility, and five years for incentive disbursement on the sale of REPM.

REPMs are among the strongest permanent magnets and are vital for electric vehicles, renewable energy, electronics, aerospace, and defence applications. The program will support the creation of integrated REPM manufacturing facilities, involving conversion of rare earth oxides to metals, metals to alloys, and alloys to finished REPMs.

Driven by rapidly growing demand from electric vehicles, renewable energy, industrial applications, and consumer electronics, India’s consumption of REPMs is expected to double by 2030. At present, India’s demand for REPMs is met primarily by imports.

In September 2025, the Union Cabinet approved a ₹15 billion (~$170.19 million) incentive program to develop India’s recycling capacity for separating and producing critical minerals from secondary sources such as e-waste and lithium-ion battery scrap. This program is a part of the National Critical Mineral Mission, under the Ministry of Mines, which aims to build domestic capacity and supply chain resilience for critical minerals.

As of mid-October, the US data center pipeline reached 245 GW of planned capacity, driven by a handful of enormous, speculative projects. These projects, and the renewable deals hyperscalers are signing, skew heavily toward Texas. More than a quarter of pipeline capacity targets the state, whose pipeline nearly doubled from 35 GW in Q1 to 67 GW in Q3.

Data Center Alley gives way to Data Center Prairie

It is conventional wisdom that for data center developers, ‘access to power’ has become the mantra. That is, the importance of fiber proximity to end customers and other data centers has been superseded by the imperative to secure power from utilities. The giga-scale campuses that have been announced this year, sited in Pennsylvania, Wyoming, and particularly West and North Texas, signal yet another pivot in strategy. Developers have increasingly given up confidence that utilities can meet their power and timeline demand and instead seek to build their own generation based on local natural resources.

Most frequently, this resource is natural gas, with a particular focus on the Permian in Texas. Pacifico Energy’s 5-GW GW Ranch, poolside’s 2-GW Project Horizon, and FO Permian’s 5-GW campus in Midland County are examples. The gas network in the US is at capacity, and building new gas generation far from supply means paying for and - perhaps more importantly for developers - waiting for new pipeline capacity.

In some cases, it should be noted, campuses are being leveraged for their scale and solar or wind resource, such as Tract’s data center parks in Nevada and Utah, and Quantica’s Big Sky Digital Infrastructure campus in Montana. While more headlines have made about the potential for batteries to make data centers flexible assets, we’ve found that batteries are being planned much more commonly to balance renewables at large campuses and to add needed fast-ramping capacity to onsite gas.

Distorting the capital landscape

These mega campuses not only reflect a new siting strategy: they distort the capital landscape. The 2% of projects over US$17 billion represent 42% of overall capital deployment, with the 60% of projects below US$1 billion contributing only 8%. With questions already intensifying regarding froth in project investment and company valuations, these projects promise to drive even more froth.

The two highest-cost projects, Project Jupiter in New Mexico (US$160 billion) and Project Kestrel in Missouri (US$100 billion), are an order of magnitude more expensive than the campuses being developed by companies like Meta and Microsoft, without appreciable increase in IT infrastructure. They are notably being funded through novel financial engineering: Their developers will be both the payers and payees of industrial revenue bonds (IRBs) issued by the local government, a contrivance that enables tax benefits.

Betting big on onsite generation

The new energy-chasing campuses are committing to onsite generation in a way that developers have been hesitant to in the past. Hyperscalers have been very clear that they prefer grid power, which requires less operating risk, shorter contract commitments, and no exposure to scope 1 emissions. Developer commitment to onsite generation reflects a bet either that hyperscalers urgency to deploy will overcome their concerns, or that the developer will be able to sell to a new generation of hyperscalers with greater risk tolerance and less concern for sustainability.

The net result is that while the number of projects in the pipeline with onsite generation has increased only to 10%, these projects represent a whopping 34% of pipeline capacity.

Unsurprisingly, the vast majority of sites are in Texas, and the technology is gas turbines.

This trend could have significant implications for both energy affordability and reliability. Whether on- or off-grid, projects with utility-scale gas generation will increase gas burns, competing with LNG exports and raising the long-term price of natural gas. This will drive up both gas and electricity bills across the country. To the extent to which turbine-based projects are off-grid, utilities will have an even harder time obtaining turbines given production limitations. That could pose reliability challenges for on-grid load growth, including electrification.

Whether or not a bubble bursts, these affordability and reliability challenges are likely to provoke state intervention to protect customers. As that begins to happen, all bets are off.

The Regional Development Association of East Central Kansas voted unanimously to support a plan to explore siting a Natrium advanced nuclear reactor in the region, according to KVOE. The decision follows a new memorandum of understanding between TerraPower, Evergy, and the Kansas Department of Commerce, marking the latest step toward expanding nuclear energy in the state.

The Natrium design uses a 345-megawatt sodium-cooled fast reactor paired with a molten salt energy storage system, allowing operators to boost output to 500 megawatts during periods of high demand. It's the same model under construction in Wyoming and is part of the cleaner energy push to stabilize the U.S. energy grid.

Nuclear power is one of the few energy sources capable of generating large amounts of low-carbon electricity around the clock, complementing renewable energy sources like wind and solar to enhance energy security and drive us toward a cleaner future.

However, nuclear power also has drawbacks, including high upfront construction costs, radioactive waste disposal, and safety concerns. Advancements in small modular and advanced reactor designs like Natrium could help address many of these issues, making nuclear a key player in reducing reliance on dirty energies and cutting planet-overheating pollution.

State Rep. Mark Schreiber called the proposal a ""tremendous opportunity"" for Lyon County, citing the area's existing infrastructure and skilled workforce, per WIBW.

Flint Hills Technical College has also pledged full support for the project, according to its president, Caron Daugherty. The college's power-plant technology program ""would be a tremendous resource that could help build and sustain a revolving workforce for maintaining and running the reactor,"" Daugherty stated, per WIBW.

""I think Kansas is perfectly situated right in the middle of the country and in the middle of the Southwest Power Pool, with a good transmission network to create power here and to be able to ship it north, south, east, or west,"" Schreiber told KSN.

Beyond the energy big picture, it is an opportunity and a ""watershed moment"" for local employment, according to Emporia Commissioner Jamie Sauder, who sees direct and long-term positive impacts for housing and local hospitality sectors, per KVOE.",https://www.thecooldown.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Natriumimage-recYFoh5q33n7TAo7-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 17:01:16.648394

While the average gasoline price in Washington has dropped 16 cents since last month, from $4.34 to $4.18 per gallon, it’s still 18 cents more than last Thanksgiving, according to AAA. Meanwhile, millions of people are hitting the road, increasing the estimated travel time from Seattle to Bellingham by 77%.

The average price nationwide sits at about $3.04, around 2 cents lower than last Thanksgiving. Earlier this year, Democrats increased the state gas tax by 6 cents to help overcome a deficit. Next July, the tax will begin rising by 2% annually, driving up the prices of groceries and other products with it.

“Drivers have grown more resilient to price swings, yet I worry that concerns about a cooling economy may be weighing on Americans,” Patrick De Haan, head of petroleum analysis at GasBuddy, wrote in a news release. “Even with affordable gas, economic uncertainty can make people stay closer to home.”

De Haan said even though the average price nationwide is holding steady, it’s not translating to more travelers, let alone for one of the states with the highest gas prices in the country. According to AAA, Washington ranks third for the most expensive gas in the nation, right behind California and Hawaii.

Following the Evergreen State are Nevada, Oregon, Alaska, Arizona, Pennsylvania, Idaho and Illinois. If someone drove the few minutes from Spokane across the state line to Idaho, they could see prices dip nearly $1. That may not amount to much now, but the gap could widen by 2% annually if prices hold.

“Every year without any change in the price of oil, Washingtonians are going to have to pay 2% more, and it might be closer to 2.5%, because that additional tax also reduces the purchasing power, which causes inflation in and of itself,” De Haan said in an interview with The Center Square on Wednesday.

He attributed the state’s position as having one of the most expensive gas prices in the nation to the Climate Commitment Act. The CCA sets a declining cap on emissions for the state’s largest polluters, requiring them to purchase “allowances” at quarterly auctions to offset their environmental impact.

Oil refineries respond by raising gasoline prices, which in turn drive up prices at the grocery store and other businesses due to higher trucking costs. De Haan said the CCA caused fuel prices to rise almost immediately, despite former Gov. Jay Inslee arguing that it would only amount to pennies.

De Haan said the more recent increases in gas prices are due to regulatory conditions across the West Coast, as refineries consider leaving the region because of the political climate. He said gas shipments are on the way from overseas to provide some relief, though 2% annual gas tax hikes still loom.

Issues with the Olympic Pipeline slowed down relief, as the shutdown requires around 1,300 truckers daily to transport the oil that the infrastructure routes along the West Coast, he said. De Haan thinks that once everything is back to normal, the state’s average gas price could drop below $4 per gallon.

“Washington state, given the fact that it’s a cap and trade state, is now likely going to be inked in as a permanent resident of the top five gas prices in the country,” De Haan told The Center Square.",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/fwbusiness.com/content/tncms/custom/image/e47550d8-b866-11ed-a481-ffd95f72d957.jpg?resize=600%2C315,N,,2025-11-27 15:01:23.431223

According to Baker Hughes, this week’s report reveals that oil rigs have fallen to their lowest numbers in four years, while gas rigs experienced a slight increase. This shift highlights ongoing adjustments within the energy sector as companies respond to fluctuating market conditions and pricing dynamics. The decline in oil rigs, particularly in Texas, reflects broader industry trends as firms prioritize financial stability over expanding production. These changes raise questions about future energy output and the implications for the U.S. economy.

Declining Rig Count Reflects Industry Trends

The rig count, a critical metric for evaluating future energy production, saw a notable decrease this week. Baker Hughes reported a drop by 10 rigs, bringing the total to 544, the lowest since September. This reduction underscores a trend where energy firms are scaling back operations in response to declining oil prices. The decision to cut rigs suggests that companies are shifting their focus from production expansion to financial health, aiming to enhance shareholder returns and reduce debt. This strategic pivot comes as analysts predict a continued decline in U.S. crude prices, which have been falling for the past several years.

Texas, the leading oil and gas-producing state, experienced a significant reduction, with its rig count dropping by eight to 226, marking the lowest level since July 2021. This decline is indicative of broader shifts in the energy sector as companies adjust their strategies to navigate the current economic landscape. The reduction in rigs also reflects a cautious approach by energy firms, as they balance the need for profitability with the challenges of a fluctuating market.

Gas Rigs on the Rise Amid Price Increases

While oil rigs have decreased, the number of gas rigs has risen, with an increase of three rigs, reaching a total of 130. This marks the highest count since July 2023, driven by a projected 58% increase in spot gas prices in 2025. The rise in gas rigs suggests a renewed interest in gas production, as companies anticipate higher profits from increased prices. This shift in focus highlights the dynamic nature of the energy market, where firms are quick to adapt to changing conditions to maximize returns.

The Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts a significant increase in gas output, projecting a rise to 107.7 billion cubic feet per day (bcfd) in 2025. This represents a substantial jump from previous years, indicating a strong response from producers to capitalize on favorable market conditions. The increase in gas drilling activity reflects a strategic move by energy companies to diversify their portfolios and leverage opportunities in the gas sector, even as they scale back on oil production.

Economic Implications of Rig Count Changes

The reduction in oil rigs and the increase in gas rigs have broader economic implications. As firms prioritize financial stability, the shift in focus away from oil production may impact overall energy output and influence global market dynamics. The decrease in oil rigs could lead to tighter supply conditions, potentially affecting prices and impacting consumers. However, the increase in gas production may offset some of these effects, providing a buffer against potential energy shortages.

The energy sector’s strategic adjustments will likely have ripple effects across the economy. A reduction in oil production could influence U.S. energy exports, affecting trade balances and international relations. Additionally, changes in energy production can impact employment within the industry, as firms may adjust their workforce to align with new production goals. These economic considerations highlight the interconnected nature of the energy sector and its influence on broader economic trends.

Future Outlook for U.S. Energy Production

Looking ahead, the U.S. energy landscape is poised for further changes as companies continue to navigate a complex market environment. With oil prices projected to decline for a third consecutive year, firms may maintain a cautious approach, focusing on financial stability rather than aggressive expansion. However, the anticipated increase in gas prices presents opportunities for growth within the gas sector, offering a potential avenue for increased production and revenue.

The future of U.S. energy production will depend on a variety of factors, including market dynamics, technological advancements, and regulatory policies. As firms adjust their strategies to align with these factors, the energy sector will continue to evolve, shaping the economic and environmental landscape. The ongoing changes raise important questions about the future direction of U.S. energy policy and the potential impacts on global energy markets.

The recent shifts in the U.S. energy sector underscore the need for adaptive strategies in an ever-changing market. As companies balance production goals with financial stability, the implications for the broader economy remain uncertain. How will these adjustments impact the U.S. energy landscape and its role in the global market? The answers will depend on how firms and policymakers respond to evolving challenges and opportunities in the years ahead.

The company's diversified utility operations continue to underpin its steady performance.

Duke Energy’s share price recently ticked higher to $123.43, putting its momentum back on investors’ radar after a solid start to the year. While the 1-day share price return was 1.23%, what also stands out is the 14.48% gain year-to-date and a five-year total shareholder return of 59.96%, highlighting how steady utility demand and measured growth strategies have rewarded patient shareholders over time.

If you’re looking to broaden your search after observing Duke Energy’s steady move, now is an opportune time to explore other fast-growing companies with high insider ownership using our .

With a strong track record and the stock trading around 11% below analyst price targets, the question remains: Is Duke Energy undervalued right now, or is the market already accounting for its growth prospects?

Most Popular Narrative: 10.2% Undervalued

Duke Energy’s most followed narrative sets a fair value substantially above its last close of $123.43, suggesting market participants are missing constructive catalysts on the horizon.

Major economic development wins (such as AWS's $10B data center in North Carolina), paired with accelerated migration and manufacturing demand in Duke's service territory, are expected to drive robust, multi-year load and volume growth. This supports higher revenues and long-term EPS growth. Supportive state and federal legislation, including the Power Bill Reduction Act in NC and the Energy Security Act in SC, streamlines cost recovery for new generation and grid investments. These measures reduce regulatory lag and improve cash flow and earnings stability over the next decade.

Want to know what’s powering this premium? The narrative centers on a combination of rising earnings, ongoing revenue expansion, and a notable profit margin trajectory. The real surprise is that it projects a valuation multiple comparable to some of the country’s highest-growth companies. Interested in the financial factors behind this outlook? Check out the details that are moving the needle on Duke Energy’s fair value calculation.

Result: Fair Value of $137.47 (UNDERVALUED)

However, accelerated adoption of distributed energy and rising capital needs could challenge Duke Energy’s revenue growth and put future margins under pressure.

Another View: How Does DCF Stack Up?

While the popular narrative suggests Duke Energy is undervalued based on analyst price targets, our SWS DCF model arrives at a different conclusion. The DCF estimate puts fair value at just $63.17 per share, meaning the stock looks overvalued compared to its current market price. This divergence in outcomes may be due to growth assumptions that could be overly optimistic or to the possibility that the market is expecting catalysts that the cash flow model does not capture.

The initiative, launched jointly by the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and the World Bank Group, represents one of Africa’s most ambitious energy access campaigns.
However, he argued the budget fails to prioritise the very group at the heart of innovation in this space, namely young entrepreneurs in the clean energy sector.
The group also criticised what it describes as near-absent youth participation in Ghana’s energy planning processes, a gap they say is inconsistent with the National Youth Policy 2022 to 2032.
Ghana joined 28 other African countries that have now presented National Energy Compacts since Mission 300’s launch in January 2025.","A youth advocacy organisation has criticised Ghana’s 2025 Budget Statement for failing to adequately recognise and support young entrepreneurs driving clean energy innovation across the country.

The Strategic Youth Network for Development (SYND) says this oversight threatens progress toward universal energy access and the Mission 300 target, which aims to connect 300 million Africans to electricity by 2030. The initiative, launched jointly by the African Development Bank Group (AfDB) and the World Bank Group, represents one of Africa’s most ambitious energy access campaigns.

Chibeze Ezekiel, Executive Director of SYND, acknowledged at a press conference in Accra that the government has outlined an ambitious roadmap for expanding electricity access and promoting cleaner cooking. However, he argued the budget fails to prioritise the very group at the heart of innovation in this space, namely young entrepreneurs in the clean energy sector.

Speaking under the Youth in Natural Resources and Environmental Governance (Youth-NREG) Platform, Ezekiel said youth-owned businesses producing solar technologies, clean cookstoves, briquettes and other climate-friendly solutions receive little to no institutional support despite quietly powering rural homes, lowering cooking costs for families and creating green jobs.

Ghana unveiled its National Energy Compact in September 2025 as part of Mission 300, outlining plans to increase renewable energy’s share in the national mix from four per cent to 10 per cent by 2030 and mobilise $20 billion in investments over the next decade. Yet SYND warns that the budget’s failure to support youth-led clean energy businesses contradicts these commitments and slows national efforts to boost access through distributed solar, improved cookstoves and low-carbon fuels.

The group argues that expanding these enterprises would speed up Ghana’s clean energy rollout, improve livelihoods in rural communities and broaden the tax base through thousands of new direct and indirect jobs. Ezekiel noted that government should provide funding, capacity-building programs and policy incentives to help these green energy enterprises thrive and absorb unemployed youth into the job market.

SYND also expressed concern that the budget does not clearly outline job opportunities to be created through energy sector investments, which represents a major expectation under Mission 300. While the government has projected 800,000 new jobs in 2026 and indicated that renewable energy alone could create 322,110 jobs from 2026 to 2030, the budget does not specify how many will come from energy access programmes, electrification projects or renewable rollouts.

This lack of detail makes it difficult for young people to plan, prepare or receive the needed guidance to position themselves for employment in the sector, according to SYND.

On funding, SYND says the government’s allocation of GH¢2.0 billion for Phase I of the Rural Electricity Acceleration and Urban Intensification Initiative falls short of what the National Energy Compact requires. The Compact needs $4.4 billion in total, with at least $1.8 billion expected from public and donor financing. The group believes the current allocation, while commendable, is too small to push Ghana toward its target of near-universal electricity access by 2030.

They caution that inadequate funding risks delaying key projects, especially in rural communities where the remaining 3.7 million unconnected citizens reside.

The government plans to distribute 450,000 household cookstoves and 7,000 commercial ones under Phase I of the National Liquefied Petroleum Gas (LPG) Promotion Programme to increase access to clean cooking. While Ezekiel welcomed this initiative, he pointed to a practical infrastructure challenge that could undermine its success.

SYND warns the rollout may result in thousands of unused cylinders if households cannot afford the gas or cannot find nearby refill points. Without more gas-filling stations and measures to make LPG affordable for poor families, the programme could fall short of its clean cooking ambitions.

The group also criticised what it describes as near-absent youth participation in Ghana’s energy planning processes, a gap they say is inconsistent with the National Youth Policy 2022 to 2032. The policy calls for creating spaces where the youth can influence national decisions, not simply be passive beneficiaries.

SYND says that while gender inclusion received attention in the National Energy Compact, youth inclusion did not. They insist that young people, often the most affected by energy poverty and the backbone of the clean-tech sector, cannot be left out of policies that shape the country’s future.

Ghana’s Energy Transition and Investment Plan aims for net-zero emissions by 2060 and has the potential to create over 400,000 jobs, requiring approximately $550 billion in investment. The plan envisions strong capital market involvement in the energy sector, with significant efforts needed to attract private investment.

SYND maintains that these weaknesses in the 2026 Budget pose a significant challenge to achieving the Mission 300 Programme and the goals outlined in the National Energy Compact. For them, Ghana’s energy future must be a partnership between government and the young innovators already building solutions on the ground.

Ezekiel insists that as the country pushes toward universal electricity access and cleaner forms of cooking, Ghana cannot achieve its goals by overlooking the hands shaping tomorrow’s energy landscape. He stressed that young people working in sustainable energy initiatives often lack the financial and technical support needed to scale their businesses, highlighting the urgent need for government intervention.

However, they say the Albanese Government has missed an opportunity to secure nature laws that genuinely safeguard Australia’s nature and climate for generations to come.

A deal struck between the Albanese Government and the Greens will ensure reforms to the Environment Protection Conservation and Biodiversity Act 1999 pass the Senate today.

Australia’s eight State and Territory conservation councils welcome the changes negotiated by Labor and the Greens to stop fast tracking of new coal and gas projects, restrictions on the delegation of powers to states and territories in some circumstances (including stopping devolution of the “water trigger”), and the closing of deforestation loopholes through Regional Forest Agreements.

However, they remain concerned that the draft laws include new pathways to hand approval powers to states and territories, and to fast track mining and land clearing via a streamlined process.

Australia will have a national Environment Protection Agency, but it will not be fully independent and will act on instructions from the Minister, who has sweeping powers to override departmental and scientific advice.

There are some significant concessions in the deal, including stopping fast-tracking of coal and gas projects, and exempt from the application of new National Interest provisions.

Clearing of regrowth that is more than 15 years old, and clearing within 50 metres of a waterway in the Great Barrier Reef catchment, will no longer be exempt from the EPBC Act under the “continuous use” exemption.

There is also a “call in” power where the Minister can declare that a project needs Commonwealth approval notwithstanding an approval bilateral, and a requirement that a bilateral assessment agreement must be in place before entering into an approval bilateral.

The water trigger, which was created to deliver federal oversight of water resources for projects like fracking, will be retained by the Federal government instead of being headed back to state and territory governments.

Other wins include:

New national standards on the environment, with legally enforceable rules to protect endangered wildlife and ensure ecologically sustainable development.

New rules for emissions reporting on big polluting companies

Excluding specific threatened species from being offset through the Restoration Fund.

Five yearly reviews to ensure the laws are delivering for communities and the environment.

The state and territory conservation councils created a joint position on the draft bills as part of the current Senate Inquiry, against which we have assessed the new deal.

Environment Centre NT Executive Director Dr Kirsty Howey said:

“While some wins have been clawed back in negotiations with the Greens, the Albanese Government has missed a golden opportunity to secure laws that genuinely safeguard Australia’s nature and climate for generations to come.

“Grassroots community and environment groups have had to fight tooth and nail to win concessions from Labor, including retaining federal approval of the water trigger to stop fracking companies from destroying our waterways.”

Conservation Council WA Executive Director, Matt Roberts, said:

“We welcome changes to stop the fast-tracking of coal and gas, but this should never have been on the table in the first place.”

“We’re concerned that these laws will enable the handing of powers to state and territory governments who’ve been shown they can’t be trusted to protect our nature and climate. It is imperative that the federal government retain decision-making powers for destructive projects like the North-West Shelf and Browse Basin.”

Conservation Council of the ACT Executive Director, Simon Copland, said:

“The elephant in the room is the huge power these laws vest in the Minister, including to override environmental protections in the national interest and make sweeping rulings. This unacceptably undermines key wins.”

“We also oppose the fast-tracking of mining, housing and deforestation via the new “streamlined” assessment pathway, which will significantly curtail community rights to have a say in decisions that affect them.”

Nature Conservation Council of NSW CEO, Jacqui Mumford, said:

“With the RFA exemption finally removed, we expect this will mean an end to logging in forests that are critical for threatened species across NSW, such as Greater Glider strongholds and the state’s remaining koala refuges.

“This is the most significant shift in forest policy in a generation and gives the Minns Government a clear mandate to deliver a fair, planned transition out of native forest logging and into sustainable, plantation-based jobs.”

Environment Victoria CEO, Jono la Nauze, said:

“For the first time in history we will have a national Environment Protection Agency with the power to enforce the laws that protect Australia’s unique plants and wildlife. This could be undermined, however, if a future government hands decision-making powers back to state governments through proposed devolution measures.”

Environment Tasmania CEO, James Overington, said:

“We applaud the persistence of the Greens and also to the members of the ALP who would’ve pushed hard for nature from the inside. At long last, we will see the end of exemptions for the logging industry. Communities in Tasmania have fought for these changes for decades, and must be congratulated for securing this important win.”

Conservation Council of SA CEO, Kirsty Bevan, said:

“We welcome the creation of a new EPA with strong enforcement powers, and the introduction of national standards. The effectiveness of these changes will largely depend on Labor following through with the creation of strong, enforceable standards on matters of national environmental significance.

As the most downstream Basin state, South Australia bears the full consequences of cumulative water extraction, contamination and climate-driven flow reductions and leaving alone the water trigger is a huge relief for South Australia’s communities, industries and internationally recognised Ramsar wetlands in the Coorong and Lower Lakes.”

Queensland Conservation Council Acting Director, Anthony Gough, said:

The Trump administration said this rule will affect hundreds of oil and gas sources nationwide and save an estimated $750 million in compliance costs over roughly a decade.

“By finalizing compliance extensions, EPA is ensuring unrealistic regulations do not prevent America from unleashing energy dominance,” said EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin in a statement.

Methane is a potent greenhouse gas that warms the planet 80 times more than carbon dioxide in the short term. Oil and gas operations are the nation’s top industrial source of methane, and the Biden era rules were designed to reduce its emissions, as well as those of volatile organic compounds including benzene, a known carcinogen.

Environmental activists criticized the ruling. “This delay risks the health of millions of Americans living near oil and gas production and undermines progress by industry leaders,” said Rosalie Winn, lead counsel for methane and clean air policy at the Environmental Defense Fund.

The EPA first announced over the summer that it would be delaying pieces of the methane standards in an interim final rule, triggering a legal challenge by EDF and other green groups that is still pending.

Although the EPA’s update of the rule is limited to pushing back multiple compliance deadlines set in the original 2024 version, the agency has said it may reconsider more substantial parts of the rule later.

This is the latest example of President Donald Trump’s EPA rolling back industrial pollution controls set by the previous administration. In recent months, the agency has proposed giving coal-fired power plants more time to meet existing deadlines to regulate wastewater and delaying the phase-down of highly potent greenhouse gases used in refrigerators and air conditioners.",https://www.worldoil.com/media/14460/gas_flare_at_night_1_jf_tt.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 12:03:38.770406

The Reform Bill is the primary component of a package aimed to modernise the Environmental Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act and has been the subject of widespread industry, state government and cross party consultation over several years. The passage of the package of Bills through the Senate followed a successful negotiation between the Government and The Greens on reforms to the Bills that were previously passed in the House.

The reforms stem from Professor Graeme Samuel AC’s 2020 independent review of the EPBC Act, which was presented to then-environment minister and now Opposition Leader Sussan Ley. The reform package is centred around three pillars: stronger environmental protection and restoration, more efficient and robust project approvals, and greater accountability and transparency in environmental decision making.

Key environmental measures in the Government’s amended Bill:

Australia will have a National Environment Protection Agency (EPA) – a strong, independent regulator with a clear focus on ensuring better compliance with and stronger enforcement of Australia’s new environmental laws.

Australia will have National Environmental Standards, to ensure clear, strong guidelines to protect the environment.

Higher penalties for the most significant breaches of environmental law, as well as environment protection orders for use in urgent circumstances to prevent and respond to major contraventions of the law.

Removing and sunsetting the exemption from the EPBC Act for high-risk land clearing and regional forest agreements, so that they comply with the same rules and standards as other industries.

Requiring proponents of large emitting projects to disclose their greenhouse gas emissions and their emission reduction plans.

Maintaining federal approval of “water trigger” coal and gas projects.

Key measures to speed up decision-making for business and the community: Stronger Environmental Protection and Restoration

A new Streamlined Assessment Pathway, to significantly reduce the timeframe for proponents who provide sufficient information upfront, providing incentive to meet the standards upfront. This will deliver faster decisions, saving businesses time and money.

New and improved bilateral agreements with states to remove duplication for the assessment and approval of projects.

Regional planning, to deliver ‘go’ and ‘no go’ zones, delivering greater certainty to business, and future planning at a landscape scale, rather than project-by-project assessment.

Clarifying definitions of “unacceptable impacts” and “net gain” for the environment and restraining the operation of Environmental Protection Orders.

WA Premier Roger Cook has received assurances from Minister Watt that Western Australia will be the first state to sign a bilateral agreement for assessment and approvals.

“Every day national methane rules are delayed means more methane in the air, more toxic pollution in our lungs, and more irreversible climate damage.""
Methane can leak from oil and gas wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure, and companies often intentionally release methane through flaring.
While saving money for fossil fuel companies, the delay on the rule could lead to 3.8 million more tons of methane entering the atmosphere, according to the Trump administration's own estimates.
""After years of scientific work and public engagement, this administration’s decision to delay methane pollution standards implementation yet again is a blatant act of climate denial and disregard for public health.","With methane more than 28 times as potent as carbon at trapping heat in the atmosphere in a 100-year period, climate experts agree that reducing methane leaks from oil and gas fields would be one of the fastest and most effective ways of making a measurable impact on planetary heating—but President Donald Trump's Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday flatly refused to do so, instead announcing a delay on a requirement for fossil fuel companies to limit methane emissions.

The Biden administration had introduced the requirement for oil and gas firms to begin reducing their emissions this year, but the EPA said companies will now have until January 2027 to comply with the rule. The administration is also considering repealing the requirement entirely.

Lauren Pagel, policy director for Earthworks, called the delay ""indefensible and illegal.""

""The Trump administration has once again chosen polluters over people, sacrificing the health of communities and climate to serve the fossil fuel industry,"" said Pagel. “Every day national methane rules are delayed means more methane in the air, more toxic pollution in our lungs, and more irreversible climate damage.""

The EPA claimed it was providing companies with a ""more realistic timeline"" for complying with the requirement, and said the action would ""save an estimated $750 million over 11 years in compliance costs.""

Methane can leak from oil and gas wells, pipelines, and other fossil fuel infrastructure, and companies often intentionally release methane through flaring. The fossil fuel industry is the largest industrial source of methane emissions in the US, where emissions of methane have risen sharply in recent years as the Biden administration oversaw record production of oil and gas, even as it sought to reduce emissions through the methane requirement and other regulations.

While saving money for fossil fuel companies, the delay on the rule could lead to 3.8 million more tons of methane entering the atmosphere, according to the Trump administration's own estimates.

""After years of scientific work and public engagement, this administration’s decision to delay methane pollution standards implementation yet again is a blatant act of climate denial and disregard for public health. The EPA’s job is to protect people, not pad the pockets of oil and gas executives,"" said Pagel.

In addition to contributing to global heating and the extreme flooding, hurricanes, heatwaves, and other destructive weather events that come with it, methane emissions are linked to higher ground-level ozone pollution made up of tiny particles that can cause respiratory and cardiac problems, cancer, and strokes.

Grace Smith, senior attorney at the Environmental Defense Fund (EDF), noted that the methane standards have already been working ""to reduce pollution, protect people’s health, and prevent the needless waste of American energy""—progress that will now be reversed by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and Trump.

“The rule released today means millions of Americans will be exposed to dangerous pollution for another year and a half, for no good reason,” said Smith. “Delaying the methane standards threatens people’s health and undermines progress by industry leaders.”

“What’s more, the Trump administration rushed to push through this harmful rule without meaningful transparency or a chance for the public to weigh in,” added Smith. “EDF is already in court challenging EPA’s first attempt to delay these vital protections. We will continue to oppose the rule released today, so that people can breathe cleaner air.”

EDF and the grassroots group Moms Clean Air Force expressed particular concern over nearly 18 million people in the US who live near active oil and gas wells.

""Children in my community and across the nation need a strong and comprehensive oil and gas methane rule as soon as possible,"" said Patrice Tomcik, senior national field director for Moms Clean Air Force.

EDF noted that ""proven, cost-effective solutions are available to help oil and gas operators meet the standards while reducing waste and monetary losses,"" and both large and small producers have expressed support for the federal methane regulation as fossil fuel-producing states have begun implementing the standards.

The rule announced Wednesday, said EDF, ""ignores the strong opposition to the rule from members of impacted communities and wide variety of other Americans.""",https://www.commondreams.org/media-library/image.jpg?id=62251385&width=1200&height=600&coordinates=0%2C416%2C0%2C417,N,,2025-11-27 16:00:26.821348

Although the report spans politics, transport and finance, many of its findings point to a profound pressure point for infrastructure planners: electricity demand is climbing faster than expected, and data centres are now a central factor.

The report opens with a stark assessment of global climate politics, describing a “period of retrenchment” driven by the re-elected Trump administration.

The US has withdrawn from the Paris Agreement and moved to limit the federal government’s authority to regulate greenhouse gases.

Generation estimates these reversals have already cancelled nearly US$30bn of prospective clean industry investment, with lost investment possibly reaching US$500bn over a decade if current modelling holds.

Power strain intensifies as demand climbs

Across markets, clean technologies are scaling, but Generation stresses that electricity consumption is rising at close to 4% annually.

The report attributes this to the combined growth of EVs, heat pumps, data centres and air conditioning systems.

The rise in data centre development, fuelled by AI and high-density compute, is specifically called out as one of the drivers pushing global electricity demand to new record levels.

This rapid load growth is slowing the decline of fossil generation. Coal’s share of the global mix is shrinking, yet the absolute amount burned is close to historic highs because overall demand is so strong.

In China and India, coal plants remain heavily utilised even as both countries accelerate renewable energy deployment.

Solar and battery storage continue to lead new energy installations. Global solar generation rose 28.3%, with China adding more capacity in a single month than any other country has ever built in an entire year.

Battery systems are shifting the shape of the grid in markets such as California, where storage now meets roughly 20% of peak evening demand on some days. But Generation notes that even these gains are being absorbed by rising load requirements.

A shifting geopolitical landscape

The report argues that China is emerging as the leading force in clean technology because of an assertive industrial strategy and soaring exports of renewables and electric vehicles.

China’s emissions may be nearing their peak ahead of its 2030 target, and Generation labels the country a potential “electrostate”.

The report’s findings on heavy duty transport infrastructure are also relevant to the data centre sector. It notes that electric lorry charging networks remain “barely-started” in most countries, illustrating the broader gap between political commitments and actual on-the-ground delivery of large-scale power and grid upgrades.

This mirrors the challenges faced by digital infrastructure developers trying to secure substations, high voltage connections and sufficient renewable supply.

Similarly, aviation and shipping remain far from net zero pathways. Europe’s planned mandates for sustainable aviation fuels face financing obstacles, and even if all proposed SAF projects were completed, they would meet only a fraction of long-term demand.

Hydrogen, long promoted as a cross-sector solution, receives a particularly blunt assessment.

Generation argues that the green hydrogen bubble has “truly burst”, with many European projects cancelled or shelved and with widespread acknowledgement that industrial decarbonisation may have been delayed by misplaced enthusiasm.

Milpitas (USA) - SolarEdge reports strong demand in Germany just weeks after the market launch of its commercial CSS-OD storage system. According to the company, more than 150 orders have already been received, totaling over 15?MWh. Twelve systems have already been installed. This opens up a key growth market for the manufacturer, as companies increasingly focus on self-consumption.

The CSS-OD combines a battery cabinet with a capacity of 102.4 kWh and a 50 kW inverter. The solution is scalable up to 1 MWh per site and is suitable for both indoor and outdoor installations. For installers, this creates a new business field, as existing SolarEdge commercial and industrial systems can be easily expanded with storage.

“The market response to the CSS-OD has been exciting, creating a strong new revenue stream that taps into our leading C&I solar business. With many countries in Europe shifting away from net metering and becoming self-consumption markets, the commercial storage segment is steadily growing,” said Naama Ohana, Head of the Commercial & Industrial Division. She added that the strong response to the CSS-OD demonstrates the economic attractiveness of commercial storage solutions. This is further highlighted by record demand for the CSS-OD, which SolarEdge is seeing not only in Germany but across Europe.

One of the first installations took place at the solar installer WG Solar Concept in Baden-Württemberg. The company operates a 280 kWp rooftop system and has installed two CSS-OD units to optimize self-consumption. Managing Director Nils Rufle emphasizes that the system integrates “seamlessly” into the existing PV installation. According to the company, the combination of PV and storage now covers around 95 percent of its own energy needs, including heat pumps and charging infrastructure.

With this early market success, SolarEdge sees its position in the commercial energy storage segment, which is set for significant growth in Europe, strongly reinforced.

SolarEdge shares closed yesterday at €30.98 (26 November 2025, Stuttgart Stock Exchange closing price). Compared with the year-start price, this represents a 138 percent increase. SolarEdge currently ranks second among the top five stocks in the 2025 RENIXX ranking.

Conclusion Taken as a whole, the Autumn Budget 2025 combines tighter, more targeted sectoral taxation with emphasis on certain measures designed to unlock investment.","On 26 November 2025, the Chancellor, Rachel Reeves, delivered her second Budget. Facing a challenging fiscal landscape of stalled economic growth, above-target inflation, and high government borrowing, she emphasised the need to continue efforts to grow the economy and “build the industry of the future"". Stability, investment and reform were key themes of her speech, alongside energy and infrastructure. For businesses operating in the UK’s energy and infrastructure sectors, the Budget signals that the government is prepared to tighten sector-specific tax levers, whilst deploying measures to unlock investment. This publication highlights several of the most relevant measures, and offers initial observations on their implications for sponsors, investors, and lenders.

Oil & Gas and the North Sea Transition

The Chancellor confirmed plans for a new Oil and Gas Price Mechanism (OGPM) to replace the Energy Profits Levy (EPL) which is due to end by March 2030, but could end earlier if the EPL’s price floor (called the “Energy Security Investment Mechanism”) is triggered. Like the levy, the OGPM is intended to act as a windfall tax on upstream oil and gas companies operating in the UK/UKCS and will apply to disposals of oil or gas when the consideration received is unusually high. The new mechanism will be revenue-based and apply an additional tax rate of 35% above price thresholds of $90/barrel for oil and £0.90/therm for gas (indexed to CPI). The OGPM will be a permanent measure, to be introduced in the next Finance Bill after consultation on draft legislation and implementation and coming into effect when the EPL ends. More immediately, legislation will be included in Finance Bill 2025/26 to confirm that no payment under a decommissioning relief deed (DRD) can arise in relation to the EPL for decommissioning expenditure incurred on or after 26 November 2025. The OPGM legislation will also ensure no payments under a DRD regime can be made in respect of the OGPM.

The announcement of a new North Sea Future Plan to support ongoing investment in the North Sea provided a counterpoint for the UK’s offshore industries. The plan envisages that, alongside oil and gas production from existing fields, the North Sea’s energy future will be focused on three key clean energy sectors: offshore wind; carbon capture, usage and storage (CCUS); and hydrogen. As part of this new North Sea strategy, the government will introduce new Transitional Energy Certificates. Administered by the North Sea Transition Authority, they will enable limited oil and gas production on or near existing fields - so long as this additional production does not require new exploration, is already part of, or is adjacent to, existing fields and infrastructure and the activity is necessary for a managed, prosperous and orderly transition.

In relation to refineries, the government is also considering the feasibility and impacts of including refined products in the Carbon Border Adjustment Mechanism (CBAM) in future.

Reducing Energy Bills

The Chancellor has prioritised lowering energy bills for consumers by removing some social and environmental levies funding a range of schemes. This includes ending the Energy Company Obligation which is currently funded through bills. In addition, the government will fund 75% of the domestic cost of the legacy Renewables Obligation for three years, and extend the £150 Warm Home Discount to a further 3 million of the poorest households. Taken together, these changes mark a modest, but symbolically important shift away from funding legacy low-carbon and social schemes solely through electricity bills and towards broader-based Exchequer funding, easing pressure on electricity prices while reopening questions about who ultimately bears the cost of decarbonisation policies.

In relation to road transport, the government is extending the 5p fuel duty cut until the end of August 2026 with rates then gradually returning to March 2022 levels by March 2027. The planned increase in line with inflation for 2026-27 will also be cancelled. Alongside the introduction of Fuel Finder, these measures are expected to save families £89 next year compared to previous plans.

Support is also offered to industrial energy consumers struggling with the high cost of power. From 2027, the British Industrial Competitiveness Scheme will reduce electricity costs by c.£35-40/MWh. In line with the government’s Modern Industrial Strategy, the scheme will benefit manufacturing, electricity intensive frontier industries such as automotive and aerospace, and foundational manufacturing industries in their supply chains, such as chemicals. The Department for Business and Trade launched a consultation in November to determine design and eligibility for the scheme. Under the proposals, eligible business activity would be exempt from the cost of the Renewables Obligation, Feed-in Tariff and Capacity Market schemes (in addition to other support received under measures for energy intensive industries).

Low Carbon Technologies

The government continues to see clean energy and low carbon technologies as drivers of economic growth. Alongside support for hydrogen, CCUS and offshore wind highlighted in the North Sea Future Plan, the Budget makes changes to the treatment of electrolytic hydrogen in the Climate Change Levy (CCL). Following a consultation at Spring Statement 2025, both electricity used in electrolysis to produce hydrogen and natural gas used as a source of CO2 in the production of sodium bicarbonate will be made exempt from CCL costs. Exempting electricity used for electrolysis would improve the operating cost profile of green hydrogen projects. Subject to parliamentary approval, these amendments will be in force by Spring 2026.

In addition, the Chancellor announced that the government is investing £14.5m in Grangemouth, Scotland to support investment opportunities and industrial projects which can create new jobs. The former oil refinery stopped processing crude oil in April, and although the Budget does not set out details, the site has previously been earmarked for redevelopment, including as a low carbon energy hub. Further detail on the delivery model - including any role for the National Wealth Fund or blended finance structures - will be important for investors assessing opportunities linked to CCUS, hydrogen, or wider decarbonisation in the region.

Nuclear

Reflecting its key role in the government’s Clean Energy Superpower Mission, the nuclear sector featured prominently in the Budget. The Green Financing Framework has been updated to include nuclear energy in the list of eligible expenditures for green financing (with some exclusions), including green gilts and retail Green Saving Bonds. The proceeds from sales of green gilts and Green Savings Bonds issued prior to 27 November 2025 will not be allocated to nuclear energy-related expenditures. A Second Party Opinion from S&P reportedly rates the new Framework as dark green, their highest rating, and an improvement on the Framework’s original rating in 2021. For investors, this recognition widens the pool of capital that can treat nuclear-related expenditure as “green” within UK-labelled instruments, aligns the UK more closely with jurisdictions that recognise nuclear as a low-carbon technology, and may over time influence how institutional investors with strict green mandates calibrate their exposure through nuclear assets.

Having reached financial close for the Sizewell C nuclear power plant and announced the UK’s first small modular reactor project at Wylfa in North Wales earlier this month, the government also committed in the Budget to “continue to identify potential sites for large-scale nuclear power”. In addition, responding to recommendations laid out in the Nuclear Regulatory Review 2025 (published by the Nuclear Regulatory Taskforce on 24 November), the government confirmed its aim to present a full implementation plan within three months and to complete sector reforms within the next two years, subject to legislative timelines. These reforms will be designed to “regulate nuclear in a way that promotes better delivery without compromising safety”. For the nuclear supply chain, the combination of a clear reform timetable and an expanded pipeline of large-scale and advanced projects should help derisk investment in skills, manufacturing capacity, and components.

Building on this, the Prime Minister also used the Budget to issue a Strategic Steer, setting out expectations for the civil, defence, and decommissioning sectors to accelerate safe and efficient delivery through proportionate regulation and stronger collaboration. The government wants to avoid a “nuclear gap by enabling existing stations to continue running where demonstrably safe, such as through the potential 20-year lifetime extension of Sizewell B, and by getting Hinkley Point C and Sizewell C online as soon as possible”. An Advanced Nuclear Framework is due to be published shortly to provide a pathway for privately-led advanced nuclear technologies with Great British Energy - Nuclear assessing project proposals, the National Wealth Fund exploring potential investment opportunities and the Department for Energy Security and Net Zero (DESNZ) exploring revenue support for viable projects.

Grid

Recognising that connections to the electricity grid remain one of the biggest blockers in delivering key growth projects across the economy, the government notes that it is working with Ofgem and the National Energy System Operator (NESO) to overhaul connection processes. This work is said to include exploring enhanced entry and membership requirements to ensure viable projects progress in the demand queue; reducing the time to power by exploring self-build for high voltage grid infrastructure and more flexible connections where possible; and removing speculative demand in the grid connection queue, with the Department for Science, Innovation and Technology (DSIT) to produce a strategic plan for data centres to ensure only the most strategic and credible projects are taken forward. New powers in the government’s flagship Planning and Infrastructure Bill are also set to create mechanisms to reallocate released capacity and reserve future capacity for strategically important demand projects.

Transport

The Chancellor’s tax-led efforts to generate revenue for the government have been extended to the electric vehicle (EV) sector. A new mileage charge, the Electric Vehicle Excise Duty (eVED), will be introduced at a rate of 3p per mile for battery electric cars and 1.5p for plug-in hybrid cars from April 2028. This will allow the government to invest a further £200m in EV charging points. Drivers will pay for their mileage alongside their existing vehicle excise duty. From 2028, this will begin to erode one of the fiscal advantages of EVs over internal combustion engine vehicles, and will be an important factor in total-cost-of-ownership models for fleet operators and mobility providers.

At the same time, the government has launched a consultation on reforming permitted development rights to make it easier and cheaper to install EV charging infrastructure such as upstands and cross-pavement solutions. It has also said it will review the cost of public EV charging, looking at the impact of energy prices, wider cost contributors, and options for lowering these costs for consumers. The review will start in Q1 2026 and report by Q3 2026.

Noting that ""infrastructure is the backbone of economic growth across our country”, the Chancellor confirmed support for a number of key projects across Great Britain. These include the Docklands Light Rail, which will be extended to Thamesmead, funded by Transport for London and Greater London Authority, “with the government also contributing over the long term”.

The government is also committing a further £891 million to complete the publicly funded works for the Lower Thames Crossing, described as “the largest roadbuilding project for a generation”, improving links between the Midlands, North and ports in the South East. As part of its staged approach, the final tranche of government support will enable the private sector to take forward construction and long-term operation. The government’s preferred financing option at this stage is the Regulated Asset Base (RAB) model. The project will be taken forward on that basis, with formal market engagement launching in 2026. This confirms the government’s willingness to deploy the RAB model in the transport sector, which may be of interest to infrastructure funds and lenders already familiar with the regime from nuclear and other regulated infrastructure.

At Budget, the government also approved the full business case for Forth Green Freeport, which aims to leverage £7.9 billion of investment over 10 years and create up to 16,000 direct jobs. A Memorandum of Understanding can now be signed with the Scottish Government, enabling the release of £25 million of government seed capital funding. Green energy and advanced manufacturing businesses located on the Freeport’s tax sites will benefit from a range of tax reliefs and incentives. The Freeport will boost UK production of clean energy and sustainable fuels, including offshore wind energy.

In relation to aviation, the government is making rapid progress in enabling the delivery of an operational third runway at Heathrow by 2035. In October, the Department for Transport launched a review of the Airports National Policy Statement (ANPS) and in November identified the scheme promoted by Heathrow Airport Ltd as the scheme to take forward to inform the ongoing review of the ANPS. The government will consult on any amendments to the ANPS by July 2026. The Budget also affirmed that “Heathrow expansion will be entirely privately financed, with no cost to the taxpayer”.

Other measures have been designed to offer support to transport users. These include the introduction of a one-year freeze of regulated rail fares – for the first time in 30 years – saving commuters on the more expensive routes more than £300 per year. As mentioned above, the Chancellor has also chosen to continue the freeze on fuel duty until September 2026 and retain the temporary 5p cut introduced by the previous government at the start of the war in Ukraine.

Social and defence infrastructure

Beyond transport infrastructure, the Budget restated the government’s commitment to invest in new infrastructure across sectors such as social housing, health, education and defence. It announced plans for 250 new Neighbourhood Health Centres and upgrades to existing buildings through a combination of public sector investment and a new model of Public-Private Partnerships (currently being developed by the National Infrastructure and Service Transformation Authority). Privately financed projects and programmes – including PPPs – will also be considered for projects that decarbonise the public sector estate.

With regard to the defence sector, the government plans to invest in accommodation with £1.5bn this Parliament and a total of £9bn over the next decade. It also aims to identify potential sites for the construction of 13 new munitions factories.

Across education, the government has committed to expanding the School Rebuilding Programme, providing almost £20 billion investment from 2025‑26 to 2034-35.

The government will continue to consider the ways in which private finance can support the delivery of wider infrastructure ambitions including leveraging private finance to help deliver the next generation of new towns.

Digital infrastructure

In addition to its support for previously announced AI Growth Zones, the government notes that it is investing up to £2 billion between now and 2030 to build a modern public compute ecosystem, ensuring that this country’s start-up and research and development communities have the necessary access to cutting-edge public compute. This includes over £1 billion to expand the AI Research Resource programme 20 times by 2030, up to £750 million for a new national supercomputer service at the Edinburgh Parallel Computing Centre (due to come online in 2027), and an up to £100 million advance market commitment to purchase novel compute.

Other measures

The government will launch a Strategic Asset Review to report before the next spending review, which will identify opportunities to monetise assets and address barriers to disposals. Both this and the value-for-money review into the maintenance of public sector assets will be informed by the Balance Sheet Framework, setting out for the first time a comprehensive approach to managing the assets and liabilities that the government holds on behalf of the taxpayer. Alongside this, HS2 Ltd is undertaking a sprint project that aims to identify and unlock opportunities for early release of land currently held for HS2 between London and Birmingham, around its stations and depot hub. This work is part of the reset of the HS2 programme and will support both regeneration and economic growth.

Conclusion

Taken as a whole, the Autumn Budget 2025 combines tighter, more targeted sectoral taxation with emphasis on certain measures designed to unlock investment. For energy and infrastructure sector participants, the immediate task is to map these measures against project and portfolio pipelines - from upstream oil and gas, hydrogen, CCUS, and nuclear, through grid, transport, and social infrastructure, to digital and data centre investments - and to position early for the consultations, funding streams, and regulatory changes that will determine which projects move fastest in the next phase of the UK’s transition and growth story.",https://www.slaughterandmay.com/media/mnmdelgq/default-share.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 13:02:09.645813

Proceeds from this round will be used to scale manufacturing capacity to 3 GWh, set up an automated facility for electric four-wheelers at Chakan near Pune, deepen research and development, and fuel domestic as well as international expansion.

The company is currently targeting a revenue of INR 200 Cr for the year, with future projections set at INR 900 Cr, as it aims to further its position in the rapidly growing Indian EV market.

Founded by CEO Pratik Kamdar, Neuron Energy offers a comprehensive range of electric mobility solutions, including lead-acid, advanced lithium-ion, and sodium-ion batteries.

Earlier focussed on two-wheeler EV batteries, Neuron is now expanding into batteries for four-wheelers and buses, emphasising high-quality, rigorously tested lithium-ion and next-gen sodium-ion solutions.

Neuron Energy last raised INR 20 Cr (about $2.3 Mn) in its Series A funding round from existing investor Chona Family Office and Capri Global Family Office last year. Prior to that, it raised INR 20 Cr in a pre-Series A round led by Equanimity Investments and the Rajiv Dadlani Group.

Including the Pre Series B round, Neuron Energy has raised INR 80 Cr till date.

The development comes at a time when EV and EV battery startups in India are seeing strong growth as the demand for cleaner mobility and energy-efficient transportation rises.

These companies are not just assembling vehicles but developing new solutions such as longer-lasting lithium-ion batteries, advanced battery management systems, battery swapping networks and charging infrastructure tailored for Indian conditions.

With government incentives, falling battery prices and increasing adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers, the ecosystem has become fertile for innovation. Investors are also backing the sector as both consumer demand and industrial applications expand.

EV major Ola Electric recently shifted its focus to battery manufacturing with rollouts of its own in-house 4680 “Bharat Cell” lithium ion batteries. The company is also eyeing to vertically integrate cell production to bring down its EV costs and reduce reliance on imports.

The Energy Assessment Tool (EAT) supports Google’s wider push to cut emissions and improve efficiency across its supply chain, including within its own data centre network.

The International Energy Agency (IEA) refers to energy efficiency as the “first fuel” in clean energy transitions due to its role in delivering fast and effective CO₂ reductions.

In data centres, where energy demand continues to rise alongside AI workloads, efficiency measures help operators reduce environmental impact while managing costs.

Kate Brandt, Google’s Chief Sustainability Officer, writes on LinkedIn: “We’re launching a tool that I wish I had access to early in my career as a sustainability leader.

“By equipping our partners with the right resources, we can accelerate progress, reduce costs and build a more efficient and resilient supply chain for everyone.”

Energy Assessment Tool for non-experts

Google’s EAT is designed to remove the common barriers that prevent energy efficiency projects from being implemented.

These include high consultancy costs, limited funding and a lack of internal expertise.

By targeting facility and plant managers, the platform encourages basic assessments without the need for a site visit or background in energy engineering.

The tool provides custom recommendations based on information such as facility size, equipment type and operational hours.

It covers more than 20 system categories including air compressors, lighting, boilers and chillers. In doing so, it offers insights that would typically require a professional audit, aligned to the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE) Level 1 standard.

Google confirms that the tool is powered by calculation methods and datasets developed by engineering firms with long-standing industry knowledge. That means facility operators can run assessments that would normally be out of reach without investment in external consultants.

The system is designed to support multiple languages including Chinese (simplified and traditional), Vietnamese, Thai and English, with plans to extend access across key manufacturing and industrial regions.

Individual supplier data remains private and confidential. Google confirms the platform is managed by a third party and reviewed to meet its internal privacy and security requirements.

Facility managers and suppliers can choose which partners to collaborate with and what data to share, such as potential energy and cost savings.

Extending energy efficiency across data centres

Although the tool is aimed at manufacturing and supply chain partners, Google also applies the same principles to its own data centres.

These sites are among the most efficient globally, and the company continues to reduce the energy intensity of its infrastructure.

Google’s custom-built AI chips have improved in power efficiency over time, helping it deliver larger workloads with reduced energy input.

In terms of cooling, Google has adopted methods like direct-to-chip systems to reduce the reliance on traditional air conditioning and minimise water use. It also integrates native planting and restoration projects around data centre locations to support biodiversity and local ecosystems.

Google includes energy efficiency in a wider sustainability strategy, which also covers responsible water use, circular design in consumer products and hardware repairability.

The company works toward minimising waste in its operations and promoting reuse of materials where possible.

As a leading corporate buyer of clean energy, Google already procures large-scale renewable power and is investing in early-stage technologies such as advanced nuclear, enhanced geothermal and grid-support innovations.

State environmental officials issued the air quality permit, after indicating the proposed facility meets regulatory guidelines – including those restricting greenhouse gas emissions.
“Receiving air quality plan approval is a major milestone for our team, our partners, and the entire region,” said Corey Hessen, CEO of Homer City Generation.
DEP officials approved a plan that added 53 new conditions beyond the standard state air quality regulations, state officials said this fall.","HOMER CITY, Pa. – A Philadelphia- based environmental group may appeal a Department of Environmental Protection decision set to award an air quality permit for a proposed $10 billion Indiana County “energy campus” data center.

Even while requiring Homer City Development to increase some additional monitoring measures, the state’s “fast-tracked” permit will allow an alarming level of “volatile organic compounds” into the environment – for very little benefit, Clean Air Council Executive Director Alex Bomstein said.

“These are compounds that contribute to smog and ozone issues,” Bomstein said. “Any over time, they can lead to all kinds of health issues.”

For all of its foul pollution, Homer City’s previous coal-fired power plant was capable of generating enough power to support up to 2 million homes, he said.

“This (new) plant isn’t being designed to heat homes and run the lights in Pennsylvania. It’s primarily going to run an AI data center to relieve people of their jobs,” he said.

“We’ll be getting millions of tons of pollution without any of the benefit.”

State officials and the Homer City project’s developers view the project far differently.

State environmental officials issued the air quality permit, after indicating the proposed facility meets regulatory guidelines – including those restricting greenhouse gas emissions.

Project developers, meanwhile, say the up to 4.4 gigawatt facility will transform the community by creating approximately 200 “high-paying jobs” and leading to hundreds more to support the business in Indiana County, planners said.

Approximately 3,000 laborers in the trades will likely be needed to build the power generating station and data center on 3,200 acres approximately 26 miles northwest of Johnstown.

“Receiving air quality plan approval is a major milestone for our team, our partners, and the entire region,” said Corey Hessen, CEO of Homer City Generation. “We truly appreciate the efforts of both Governor Shapiro’s office, which helped move this process forward, and the expert team at PA DEP, who diligently reviewed our application to ensure that the project would proceed in full compliance with Pennsylvania’s air quality regulations.”

The facility will also be designed to produce energy for the power grid. But AI, or artificial intelligence, technology requires massive amounts of electricity and the project’s primary intent is to help feed that need, developers have said.

Environmental groups worry the technology – and data centers they require – will drive up the cost of electricity.

Bomstein noted that groups like the Clean Air Council have 30 days to file an appeal to the permit – and other regulatory hurdles must be cleared before the project can go to construction.

The high level of carbons that would be emitted into the air by the plant – not just over Pennsylvania but across multiple states – are one key concern, he said.

If these ranges rise to the maximum the state allows, we could be talking about $508 million in health-(related) harms annually ... from this pollution,” Bomstein said.

He estimated the projected cost in “health” harms at up to $211 million in Pennsylvania.

The Homer City project’s planners have said the new plant will cut greenhouse emissions by 65% compared to the previous plant, which was known as a top polluter in Pennsylvania.

Bomstein said it’s clear certain pollutants, such as Sulphur dioxide emissions, would drop.

But the potential level of ammonia – the same substance found in products such as window cleaner – would rise substantially if they reach permitted levels, he said, citing eye and respiratory dangers.

He said those levels could exceed legal limits. The Clean Air Council wants to see more steps taken to ensure excessive amounts of the substance aren’t being emitted into the environment.

Bomstein credited Department of Environmental Protection officials for requiring increased testing of the emissions that will rise from the plant’s towering stacks.

As initially outlined, that certain pollution would have been measured every five years. The DEP will instead require it every three years, he said.

DEP officials approved a plan that added 53 new conditions beyond the standard state air quality regulations, state officials said this fall.

That includes requiring that the “best available control” measures be used in the future and to enhance certain record-keeping and post start-up testing measures, a notice in the Pa. Bulletin shows.

But there are still a number of other complaints that weren’t addressed, he added.

“This is just something you can’t let go,” Bomstein said.

“That’s why the community and groups like ours will keep fighting.”",https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/social/images/yahoo_default_logo-1200x1200.png,N,,2025-11-27 13:03:33.051786

It represents a significant step for South Africa’s energy transition and for the future of Mpumalanga as a renewable-energy hub. Seriti is proud to contribute to infrastructure that supports a safer and more sustainable national energy system.”

The station and the 900-MW program sit in Mpumalanga, the historical center of South Africa’s coal industry. The region hosts a large share of the country’s coal-fired power plants and therefore plays a central role in the national decarbonization agenda.

The project carries symbolic and strategic weight for the country. South Africa has pledged to reduce its dependence on coal and recently outlined a long-term electricity plan in which low-carbon sources will overtake coal for the first time.

The government plans to add 11,270 MW of solar PV, 7,340 MW of wind, 6,000 MW of gas, and 5,200 MW of nuclear capacity by 2030. Policymakers expect Mpumalanga to absorb a significant share of this transformation through repurposed sites and new renewable installations.

In April, Generadora Metropolitano announced that a 15-year power purchase agreement (PPA) had been signed with Chilean mining company Codelco for the supply of 100% renewable energy from the Dune Plus facilities.

The PPA term begins January 2026 and will cover the supply of 1,000GWh of electricity each year to power Codelco’s mining operations. The company has awarded more than 3,000GWh of annual contracts for renewables in the past two years and is targeting 100% electricity supply from renewable sources by 2030.

The Atacama Desert region has some of the highest annual solar irradiation levels in the world, making it a prime location for solar PV development and has enabled Chile to become one of the leading adopters of the technology in Latin America.

In turn, this has led to the adoption of energy storage technologies, primarily for energy shifting applications and with typical durations of 4-hour or 5-hour.

At the Energy Storage Summit Latin America 2025 in September, Ana Lía Rojas, executive director at the Chilean renewable energy and energy storage association (ACERA), said that in 2024, 2.2TWh of new solar PV generation was added to the national grid, but curtailment of solar increased by 2.7TWh.

Chile is adopting energy storage technologies so quickly that then-energy minister Diego Pardow Lorenzo said at the summit, hosted by our publisher Solar Media in the national capital Santiago, that the country will surpass its 2GW by 2030 BESS deployment policy target by January next year, and its 2050 target of 6GW by 2027.

The Antofagasta region, meanwhile, is rich in mineral wealth and one of the world’s most significant mining areas for copper and lithium.

Generadora Metropolitano launched with the acquisition of four backup power plants from AES Gener, the regional subsidiary of AES Corporation, in 2018. Two diesel-fired power plants in that portfolio have since been closed. The company, now focused on low-carbon technologies has to date developed four PV plants in the country with 1,030MW total generation capacity.

Dune Plus marks the first battery storage projects for the JV between French state-owned power company EDF and Chilean developer AME.

Financing for Dune Plus has been closed with backing from international banks BNP Paribas Securities, Credit Agricole Corporate and Investment Bank, MUFG, Societe General and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking, under a non-recourse project finance structure.

The EIA expects OPEC+ will produce at about 1.5 Mb/d below their target in 2026.

WTI oil price was revised $2/b higher in 2026 than last month’s STEO.

Refinery margin (profits) are expected to increase in 2025 and 2026 for both gasoline and diesel fuel.

Natural gas prices for residential consumers are expected to rise only by 2% this winter to $13.80/MCF.

A warmer winter is expected in 2025/2026 leading to lower consumption of natural gas compared to last winter.

Growth in electric power consumption is concentrated in the West South Central Region (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, and Arkansas) with 34% of all US growth coming from this region in 2025 and 66% in 2026. For the US as a whole electricity sales increase by 2.4% in 2025 and by 2.6% in 2026.

OECD stocks rise to the early 2021 level by the end of 2026.

US natural gas output jumps by 5.1 BCF/d in 2025 (4.4%).

Consumption of natural gas rises by 1.3% in 2025 and is roughly flat in 2026.

Most of the increased natural gas output is exported with exports increasing by 4.5 BCF/d from 2024 to 2026, an increase of 36% over 2 years (a 26.4% increase in 2025 and a 7.6% increase in 2026 natural gas exports).

For the past 12 months tight oil output has been pretty flat.

In the Permian scenarios above I try to match the AEO 2025 reference case for the Southwest region with non-Permian C+C and Permian conventional oil deducted (about 800 kb/d for 2024 to 2050). The Permian Garzon case uses analysis by Jorge Garzon from Novi Labs on Tier 1 and Tier 2 remaining locations in the Permian Basin to arrive at a total of 107 thousand wells. For that scenario low oil prices are assumed (under $70/b in 2025 $) so that lower tier locations are not profitable to drill and complete. The medium scenario assumes higher oil prices up to $85/b in 2025$ so that some tier 3 and lower wells are completed (about 33 thousand of them). The high scenario assumes even higher prices (perhaps up to $120/b in 2025$) with another 42 thousand wells more than the medium scenario completed. Note that about 55 thousand wells had been completed by June 30, 2025.

In the grand scheme there are about 1500 Gb of remaining C+C global resources so the difference of 21 Gb between the low and high Permian scenarios is small, less than 1.5% of remaining crude oil resources. Note that from 2012 to 2024 about 95% of the increase in World C+C came from Permian Basin tight oil (5080 of 5341 kb/d of the World C+C increase from 2012 to 2024).

In generations past, bubbles of overbuilding in railroads and fiberoptic networks and even gas turbines took years to absorb, and bankrupted plenty of operators.","Tech giants want to double A.I. electricity consumption in 5 years by enough to power more than 30 million homes. America can do it.

Between now and 2030, the giants of A.I. like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft, Amazon and Meta aim to more than double the computing power dedicated to growing and operating their non-human minds. They currently use about 40 gigawatts of power, enough for 30 million homes.

The cost of this ambition will be astronomical — about $50 billion per gigawatt of computing power built for a total of $2.5 trillion over the next five years alone. Roughly 80% of that will go to buy GPUs made by the likes of Nvidia and AMD; the rest — some $500 billion — will provide the energy via new power plants and transmission lines.

At the trajectory these hyperscalers are on, Goldman Sachs figures that by 2030 American datacenters will consume 500 terawatt hours per year — more than 10% of total domestic electricity. “I think we should already be raising the alarm on the potential for facilities to complete construction but be without power in 2028 and 2029,” says Zach Krause, an analyst at East Daley, a Denver energy consultancy. “I hope they don’t march into a wall.”

Some already have. In Oregon, Amazon Data Services has filed a complaint against Berkshire Hathaway subsidiary Pacificorp, which has refused to provide power to energize some of Amazon's $30 billion in data center investments there. In Santa Clara, Calif. two 50 megawatt centers developed by Digital Realty and Stack Infrastructure are ready to go but can’t get electricity until Silicon Valley Power completes $450 million in grid upgrades – not expected until 2028 or later. Faced with new demand for 30 gigawatts of power, utility AES in Ohio told developers they had to enter into long term contracts to buy 85% of the power they want. (The queue dropped by more than half to just 13 GW).

Amid the doomsday scenarios are optimists. Joseph Majkut, director of energy security at CSIS, writes in a new report that this is a nice problem for the United States to face, and overcome: “Rapid demand growth should be good news. Despite trade conflicts and macroeconomic uncertainty, the United States is positioned to power more economic growth and strategic industries than we’ve seen in decades.”

“A lot of people are saying power is the constraint. Increasingly we believe that is not necessarily true,” says Carson Kearl, power markets analyst at Enverus in Calgary. He thinks building enough, fast enough shouldn’t be a problem. ""The initial reaction is one of disbelief,"" he says. ""But there's a lot of excess capacity in the market,"" if you locate your project in the right place.

Alex Tang of VC firm 50 Years agrees. ""If a hyperscaler has committed to it, it's going to happen,"" says Tang, who has invested in nuclear, batteries and solar startups. ""We are one of the most efficient capital markets. We have shifted on a dime and can stand up a massive effort."" According to federal data the U.S. built 40 GW of new power plants in 2023, and is on track to erect 63 GW this year — half of which will be solar panels.

Plenty of datacenter developers are taking the situation into their own hands, building their own power generation on site rather than relying on utility companies to hook them up. These ""behind-the-meter"" generators are especially prevalent in Texas, which has its own power grid that isn't subject to federal regulatory oversight enabling easier permitting. In Abilene, Texas, the Stargate project being developed by OpenAI, SoftBank, Oracle and investment firm MGX is building 10 gas turbines to serve as backup power.

Unexpected entrants into this space include the big oil companies, which aim to arbitrage the price difference of their low-value gas against high-value electricity. Chevron plans to build 5 GW of gas turbines for datacenters by 2027 in the Permian Basin of Texas where gas is so plentiful that prices at the Waha pipeline hub have gone negative this year. Giant oil companies, which already operate dozens of power plants at their refineries, will be able to lean on vendors for utility-scale turbines.

Others face 4-year wait times for big turbines from the likes of G.E. Vernova, Siemens and Hitachi. So they have turned to other options. Private equity giant Brookfield inked a $5 billion deal with Bloom Energy for their fuel cells that run on gas. Meanwhile, Elon Musk's xAI, for its Memphis, Tennessee data center, has deployed dozens of smaller gas turbines (~30 megawatts) procured from Caterpillar subsidiary Solar Turbines. Kearl at Enverus thinks developers will be able to source an impressive 25 GW a year of smaller-size gas generators.

Natural gas will power about 60% of all this new datacenter demand, says Goldman Sachs. Such a domestic natural gas building boom is not unprecedented. According to the Energy Information Administration, in 2002 developers added 57 GW of gas turbines to the grid, led by independent power producer Calpine, which subsequently went bankrupt in 2005 due to surging natural gas prices amid tight supplies. (The company is now being acquired by Constellation Energy).

Demand from A.I. could even give coal a second life. Usage has ticked up in the past year as Trump’s EPA has proposed to repeal Biden-era anti-coal rules. Officials in Pueblo County, Colorado recently asked Xcel Energy to delay the closingCK of two coal plants until replacements have been found.

Longer term, a renaissance in nuclear power will also ensure ample electricity. Meta, Microsoft and Amazon have all contracted for years of power from decades-old nuclear reactors, and Constellation Energy even landed a federal loan guarantee to restart a mothballed reactor at Three Mile Island.

New nukes are in the works as well. Westinghouse and Brookfield landed federal backing to build $80 billion of new AP1000 reactors, while a dozen startups are working on new small modular reactors. Trump’s energy secretary Chris Wright wants to see nuclear reactors and datacenters built on federally owned lands, particularly military installations that could benefit from redundant power supplies in exchange for easy permitting.

International energy consultancy WoodMackenzie, forecasts that A.I. will help find even more energy than it uses. The firm took decades of data on 2,500 of the world’s biggest oil and gas fields, then fed it into a proprietary A.I. Using “integrative modeling,” the A.I. showed how the industry could boost global oil reserves by 500 billion barrels by applying best techniques to newer fields.

Likewise, Rocky Mountain Institute says plenty more power can be unlocked (50 GW or more) by increasing grid efficiencies, upgrading high-voltage transmission lines, and creating so-called “demand response” programs, where big customers agree to curtail electricity use during times of peak demand. Researchers at Duke University figure that if datacenter operators agreed to dial back power use during just 1% of their expected uptime, it would have the effect of giving the power grid “curtailment-enabled headroom” to the tune of 125 GW.

It's easy to be a naysayer. In generations past, bubbles of overbuilding in railroads and fiberoptic networks and even gas turbines took years to absorb, and bankrupted plenty of operators. But this isn't subprime lending — the data center building boom is backed by the richest companies and most powerful government in the world. If they need more electricity to remain dominant in A.I. (and protect their market capitalizations), they will find a way.

The abundance of renewable energy makes climate-friendly production significantly cheaper in other regions than in Germany.
For example, procurement costs for green ammonia of approximately 693 euros per tonne are expected in Namibia by 2035, compared to some 1,130 euros in Germany.
The report examined three value chain options for green ammonia: production entirely located in Germany, a route using hydrogen imports from Spain, and a route using ammonia imports from Namibia, which is then processed in Germany.","The production of fertilisers with fossil fuels has no future in Germany given the country's climate targets, according to a report by the German Energy Agency (Dena) in cooperation with the Climate Neutrality Foundation (SKN), which outlines a roadmap for the transition to using green ammonia instead.

However, the relocation of a large portion of the industry abroad is unavoidable in the long term because renewable electricity will remain more expensive in Germany compared to sunnier or windier regions such as Spain or Namibia, according to the report.

Ammonia is a key ingredient in fertilisers and traditionally made with fossil gas. Green ammonia is made on the basis of green hydrogen, which is produced with electrolysis using renewable electricity.

Green fertiliser production should nevertheless be established domestically and maintained through policy measures to reduce geopolitical risks and secure supply, the authors argued.

“The fertiliser industry is a key sector of German industry – and at the same time heavily dependent on fossil natural gas,” said SKN director Rainer Baake. “Anyone who wants to keep this industry in Germany must restructure it so that it can operate without fossil fuels by the mid-2040s at the latest.”

In view of Germany’s 2045 climate neutrality target and the expiration of free emission allowances for the fertiliser industry under the European Emissions Trading System (ETS) by 2039, the report argues that new supply chains must be established for imports from sunny and wind-rich countries to facilitate the transition.

Minister for the State Electricity Commission Lily D’Ambrosio visited the site today to see the installation of a 162.5 tonne transformer that will connect the park to the grid and help drive down energy prices for families.

The project’s 212,296 solar panels and a 100-megawatt, two-hour battery system will have enough to power more than 51,000 homes each year. It will be among Australia’s first integrated solar and battery energy storage systems (BESS) connected through a single grid connection point.

The new battery provides additional energy capacity to the grid, enabling 180-megawatts of new renewable generation to be connected to the grid, further pushing energy prices down.

This is Victoria’s first 100 per cent government-owned energy generator since the Jeff Kennett’s Liberal Party sold the state’s energy system to private companies that sent much of the profits offshore.

Work will continue into next year, ahead of the project becoming operational in 2027. More than 200 people have been employed on the site to date, including local tradespeople from the community and surrounding areas.

The project is also giving apprentices and trainees valuable hands-on experience in Victoria’s growing renewable energy sector – creating local jobs and building skills that will benefit the community.

SEC and its construction partners OX2 and PSD continue to engage with local jobseekers for upcoming roles as work progresses.

SEC is working with the Horsham community to shape a Community Benefit Fund, ensuring the project delivers long-term value for the region and the fund will be launched next year.

SEC recently announced plans to increase the fund to $100,000 a year and will now invest $3 million in local projects, initiatives and services over the 30-year operational life of the project.

The financing round is anchored by Infinite Grid Capital (IGC), which has committed $10m as part of a long-term strategic relationship aimed at accelerating NeoVolta’s next phase of growth.

The funding is designed to support NeoVolta’s planned entry into large-scale U.S. production. A substantial portion of the capital is earmarked for a proposed state-of-the-art manufacturing facility in Georgia, outlined in a memorandum of understanding with third-party partners. If finalized, the plant would be built with an initial annual capacity of around 2 GWh, focusing on utility-level and commercial and industrial (C&I) battery energy storage systems. The company expects operations could begin ramping up in 2026, pending definitive agreements.

The initiative would position NeoVolta to benefit from federal incentives encouraging domestic battery production and supply-chain resilience — a priority for both U.S. energy policy and companies seeking to reduce dependence on imported storage technologies. The expansion would also strengthen the country’s industrial base by adding new manufacturing capabilities in a sector seeing rapid demand growth due to grid modernization, electrification, and extreme-weather resilience needs.

NeoVolta CEO Ardes Johnson said the investment arrives at a pivotal moment for the company’s U.S. manufacturing strategy. “IGC is well-capitalized and highly aligned with our vision as we advance our domestic manufacturing plans and scale our commercial and grid-aligned channels,” Johnson said. “The investment delivers the capital and support we need while preserving the flexibility essential to our next phase of growth.”

China currently accounts for over 80% of the global production of battery materials.
Recycling will increasingly play a key role, and Redwood Materials already controls roughly 90% of lithium-ion battery recycling in North America—the equivalent of 250,000 EV batteries per year.
Still, that 90% equals only about 10% of the EV battery deployment in the U.S. each year.
“The end goal is creating a circular economy where recycling—not mining—becomes the primary source of the minerals,” Straubel said.","Tesla cofounder JB Straubel served as the brains behind the battery development for the electric vehicle giant, and he saw firsthand the massive amounts of critical minerals that are potentially wasted when it comes time to retire each EV—raw materials ripe for recycling and redeploying.

China dominates most of the world’s critical mineral supply chains. Each EV battery represents a treasure trove of lithium, cobalt, copper, nickel, and more that can be reused for brand-new batteries for energy storage and all sorts of devices from AI data centers to military equipment to smartphones and computers. There are 60 natural elements deemed “critical minerals” by the U.S. government, and America only produces a small minority of them.

Straubel founded Redwood Materials in 2017, which is rapidly expanding and has grown into the United States’ first line of defense for recycling critical minerals in the potential supply-chain cold war with China—now at a temporary truce.

“Being able to tap into materials that are already in the market can dramatically reduce the pressure on what’s needed to mine,” Straubel told Fortune. “Once you have some diversity of supply, you reduce the risk of the [Chinese] monopoly and the geopolitical concentration.”

Since the U.S. launched a tariff war earlier this year and China threatened to withhold certain critical minerals, the U.S. has aggressively emphasized investments and partnerships for developing its own critical minerals mining, refining, recycling, and magnet and battery manufacturing. China currently accounts for over 80% of the global production of battery materials.

The U.S. can’t just open a dozen new mines overnight. Recycling will increasingly play a key role, and Redwood Materials already controls roughly 90% of lithium-ion battery recycling in North America—the equivalent of 250,000 EV batteries per year. Still, that 90% equals only about 10% of the EV battery deployment in the U.S. each year. That means Redwood could expand its capacity by 10 times even if the EV market share stays flat in the U.S.

A major reason is oil prices, said Andrew Leach, who teaches economics and law at the University of Alberta.
For years, growth was underpinned by visions of “$100 oil, $200 oil, $300 oil,” but those days are gone, Leach said.
It was sold for more than $45 US less per barrel compared to the main U.S. oil price.
But there’s a much bigger challenge at hand given falling oil prices, he said.","A long-awaited deal is set to be unveiled Thursday that reportedly will include support for a new oil pipeline to the B.C. coast, as well as exemptions for Alberta from federal environmental laws.

Those moves will likely be received with open arms amongst industry leaders in the oil and gas sector. The argument has often been made that uncertainty over regulations, paired with challenges in getting products to market, is chasing away new investment.

But even if this agreement reduces some of that friction, experts say it won’t necessarily trigger a sudden flood in spending.

A major reason is oil prices, said Andrew Leach, who teaches economics and law at the University of Alberta.

The benchmark North American crude blend known as West Texas Intermediate, or WTI, is currently priced below $60 US, and the U.S. Energy Information Administration projects prices will decline to an average of $55 US in 2026. Projections vary, but others see prices headed even lower in 2027.

Oilpatch drilling slows as oil and natural gas prices sink

“If that’s the environment we’re headed to … all you have to look at is the operating costs and operating profits of these facilities,” Leach said. “You’ll get a sense that that’s going to disrupt things at a scale no federal policy exemption could correct.”

In 2014, oil and gas investment in Canada ranged around $80 billion.

In 2025, it’s closer to approximately $35 billion, according to the latest numbers from the ARC Energy Research Institute, which models the entire Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin.

For years, growth was underpinned by visions of “$100 oil, $200 oil, $300 oil,” but those days are gone, Leach said.

“The world is awash in cheap energy, which has a whole bunch of positives,” he said. “But when you’re sitting on a trillion barrels of oil, the fact that the world’s awash in cheap energy is generally bad news.”

On market access

Alberta’s oilsands hit a record production high in 2025 as companies invested in smaller expansions.

But the last major oilsands facility was Suncor’s Fort Hills mine, which opened in 2018. Even with a new pipeline, building a new oilsands facility would require a massive investment to the tune of billions of dollars.

Leach said he doesn’t see that happening, unless there’s a massive rebound in long-term price expectations.

Richard Masson, an executive fellow at the University of Calgary's School of Public Policy and the former CEO of the Alberta Petroleum Marketing Commission, agreed there’s unlikely to be a new mine from a new operator.

“The existing players have all the best leases and have economies of scale and experience, so will focus on mine pit replacements and incremental expansions,” he said.

Masson said companies have started to invest more in growth, with Canadian Natural Resources , Suncor and Cenovus among those pursuing projects.

But in his view, the big barrier to more of that happening has been market access.

“We had grown production really quickly, and then we didn’t have enough pipelines, and then the differential widened a lot,” he said, referring to the price gap between WTI and the Canadian price of oil, Western Canada Select.

“Companies said, 'I’m not going to spend hundreds of millions or billions of dollars, if I can’t get my product to market at a good price.' And so growth really slowed down.”

Masson said he thinks it's necessary to amend the federal regulations to provide more clarity. Once that happens, growth can speed up to the extent that market access is available.

But he stressed that a new pipeline isn’t a simple proposition.

Canada has embarked on a variety of pipeline misadventures over the past decade, including Keystone XL, which had a winding history of approvals and rejections.

Carney raised Keystone XL pipeline revival in meeting with Trump

“We messed up so many things on building pipelines in the last decade. It’s going to be super difficult to overcome,” he said. “How are we going to do that? And who’s going to take the lead?”

Who wants to build a pipeline?

Analysts say it’s often overlooked whether pipeline companies themselves want to take on a megaproject.

Aaron MacNeil, a research analyst with TD Cowen, said the industry is still grappling with the fallout of recent megaprojects that ran far over budget.

“We have two clearly documented examples of projects that have recently been completed and were significantly above initial budget expectations,” he said, referring to Coastal GasLink and the Trans Mountain expansion project.

Today’s midstream companies have plenty of short-cycle, low-risk, high-return options to invest in, MacNeil said.

They also have constraints, including limited capital and limited teams. That makes them less inclined to pursue a pipeline project when other opportunities deliver better and faster returns, he said.

MacNeil classifies a new West Coast pipeline as a “blue sky” scenario: possible, but low-probability without incentives. To make it viable, he said it could potentially include a government backstop if costs soared for reasons beyond the company's control.

What's next?

A TD Cowen report released Nov. 11 suggests there’s currently a “major point of debate” amongst investors and the industry centred around when the Western Canadian Sedimentary Basin might again face constraints on the amount of crude oil that can be transported, otherwise known as takeaway capacity.

The investment bank pointed out that in 2018, when there wasn't enough capacity to transport oil out of the region, the price for Canadian heavy crude oil dropped significantly.

It was sold for more than $45 US less per barrel compared to the main U.S. oil price. Such sharp drops can cause major financial harm to oil producers, and results in major impacts to government budgets.

""I think that we have very good visibility to brownfield expansions in the near- and medium-term, which will bring on market access in a just-in-time manner,"" MacNeil said. ""Obviously, longer term, we don't have as clear visibility on that.""

Leach said he won't dispute that some federal policies were going to change the viability of resource investment.

Those policies could have imposed costs on projects and uncertainty into the regulatory process, he said.

But there’s a much bigger challenge at hand given falling oil prices, he said.

“Now, we’re in this world where suddenly we’re going to ignore all these price changes, and say it’s just the federal policies that matter,” he said. “I think that’s the wrong approach.”","https://i.cbc.ca/ais/02083ac2-f5b5-40e8-8b8c-9b72c6ad1870,1764191051290/full/max/0/default.jpg?im=Crop%2Crect%3D%280%2C139%2C4000%2C2250%29%3BResize%3D620",N,,2025-11-27 09:58:29.550725

Data centres need a lot of electricity and emit lot of excess heat that should be utilised.

Finland wants to retain control

Veli-Matti Mattila, former CEO of the software firm Elisa, wants to see cuts to electricity taxes and a softening of permission rules for data centres. But he is also calling for the centres to be required to register their activities, so that “we know what they are doing.”

Read the article in Swedish on Arbeidsliv i Norden

TikTok’s plans for a centre in Kouvola have created debate, but Mattila underlines that it is better that tech giants like TikTok set up shop in Finland rather than outside of the EU.

There are some 30 data centres in Finland right now, but the number could multiply within a few years as AI, cloud services and digitalisation continue to grow.

Necessary boost outside growth areas

The data centres bring a welcome boost to the Finnish economy. They also support digitalisation and the development of the data economy, as well as supply security, pointed out Finnish Prime Minister Petter Orpo in a comment to the roadmap.

Finland is particularly looking for investments that create added economic value through increased employment, tax income and innovation. New server halls are not enough.

The data centres also contribute to business activity outside of the main growth areas and can help boost the regional economy and research.

Wahlroos: Good climate for cooling

Cooling is an important issue for data centres, which is why many companies build them in cool places.

Finnish banker Björn Wahlroos recently told Finnish TV about the challenges of getting people to invest in the country.

“Finland is in the far north of Europe, at the end of the line, with a climate that is only good for one thing: cooling data centres.”

Otherwise, Finland is not that attractive, especially not when it comes to taxation. High tax levels are not very tempting for workers or investors, according to Björn Wahlroos.

He moved to Sweden in protest against Finland’s inheritance tax, but in the TV interview, he said he was more comfortable with a Mediterranean climate.

Lower taxes and a lot of cheap energy

Wahlroos, and many with him, underline the need for attracting investments. Data centres can benefit the national economy if investors can be tempted with good financial incentives, well-educated workers and tax reliefs.

But they also want cheap, reliable energy, since data centres consume a great deal of power and release a lot of excess heat that needs to be cooled down, preferably in a productive way.

In the USA, data centres’ energy needs have come in for a lot of criticism. They put pressure on the electricity grid and can push up energy costs.

Large American companies are planning to build their own power plants to secure their energy supply. Such plans also exist in Finland, albeit on a smaller scale.

The government: Avoid weather dependency and Russian energy

When Petteri Orpo’s government came to power in 2022, it promised more new electricity production capacity than ever before. The industry would benefit from increased investments, and fossil fuels would be replaced with electricity-based solutions in industry, heating and transport.

The government wants to promote the green transition with cleantech solutions with stable and predictable framework conditions. Data centre projects will be encouraged; they should be able to link to the grid, and their excess heat should be used for district heating.

More nuclear power

The government argues that Finland needs more nuclear power and has promised to approve all applications for a decision-in-principle that meet the criteria, where the applicant’s background is considered acceptable in terms of national security.

The construction of small modular reactors (SMRs) will be facilitated. New nuclear energy legislation will pave the way for innovation and a faster execution of projects.

The Hanhikivi nuclear power plant, south of Oulu, is still fresh in people’s minds.

The nuclear power company Fennovoima had already begun forest clearing and groundwork for a new power plant with technology, fuel and participation from Russian Rosatom.

This ended when Russia launched its full-scale invasion of Ukraine in 2022.

Instead, Finland began freeing itself from Russian energy dependence. The legal aftermath is still ongoing.

Small-scale nuclear power plant in the middle of Helsinki?

But the nuclear power debate is yet again raging. Helsinki’s energy company Helen is looking into positioning small-scale nuclear energy production in the middle of the Finnish capital,

The aim is stable, fossil-free electricity production in a small-scale, safe nuclear power plant, independent of the weather, with no carbon emissions and in a cost-effective way.

A public meeting to discuss nuclear power in November heard many express concerns about security risks. The meeting was not about the principle of nuclear power, but it gave residents the chance to seek more information now that the environmental impact assessment is beginning.

The participants were not convinced, but they remained calm. The oldest remembered earlier campaigns urging people to save energy, and several expressed concern for the long-term safety risks of placing nuclear power in the middle of Helsinki.

Helsinki city councillors will make a decision in the coming years. But small-scale nuclear power production is already part of the capital’s strategy.

Kajaani – excess heat as a resource

Helsinki is not alone in looking at nuclear power as an option. The same is happening in Kuopio and some other places.

Other types of energy use are also being explored. The vocational high school in Kajaani has spent the past two years working with companies and the Finnish Natural Resources Institute Luke to create a project aimed at reusing excess heat from by data centres.

The aim is to build several functioning facilities in addition to those already located in the Renforsin shore area, which used to house wood processing and paper industry operations.

There, the Icelandic company Borealis Data Center is expanding its capacity beyond the facility it purchased in February 2024.

In a press release, the company underlines its desire to use AI on a large scale. It also mentions the infrastructure that makes environmentally friendly data centre activity possible.

Kajaani already hosts some of Europe’s supercomputers and could become a hub for data centres.

Just outside Kajaani city centre, in Otanmäki, Google is preparing to establish a sizeable presence. For the city, this means large visions including heated pavements, greenhouses, fish farming and water purification.

Project manager Sirpa Keränen underlines that these are high-level dreams, but they are technically achievable. She also mentions the outdoor pools, which will stay open for more than the three summer months.

Excess heat from the data halls could heat the pool water all winter – an unbeatable attraction for the tourism industry in Northern Finland, she argues.

At these latitudes, the sun is out only for a few hours in winter, and temperatures often fall below zero.

A Nordic perspective

When Nordic energy ministers met in October, they highlighted the need to expand transmission grids and speed up energy production.

The Nordic region is already in a strong position thanks to renewable energy, stable electricity prices and high levels of technological expertise.

But the ministers stressed that the region could become a world leader on energy security and the green transition – even in the Arctic areas.",https://www.nordiclabourjournal.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Helsinki-tram.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 15:01:14.177580

Global critical minerals markets face unprecedented disruption as traditional supply chains encounter mounting geopolitical pressures and demand volatility. The convergence of energy transition requirements, democratic alliance building, and resource security imperatives creates new frameworks for international cooperation that extend far beyond conventional trade relationships.

Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation represents a fundamental shift in how democratic nations approach strategic resource partnerships. Rather than pursuing purely transactional commodity exchanges, this collaboration establishes integrated development mechanisms that align geological advantages with processing capabilities, financial resources, and end-use manufacturing requirements. Furthermore, this partnership addresses the mining industry evolution taking place globally.

Regulatory Architecture Driving Cooperation

The European Union's Critical Raw Materials Act (CRMA) establishes binding targets that create structural demand for international partnerships: 10% domestic extraction, 40% processing capacity, and 25% recycling rates by 2030. These targets acknowledge that EU domestic resources alone cannot satisfy critical minerals requirements for energy transition and digital transformation initiatives.

Australia's mining regulatory environment demonstrates compatibility with EU environmental, social, and governance standards through several key mechanisms. The establishment of a proposed European CRM facility further reinforces these alignment efforts.

Environmental impact assessment protocols aligned with EU Environmental Impact Assessment Directive 2014/52/EU

Social governance frameworks compatible with OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises

Supply chain transparency requirements under the EU Conflict Minerals Regulation (2017/821)

Rehabilitation and closure standards matching EU environmental restoration obligations

This regulatory alignment eliminates administrative friction that typically complicates international resource partnerships. Projects developed under Australian mining law can meet EU sustainability requirements without dual compliance systems, reducing operational complexity and development costs.

The 34 critical raw materials identified under the CRMA span lithium for battery production, rare earth elements for renewable energy systems, cobalt for electric vehicle batteries, and graphite for energy storage applications. Australia possesses established production capacity or development projects across the majority of these priority materials.

Financial Innovation Through EIB Global Partnership

The Declaration of Intent signed in November 2025 between EIB Global and the Australian Government creates structured financing mechanisms that address fundamental challenges in critical minerals project development. Traditional mining finance struggles with long development timelines, substantial capital requirements, and uncertain demand profiles that characterize emerging critical minerals markets.

EIB Global financing mechanisms established through the Declaration include:

Investment Mechanism Function Strategic Advantage Direct equity participation Risk sharing across project phases Reduced capital requirements for Australian developers Long-term supply contracts Price stability and demand certainty Guaranteed market access for Australian producers Technology transfer partnerships Advanced processing capabilities Value-added mineral products and innovation exchange Infrastructure co-investment Shared development costs Accelerated project timelines and reduced individual exposure

This framework enables risk mitigation for critical minerals projects across the entire value chain from exploration through processing and recycling operations. EIB approved €60 billion in financing for climate action and environment projects in 2023, demonstrating substantial lending capacity for critical minerals development initiatives.

Direct equity participation allows EIB Global to take ownership stakes in Australian critical minerals projects, reducing capital burden on local developers while aligning financial returns with project success. Long-term supply contracts create 10-15 year demand certainty that facilitates project financing viability through guaranteed off-take agreements.

Geopolitical Drivers and Strategic Positioning

Democratic nations increasingly recognise critical minerals supply chains as national security infrastructure requiring alliance-based solutions. China controls approximately 60-70% of global rare earth element processing capacity, creating strategic vulnerabilities that extend beyond economic considerations into defence and technology sovereignty.

Chinese export restrictions implemented since 2010 demonstrate how resource concentration enables political leverage over importing nations. According to the Australian Government's strategic minerals partnership, China's export quotas on rare earth elements remain volatile and subject to geopolitical tensions, creating supply uncertainty for manufacturers dependent on these materials for advanced technologies.

Alliance Structures for Resource Security

Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation represents deliberate diversification away from authoritarian-controlled supply chains toward partnerships among democratic allies. This approach addresses multiple strategic objectives whilst supporting energy transition mining initiatives globally.

Supply chain resilience through geographic and political diversification

Environmental standards alignment reducing regulatory arbitrage risks

Technology transfer opportunities enhancing processing capabilities

Defence cooperation integration supporting broader security partnerships

Global critical minerals demand growth of 40-60% by 2040 due to energy transition creates market opportunities for alternative suppliers. Democratic nations possess geological resources, technological capabilities, and financial resources necessary to develop parallel supply chains independent of authoritarian control.

The EU imports approximately 98% of its rare earth element requirements, creating strategic vulnerability that extends across renewable energy, electric vehicles, defence systems, and telecommunications infrastructure. Australia's geological endowments in rare earths, lithium, cobalt, and other critical minerals position it as a natural partner for EU supply diversification.

Strategic Autonomy Framework Implementation

The EU's strategic autonomy agenda prioritises partnerships with politically stable, democratically governed nations possessing advanced mining infrastructure. Australia represents an optimal strategic partner through established geological resources, mature regulatory frameworks, democratic governance alignment, and geographic distance from geopolitical instability zones.

EU Strategic Compass and Industrial Strategy for Net-Zero Europe guides partnership selection criteria emphasising:

Domestic extraction initiatives targeting increased EU mining and processing capacity

Partner diversification developing multiple democratic supply sources

Circular economy integration advancing recycling and secondary material recovery

Technology advancement supporting innovation in processing technologies

The €1 trillion EU Green Deal investment target by 2030 creates substantial financing capacity for critical minerals partnerships. EU requirements for a 25-fold increase in lithium processing by 2030 to meet battery production targets demonstrate the scale of partnership opportunities. Additionally, Australia's strategic reserve initiatives complement these European objectives.

Economic Integration and Investment Mechanisms

Australia-EU bilateral trade volumes reached €49 billion in goods and €38 billion in services in 2025, establishing substantial economic integration that provides foundation for expanded critical minerals cooperation. Spanish companies expanding presence in Australia's energy, defence, and transport sectors indicate broader European industrial integration beyond minerals alone.

Joint project development mechanisms accelerate market entry by distributing financial requirements across multiple parties while creating demand certainty through long-term contracts. This shared risk approach enables smaller and mid-tier Australian mining companies to advance projects that would otherwise remain underfunded.

Technology Transfer and Value Addition

Technology transfer partnerships provide Australian producers access to EU advanced processing techniques, enabling value-added mineral production rather than raw ore exports. Processing efficiency improvements of 5-15% from technology transfer enhance project economics while supporting EU manufacturing competitiveness. These advances contribute significantly to the lithium battery revolution occurring globally.

Critical minerals cooperation facilitates integration across multiple industry sectors:

Defence manufacturing: Secure cobalt and rare earth supplies for radar systems and communications equipment

Battery production: Lithium supply security supporting EU electric vehicle manufacturing

Telecommunications infrastructure: Rare earth elements essential for 5G networks and advanced communications

Renewable energy systems: Critical minerals for wind turbines, solar panels, and energy storage

European defence expenditure increased approximately 21% in 2023 compared to 2022, reaching €230 billion and creating substantial demand for defence-grade critical minerals. Secure supply chains for these materials become essential for European defence industrial base resilience.

Infrastructure Development and Co-Investment

Critical minerals projects require substantial infrastructure investment in processing facilities, transportation networks, and port capabilities. Capital requirements range from €200 million to €2+ billion depending on commodity and scale, creating financing barriers for individual developers.

EU co-investment in Australian infrastructure reduces individual project risk while ensuring supply chain integration meets European manufacturing specifications. Joint infrastructure development includes:

Processing facilities incorporating EU technology standards

Transportation networks connecting mines to processing and export facilities

Port infrastructure enabling efficient product shipping to European markets

Research and development facilities supporting ongoing technology advancement

Regulatory Compliance and Standards Alignment

Australia's mining environmental standards demonstrate operational compatibility with EU sustainability requirements, eliminating regulatory friction that complicates international partnerships. Both jurisdictions mandate comprehensive environmental impact assessments, ongoing monitoring requirements, restoration obligations, and stakeholder engagement protocols.

Environmental Framework Harmonisation

Environmental standard compatibility encompasses multiple regulatory areas:

Water management: Comparable requirements for quality monitoring and protection

Biodiversity conservation: Aligned habitat protection and species preservation protocols

Air quality standards: Similar emission limits and monitoring requirements

Waste management: Compatible standards for tailings storage and processing waste

Closure and rehabilitation: Mandatory environmental restoration at project end-of-life

This regulatory alignment reduces compliance costs for joint ventures operating across both jurisdictions while ensuring environmental performance meets shared democratic values and international standards.

Certification and Market Access Systems

The European Institute of Innovation and Technology (EIT) for Raw Materials coordinates certification and best practice exchange between Australian and EU mining operations. EIT RawMaterials includes 70+ partners across 26 countries, providing established networks for knowledge transfer and standard harmonisation.

Certification processes ensure Australian critical minerals meet EU processing and end-use specifications:

Sustainable sourcing verification confirming environmental and social compliance

Processing specifications matching EU manufacturing requirements

Supply chain traceability enabling end-to-end tracking from mine to end-user

Recycling integration supporting EU circular economy targets

These certification frameworks enable market access to premium-priced EU supply chains prioritising environmental and social criteria while providing competitive advantages for certified Australian producers.

Market Impact and Competitive Positioning

Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation creates alternative supply sources that reduce Chinese market influence over pricing and availability. Long-term supply contracts between Australian producers and EU manufacturers establish price stability mechanisms benefiting both resource developers and end-use industries.

Priority Minerals and Strategic Focus

""Critical Focus Areas"": Lithium extraction and processing for battery manufacturing, rare earth element separation for renewable energy systems, cobalt production for electric vehicle batteries, and graphite processing for energy storage applications represent priority commodities driving partnership initiatives.

Lithium processing facilities requiring €500 million+ capital investment can now access EIB co-financing, reducing individual project risk exposure while accelerating development timelines. Long-term battery raw material contracts with EU manufacturers create demand certainty extending 10-15 years beyond initial production commencement.

Chinese processing dominance in rare earth elements creates opportunities for alternative suppliers meeting democratic governance and environmental standards. Australian rare earth projects supported by EU investment and technology can capture market share from producers dependent on Chinese processing capabilities.

Pricing Dynamics and Market Restructuring

Increased Australian production capacity supported by EU investment creates competitive alternatives to Chinese-dominated supply chains. Typical critical minerals project development timelines of 5-10 years mean partnership benefits will materialise progressively through the 2030s as projects advance through development phases.

Market restructuring occurs through multiple mechanisms:

Supply diversification reducing single-source dependencies

Long-term contracting creating price stability for producers and consumers

Processing competition challenging Chinese technological advantages

Democratic alliance sourcing premium pricing for secure supply chains

Implementation Challenges and Risk Factors

The stalled Australia-EU Free Trade Agreement presents ongoing challenges, with disagreements over agricultural market access and EU protection of geographic indications creating broader trade relationship complications. These unresolved issues could impact critical minerals cooperation timelines and investment flows.

Infrastructure and Development Requirements

Australian critical minerals projects require significant infrastructure investment that extends beyond individual mine sites to encompass:

Regional processing hubs serving multiple mining operations

Skilled workforce development for advanced processing technologies

Research and development capabilities maintaining technological competitiveness

Transportation networks connecting remote deposits to processing and export facilities

Port expansion accommodating increased critical minerals export volumes

EU co-investment in infrastructure reduces individual project risk while ensuring supply chain integration meets European manufacturing specifications. However, coordination between multiple stakeholders across two continents creates project management complexity requiring institutional frameworks for dispute resolution and performance monitoring.

Regulatory and Political Risk Management

Long-term critical minerals partnerships face potential disruption from:

Regulatory changes affecting mining approvals or environmental requirements

Political transitions altering government support for international partnerships

Trade policy shifts impacting tariffs or import regulations

Currency fluctuations affecting project economics and return calculations

Technology disruption changing mineral requirements or processing methods

Risk mitigation requires robust contractual frameworks, political risk insurance, and flexibility mechanisms accommodating changing circumstances over 15-20 year project lifecycles.

Future Implications and Strategic Outcomes

Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation establishes a template for democratic resource partnerships that could extend to other allied nations including Canada, the United States, and Japan. This alliance structure has potential to fundamentally reshape global critical minerals markets by reducing authoritarian control over strategic resources.

Long-term Market Transformation

Democratic resource cooperation creates several transformative effects:

Supply chain resilience through geographic and political diversification

Technology advancement via collaborative research and development

Environmental standards elevation across global mining operations

Market competition reducing monopolistic pricing power

Strategic autonomy for democratic nations in critical technologies

Partnership expansion potential includes integration with existing initiatives such as the Minerals Security Partnership, QUAD critical minerals cooperation, and AUKUS technology sharing agreements. Institutional frameworks developed for Australia-EU cooperation provide models for broader alliance-based resource development.

Energy Transition Acceleration

Secure, democratically sourced critical minerals supplies enable accelerated renewable energy deployment and electric vehicle adoption across EU markets. Australian resource capacity supported by European investment and technology creates supply chain resilience essential for achieving climate transition objectives without geopolitical vulnerability.

Climate transition timelines depend critically on materials availability, with lithium, cobalt, and rare earth shortages potentially constraining deployment rates for renewable energy and electric transportation. Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation directly addresses these potential bottlenecks through coordinated capacity development.

Battery manufacturing competitiveness in European markets requires secure raw material supplies at predictable prices. Long-term contracts with Australian producers provide cost certainty enabling European manufacturers to compete globally while maintaining supply chain security aligned with democratic values.

Regulatory Framework Evolution

Both Australian and EU regulatory frameworks continue evolving to accommodate increased cooperation, with streamlined approval processes for joint ventures and harmonised environmental standards reducing administrative complexity. Policy adaptations create institutional foundations for expanded partnership scope beyond current critical minerals focus areas.

Policy Innovation and Adaptation

Regulatory evolution encompasses:

Fast-track approval processes for projects meeting strategic partnership criteria

Environmental equivalency recognition reducing dual compliance requirements

Technology transfer facilitation through intellectual property frameworks

Investment protection mechanisms for long-term international partnerships

Dispute resolution systems managing cross-jurisdictional conflicts

These policy adaptations require coordination between federal and state governments in Australia and among EU member states to ensure consistent implementation across jurisdictions. However, as highlighted in recent EU strategic projects announcements, progress continues advancing rapidly.

Defence and Security Integration

Australia-EU negotiations on cyber-defence, procurement, and joint research and development reflect broader security cooperation that reinforces critical minerals partnership strategic value. Resource security increasingly integrates with defence policy as nations recognise supply chain vulnerabilities represent national security risks requiring allied coordination.

Defence industrial base resilience depends on secure access to critical minerals for advanced weapons systems, communications equipment, and electronic warfare capabilities. Australia and EU critical minerals cooperation supports broader defence partnership objectives while creating economic benefits for both regions.

Technology sovereignty considerations drive partnerships in critical minerals processing, battery manufacturing, and advanced materials development. Joint research initiatives enable shared technological advancement while maintaining competitive advantages over authoritarian competitors.

“There will be room for private investment, but with certain rules,” Sheinbaum recently said, emphasizing the need for technical and operational stability in the power sector.","The Mexican authorities have reported a growing number of PV projects submitted for approval since the publication of a new decree regulating private investments in the energy sector in mid-October.

The new rules require future private investment contracts in the electricity sector to align with the federal regulatory framework, including the engineering and construction oversight phases outlined in the official document. The instrument aims to provide greater certainty regarding timelines and investor responsibilities, as well as greater visibility into the development of installed assets.

With this decree, the oversight of generation projects and the conditions for private investment are detailed within the Mexican regulatory framework, offering a clearer context for market participants. In this regard, a recent report by Ember indicates that private investment and energy storage could play a significant role in the coming years, with estimates of up to 36,000 MW of solar power and 30 GWh of battery storage.

The latest of the PV projects submitted for approval is a 90 MW solar plant planned for the municipality of Lagos de Moreno, Jalisco, with interconnection to the Lagos Galera substation of the Federal Electricity Commission (CFE). The proposal includes 218,568 solar modules on 2,602 trackers in a 1P84 configuration. The design calls for 100 central inverters – four per transformer substation – across 25 substations delivering output at 34.5 kV. The generated energy will be routed through a low-voltage network to inverters that convert DC to AC at 645 V.

Another project is the 118.8 MW Tulancingo Solar Park, under development by Desarrollos Fotovoltaicos de México del Centro, expected to be located in the municipality of Singuilucan in the state of Hidalgo. GR Energía Renovables is developing a 30 MW solar facility in San Miguel de Allende in Mexico’s central highlands.

Moreover, Bluemex San Miguel submitted an environmental impact statement to the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources (Semarnat) for the 139 MW FV Santa Fe solar project, which includes 680 W bifacial modules, an energy storage system, an electrical substation and a 335,885-meter transmission line on a surface of 481,432 hectares with a planned occupation of 178,781 hectares in the municipality of Allende, Guanajuato.

Another project is the 788.7 MW Alegría Solar project linked to 177.69 MW/314.98 MWh of battery storage. Submitted to Semarnat by Sunstone Power 2, the plant is planned for the municipality of Campeche in the homonymous state. It includes 1,151,416 photovoltaic modules of 685 W each, 101 transformer centers and 202 inverters.

Yet, GCC Solar Samalayuca requested the environmental impact statement for the Samalayuca I Solar Park project, which includes site preparation, construction and operation of a self-consumption photovoltaic park with an alternating-current generation capacity of up to 22.2 MW and an estimated production of 59,229 GWh per year. The facility will be located in Juárez in the state of Chihuahua.

In October, Spanish energy company Iberdrola announced plans to move ahead with two solar projects totaling 535 MW in Mexico, marking a renewed commitment to the country’s energy market after years of divestment and regulatory tensions.

Through its local subsidiary Green Park Energy, the Spanish utility obtained land-use change approval for a 415 MW photovoltaic plant in Saltillo, Coahuila. The unit also filed an environmental impact statement for its 120 MW San Diego de la Unión photovoltaic project in Guanajuato.

Between May 2022 and August 2025, Smitty’s Supply reported that it exceeded limits 230 times for the amount of organic material, fecal coliform, carbon and other pollutants it’s allowed to discharge in its wastewater.
These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators.
In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.
The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August.","(Louisiana Illuminator) - Louisiana and the federal government are pushing for more than $1 billion in fines and penalties against Smitty’s Supply Inc. for years of environmental violations and more recent damages from an explosion and petrochemical spill at its Tangipahoa Parish plant.

That dollar figure is eye-catching but also leads one to question: Why did it take an environmental disaster for officials to finally act against a business with an established track record of wiping its feet on regulations meant to curb pollution?

The answer: It’s in line with regulators’ kid-glove approach to environmental enforcement in Louisiana, where state and federal agencies go out of their way to provide a welcome mat for industry while placing the welfare of its residents on the backburner.

Examples of this practice are actually detailed in a lawsuit the state Department of Environmental Quality and U.S. Environmental Protection Agency have filed against Smitty’s Supply. It accuses the company of violating the federal Clean Water Act, the Louisiana Water Control Law and Louisiana Water Pollution Control regulations, among other regulations.

Their complaint cites hundreds of infractions going back nearly five years, culminating with the Aug. 22 disaster at its Roseland facility. Millions of gallons of oil, lubricants and automotive fluids made their way into the nearby Tangipahoa River and flowed several miles downstream. A fire that took two weeks to fully extinguish created an oily soot that covered nearby homes, farms and businesses.

Before that, the company was cited for illegal wastewater discharges, failing to report pollution and seven separate chemical spills since 2021 that went beyond the facility’s property and contaminated public areas.

Between May 2022 and August 2025, Smitty’s Supply reported that it exceeded limits 230 times for the amount of organic material, fecal coliform, carbon and other pollutants it’s allowed to discharge in its wastewater.

These are incidents that Smitty’s Supply has reported to regulators. What’s gone unreported?

According to the lawsuit, the company failed to conduct “daily visual observations” of five outfall canals to check for possible pollutants on weekends and holidays from May 2022 through at least April 2025. A bit of quick math indicates that equals about 350 days without required surveillance. And because these inspections weren’t performed, they couldn’t be logged, which led to additional violations.

Then there are the infractions found when LDEQ inspectors made site visits. In January and February 2023, there were “hydrocarbon materials” and an orange “emulsified petroleum product” flowing from Smitty’s Supply outfall canals into a public roadside ditch.

After the August explosion, regulators determined the company failed to develop a required Spill Prevention, Control and Countermeasure Plan and didn’t adequately maintain a Facility Response Plan that lays out how it handles such incidents.

All this is to say there is an extensive history of the company failing to take significant steps to address its pattern of violations and minimal evidence of regulators taking meaningful enforcement action to bring about improvements.

The EPA’s website shows it has issued $161,522 in fines against Smitty’s Supply over the past five years, WVUE-TV Fox 8 reported in August. The company paid $250,000 to settle a state complaint over an oil spill in 2021, and the EPA collected $194,772 in 2019 for infractions, WWL-TV reported.

It’s hard to determine what kind of dent these penalties have made in the private company’s bottom line; it doesn’t have to make its revenue and net income public. But on its website, Smitty’s describes itself as “one of the leading manufacturers in the world of lubricants and related products.” It leads you to believe that Smitty’s Supply has had the wherewithal to prevent its many regulatory fumbles over the years, acknowledged and otherwise.

Like Charles Dickens wrote (and Elvis Costello later sang), accidents will happen. But they’re more probable — and maybe less likely to be considered accidents — in a state where officials aren’t willing to take meaningful punitive action to prevent them.

That leads to another question: It’s not if there will be another Smitty’s Supply-level disaster, but when and where.

Europe’s largest markets, Germany, the UK, France, Spain, and Italy, recorded a combined 32% increase in BEV sales in Q3 2025.
Spain’s BEV sales doubled compared to last year, with BEV market share now at 11%, benefiting from cheaper EV models and improving charging infrastructure.
The U.S. BEV market grew 22% in Q3 2025, reaching a 10% market share, driven largely by consumers rushing to benefit from federal tax credits before they expired.
South Korea’s 86% rise in BEV sales was fuelled by strong subsidies and the rapid expansion of charging stations, pushing its market share to 18%.","Across the globe, electric vehicles (EVs) are no longer niche products. In Q3 2025, total battery electric vehicle (BEV) sales rose 35% year-on-year, with more than one in five new vehicles sold globally being battery electric, according to PwC. National policies have been a major force behind this rise, while expanding model availability, more affordable options, and improved charging infrastructure have further strengthened consumer demand.

China stands out as the clearest example. Over two million BEVs were sold in Q3, giving the country a 34% market share. This growth is largely due to state-led incentives, including government subsidies for new energy vehicles (NEVs), exemptions from taxes, and restrictions on internal combustion engine (ICE) license plates encouraged first-time buyers to choose EVs.

These policies also made affordable, entry-level BEVs attractive, which contributed to a 6% year-on-year decline in PHEV sales as consumers increasingly skipped hybrids in favor of fully electric vehicles.

Europe Pushes Forward Through Regulation

Moving from China’s incentive-driven model to Europe’s rule-based structure shows how different policy approaches lead to different growth rates in EV adoption. Europe’s largest markets, Germany, the UK, France, Spain, and Italy, recorded a combined 32% increase in BEV sales in Q3 2025.

Germany led the pack, with a 45% year-on-year growth, reflecting a consistent domestic push with both incentives and strong EV model availability. The UK, while growing more moderately, has the highest BEV share among these top five countries at 23%, largely due to the ZEV Mandate, which requires 28% of new vehicles sold to be zero-emission.

Spain’s BEV sales doubled compared to last year, with BEV market share now at 11%, benefiting from cheaper EV models and improving charging infrastructure. Italy lagged at a 5% market share, reflecting slower adoption of new EV models and less aggressive government incentives. France saw moderate growth in BEV sales, rising 16% year on year, as consumers gradually shifted away from ICE vehicles in response to stricter emissions regulations and expanding EV incentives.

PHEVs in these markets grew 65% year-on-year, except in France, where they declined 8%, showing that hybrids still play a strategic role for automakers in meeting CO2 targets ahead of 2026 regulatory changes. Meanwhile, ICE vehicle registrations fell across all top-five markets, with France recording the sharpest drop at 27%, underlining the shift in consumer preference.

In smaller European markets, Denmark experienced a 43% year-on-year increase in BEVs, with a 70% market share of all new vehicles, second only to Norway at 97%. Sweden recorded the highest PHEV share at 27%, highlighting how policy, incentives, and infrastructure can shape adoption differently across countries.

The United States Leans on Affordability and Credits

The effect of policy becomes even more visible when looking at the United States. The U.S. BEV market grew 22% in Q3 2025, reaching a 10% market share, driven largely by consumers rushing to benefit from federal tax credits before they expired. This deadline produced a surge that automakers quickly responded to with more affordable line-ups.

GM and Hyundai, for example, grew their Q3 2025 EV sales more than sevenfold and over 100-fold, respectively, since 2015, as both introduced multiple new models under $50,000. VW’s EV sales nearly tripled over the same period. Surveys now show that nearly two-thirds of American consumers plan to buy an EV within five years, indicating that incentives can spark momentum that continues even after the policy ends.

Elsewhere in Asia, national policy continues to shape very different outcomes. South Korea’s 86% rise in BEV sales was fuelled by strong subsidies and the rapid expansion of charging stations, pushing its market share to 18%. Japan, however, remains dominated by hybrids. With BEVs and PHEVs making up just over 3% of new sales, the country’s slower policy shifts and long-standing consumer preference for hybrid technology have kept full electrification at bay.

When Policy Shapes Competition

Comparing these regions highlights a deeper pattern: national strategies are determining not just sales, but competitive advantage. China’s flexible, incentive-driven approach contrasts with Europe’s regulatory-heavy strategy.

Europe aims to ban ICE vehicles from 2035 and meet strict CO2 limits, but such top-down mandates can slow decision-making and consumer certainty. China instead uses subsidies, tax exemptions, and licensing policies to encourage adoption. Evidence from China’s rapidly rising BEV share shows that incentives can accelerate market growth more efficiently than strict bans alone.

In the US, policy uncertainty has led some automakers to scale back EV investment despite strong consumer demand. The Ford Mustang Mach-E recently outsold its petrol counterpart 2-1, showing that market appetite is growing regardless of temporary policy gaps. Manufacturers that fail to keep pace risk losing ground to rivals in Europe, China, and South Korea, where national policies are accelerating electrification with far greater consistency.

Does the Future Belong to Policy-Backed Innovation?

Even with incentives tapering off in some regions, the global direction of travel is clear. Falling battery costs, expanding model availability, and steady government commitments point to a future where EVs become the default choice.

The automakers that combine innovation with affordability, and operate in environments where national policy supports long-term investment, are best positioned to lead the next decade of mobility.

Spain, Europe's second-largest carmaker, is positioning itself as a battery hub thanks to lower labour costs and industrial energy prices that are about 20 per cent below the EU average. Three more plants are planned, including projects by Envision AESC, Volkswagen's PowerCo and InoBat.

Europe's auto associations are pushing for stricter requirements on local sourcing of components in part to protect them from Chinese rivals, as the European Commission prepares to unveil a new set of measures to bolster the sector.

You’re now seeing five-gigawatt campuses in Midland County, two-gigawatt gas-backed parks like Project Horizon, and 5-GW monsters like Pacifico’s Ranch.

This is no longer about whether AI valuations are rich or whether project IRRs make sense on a spreadsheet.
The market is staring at an AI-capex universe that is forcibly rewriting America’s energy system in real time.","The AI trade has entered that deliciously dangerous phase where everyone keeps whispering about bubbles, but nobody is prepared to lift their foot off the accelerator. And the proof isn’t in NVIDIA’s (NASDAQ: ) price action anymore — it’s in the power grid. If you want to understand where the AI-capex Manhattan Project is heading, stop looking at GPUs and start looking at gigawatts.

As of mid-October, the US data-center pipeline has swollen to an absurd 245 GW, a number so grotesquely oversized it makes 2021-era crypto mining look like a candle flickering in a windstorm. The gravitational pull of that pipeline has shifted decisively toward Texas, where planned capacity has nearly doubled in two quarters as developers stampede into the only geography that can plausibly accommodate this scale of ambition.

The old gospel of “fibre adjacency” has been replaced by a blunt new commandment: access to power is access to survival. And once that truth took hold, the entire map of the industry began to warp. Data Center Alley is giving way to Data Center Prairie — sprawling, isolated, giga-campuses stretching across Pennsylvania steel country, the Wyoming emptiness, and above all, the sun-bleached plains of West and North Texas.

The developers aren’t pretending anymore. They don’t trust the utilities to deliver on time, and they aren’t willing to let grid bottlenecks dictate the pacing of the AI revolution. So they’re doing the unthinkable: building their own power plants, at hyperscaler scale and hyperscaler speed.

is the weapon of choice, particularly where the Permian Basin sits practically beneath the server racks. You’re now seeing five-gigawatt campuses in Midland County, two-gigawatt gas-backed parks like Project Horizon, and 5-GW monsters like Pacifico’s Ranch. And yet even the gas network is bursting at capacity, which means if you’re building far from the basin, you’re not just paying for more molecules — you’re paying in time, waiting for new pipelines that may not clear regulatory hurdles before the next economic cycle turns.

Some developers are bending sunlight and wind rather than gas, as in the Nevada and Utah solar-stabilized tract developments or Montana’s Big Sky digital infrastructure campus. But even there, batteries are less about flexibility and more about brute force balancing — smoothing renewables and providing fast-ramping backup for onsite gas turbines. These are no longer clever grid-optimization tricks. They’re survival systems designed for workloads that cannot go dark, ever.

And this all comes with a capital distortion that would make even late-cycle Silicon Valley blush. The 2% of projects with budgets north of USD 17 billion somehow account for 42% of total capital deployment. Meanwhile, the 60% of projects under USD 1 billion barely register — just 8% of total capex. Froth isn’t creeping into the system; it’s flooding the pipes.

The poster children are Project Jupiter in New Mexico at USD 160 billion and Project Kestrel in Missouri at USD 100 billion — numbers so detached from reality they feel like lunar base proposals. What’s more remarkable is the financial engineering underneath them: developers issuing industrial revenue bonds where they are both payer and payee, a circular structure that tees up tax advantages and pushes project valuations into uncharted airspace.

The biggest tell that we’ve entered a new regime is the hyperscalers themselves. For years, they resisted onsite generation, preferring the clean-hands simplicity of grid power. No scope 1 emissions, fewer headaches, shorter contractual lock-ins. But urgency is now trumping orthodoxy. Developers are betting that hyperscalers will overlook the operational risk because speed to compute is paramount, or that a new generation of hyperscalers — less fixated on ESG purity and more obsessed with capacity — will happily sign onto gas-fired campuses if it means teraflops tomorrow instead of teraflops in 2029.

Even though only 10% of the pipeline includes onsite generation, those projects account for a staggering 34% of total capacity. And of course, Texas dominates the map, with gas turbines as the workhorse technology. Every terawatt of this build-out tightens the natural-gas market, competing directly with LNG exports and nudging long-term gas prices higher.

This doesn’t just lift electricity bills for consumers — it crowds utilities out of the turbine market at precisely the moment on-grid demand from EVs, manufacturing reshoring, and electrification is accelerating. If the off-grid AI complexes soak up the turbine supply chain, the regulated utilities will be left trying to keep the lights on with one hand tied behind their back.

And here’s the real kicker: even if the AI bubble burps, pops, or deflates gently, the affordability and reliability pressures unleashed by this shift will not disappear. Once tens of gigawatts of private, gas-fired compute fortresses start pulling fuel, burning molecules, and shaping regional power curves, state regulators are going to step in. First softly, then loudly. And once that happens, all bets are off. Markets can price a bubble; they can’t price a political backlash against runaway energy demand.

This is no longer about whether AI valuations are rich or whether project IRRs make sense on a spreadsheet. The market is staring at an AI-capex universe that is forcibly rewriting America’s energy system in real time. The Manhattan Project metaphor is no longer figurative — it’s literal.

German energy group RWE announced the commissioning of the Stoneridge Solar project in Milam County, Texas. The facility includes a photovoltaic plant with a capacity of 200 megawatts (MW) and a battery storage system of 100 MW, or 200 megawatt-hours (MWh). This energy complex is designed to meet strong local demand while ensuring a stable contribution to the power grid.

A strategic project in a fast-growing market

Stoneridge Solar adds to RWE’s energy assets in the United States, where total capacity now exceeds 11 gigawatts (GW). The project strengthens the company’s position in the expanding American market, particularly in the southern region where electricity needs are driven by rapid population growth and extreme weather conditions.

The construction of the site generated more than 200 temporary jobs. Permanent positions have also been created for ongoing operations, contributing to the region’s economic integration. The facility is expected to generate several million USD in tax revenues for Milam County and the Thorndale Independent School District.

Local deployment supported by tax revenues

The anticipated revenues are expected to support school renovations and emergency services. The project includes material support for Thorndale Elementary School and an operational partnership with the local volunteer fire department, reinforcing the operator’s local presence.

The project comes at a time of increasing strain on the Texas power grid. The addition of a storage system allows energy produced during the day to be distributed during peak demand periods. This technical setup enhances grid reliability while improving the management of intermittent capacity.

A combined solar-storage deployment model

The integration of solar production and battery storage is an emerging model in the U.S. energy sector. It increases grid flexibility without relying on conventional thermal sources.

By strengthening its installations in the United States, RWE continues to deploy infrastructure designed to meet energy needs while expanding its operational portfolio in high-potential regions.

From government mandates to corporate overhauls, the Electric Vehicle (EV) revolution is no longer a distant reality but a full-blown truth. For Indian students, the shift represents not only technological change but also a powerful opportunity to build a meaningful and future-focused career.

The basics of the EV revolution

Electric vehicles (EVs) are transforming the automotive sector by replacing internal combustion engines with cleaner alternatives. They come in various forms and some of them are Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs), which run entirely on rechargeable batteries; Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs) pair batteries with conventional engines; Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) use both but cannot be plugged in; and Hydrogen Fuel Cell Vehicles generate electricity through hydrogen, emitting only water. Together, they represent diverse pathways to sustainable transport.

With governments worldwide driving policies for net-zero targets, EV adoption is accelerating—by 2025, one in five new cars sold globally is expected to be electric. Nations like India, the UK, and Ireland are not only cutting emissions but also unlocking opportunities in innovation, entrepreneurship, and green jobs.

EVs as career catalyst

The introduction of EVs is set to have a significant impact on various sectors, both directly and indirectly. Industries such as automotive, construction, energy, mining, chemical, battery manufacturing, and real estate are set to bear a profound direct impact. EV adoption is also encouraging major investments in charging infrastructure, energy storage, and sustainable design. Further, EVs can significantly impact international relations, global policies, and geopolitics. Given its strength, countries are preparing for the revolution EVs will bring.

The global landscape

The UK has committed to net-zero carbon emissions by 2050 and has become the first country to sign a legally binding contract for the same. Transport accounted for 29% of the UK’s total greenhouse gas emissions in 2023, making it the largest-emitting sector of the UK economy. Over half (54%) of the UK’s transport emissions come from cars and taxis. Therefore, the government plans to introduce EVs and ban the sale of Internal Combustion Engines (ICEs) by 2030. To support this shift, it’s investing £150 million in loans to SMEs for R&D and £90 billion across the sector. This will create a wide range of job roles, from sustainable infrastructure engineers to battery chemists and smart grid analysts.

Similarly, Ireland is also accelerating toward electrification, targeting 9,36,000 EVs on its roads by 2030, i.e., about a third of its total vehicles. Government grants, tax rebates, and charging infrastructure schemes are supporting this growth.

India, the 5th-largest auto manufacturer, will rise to 3rd place by 2030. With the net-zero target by 2070, India is aiming to accelerate EV adoption in commercial vehicles and private cars. This EV push could generate 10 million direct jobs and 50 million indirect jobs.

For Indian students, understanding the distinct approaches and innovations in these markets offers valuable cross-border insights and career direction.

India is rapidly positioning itself as a key player in the global EV transition, driven by government initiatives like FAME-II, state-level EV policies, and growing investments from both domestic and international automakers. With a strong push for local manufacturing, battery innovation, and charging infrastructure, the country is not only targeting mass adoption of electric two- and three-wheelers but also nurturing a talent pipeline through specialised courses and industry–academia collaborations. This evolving ecosystem underscores India’s ambition to become both a major EV market and a hub for innovation.

Where opportunities lie

As the electric vehicle (EV) revolution gains traction, the education sector is being called upon to evolve just as swiftly. Universities across the UK and Ireland are stepping up by introducing a mix of specialised, upskilling, and reskilling courses that align with the emerging needs of the EV industry. These programmes span multiple disciplines, equipping students with the knowledge and skills required for the mobility landscape of tomorrow.

The UK has emerged as a hub for EV-focused education, with universities introducing specialised postgraduate programmes to address the growing demand for green mobility talent. In the country’s automotive heartland, institutions are driving innovation through courses in vehicle technologies, hydrogen and fuel cell systems, power electronics, and connected autonomous vehicles. In other regions, programmes in smart grids, battery technologies, sustainable energy, and advanced materials are expanding the talent pool, and Ireland is too strengthening its academic offerings in this space.

Beyond automotive-specific degrees, universities are also nurturing EV-relevant skills through courses in control systems, automation, and power networks, while ensuring graduates are equipped to contribute across the wider energy and mobility ecosystem.

Ultimately, the EV revolution is about more than just transitioning away from internal combustion engines; it’s about reimagining the future of mobility in cleaner, smarter and more sustainable ways. It requires a new generation of engineers, designers, energy experts, and policy thinkers. For Indian students aiming for a global career in this dynamic sector, now is the time to explore these academic pathways, align with industry trends, and become part of a movement that is reshaping how the world moves.

Publication of the law on Tuesday (25) confirmed the signal given hours earlier by Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira during an interview on TV Cultura’s Roda Viva.
Some analysts viewed the decision as contradictory to federal energy policy, since it maintains subsidies for a high-emission source despite international pressure following COP30.
He argued that keeping the current methodology leads to a R$83 billion loss in federal revenue over ten years.
The organization is analyzing next steps but intends to lobby Congress to restore the approved wording.","High-profile items, such as compensation for generation curtailment and a change to the reference price for oil, were removed. The extension of coal-fired power plant contracts, however, was kept in place.

Publication of the law on Tuesday (25) confirmed the signal given hours earlier by Mines and Energy Minister Alexandre Silveira during an interview on TV Cultura’s Roda Viva. Silveira had indicated that the government would reject provisions that, in his view, threatened tariff stability and regulatory predictability.

The most sensitive veto targeted a broad compensation mechanism for wind and solar power plants in cases of curtailment caused by oversupply or lack of transmission capacity. The text had provided for retroactive payments, which, according to Silveira, could have generated a tariff impact of up to R$6 billion.

With the veto, companies will only be reimbursed for curtailment explicitly caused by inadequate infrastructure to evacuate energy. Other cases should be discussed later, the minister signaled during the interview.

Consumer groups had opposed the measure, while renewable-energy companies argued that the lack of a solution to manage curtailment-related costs threatens investments and jobs.

“We’re going to see more layoffs. We’re dealing with two crises: the micro-crisis, which is curtailment—this entire regulatory mess that needs fixing—and the macro-crisis, which is the broader industrial downturn, with factories closing and workers being dismissed,” said Elbia Gannoum, president of the Brazilian Wind Energy Association (ABEEOLICA).

Another veto struck the provision limiting new self-generation arrangements, an increasingly common strategy among large industrial consumers. The official justification argued that such restrictions would undermine the efficient use of installed capacity and create artificial barriers at a time when the government is attempting to reorganize the regulatory framework to attract new investment.

According to Raphael Gomes, an energy partner at law firm Lefosse, the original text limiting self-generation to new projects, under the logic of encouraging additional capacity, “runs counter to the facts, given that one of the sector’s biggest short-term problems is precisely generation curtailment due to insufficient demand to absorb existing supply.”

The extension of coal-fired plant contracts through 2040 was preserved. Some analysts viewed the decision as contradictory to federal energy policy, since it maintains subsidies for a high-emission source despite international pressure following COP30. The minister, however, argued that these plants remain necessary for system reliability.

For Nivalde de Castro, general coordinator of the Power Sector Study Group (Gesel) at the Federal University of Rio de Janeiro, the extension should have been vetoed from an energy-planning perspective. “This decision was largely political, tied to regional economic interests and pressure from lawmakers, a pattern that has become common and somewhat damaging to the power sector.”

In the oil and gas segment, the government ultimately vetoed the change to the reference price used for calculating royalties, an adjustment that would have increased federal revenues and had divided the industry and government officials.

Evaristo Pinheiro, president of Refina Brasil, said the veto is cause for concern. He argued that keeping the current methodology leads to a R$83 billion loss in federal revenue over ten years.

The announcement was shared online by PM Narendra Modi, who called it “a historic first for India’s high-tech manufacturing.”

REPMs are strong magnets used in EV motors, wind power units, satellites, aircraft systems, missiles and many electronic products. India currently imports most of these magnets.

With EV sales rising and renewable energy expanding, the demand for REPMs is growing quickly. Heavy dependence on imports can lead to shortages and higher prices.

Only a few countries produce most of the world’s supply, which increases the risk for Indian companies. Building local production can give India better control and more stability.

The plan aims to create 6,000 MTPA of REPM output. This covers the full chain, from converting rare earth oxides into metals to forming alloys and then making finished magnets.

Having the entire system inside the country is expected to give manufacturers a steady flow of material as they grow in high-tech areas.

The announcement also said the step would help improve self-reliance and support clean energy goals.

The scheme offers ₹6,450 crore in sales linked incentives for a five year period and ₹750 crore in capital support to help companies set up factories.

The government will pick five companies through a global bidding process. Each selected company may receive approval to produce up to 1,200 MTPA.

The full plan will run for seven years. The first two years are for construction and setup, followed by five years of incentive payouts.

The goal is to secure a local supply of rare earth magnets so that industries such as EVs, wind power, defence and advanced electronics do not depend as heavily on imports.

The plan is also expected to support new jobs and give Indian companies a more stable path for future growth.

The company made a Class 4 electric truck chassis with a cab–over design.

Emails sent by the company’s HR boss show that Bollinger missed payroll for the last two pay periods.

Bollinger Motors, the maker of the B4 Class 4 electric truck, is out of business. Emails sent by the company’s human resources director and seen by the Detroit Free Press say that the Michigan-based startup’s last day of operations was last Friday.

""We received word late last night that the day has arrived, we are to officially close the doors of Bollinger Motors, effective today, November 21st, 2025,"" Helen Watson, Bollinger’s HR chief, said in an email.

Bollinger's first vehicles were the B1 and B2, but neither went into production.

The company sprang into the spotlight in the late 2010s with the boxy B1 and B2 electric pickup and SUV, but neither model went into production. Instead, Mullen Automotive bought a controlling stake in the startup in 2022, and the entity started working on a Class 4 cab-over electric truck chassis.

However, the business never took off, and Bollinger found itself in the crosshairs of multiple lawsuits and financing woes. The startup’s founder, Robert Bollinger, left the company in March and sued parent company Mullen Automotive over a $10 million loan he gave last year, alleging that the startup was broke.

That passed, as Mullen paid back Bollinger. But other issues made their presence felt. Lawsuits from suppliers came and went, with six active cases from companies like Germany’s Thyssenkrupp and Brazil’s Metalsa still being on the Oakland County Circuit Court’s agenda, according to Automotive News.

Michery, the CEO of Mullen Automotive, took over as the leader of Bollinger Motors in June and put both companies under the “Bollinger Innovations” umbrella. While the entity that made the Bollinger B4 electric truck has closed, Bollinger Innovations is still open for business, the Detroit Free Press noted.

The B4 electric truck was Bollinger's first and only production model.

Dozens of employees have filed complaints over unpaid wages, and the state of Michigan is bound to fight over millions of dollars from the struggling EV maker after it failed to reach job milestones. Bollinger was awarded $3 million from the Michigan Economic Development Corp. after it promised to invest $44 million and create 237 jobs in Detroit’s metro area. As of September 30, the startup had no qualified new jobs and 50 base employees, according to a MEDC spokesperson, who added that Bollinger had until May 4 to fix the default by reaching job milestones. It “will be required to pay back all or a portion of those funds” if that doesn’t happen, Danielle Emerson said for Automotive News.

With the company out of business, that’s unlikely to happen now. As for the unpaid wages, Bollinger’s HR director said that David Michery, the CEO of Bollinger Innovations, will “make us whole with regards to the remaining monies.” ""It is the end of an era, but one you should all be very proud of,"" she added.",https://cdn.motor1.com/images/mgl/nAb616/s1/2025-bollinger-b4.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 03:59:09.676662

""We received word late last night that the day has arrived, we are to officially close the doors of Bollinger Motors, effective today, November 21st, 2025,"" Human Resources Director, Helen Watson, told the outlet.

This comes after mounting evidence that the business was having trouble making payments, including to its own employees. The Michigan Department of Labor and Economic Opportunity confirmed that Bollinger presently has 59 individual reports of unpaid wages last week.

COO Walter Collins had told employees that October payments would be delayed. Now, CEO David Michery has reportedly staff that the company will make good on the last two missed pay periods as its final act.

""I am working on creating checks for the 10/31/2025 payroll and believe they will be in hand on Monday,"" Watson explained in an email. ""It is the end of an era but one you should all be very proud of.""

Bollinger has had a rough go of things. Originally envisioned as a business that would build hardcore, all-electric SUVs and pickup trucks in 2015, it later pivoted to building electrified commercial trucks. While it did end up completing one Class 4 design, things never really got off the ground.

The company went into receivership earlier this year after being sued by founder Robert Bollinger over a $10-million loan he issued in October of 2024. While the matter was dealt with, Mullen Automotive (which purchased a controlling stake in the company in 2022) noted that it still had several suppliers that needed to be paid.

Sadly about a half-dozen of those businesses have taken legal action against Bollinger over an estimated $5 million in unpaid bills.

Obviously, financial issues have been a major hurdle for the EV startup as the years rolled on. But dwindling interest in all-electric commercial vehicles and waning government subsidies probably would have done it in eventually. Bollinger had attempted to strike while the iron was hot. However, it seems to have missed the window for both electrified passenger trucks and commercial vehicles.

Bollinger Motors is effectively dead. But Bollinger Innovations apparently lives on for now, despite having delisted itself from the NASDAQ stock exchange after its shares effectively became worthless. This comes after numerous reverse stock splits within the last year and subsequent sell-offs. This is another one of those instances where the only people that seemed to have benefited from the EV startup were those that bought in early and sold before the collapse.

Currently, Ag-Grid has five operating dairy digesters that process both dairy manure and food waste. Two of the digesters, located in Connecticut, produce renewable electricity, reducing the carbon footprint of dairy farms and adding to the electrical grid.

Prior to founding Ag-Grid Energy, Akki worked for the DuPont Chemical Company, where she held senior positions in central R&D, DuPont Titanium Technologies, Nonwovens, and Industrial Biosciences. Akki earned her B.S. degree in chemical engineering from Osmania University in India, her M.S. degree from University of Connecticut, and her Ph.D. from Georgia Institute of Technology. She is a member of the American Biogas Council, and Partnership for Electric Pathways. She was inducted into the UConn Academy of Distinguished Engineers in 2024.

You started your university education in India before coming to America. How difficult was that transition?

I was motivated to come to the United States while I was in undergrad – many classmates around me, particularly in the university community, were talking about emigrating to America. I knew of UConn through a colleague at Osmania who had come to Storrs to get his master’s degree. In 1988, I moved to the U.S. and came straight to UConn. Assimilation took some time, as you might imagine… back home, I was very traditional and had never even worn a pair of blue jeans.

I had long hair and wore ethnic garb. After a few months, an advisor recommended that I try to adapt to U.S. culture. It was good advice, even though I cherished my heritage. I chopped my hair, bought jeans, and worked at reducing or removing cultural barriers, which was a good move, at least appearance wise! The education system here was so different from back in India; I had never used a mainframe computer or graphing tools, and really dove into data analysis and experimentation.

What did you study at UConn?

I have to admit I fell in love with research when I was at UConn, and spent the next decade in research because of that exposure. I was really interested in polymers, and after earning my master’s degree, worked in polymers for the next 20 years. My experiences there helped me develop an in-depth understanding of science, and I still use those fundamentals today. I hadn’t thought about earning a Ph.D., but was driven by the idea of putting science into action.

How did your work at DuPont lay the groundwork for your current vocation?

Of my 20 years at DuPont, 15 were in polymers. I was very interested in chemistry and chemistry-related work, and expanded into business management and product development, areas that would be critical to starting my own business. When I became immersed in industrial bioscience, I was sent to Europe to see how companies there were utilizing enzymes to improve biogas production on dairy farms. I spent a lot of time in Italy and Germany, visiting small dairy farms, typically those with fewer than 200 cows. Each of the farms I visited had anaerobic digesters, which I found fascinating. They were able to use these systems to produce energy, reduce carbon, and rid themselves of methane.

How did this all translate to you starting Ag-Grid Energy LLC?

After visiting many of those farms and companies in Europe, I did more research and realized that some U.S. farms were using anaerobic digesters, but not many. I decided I wanted to build my own digester, rather than remain in a corporate setting; I knew I wanted to be my own boss, and be able to take risks.

I started talking to farmers, and by the end of 2016, had identified four dairy farms that were willing to work with me. I recognized that these farmers were partners, not just clients, and that collaboration was critical to creating a dynamic entity that could be successful and sustainable.

There was a lot to learn, especially about financing and investors. I had to create a new business model that would allow investment in this field, and become knowledgeable about engineering, prospective builders and vendors, utilities, permitting, grants and much more. I literally had to claw my way up in the beginning, and finally found a bank that would help with financing, and a tax credit partner.

What happened next?

Well, from research to my first groundbreaking took two and a half years. By June 2019, I was up and running with two projects in Western Massachusetts. At that time, there weren’t any digesters in Connecticut, so I brought my Massachusetts team with me to Connecticut and was able to obtain partial funding through the Connecticut Green Bank.

It’s funny, you’d think something this practical, a science that makes so much sense, wouldn’t be so innovative or hard to finance. But this technology is more expensive to implement than are solar or wind, so funding is a challenge. Several states had food waste bans – that supported the new business model. In New England, the farms are small – the manure their cows produced wouldn’t be enough to create the extra energy needed to self-sustain and sell back to the grid, so the innovation became adding food waste to create that extra energy. I was able to gather food waste from food processing plants and grease trap waste from fast-food chains, and divert these to our project. Besides processing the waste and creating electricity, we also were enhancing nitrogen and phosphorus in remaining digestate, which are used in fertilizers on the crop farms where the dairy farmers produce feed for their cows.

Are your tanks for the digesters bigger than a breadbox?

Oh, my yes – we’re talking about million-gallon tanks buried underground, 120 feet in diameter and 20 feet deep. We also built covered lagoons or large concrete storage tanks to store the digestate which is rich in organic fertilizer. This process offers efficiency, heat, cogeneration and enhanced nutrient benefits. The heat is piped to areas of the farm and used to prevent icing in the barns and garages, and we’ve been able to reduce the farmers’ need to buy other fuels at our projects in Connecticut, Massachusetts and in New York.

What’s next for you and Ag-Grid?

Well, we recently broke ground on a new project in Michigan, which will include piped renewable natural gas, which is a new addition to our portfolio. We’re looking at larger farms, and now have 10 employees. We’ve become more technologically savvy as well, and use sophisticated sensors for remote monitoring and to help us analyze and then control feed digesters online. We’ll continue looking into “right sizing” our projects for maximum efficiency and profit for our customers, as well as the production and refining of chemical intermediates such as methanol and marine fuels.

We try to avoid energy politics – our interest is in helping farmers rebuild rural America by offering them ways to keep costs down, reduce their environmental footprint and remain good conservation stewards.

What lessons can you share from your experiences?

I can offer three insights. First, research and learning at UConn helped transform my thinking and vision. It’s critical to come to your studies with an open mind, and be willing to explore, experiment and take risks. One of the beauties of being in college is remaining nimble and trying to figure out how you can fit in the changing and new world order.

Second, balance is important. For me, a huge driver was finding the balance between creating a successful business and doing the right thing. It’s not just about making money – if you keep the greater good in mind, like the importance of protecting the environment, while at the same time helping sustain small farms, that balance will likely result in greater success.

That balance also includes personal needs and time. I live in Pennsylvania, have three children, love painting and reading, and find time to give back by being a director on my local school board, helping our schools make smart choices and decisions.

And finally, you need to know who you are, or to figure that out as you grow. I realized that big business wasn’t for me, that I was better suited to be a small business owner and entrepreneur. Carve your own path… find the passion that fits your personality and know that success – and the money – will come.",https://today.uconn.edu/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/akki-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 03:58:50.109108

Growing up in the small town of Kareli, he witnessed at first hand how farmers struggled with high energy costs, fertiliser shortages, and expensive waste management. This observation sparked the creation of BioNova.ge, a youth-led cleantech enterprise with a bold mission: “from waste to energy.”

“What was once considered a burden – organic waste – can become a resource for energy, fertiliser, and climate action,” says Nikoloz.

The idea for BioNova was born during research and interviews conducted with farmers and food businesses, which revealed a real need for solutions in organic waste processing. Many farmers and small enterprises faced high costs for waste management, energy, and fertiliser – challenges that a biogas system could help address.

Before receiving support from EU4Youth, BioNova was little more than an idea and a handful of early prototypes. The founders – Nikoloz Gongliashvili (CEO), Nikoloz Chikhladze (CTO), Mariam Beltadze (CFO), and Nini Nikoladze (COO) – faced challenges securing funding, accessing technical expertise, and convincing stakeholders that biogas could be economically viable as well as environmentally beneficial. They needed mentorship, financial resources, and a strong network of partners to turn their concept into a working enterprise.

How EU4Youth helped the idea take off

The team discovered the EU4Youth programme through Junior Achievement Georgia, and immediately recognised that its focus on social entrepreneurship and green innovation matched their vision.

Through the EU-funded EU4Youth Building Back Better Through Social Entrepreneurship project, BioNova received critical financial support for prototype development, alongside mentorship and training in business strategy and technology commercialisation. The programme also opened doors to valuable networking opportunities with partners both in Georgia and internationally.

This combination of guidance and resources allowed the team to refine their biogas prototypes, integrate IoT sensors, and develop a mobile app that provides real-time data on energy and fertiliser production. They also piloted an innovative methane capture system that converts emissions into biogenic CO₂, and engaged directly with farmers and communities through field demonstrations, building trust and demonstrating the tangible benefits of their technology.

Overcoming challenges

Like many young start-ups, BioNova faced several significant hurdles. Limited financial resources slowed early growth, while farmers’ initial scepticism meant the team had to invest considerable time in education and demonstrations to prove the value of their technology. At the same time, sourcing high-quality materials and sensors proved challenging in Georgia, creating additional delays and technical obstacles.

“The main challenge was raising awareness and convincing people that biogas technology is truly beneficial and capable of providing great value,” Nikoloz recalls.

But with persistence and partner support, BioNova overcame these barriers and built resilience – the kind that now defines its culture. Today, the enterprise has completed over 80% of product development and is preparing for market launch.

Impact and recognition

Since its inception, BioNova has achieved significant recognition, earning awards for both innovation and social impact. The team has been named winner of the CUnicorn Batch 3 Pre-Acceleration Programme, received the Social Impact Award 2024, the GITA 25K Shida Kartli Regional Grant, and was honoured as Agropreneur of the Year 2024 at the Future Agro Challenge. BioNova also won the Polish Acceleration Programme (PAR) for agritech innovation, the Kaspi Seeds Grant for Best Social Enterprise, and the European Single Market Expansion Award 2025.

Beyond the accolades, the team has made tangible progress: they have developed six prototypes (two still in pilot phase), produced 60 cubic metres of biogas in initial trials, partnered with over seven organisations, and conducted interviews with more than 120 farmers. They successfully raised 90,000 GEL for research, development, and materials, and built digesters ranging from 0.02 to 15 tons to accommodate a range of agricultural needs.

Building Georgia’s green future

BioNova’s long-term goal is to make biogas a driver of regional energy independence and sustainable agriculture in Georgia.

“Each biogas plant is a small but powerful building block of a decentralised energy network,” says Nikoloz. “It can reduce costs, improve energy security, and create new opportunities for local farmers.”

Next steps include standardising their product, securing CE certification for the European market, and expanding regionally across the Caucasus and Central Asia. Partnerships with organisations such as DENA (the German Energy Agency), GITA (Georgia’s Innovation and Technology Agency), and Roots of Impact will strengthen the start-up’s international reach.

Nikoloz and his team believe their journey is just beginning:

“We still have much work ahead, but through collaboration and partnership, we will reach our goals and help to create a more sustainable and greener future in Georgia.”

That’s why we need citizens across the continent — and around the world — to keep pushing for major investment in Africa’s renewable energy future.","Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg, Global Citizen’s first-ever summit on the African continent, marked the culmination of the year-long Scaling Up Renewables in Africa (SURA) campaign, closing with breakthrough pledges that will help unlock electricity access for over 17.5 million homes and deliver 26.8 gigawatts of clean energy across the continent by 2030. Held at the Sandton Convention Centre on Nov. 21, the summit made one thing clear: with the right investments, resources, and political will, Africa has what it takes to lead the world in delivering a clean energy future, transforming its unparalleled renewable potential into life-changing power for millions.

Co-chaired in partnership with Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission, and H.E. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa, with support from the International Energy Agency (IEA), Global Citizen’s 12-month SURA campaign secured pledges that will help with efforts to quadruple Africa’s renewable energy capacity by 2030.

The timing was significant. Convened on the historic eve of the first G20 Summit ever led by an African nation, the event convened Heads of State, major development finance institutions, private sector leaders, and engaged Global Citizens all laser-focused on one goal: closing Africa’s massive energy access gap. Through a series of new, timebound financial and policy commitments, leaders demonstrated they were ready to kickstart momentum, underscoring the urgent need to act at a moment when the continent’s rapid population growth, unmet energy needs, and escalating climate impacts are intensifying.

Serving as the official pledging moment for the SURA campaign, Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg united governments, investors, and citizens together to ignite momentum and build up a more resilient energy future for the continent. Here’s exactly how.

What Brought Global Citizen NOW to South Africa?

Global Citizen NOW is Global Citizen’s premier thought-leadership platform, bringing together world leaders, innovators, advocates, and cultural figures to drive urgent action to end extreme poverty. The sessions explore what solutions are working, where progress is falling short, and what must happen now to build a prosperous and sustainable future. With democratized access through online streaming, the summit extends its influence well beyond the room, offering panels that blend insights from government, business, and the arts to spark new ideas and partnerships around energy, equity, and development.

More than a series of conversations, Global Citizen NOW is designed to translate dialogue into impact. Participants contribute to major advocacy moments, help shape commitments, and drive real-world change. Past editions have catalyzed cross-sector solutions and meaningful pledges that advance the global fight against extreme poverty.

The first-ever Global Citizen NOW summit in Africa in Johannesburg marked a major milestone in the series’ global expansion following previous events in New York City, Melbourne, Rio de Janeiro, Detroit, Belém, and Sevilla.

This edition focused not only on energy access, but also global health security, building climate resilience, and promoting themes of solidarity, equality, and sustainability ahead of this year’s G20 meetings. To help, the summit enlisted a robust lineup of speakers, including H.E. Cyril Ramaphosa, President of the Republic of South Africa; Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission; Hakainde Hichilema, President of Zambia; Taoiseach Micheál Martin, Prime Minister of Ireland; Jonas Gahr Støre, Prime Minister of Norway; Dr. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, former UN Under-Secretary-General and Deputy President of South Africa; and Sipho Makhubela, Chief Executive Officer, Harith General Partners, along with other notable participants.

This landmark event was made possible by a network of cross-sector partners, including presenting partner Harith General Partners, who helped highlight the essential role the private sector can play in accelerating the build-up of Africa’s clean energy future. Other major partners included Octopus Energy, Pele Energy Group, and TransEnergy Global, along with support from Genesis Energy and PayPal. The event’s mission and programming were also amplified to audiences across Africa and beyond thanks to media partners including EIB Network, TimesLIVE, and Vanguard Media.

The Lowdown on SURA: What Is It and Why Does It Matter?

Officially launched in November 2024 by Global Citizen alongside President von der Leyen and President Ramaphosa, and developed with policy support from the International Energy Agency (IEA), SURA set out with a bold mission to confront Africa’s deep energy inequities head-on and help jumpstart the continent’s clean energy transformation.

The need to change course is undeniable. Today, over 600 million people in Africa live without reliable electricity, otherwise known as energy poverty, while one billion on the continent are forced to rely on unsafe cooking fuels such as charcoal, that harm both their health and the environment. With Africa’s population projected to reach two billion by 2050 — and with two out of every five children born in the world expected to be African — energy demand will only intensify, stretching continental energy grids and resources to their potential breaking point. Without decisive action, millions will remain without reliable power, locked out of economic opportunity, quality education, digital inclusion, and dependable health care.

Compounding the issue even more, many countries still depend heavily on outdated fossil fuels. For example, in South Africa — Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg’s host country — 82% of electricity still comes from coal, a sector that supports thousands of livelihoods country-wide, complicating a path towards fully embracing renewables. Public efforts to finance a clean transition have repeatedly fallen short, leaving communities vulnerable to regular power outages, rising costs, and escalating climate impacts.

SURA was designed as a direct call-to-action for leaders to address these challenges head-on. Meaningful, time-bound financial and policy commitments can help shift Africa’s current trajectory and make genuine progress towards meeting the COP28’s goal set in 2023 to triple renewable energy capacity by 2030.

The push for clean energy aligns with broader social and economic development needs. Electricity is the foundation for agricultural productivity, public services, economic growth, and stronger social welfare. Today, Africa faces some of the steepest challenges globally: it’s home to 33 of the world’s 47 least-developed countries, and less than half its population has regular electricity access. Energy poverty limits everything from a child’s ability to study after the sun goes down to hospitals’ ability to operate essential equipment or refrigerate life-saving vaccines.

Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg was designed to be the campaign’s defining culmination moment — the stage where momentum built up over the year turned into action with concrete pledges to deliver on SURA’s promises.

Not Just Good Economics, But a Moral and Climate Imperative

Economic and climate data tell a powerful story: expanding access to electricity is directly linked to economic growth, especially when that power is renewable. For every dollar invested in renewable energy, an additional $0.93 is generated. That math means investing in clean energy is one of the smartest economic investments a country can make.

For Africa, this transition is more essential than ever. Climate change is already costing the continent 5-15% of its GDP per capita growth due to extreme weather, droughts, food insecurity, and increasingly fragile, unreliable energy systems that come from it. As climate impacts intensify, scaling renewables is both an economic necessity and a climate imperative.

Globally, the stakes are sky high. To stay on track to reach net zero emissions by 2050, emerging markets and developing economies need to increase their clean energy investment from less than $150 billion today to over $1 trillion by 2030 — a seven-fold increase. A staggering challenge to say the least.

That’s where SURA came in. By amplifying youth leadership, local entrepreneurship, and innovative homegrown solutions, the campaign positioned Africa not as a passive recipient of aid, but as a global engine of clean energy growth.

What’s the State of Africa’s Renewable Energy Mix Now?

We know that Africa is home to some of the world’s richest renewable energy resources, yet much of this potential remains vastly untapped. Today, the continent generates roughly 18% of its energy from renewables — far behind regions like the European Union, where nearly half of the energy mix is clean.

The disconnect is striking. Imagine Africa’s solar potential as a gigantic water tap. Right now, only a trickle is being used, but its potential is overflowing. Africa’s countries experience more sunshine than anywhere else on Earth and hold 60% of the world’s best solar resources, but it accounts for only about 1% of installed global solar PV capacity. With an estimated 7,900 GW of potential energy — for context, just 1 GW is enough to power about 750,000 homes — solar represents Africa’s most significant clean energy opportunity. As the African Development Bank put it, the continent’s solar potential is “almost unlimited.”

Hydropower meanwhile already supplies around 40% of sub-Saharan Africa’s electricity, making it one of the region’s most established renewable technologies. But aging infrastructure, climate variability, and shifting rainfall patterns pose growing risks to hydropower’s long-term reliability and dominance. Wind power offers another major frontier to explore, with incredible onshore and offshore wind corridors spanning North, East, and West Africa. Meanwhile, geothermal resources along the East African Rift, spanning Kenya, Ethiopia, Djibouti, and Tanzania, offer dependable clean power, and bioenergy (where projects convert agricultural waste and landfill gas into electricity) is rapidly expanding in markets such as South Africa and Kenya. Collectively, these resources position Africa to build a diverse, resilient, and increasingly homegrown clean energy mix.

But progress is accelerating unevenly. North Africa leads in installed renewable capacity, driven by large-scale solar and wind developments. Southern Africa meanwhile is beginning to emerge as a hub of dynamic policy reform and project development. This is particularly true in South Africa, where newly introduced regulations aim to unlock private-sector investment. Initiatives like its Just Energy Transition Partnership (JETP) show how coordinated financing can help manage the social impacts of moving away from coal, ensuring workers and communities are not left behind. And although Central Africa — and smaller states such as Eswatini, Equatorial Guinea, and the Republic of Congo — remain underrepresented when it comes to global investment in renewable projects, the region is poised to more than double its renewable capacity once major hydropower and solar projects advance.

Altogether, this paints a clear picture: Africa has every ingredient needed to build a comprehensive, resilient clean-energy system — what’s missing is the investment to really kick it into high gear.

The Finance Gap

The problem? The money needed to pay for Africa’s energy transition far outpaces what’s currently available.

Over the past two decades, only about 2% of global renewable energy investment has flowed to Africa — and most of that has been concentrated in just a few countries. Capital also continues to favor fossil fuels, particularly gas and mixed fossil projects, while many low-income and fragile states facing acute energy poverty receive only minimal support. This imbalance threatens to widen an already deep energy equity divide across the continent.

Africa’s energy transition will require a comprehensive financing and policy strategy that goes beyond building new power plants. This includes modernizing outdated grids and strengthening transmission and distribution networks, while improving energy efficiency across homes, businesses, and industries — replacing inefficient appliances, systems, and equipment that drive up energy demand.

Stronger regulatory frameworks and expanded local technical expertise are also essential to support long-term investment. At the same time, countries need clear plans for developing new clean generation, particularly renewables, alongside modern grid infrastructure.

Empowering Africa’s Next Generation: Global Citizen Fellows

Africa’s clean energy future will be shaped by its young people, and the Reverse Power Panel — a youth-led initiative facilitated by Global Citizen ahead of the main summit — placed their leadership at the center of the conversation. With the continent home to the world’s youngest population — but also rising unemployment and limited economic opportunities — incorporating youth voices can’t just be an afterthought, it’s essential.

Investing in renewable energy can help close this gap: clean energy sectors create up to three times more jobs per dollar spent compared to fossil fuels. Building strong local expertise in modern energy systems is therefore critical for moving away from outdated and inefficient technologies.

A people-centered energy transition requires training programs, capacity-building initiatives, and opportunities for communities to design, manage, and maintain their own energy systems. These efforts reduce reliance on foreign specialists and strengthen local ownership. Initiatives such as the IEA’s energy-efficiency training for African professionals support this shift, preparing a new generation of workers for modern energy jobs.

Global Citizen is contributing to this momentum through its cohort of African Global Citizen Fellows, who bring expertise in renewable energy, advocacy, policy, and community organizing as well as helping drive youth engagement in the SURA campaign. Among them are young leaders such as Fèmi Tankpinou of Benin, founder of ECOZEM, a solar-powered urban transport service; Hope Dlamini from South Africa, a policy strategist and youth advocate; Lungile Magagula, a rising voice in climate and energy justice; and Manar Benessaidi of Morocco, a strategist working at the intersection of diplomacy, development, and local activism.

To elevate these voices even further, Global Citizen hosted the youth-led Reverse Power Panel on November 17 in Johannesburg. The event showcased Africa’s young clean-energy innovators alongside government and civil society leaders, including Deputy Minister of Electricity and Energy Samantha Graham-Maré and Africa Change Lab Director Bhekumuzi Dean Bhebhe. The session’s goal was clear: transform youth-driven ideas into actionable commitments, place young Africans at the center of decision-making, and demonstrate what truly youth-powered climate and energy leadership looks like.

Past SURA Commitments: Turning Momentum Into Real Power

To catch you up to speed: Commitments announced earlier in the SURA campaign included major commitments made at this year’s Global Citizen Festival in New York City in September, including Globeleq’s pledge to deliver 1.3 gigawatts of new, clean power across key markets, spanning solar, wind, and other renewable technologies, reaching an estimated 6 million residents. Additionally, Energea announced it would invest $250 million toward expanding renewables on the continent. Pele Energy Group also announced plans to expand capacity from 10 gigawatts over the next decade to provide renewable energy to 3.1 million homes.

At this year’s Global Citizen NOW: Impact Sessions and Global Citizen Festival in September, calls for action delivered. Major new pledges for renewable energy projects across Africa were unveiled, together amounting to enough electricity to connect more than 4.6 million households by 2030.

One of the first big commitments came from South African energy company Globeleq, which announced plans to build 1.3 gigawatts of new renewable power generation across Africa — enough to light up around 1.5 million homes. In a video message played at the Festival, CEO Jonathan Hoffman captured the importance of the moment: “Power generation is like building the foundation of a house. You can build more when you have more power.” In other words, more electricity means more opportunity for entire economies.

Then came one of the most ambitious pledges ever made from a Global Citizen stage. Pele Energy Group committed to roll out 10 gigawatts of renewable energy over the next decade — a massive expansion that will electrify 3.1 million households within five years, scaling up to 6.25 million households across 11 African countries within 10 years. CEO Gqi Raoleka described the pledge as part of a shared mission: “Meeting an organization such as Global Citizen is a perfect alignment of entities preoccupied with a social imperative, [it is] the change we all want to see in eradicating global poverty.”

Momentum continued with Energea, an impact-focused energy investment platform, announcing a $250 million commitment to expand renewable energy projects across Africa over the next five years. Most of the investment will go toward new solar infrastructure, bringing clean, reliable power directly to communities that need it most. Meanwhile, the European Commission detailed how its massive clean-energy financing package for Africa — part of a €3.4 billion pledge made at COP28 — will be rolled out in support of the SURA campaign.

Earlier in the year, TransEnergy Global set the tone for breakthroughs at Global Citizen NOW: Sevilla in June, at which they announced a groundbreaking move: Project Mzansi. This initiative will see the purchase of a major coal reserve in Limpopo, not to extract the coal, but to rather keep it in the ground for at least 100 years. This historic first will keep 118 million tons of coal in the ground, preventing 236 million tons of CO₂ from ever entering the atmosphere. To finance the project, TransEnergy will release energy transition credits, a new type of carbon credit that helps companies meet their decarbonization goals. The company will then reinvest these proceeds into local communities and renewable energy projects across South Africa.

A Series of Electrifying Panels

Throughout the day, Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg convened an extraordinary lineup of leaders from across government, business, civil society, philanthropic, and creative sectors to shape a vision for meaningful leadership at the G20 and beyond.

Across every discussion, one message rang clear: African nations are the drivers of bold, scalable solutions to some of the world’s most urgent challenges. From accelerating renewable energy and economic transformation to sparking discussions about how to strengthen health security, job creation, and global governance reform, the panels demonstrated how African leadership, powered by an engaged civic society and citizen engagement, can unlock a brighter future for all.

The day opened with welcoming remarks from actress, humanitarian, and Global Citizen Ambassador Nomzamo Mbatha, who also served as host throughout the summit, setting the stage for a series of panels that brought these themes to life:

Johannesburg 2025: A Defining Moment for Global Progress

In this opening conversation, an all-star lineup — including actress and Global Citizen Ambassador Nomzamo Mbatha, global health champion Sibulele Sibaca-Nomnganga, Pele Energy CEO Gqi Raoleka, former South African Deputy President Dr. Phumzile Mlambo-Ngcuka, and legendary artist and humanitarian Yvonne Chaka Chaka — dove into what it means for the continent and the world for an African nation to host the G20 summit for the first time. Speakers shared how African leaders, innovators, and communities are reshaping the trajectory of global priorities, painting a picture of a continent leading the way — and inviting the world to follow.

Global Health Security for Shared Prosperity

Dr. Sivuyile Madikana of Discovery Health moderated a conversation between together Lady Roslyn Morauta, Chair of The Global Fund Board, and Robbie Brozin, co-founder of Nando’s and Goodbye Malaria, to tackle one of Africa’s biggest questions: how do we keep people healthy in a world full of overlapping crises? From climate change to pandemic threats to fragile health systems, the panel unpacked how smart investments, stronger public-private partnerships, and community-led solutions can build resilience from the ground up. Their message was clear: when we protect people’s health, we can unlock long-term prosperity across the continent.

The Global Fund — the largest grant funder of health programs in low- and middle-income countries — has proven an essential resource for nations building up health infrastructure and community health networks. But the number that speaks above all else? They’ve saved an astounding 70 million lives since 2002.

With the Global Fund’s 8th replenishment taking place at the same time as the summit, ultimately mobilizing $11.34 billion, the conversation turned to how crucial investments in public health care are to defeat virulent diseases such as HIV, tuberculosis, and malaria, and why they are among the most cost-effective ways to protect people, economies, and global systems. Leaders underscored the importance of public–private partnerships, community leadership, and steady financing to build stronger, more resilient safeguards capable of stopping future pandemics before they start.

That point is brought to life through the work of (RED), which for nearly two decades now has partnered with leading global brands and organizations to raise awareness of the fight against AIDS and the injustices that allow it to persist. (RED) has supported the Global Fund’s work specifically through grants that help the Fund deliver essential HIV testing, treatment, and care, in addition to supporting healthcare workers and strengthening health systems. Founded by Bono and Bobby Shriver, (RED) has generated more than $800 million for the Global Fund and recently pledged $75 million towards its latest replenishment, made possible through partnerships with companies including Apple, Bank of America, Fiat, Gilead, Merck/MSD, Roche, Salesforce, Santander, and Vespa.

Energy Access: The Engine of Development

This dynamic session led by Zoisa North-Bond, CEO of Octopus Energy Generation, brought together Jito Kayumba, Special Assistant to the President of Zambia, and Akinwole Omoboriowo II, CEO of Genesis Energy, for a conversation that cut straight to the heart of progress: power. Speakers explored how reliable energy is the spark that ignites development. With more renewable power, countries can light up hospitals, boost education, grow businesses, and create jobs, setting off a “development dividend” that lifts entire communities. In other words, when a nation gets its energy mix right, it sets the stage for true economic growth.

PayPal Small Business Impact Awards

During this inspiring session, co-moderated by PayPal’s Middle East & Africa Senior Vice President & Regional Head Otto Williams and actress-entrepreneur Pearl Thusi, the evening celebrated the recently announced winners of PayPal’s Small Business Impact Awards — an initiative by PayPal and Global Citizen to celebrate small businesses advancing social and environmental impact.

Recipients of this year’s awards included Somnath Ray, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the US-based CLIP company, which is committed to democratizing public transport through e-bike access; Kunjpreet Arora, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the India-based Angirus, which develops alternative, sustainable construction materials; Franco Rodriguez Viau, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer of the Argentinian firm Satellites on Fire, which has leveraged AI to improve wildfire alert systems; Zizipho Ntobongwana, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sheba Feminine, based in South Africa, which creates sustainable and inclusive period products for all; and Filip Lundin, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Sopköket AB, a Swedish organization that tackles food waste, hunger, and social exclusion. These inspiring entrepreneurs took the stage to showcase exactly how small businesses can be at the forefront of everything from advancing climate solutions to empowering women and uplifting communities, and how entrepreneurship can spark social innovation for the public good.

Fireside Chat: Scaling Up Renewables in Africa

South African President Cyril Ramaphosa, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen, and Global Citizen CEO Hugh Evans sat down together to discuss the goals of the SURA campaign in-depth. This high-level dialogue dug into how Africa and its global partners can work together to rapidly scale renewables, unlock investment, and boost energy security across the continent. The leaders stressed that tripling renewables by 2030 is an ambitious goal, but also immensely achievable as long as collaboration and financing flows where it’s most needed.

Sabrina Dhowre Elba, CEO, Activist, and Global Citizen European Board Chair, sat down with the Prime Minister of Ireland, Taoiseach Micheál Martin, to discuss how Ireland and Africa can work together to shape a more equitable renewable-energy future. Ireland’s own rapid energy transition has reshaped its national trajectory, and the commitments announced at the summit signal the possibility of similar change for millions across the African continent. A central theme of the conversation was the importance of a just, locally owned energy transition, as Martin underscored that true collaboration means ensuring communities benefit directly from renewable-energy investments.

Leadership in Crisis: A Conversation with Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre

Norway’s Prime Minister Jonas Gahr Støre joined Global Citizen’s Co-Founder and Chief Policy, Impact, and Government Relations Officer Michael Sheldrick and Dr. Sidi Ould Tah of the African Development Bank Group to dig into what real leadership looks like in a turbulent world. From climate to economic shocks, Prime Minister Støre reflected on how challenges test governments and demand smart, steady, compassionate leadership. He highlighted the importance of global cooperation and highlighted Mission 300, a joint initiative between the Rockefeller Foundation and the World Bank working to help provide electricity to 300 million people across Africa by 2030 through policy reform, infrastructure investment, and private sector collaboration.

Catalyzing Africa: Harith, AfDB, and the Power of Homegrown Finance

Led by Sabrina Dhowre Elba, Global Citizen European Board Chair, this conversation turned the spotlight to the power of African-led finance. Joined by Sipho Makhubela, CEO of Harith General Partners, and Hon. Maropene Ramokgopa, South Africa’s Minister in the Presidency for Planning, Monitoring & Evaluation, the panel made one thing clear: when African institutions, investors, and governments take the lead, backed by strong public–private partnerships, the continent can shape its own economic future. With homegrown capital fueling development, people across the continent can drive growth that’s both resilient and truly homegrown.

Commitment to Capital: Financing Africa’s Future

Moderated by CNBC’s Fifi Peters, this discussion brought together Matsi Modise of the World Climate Foundation, Alexio Musindo from the International Labour Organization, and Josh Wilson from TIME Africa & Global Venture Partners to explore how clever financial tools and blended public-private investments can create good jobs, strengthen communities, and build lasting prosperity. The conversation made it clear that unlocking capital isn’t just about money; it’s about investing in people and systems that can carry Africa’s growth forward for generations.

Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg: More Than Conversations, Real Commitments

Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg saw several monumental pledges announced on its stage, adding up to a historic evening marking some of the largest investments dedicated exclusively to jumpstarting Africa’s clean energy future to date.

Across governments, development banks, and private companies, leaders unveiled a decisive shift in support of the continent’s energy systems and will help drive progress towards quadrupling Africa’s renewable energy capacity by 2030.

Europe’s €15 Billion Investment in African Renewables

In one of the biggest moments of the entire night, the European Union (EU) confirmed a combined €15.1 billion in support for renewable energy development across Africa. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen made the announcement on stage, detailing a package that includes €13 billion in grants, loans, guarantees, and equity through European financial institutions and EU Member States, along with €2.1 billion anticipated to be leveraged from private sector partners. €3.1 billion of this pledge had been announced previously over the course of 2025, including during the EU-South Africa summit in March, the Mattei Plan for Africa and Global Gateway event in June, the Africa Climate Summit and the United Nations General Assembly in September and the Global Gateway Forum in October. The last €7 billion was announced during Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg.

The package announced by President von der Leyen includes new Global Gateway projects that count contributions from Germany, France, Denmark, Italy, the Netherlands, and Spain as well as the European Investment Bank and the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development. Several impactful projects across the continent will benefit from this funding, including: building up mini-grid electricity systems to light up rural areas in Madagascar; a major new hydropower plant in Malawi; the development of renewables from solar in Zambia to help upgrade water supply systems in urban and rural areas; a new photovoltaic solar power plant in Côte d’Ivoire; support for early-stage renewable energy projects and companies in the Democratic Republic of Congo; two major projects to help provide access to sustainable cooking fuels and solutions across Central, Southern, and East Africa, as well as Indian Ocean regions. A full list of projects can be found here.

EU leaders such as Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni, Federal Chancellor of Germany Friedrich Merz, Portuguese Prime Minister Luis Montenegro, Sweden’s Minister for EU Affairs Jessica Rosencrantz, the Netherlands’ Huib-Jan de Ruijter, Chief Investment Officer of FMO, the Dutch entrepreneurial development bank, and President of the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development Odile Renaud-Basso and Nadia Calviño, President of the European Investment Bank, all appeared via video to highlight the investments made to date through the SURA campaign. Denmark and Austria also announced new commitments to SURA, as did Irish Taoiseach Micheál Martin announcing a €5 million contribution to the International Energy Agency’s Clean Energy Transitions Programme.

Given the diverse nature of European financing tools and reporting cycles, the consolidated figure includes projects and instruments that may have been public, under negotiation, or previously announced in other contexts, but which directly contribute to expanding renewable energy generation, transmission, and energy access across Africa.

Development Banks & Regional Partners Strengthen Continental Commitments

In addition to Europe’s support, several major development institutions announced new commitments. The African Development Bank pledged to allocate at least 20 percent of all African Development Fund resources to renewable energy, marking a significant shift toward clean-power priorities. Norwegian Prime Minister Støre committed NOK 3.1 billion (about $300 million), including about $61 million specifically for renewable-energy projects, over three years to the African Development Fund starting in 2026.

More regional efforts were announced as well. The Development Bank of Southern Africa shared its ambition to provide an additional 3 GW of clean energy capacity., Meanwhile, Zambia unveiled significant new targets towards their Green City and Urban Solar initiatives, which together will deliver 211 MW of renewable energy, create nearly 4,000 new jobs, and impact around 2.4 million people total.

The Private Sector Steps Up: Multi-Billion Dollar Action Across the Continent

One of the most significant commitments came from CrossBoundary Energy, who announced they had secured $200 million towards their goal of a $1 billion pipeline of renewable projects by 2030, spanning solar, wind, and battery storage. Meanwhile, Genesis Energy Group stepped forward with one of the largest private-sector commitments of the summit, announcing plans to deliver 10 GW of clean energy across Africa over the next 5 to 10 years. This expansion has the potential to provide power to an estimated 11.2 million households, reaching more than 33 million people while creating between 184,000 and 252,000 construction jobs and 13,700 to 20,500 long-term jobs.

Global Citizen NOW: Johannesburg presenting partner Harith announced they would scale up their energy investment to the tune of delivering 3.5 GW of renewable energy, reaching around 850,000 people over the next five years. Enertrag announced its plan to deliver 1.2 GW of grid-secure renewable power in South Africa from 2026, enough to supply over 800,000 homes and benefit up to 2.8 million people while offsetting 3.5 million tons of CO₂ each year — equivalent to taking 800,000 cars off the road.

Scatec announced a major expansion of its global renewable energy portfolio, pledging to expand its clean energy project portfolio globally by $500 million, with a particular focus on the African continent. With 5.4 GW of power already secured, including 4.7 GW across Africa, these projects are expected to help avoid 6 million tons of CO₂ annually once operational.

Household access and consumer energy solutions also saw major momentum. Sun King, a leader in off-grid solar products, announced a $1.3 billion commitment by 2030 to deploy 3.8 GW of solar energy. Their goal: bring clean power to 50 million homes, schools, health centers, and small businesses, bringing clean electricity to 200 million people while creating 45,000 jobs and opening 1,200 new stores across Africa. Octopus Energy meanwhile expanded its Power Africa Fund with an additional $200 million in funding, bringing its total value to $450 million dedicated to accelerating clean energy across the continent. This expanded fund is projected to help deploy 180 MW of new renewable generation and deliver reliable electricity to 1.1 million people, supporting households, businesses, and essential services connect to essential power.

Together, these commitments reflect a powerful shift: the private sector is not just talking about Africa’s renewable potential — it’s investing in it. From billion-dollar portfolios to millions of new households electrified, the announcements from Johannesburg show that Africa’s clean energy transition is accelerating, and the world is finally starting to match its ambition.

Total SURA Commitments Rundown

Throughout the year, SURA showcased what bold, collective action can achieve, all backed by major commitments from member states of the European Union, other national governments, leading private sector energy companies, and multilateral development banks. Through this campaign, partners pledged 26.8 gigawatts of renewable energy, enough to power 17.5 million homes,

Over the last 13 years, Global Citizen has helped deploy more than $50 billion in commitments made through its platform and events, impacting 1.3 billion lives worldwide. These milestones prove that while Global Citizen’s mission to defeat poverty and defend the planet is ambitious, progress can be tangibly achieved when people campaign collectively, act strategically, and demand bold action from our leaders.

Global Citizen has a strict due diligence and accountability process to ensure that all commitments announced are brand new and come complete with a clear, detailed plan for delivery. Each pledge is vetted, monitored, and evaluated from beginning to final implementation for its measurable impact and alignment with Global Citizen’s campaign objectives.

Read on for a comprehensive rundown of every pledge made over the course of the year-long SURA campaign:

Looking Ahead: This Is Just Beginning

Though the pledging event is over, the conversations sparked in Johannesburg are just getting started. Africa’s energy future is already taking shape, led by the young people, communities, and local innovators who feel the pressing need to address the realities of unreliable electricity every single day. They understand what energy poverty really looks like, what climate risks mean for daily life, and what kinds of solutions truly work on the ground. Their efforts are proof that Africa’s clean energy transition is happening right now — and that with the right support, it can scale even faster.

To keep this momentum growing, public engagement is essential. When people everywhere raise their voices, governments, companies, and financial institutions pay attention. That’s why we need citizens across the continent — and around the world — to keep pushing for major investment in Africa’s renewable energy future. Every call, every message, and every action helps build the political will to unlock more funding for clean, affordable power.

Policymakers and development agencies have a crucial role to play. It’s time to update outdated energy and financing strategies, embrace solutions fit for Africa’s realities, and strike the right balance between urgent development needs and long-term sustainability. When that happens, Africa can tap into its incredible renewable potential, drive inclusive and equitable growth, and build an energy system designed for the future.

The challenges ahead are clear. But so are the opportunities. This moment could be one of our greatest chances to help shape a more sustainable, prosperous future for Africa and for the world could well be one of the biggest of our time. Now is the time to light the way forward to a brighter future.",https://img.globalcitizen.org/yGsSh1F3o0NhihEc8eR9LPdJ7Tx5cu-ZRJUWs8Y2/1500x670%2Ffilters%3Aquality%2885%29%3Afocal%282473%2C1649%29%2Fhttps%3A%2F%2Fmedia.globalcitizen.org%2Fab%2F25%2Fab2588f1-839d-4efe-93e6-55d5b2b7faaa%2F2247799726.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 02:58:20.722156

Click to get this free report Constellation Energy Corporation (CEG) : Free Stock Analysis Report Duke Energy Corporation (DUK) : Free Stock Analysis Report This article originally published on Zacks Investment Research (zacks.com).","The electricity producers in the United States are experiencing a surge in demand for clean electricity. The increase in demand was due to AI-based data centers, an increase in domestic manufacturing through the reshoring of some industries, an increase in usage of electric appliances and rapid adoption of electric vehicles. A massive volume of reliable, 24X7 emission-free electricity can come from the nuclear power plants. Constellation Energy CEG and Duke Energy Corporation DUK produce a large volume of electricity from nuclear power plants and have plans to expand their generation volumes.

Nuclear power plants consistently achieve high-capacity factors, allowing them to run at or near full output for extended periods. This makes nuclear energy a dependable source of baseload electricity, especially compared with intermittent renewables. In May 2025, President Trump signed four executive orders aimed at strengthening the nuclear supply chain and accelerating the deployment of new reactors. These initiatives target a substantial expansion of U.S. nuclear capacity, increasing it from roughly 100 gigawatts (“GW”) today to 400 GW by 2050.

Constellation Energy presents a strong investment opportunity as the largest producer of carbon-free nuclear power in the United States. Its fleet of dependable, high-capacity nuclear plants delivers steady baseload electricity, reducing exposure to commodity price swings and enhancing cash flow predictability. As demand grows for clean, around-the-clock power from data centers and industrial electrification, Constellation Energy is positioned to capture value from zero-emission energy. Ongoing reinvestment and supportive policy initiatives further reinforce its long-term growth prospects.

Duke Energy presents an attractive long-term investment supported by a broad clean energy portfolio along with a dependable nuclear fleet. Its nuclear facilities deliver steady baseload generation, contributing to earnings stability and constructive regulatory engagement. Alongside this foundation, Duke Energy continues to scale its solar, wind and battery storage initiatives, strengthening the clean energy strategy. The combination of reliable nuclear output and an expanding renewable platform positions the company for sustainable rate-base growth and durable cash flow performance.

With clean energy demand accelerating, it is worth taking a closer look at the fundamentals of both companies to determine which one presents the stronger investment opportunity.

Heading into this year’s fall lobbying, CCL volunteers had an important reminder ringing in their ears: turning a policy idea into a law is a marathon, not a sprint. That was the message from CCL Vice President of Government Relations, Jennifer Tyler, in her “Lobby Week Asks and Opportunities” session during our Fall Virtual Conference on Nov. 15.

Each step forward teaches us something and makes the next step possible, building toward bigger wins. With that mindset, Jenn reminded us, even successes that seem small should be celebrated as significant progress. They show us what works and what doors might be opening next.

“All [wins] are crucial to preserving climate policies already on the books, advancing new ones, or setting the stage for future progress,” Jenn said.

Making progress in Congress

CCLers spent most of the past year claiming those wins and laying the groundwork for more progress. For example, from January to July, CCLers advocated hard to protect clean energy tax credits that were at serious risk of being repealed during the budget reconciliation process. We helped limit the steepest proposed cuts to those tax credits as well as prevent a new tax on solar and wind. Along the way, we saw dozens of Republican lawmakers speak up about the benefits clean energy tax credits had brought to their district or state, showing that we’re changing the conversation and building more common ground on climate and clean energy.

Watch Jenn’s conference session to hear about other noteworthy progress we’ve seen this year, including on the Fix Our Forests Act and on bipartisan permitting reform.

Our Fall Lobby Week asks

With the importance of steady progress and the long game in mind, Jenn and CCL Research Manager Dana Nuccitelli laid out the asks volunteers would be discussing with Congress during the fall lobbying push.

The three primary asks include:

Comprehensive bipartisan permitting reform: We’re asking all members of Congress to negotiate and pass a bipartisan permitting reform package — crucial for more clean energy development across the country. When? “They need to do permitting reform right now,” said Jenn. “Not in a year or three years.”

Fix Our Forests Act (FOFA): We’re asking all senators and House Democrats to support FOFA, either when it comes up on the Senate floor or when it passes the Senate and returns to the House. The better we can protect forests, the better trees can do their job pulling climate pollution out of the atmosphere.

Foreign pollution fee legislation: Lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are starting to recognize the importance of a fee on carbon intensity for imported goods. CCLers are asking House Republicans to implement foreign pollution fee legislation, also referred to as carbon border adjustment legislation.

Our asks in action

Armed with knowledge from CCL’s Government Relations and Research teams, volunteers began attending more than 300 virtual lobby meetings with congressional offices. Most of these meetings took place Nov. 17-21, during our official Lobby Week, but meetings are scheduled to continue through December due to delays from the government shutdown.

To further amplify our lobbying asks, we kicked off a call-in campaign on Nov. 17. Calling Congress ahead of time to voice support shows lawmakers and staff that the people in the lobby meeting have many more community members who share their perspective. Broad support helps build political safety for Members of Congress to act on climate — a key part of our theory of change, outlined in our strategic plan.

So far, volunteers have placed an additional 812 calls to Congress from home in support of permitting reform. We’re hoping to reach 1,000 calls before the end of the fall lobbying push. Add your voice!

In the meantime, CCLers will press on with remaining meetings and sharing their appreciation across social media. Volunteers have posted from their meetings with Rep. George Latimer (NY-16), Rep. Emily Randall (WA-06), Sen. Michael Bennett (CO), Rep. Mikie Sherill (NJ-11), Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand (NY), Rep. William Timmons (SC-4, pictured above) and many more.

While many other climate groups have stepped back from D.C., we’re stepping up and pushing forward.

“Your advocacy is seen, it’s valued, and it’s working,” Jenn told CCL volunteers in her conference session. “Even in the hardest seasons, you’re changing the tone of the climate conversation in Congress — one meeting, one relationship, and one small but significant step at a time.”",https://citizensclimatelobby.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Timmons-meeting.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 02:58:30.004747

Chinese market share will peak at 13.0% in 2028 and slip back to 11.7% in 2030 or 756,000 vehicles.
This will be helped by entrenched local loyalty to heritage European brands.
10% by 2030 seems plausible Michael Fisher, data scientist at the financial analysis platform TradingPedia, said Chinese EV sales might reach 10% by 2030.
This uneven adoption will influence both the pace and scope of Chinese EV market penetration across Europe,” said Fisher.","Sales of Chinese electric vehicles in Europe continue to power ahead and the advance is expected to gain momentum. But new models planned by local manufacturers should help bring it under control and flatten out the trend before the end of the decade.

Schmidt Automotive Research said Western Europe market share for Chinese EVs will jump to 11.0% this year or 269,450 vehicles, up from 9.6% in 2024, and compared with only 3.8% in 2021. Chinese market share will peak at 13.0% in 2028 and slip back to 11.7% in 2030 or 756,000 vehicles.

Western Europe includes the 5 largest markets of Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Spain.

The overall share for Chinese manufacturers including plug-in hybrids and hybrids will jump from 3.4% in 2024 to 6.0% this year or 701,750 vehicles. Overall share will advance to 7.5% in 2026 and reach 9.9% by 2030 or 1,292,000 vehicles, according to Schmidt Automotive.

Meanwhile, the European Automobile Manufacturers Association (ACEA) announced Tuesday EV sales in all of Europe in the first 10 months of the year reached 1.5 million for a market share of 16.4%, up from 13.2% in 2024. The overall market was up 1.4% at 11 million.

China share more than trebled

China’s EV market share has more than trebled in Europe to around 7.0% in the first half of 2025 compared with about 2.0% in 2022, BMI, a Fitch Solutions company, said.

EV model launches planned over the next couple of years will provide some defense against intensifying Chinese competition. This will be helped by entrenched local loyalty to heritage European brands.

Major brands like Volkswagen, Mercedes, BMW, Renault and Stellantis are planning a big rollout of more advanced and competitively priced small EVs and PHEVs. Planned EV launches include Volkswagen’s ID.1, ID Polo, Renault’s 5 E-Tech, Stellantis’s Citroen e-C3, Peugeot E-208 and Fiat Panda EV.

The next phase for China will be its switch to producing in Europe, propelled by the European Union’s tariffs on imported EVs. This will also help to buttress its image among European buyers.

BYD has already announced plans for factories in Hungary, Turkey and maybe Spain. SAIC, owner of the biggest-selling MG brand, hasn’t announced any local production plans yet. Chery and its Omoda and Jaecoo brands has a plant in Spain.

10% by 2030 seems plausible

Michael Fisher, data scientist at the financial analysis platform TradingPedia, said Chinese EV sales might reach 10% by 2030.

“Growth rates are impressive, but they appear to be moderating, suggesting that a 10% EV share by the end of the decade is plausible, though it will depend on regulatory support, consumer adoption, and the competitive response of established European manufacturers,” Fisher said in an email exchange.

“BYD and SAIC are likely to lead Chinese EV penetration in Europe, with BYD particularly strong in mainstream segments and SAIC steadily expanding its footprint. European automakers, including Volkswagen, Stellantis, BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Renault, continue to dominate overall car sales, but the rapid growth of Chinese brands represents a notable competitive challenge, particularly in smaller and more affordable segments,” Fisher said.

Could this push from China, in a market likely to be stagnant, cause any incumbents financial problems?

“At this stage, it is unlikely that Chinese expansion will directly trigger bankruptcies among established European automakers. However, weaker regional brands may face increasing pressure, if Chinese sales continue to accelerate. EV penetration remains highest in countries such as Norway, Iceland, and the Netherlands, while southern and eastern European markets, including Italy, Poland, and Greece, show lower adoption rates. This uneven adoption will influence both the pace and scope of Chinese EV market penetration across Europe,” said Fisher.

Great Wall Motor plans Europe factory

On Thursday, China’s Great Wall Motor said, according to Reuters, that it plans to make 300,000 vehicles in Europe by 2029. GWM is looking at sites in Spain and Hungary and other unspecified locations. GWM’s Ora 3 and Haval SUV brands are already selling in Europe. It plans to launch the Ora 5 compact SUV in Europe next year, Reuters reported.

Geely recently announced it will sell its own name brand in Europe with the target of opening 1,000 dealerships in five years. Geely also owns Volvo, Polestar, Zeekr and Lotus and the PHEV maker Lynk & Co.

Some Chinese interlopers might fail

Schmidt Automotive founder Matt Schmidt said in the report all these brands, especially those aimed at the higher end, are unlikely to remain for the long term and some consolidation is likely.

“The main entry to Europe for Chinese brands continues to be from a volume brand perspective, with manufacturers such as Renault, Ford, Stellantis, as well as Volkswagen’s core brands all exposed to the threat of Chinese offering a comparably priced model in the same segment but with a higher trim package, whilst remaining profitable thanks to their Chinese cost base, despite tariffs” Schmidt said in the report.",https://imageio.forbes.com/specials-images/imageserve/6927178995f65e8d6e803b7b/0x0.jpg?format=jpg&height=900&width=1600&fit=bounds,N,,2025-11-27 12:03:52.661539

Brown, Alexandra Hamilton",,,,,https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/key-takeaways-from-cop30-un-climate-change-conference,"Last week marked the close of the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Belém, Brazil.
Below is an overview of the most notable developments from Belém and the emerging expectations for future climate action.
In contrast, California Governor Gavin Newsom attended COP30, sharply criticizing federal climate policy and positioning California—the world’s fourth‑largest economy—as a “stable and reliable partner” for global climate mitigation efforts.

Trade- The Global Mutirão acknowledged the importance of international trade policies to climate action.","Last week marked the close of the 30th Conference of the Parties (COP30) to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) in Belém, Brazil. COP30, billed by some as the COP of “truth” or “implementation,” sought to advance key issues tied to the climate goals established under the Paris Agreement, now ten years in effect. Below is an overview of the most notable developments from Belém and the emerging expectations for future climate action.

A much reported takeaway from COP30 is the fact that it concluded without agreement on a unified roadmap to phase down fossil fuel use. More than 80 countries reportedly pushed for a detailed global plan. But consensus proved elusive, underscoring persistent geopolitical and economic divisions, and the term “fossil fuels” does not appear in the final COP30 decision text—the Global Mutirão (a Brazilian term derived from the indigenous Tupi-Guarani language meaning “collective effort”). Instead, the outcome defers the issue to voluntary national and regional processes and a Brazil‑led initiative outside the formal UNFCCC track focused on developing transition strategies.

Attention also focused on the absence of US federal officials, marking the first COP in 30 years without formal US government representation. This absence reflects the Trump Administration’s climate and energy policy positions and its narrower approach to multilateral climate engagement. In contrast, California Governor Gavin Newsom attended COP30, sharply criticizing federal climate policy and positioning California—the world’s fourth‑largest economy—as a “stable and reliable partner” for global climate mitigation efforts.

At the same time, many observers viewed COP30 as an important step in sustaining international climate cooperation amid significant geopolitical and market headwinds. COP30 involved consultations on several key topics, led by pairs of developed and developing countries, including adaptation, finance, mitigation, just transition, technology, and gender. The Global Mutirão decision document emphasizes progress made over the past decade, including rapid technological advancements, falling clean‑energy costs, and record investment in renewable power and low‑carbon infrastructure. It also expressly reaffirms the commitment made in the Paris Agreement to pursue efforts to limit the global average temperature increase to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels and “acknowledges that the global transition towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate‑resilient development is irreversible and the trend of the future,” signaling the continued long‑term direction of global climate policy.

Below are additional high level takeaways from COP30:

Nationally Determined Contributions- In the lead-up to COP30, many stakeholders called for greater climate ambition—including updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), which outline each nation’s emissions-reduction targets and broader climate-action commitments. NDC revisions can translate into new permitting requirements, technology standards, procurement rules, and climate‑related disclosure obligations. A significant number of countries have yet to submit their updated NDCs, and there was broad consensus in Belém that the current set of NDCs is insufficient to keep global temperature rise below 1.5°C. Under the Paris Agreement, the next NDC cycle will cover 2025–2035, with progress assessed during the next Global Stocktake.

The final COP30 decision underscored the need to align existing NDCs with nations’ long-term strategies for low-emissions development and encouraged nations to chart pathways toward global net-zero emissions by mid-century, keeping the 1.5°C goal “within reach.” Post-COP30, attention will shift to both raising ambition (e.g., stronger mitigation targets in forthcoming NDCs) and moving from ambition to implementation, including country-specific and sector-specific plans—particularly in energy, industry, transport, and land use. These forthcoming strategies will shape regulatory frameworks, investment signals, and compliance obligations for private-sector actors across multiple jurisdictions.

Forest Preservation- Although the Global Mutirão omitted any formal plan to address deforestation, despite fairly widespread support among countries, one of the most consequential outcomes of COP30 was the announcement of the Tropical Forests Forever Facility (TFFF)—a proposed $125 billion, performance-based fund aimed at compensating tropical nations for preserving standing forests. Potential performance metrics expected under TFFF include verified reductions in annual deforestation, forest carbon stock maintenance, and satellite validated land use change avoidance. Although questions remain about how TFFF will be capitalized and governed, its launch marks a major pivot toward scalable, results-based finance for nature, with an emphasis on high-value forest regions in the Amazon, Congo Basin, and Southeast Asia.

TFFF’s design signals a shift away from short-term, project-level conservation toward predictable, multi-decade, sovereign-level forest-protection finance supported by robust, science-driven monitoring. Importantly for private-sector stakeholders, payments will be tied to verified reductions in deforestation, opening clearer commercial pathways for carbon-market integration, jurisdictional nature-based credits, and blended-finance structures. TFFF is also expected to operate alongside emerging regulatory regimes—such as the EU Deforestation Regulation (EUDR)—and may help create a more coherent policy environment for corporate supply-chain compliance and sustainability reporting. Together, these developments position TFFF as a potentially transformative tool for companies navigating evolving legal, financial, and ESG expectations around forest risk.

Carbon Capture Utilization and Storage- Although the Global Mutirão does not explicitly reference “carbon capture, utilization, and storage” (CCUS), several provisions in the COP30 Global Climate Action Agenda Outcomes Report (Action Agenda) directly implicate CCUS deployment and national abatement strategies. The Action Agenda acknowledges the role of industrial abatement technologies where they are technologically and economically feasible—an important signal for private-sector stakeholders. In practice, CCUS remains the only scalable abatement pathway capable of enabling continued operation of certain carbon-intensive assets, particularly in hard-to-decarbonize sectors. The Action Agenda urges nations to accelerate emissions reductions in heavy industry, emphasizing net-zero-aligned technology pathways for iron and steel, cement, chemicals, refining, and other major sources of CO₂. For project developers, investors, and industrial operators, this language provides a clearer policy basis for CCUS integration—supporting investment certainty, informing permitting strategies, and shaping long-term decarbonization planning.

Notably, the London Register of Subsurface CO2 Storage, a consortium of scientists and industrial partners led by the Imperial College London, published its first annual report on global CO₂ storage during COP30. The report finds that over 383 million tons of CO₂ have been sequestered since 1996—the equivalent of 81 million vehicles driven for a year. The report’s authors claim that the report illustrates that CCUS is an essential tool—a proven, scalable technology needed to tackle climate change. As countries revise their NDCs and develop associated implementation plans, CCUS is poised to become a more prominent component of national strategies.

Transparency- Measurement, reporting, and verification (MRV) emerged as a central theme at COP30, reflecting the growing emphasis on implementation, transparency, and accountability across all pillars of the Paris Agreement. The final agreement reaffirmed obligations under the Enhanced Transparency Framework (ETF) and underscored that high-quality MRV systems are essential for tracking progress toward NDCs – emissions and removals – and supporting the next Global Stocktake. Regarding carbon markets, COP30 focused on operationalizing MRV rules under Article 6, with renewed attention to ensuring environmental integrity, preventing double counting, and standardizing reporting formats for internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) under Article 6.2. Practically, this call for further progress on MRV must be balanced with nation-specific developments to pull back from existing MRV frameworks.

Adaptation- A major headline from COP30 was the political commitment to “at least triple” global adaptation finance with a target of $120 billion by 2035, signaling an intent to substantially scale resources for climate-resilient infrastructure, water systems, and agriculture. Like with TFFF noted above, this pledge is not yet accompanied by financial commitments, reflecting remaining uncertainty associated with climate finance. This commitment nonetheless reflects growing international recognition that adaptation funding must increase. For private-sector stakeholders, increased funding is expected to drive demand for resilient energy systems, grid and transmission upgrades, long-duration storage, cooling technologies, flood- and heat-resistant infrastructure, and sophisticated monitoring, data, and risk-management services. It would also support the growth of public-private partnerships, blended-finance structures, and resilience-focused investment platforms.

Article 6 Carbon Markets- The final COP30 agreement reiterates countries’ obligations under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, which governs international carbon markets. Article 6.2 enables countries to trade internationally transferred mitigation outcomes (ITMOs) towards their NDCs, while Article 6.4 establishes a centralized crediting mechanism allowing both public and private entities to generate and trade carbon credits—often referred to as the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism. Although the Article 6 “rulebook” was largely completed at COP29 in Baku, COP30 shifted attention from negotiation to implementation. Discussions emphasized the practical steps needed to operationalize these markets, including safeguards for environmental integrity, measures to prevent low-quality credits, and alignment of Article 6 transactions with countries’ NDCs.

A consistent message from negotiators and observers was the need for accelerated deployment of Article 6 frameworks to unlock investment and support carbon markets. Looking ahead, the post-COP30 work will need to address several outstanding issues. These include rules on permanence and reversal risk, procedures for transitioning legacy Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) credits into the Article 6.4 system, and the development of nature-based methodologies, particularly for forestry and other land-sector activities. These decisions will shape market confidence, credit eligibility, and investment strategies in the emerging Article 6 landscape.

Trade- The Global Mutirão acknowledged the importance of international trade policies to climate action. Although the COP30 agenda did not formally include trade measures discussion, as some parties reportedly advocated for, the final agreement nonetheless reaffirmed that climate action measures “should not constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable discrimination or a disguised restriction on international trade.” It also established a series of dialogs to occur over the next three years years among the Parties and other key stakeholders, including the World Trade Organization, to “consider opportunities, challenges and barriers in relation to enhancing international cooperation related to the role of trade.”",https://www.hunton.com/the-nickel-report/assets/images-t1764191251/201324.png,N,,2025-11-27 06:58:43.286212

The original reforms said the minister “must be satisfied” a decision is “not inconsistent with” the National Environmental Standards.
The government has only drafted two of the many environmental standards anticipated, one on matters of national environmental significance and one on environmental offsets.","Today is a landmark day for environmental law. After years of false starts and abandoned promises, Labor has finally struck a deal with the Greens to pass long-awaited changes to the federal Environment Protection and Biodiversity Conservation Act. The laws are expected to pass the Senate today – the final parliamentary sitting day of the year.

Change is long overdue, as the 25-year-old laws have been shown to be not fit for purpose. Australia’s unique species and ecosystems are in real trouble. Threatened species populations are falling year after year, while climate change is driving species to extinction and ecosystems towards collapse.

Significantly, neither Labor nor the Greens are declaring the bill a complete success. In its second reading today, Labor Senator Michelle Ananda-Rajah described the bill as “not perfect”, while the Greens described it as falling “woefully short” on climate.

Environment Minister Murray Watt was negotiating with both the Coalition and the Greens to pass the laws. While the Greens agreed to the deal and extracted key concessions on native forest protections, Watt has left some wins for business and the Liberal Party.

The compromise deal is indeed far from perfect. But after five years of stalled reforms, it’s clear significant compromise was the only way for the laws to pass.

What was in the original reform bill?

In late October, Labor introduced reforms that proposed a slew of changes to existing environment laws.

These included provisions for:

making national environmental standards to guide decision-making

a new federal environmental protection agency

planning at a bioregional scale to assess cumulative damage across a landscape

These changes were broadly positive. But other elements raised considerable concern, namely:

considerable ministerial discretion over whether to apply the new national environmental standards to development applications

a wide-ranging national interest exemption allowing the government to fast-track projects in the undefined “national interest”

fast-tracking for some decisions

allowing developers to pay into a “restoration fund” to compensate for biodiversity loss despite evidence it worsens biodiversity loss

excluding native forest logging from Commonwealth oversight

plans to devolve environmental decision-making to states, with the pro-mining and anti-regulation Western Australian government the first in line.

The original 500-page draft bill had areas of considerable uncertainty, such as requiring the minister to knock back developments if satisfied they would have “unacceptable impacts”. The idea was sound: create red lines where projects don’t have to be considered if damage to the environment would be too great. But the definitions were confusing and subjective.

For instance, an “unacceptable impact” on a critically endangered species was defined as one that “seriously impairs, will seriously impair, or is likely to seriously impair” species viability. But “seriously impair” was nebulously defined as “something if, compared to the action not being taken, the impact results in the thing being seriously altered for the worse”. Industry criticised this for setting the bar too low, fearing it would stop projects in their tracks.

What concessions have the Greens secured?

While the Labor-Greens deal means the bills can now pass the Senate, it hasn’t fundamentally changed what was introduced by Labor. The concessions include:

better protection for native forests

banning fast-tracking of new coal and gas projects

reining in ministerial discretion.

The Greens are claiming their major concession is the removal of a longstanding exemption for the logging industry for areas of native forest covered by Regional Forest Agreements. Forested areas under these agreements currently have no protection from federal environment laws.

Under the changes, these agreements will have to comply with the laws and meet higher standards within 18 months. The deal contains compensation for forestry workers. This is a clear win for the environment.

The Greens also secured modest progress on climate, but far short of their long-sought climate trigger, which was a non-starter for Labor.

Instead, the bill will be amended to remove coal and gas projects from fast-tracked approvals and to prevent the minister from declaring these to be projects to be in the “national interest”.

Crucially, the Greens claim the deal will tighten ministerial discretion. The original reforms said the minister “must be satisfied” a decision is “not inconsistent with” the National Environmental Standards. This gave the environment minister of the day wide leeway to depart from the standards and approve projects. The Greens are claiming a major win here by changing the language from “not inconsistent with” these standards to “consistent with”. This isn’t semantics – it’s a stricter legal test.

The amendments will also bring more land clearing under the environment assessment regime and allow the minister to declare some matters too important to be offset by paying into the new Restoration Contributions Fund. This could be a potentially important safeguard.

Wins for the Liberals?

In recent months, Watt has pitched these reforms as a win for the environment and for business, which would benefit from faster approvals. But businesses were wary of the nebulous concept of “unacceptable impacts”.

It looks like Liberal Senator Jonathon Duniam’s proposed changes to the definition of “unacceptable impacts” have been supported.

The definition of an “unacceptable impact” on a critically endangered species has been pared back to “seriously impairs […] viability”. This means projects can’t be knocked back if they are only likely to seriously impair viability.

“Seriously impair” has now been redefined as “something if, compared to the action not being taken, the impact results in an impairment or alteration of the thing that is of a severe nature and extent”. These are terms requiring subjective interpretation, but “severe nature” may make it harder to reject projects than “seriously altered for the worse”.

Will the new legislation stem the damage to nature?

The bar for improvement is low. Australia’s current environment laws are riddled with administrative discretion. Many projects are never assessed, and 99% of projects assessed under these laws are given the green light.

The revised bill contains some key elements proposed by the scathing 2020 Samuel Review, such as provision for National Environmental Standards, while the concessions won by the Greens reduce ministerial discretion. Samuel described today’s deal as a “great balance” between environment and business concerns.

Much will be up in the air even after these laws pass. The government has only drafted two of the many environmental standards anticipated, one on matters of national environmental significance and one on environmental offsets. It remains to be seen whether these standards will improve decision-making, and they are also not yet finalised. Major questions around the interpretation of language in the new laws may need to be hashed out in future court proceedings.

The Greens were unable to remove Labor’s new “pay to destroy” from the laws. This is a significant concern, as the controversial ability for developers to pay into a restoration fund will likely be seen as the easy route. This mechanism is already up and running in New South Wales, with poor outcomes.

What now?

These reforms are the end of a tortuous process – and the start of another, far bigger, job.

Toronto | Traditional territories of the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishinaabeg, the Haudenosaunee, and the Wendat – The Ontario government’s decision today to approve a $26.8-billion refurbishment of Pickering Nuclear Generating Station Units 5–8 is a costly and high-risk choice that will push electricity bills higher, increase pollution, and sideline the clean-energy solutions Ontario urgently needs.

Nuclear power already dominates Ontario’s grid today and, under the government’s plan, would expand to 75 per cent of all electricity generation by 2050. Because nuclear is inflexible and cannot ramp up or down with demand, the entire system must be engineered around it, limiting its ability to integrate wind and solar. This design leaves Ontario relying more on fossil gas plants to balance the grid, driving up both emissions and costs.

Committing to refurbish Pickering—already one of the oldest nuclear stations in North America—adds more risk to an already risky strategy. And because Pickering’s reactors will be offline for most of the next decade before returning to service in the mid-2030s, the government plans to burn significantly more gas in the meantime—driving electricity-sector emissions from a near-zero low of 2.5 megatonnes to 20 megatonnes by 2030, wiping out most of the gains Ontario made in phasing out coal.

The government claims the refurbishment will create nearly 37,000 jobs, but this does not change the fundamental reality: nuclear is one of the most expensive sources of electricity. Wind and solar are now the lowest-cost sources of new power worldwide, including here in Ontario. Meanwhile, nuclear remains a key driver of the recent 29 per cent increase in electricity rates. The government is masking the true cost by shifting expenses onto the tax base—but taxpayers and ratepayers are the same people, and they will ultimately cover the bill.

At the same time, Ontario is planning for fewer renewables in 2050 than we will have in the 2030s. This flies in the face of global trends, where clean energy is being deployed at record scale because it is affordable, flexible, and fast to build. Pairing wind and solar with hydro power and battery storage has become the backbone of clean-energy systems worldwide—yet Ontario’s nuclear-heavy strategy sidelines these solutions for decades.

Ontario does not need to choose a pathway that locks in higher costs and higher emissions. There is still time to shift course toward a modern electricity system that prioritizes renewables, energy efficiency, storage, and reliability—without saddling Ontarians with decades of unnecessary nuclear expansion and increased gas burning.

Back to top Electric vehicles The budget confirmed the introduction of a new “pay-per-mile” charge for electric vehicles, to raise more than £1bn in additional tax revenue by the end of this decade.","UK chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced new measures to cut energy bills alongside a “pay-per-mile” electric-vehicle levy as part of Labour’s second budget.

The policy changes are expected to cut typical household bills by around £134 per year, amid intense political scrutiny of energy prices and a government pledge to reduce them.

This cut is achieved through a combination of moving a portion of renewable-energy subsidies from bills to general taxation and ending a support scheme for energy-efficiency measures.

Reeves has also retained a long-standing freeze on fuel-duty rates on petrol and diesel, albeit with a plan to “gradually” reverse the extra cuts introduced under the previous government.

With fuel-duty receipts set to fall as people opt for electric vehicles, the government has also laid out its plan for an “electric vehicle excise duty” from 2028, to replace lost revenue.

The government has also announced new “transitional energy certificates” to allow new oil and gas production at or nearby to existing sites, as part of its plan for the future of the North Sea.

Below, Carbon Brief runs through the key climate- and energy-focused announcements from the budget.

Energy bills

The chancellor used her budget speech to announce two major changes that will cut dual-fuel energy bills for the average household by £134 per year from April 2026.

The first is to bring the “energy company obligation” (ECO) to an end, once its current programme of work wraps up at the end of the financial year. This will cut bills by £63 per year, according to Carbon Brief analysis of the forthcoming energy price cap, which will apply from 1 January 2026.

The second is for the Treasury to cover three-quarters of the cost of the “renewables obligation” (RO) for households, for three years from April 2026. This will cut bills by £70 per year.

The total impact for typical households – those using gas and electricity – will be to cut bills by an average of £134 per year over the three-year period to April 2029.

(As explained in footnote 77 of the budget “red book”, this rises to an average of £154 per year, when including households that use electric heating and are not connected to the gas grid. This figure is then rounded to £150 per year in government communications around the budget.)

Notably, given the political attention on energy prices, this three-year period of discounted bills runs through to just before the next general election, which must be held by August 2029.

There has been furious debate over the past year over the causes and the most effective solutions to the UK’s high energy bills. A Carbon Brief factcheck published earlier this year showed that it was high gas prices, rather than net-zero policies, which has been keeping bills high.

Nevertheless, a politicised debate has continued and there has also been increasing attention on the factors that will put pressure on bills in the near future, such as efforts to strengthen the electricity grid.

At the same time, the advisory Climate Change Committee (CCC) has repeatedly advised the government that it should make electricity cheaper, as so much of the UK’s climate strategy depends on getting homes and businesses to use electricity for heat and transport.

The changes in the budget will go some way to addressing this.

Carbon Brief calculations show that they would cut unit prices for domestic electricity users by around 4p per kilowatt hour (kWh) – roughly 16% – from 28p/kWh under the next price-cap period from the start of 2026, down to around 23p/kWh.

However, the red book says the government wants to further “improve” the price of electricity relative to gas, often referred to as “rebalancing”. It explains:

“The government is committed to doing more to reduce electricity costs for all households and improve the price of electricity relative to gas…The government will set out how it intends to deliver this through the ‘warm homes plan’.”

Under ECO, which has been in place since 2013, utility firms must install energy efficiency measures in fuel-poor homes, funded by a levy on energy bills.

It replaced two earlier schemes, known as CERT and CESP, with reduced funding after then-prime minister David Cameron reportedly told ministers to “get rid of the green crap”. This shift coincided with a precipitous decline in the number of homes being treated with new efficiency measures.

The ECO scheme has been hit by a series of scandals, with a recent National Audit Office report citing “clear failures” in its design, resulting in “widespread issues with the quality of installations”.

Pre-budget media reports had speculated that the government would pay for ongoing energy efficiency initiatives after scrapping ECO, using funding from the forthcoming “warm homes plan”. This speculation had suggested that subsidies for heat pumps would be cut as a result.

Instead, the budget includes an extra £1.5bn of funding for the warm homes plan, to cover the additional cost of taking over from ECO. (The total cost of ECO was around £1.7bn.)

Adam Bell, head of policy at the consultancy group Stonehaven and the government’s former head of energy policy, tells Carbon Brief that, while this £1.5bn is not the total cost of ECO, the scheme had been “terribly inefficient”. He adds that a government-run alternative that tackles home upgrades on an area-by-area basis was “likely to be cheaper”.

Contrary to much pre-budget speculation in the media, the chancellor did not reduce the already-discounted 5% rate of VAT on energy bills. Nor did she scrap the “carbon price support”, a top-up carbon tax on electricity generators.

Finally, the budget red book says that the government “recently confirmed” an increase in the level of relief for certain industrial users, from electricity network charges.

It says that, in total from 2027, the “British industrial competitiveness scheme” will cut electricity costs for affected businesses by £35-40 per megawatt hour.

Electric vehicles

The budget confirmed the introduction of a new “pay-per-mile” charge for electric vehicles, to raise more than £1bn in additional tax revenue by the end of this decade.

It has long been expected that fuel-duty receipts will begin to fall as electric vehicles start making up a rising share of cars on the road.

In its report accompanying the budget, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) forecasts a decline to around half of current levels in the 2030s in real terms, before falling to near-zero by 2050.

As such, the new charge on EVs will help maintain road infrastructure, the budget states. The “red book” notes that the new tax will see EV drivers paying a “fair share”. It adds:

“All vehicles contribute to congestion and wear and tear on the roads, but drivers of petrol and diesel vehicles pay fuel duty at the pump to contribute their fair share, whereas drivers of electric vehicles do not currently pay an equivalent.”

The electric vehicle excise duty (eVED) will come into effect in April 2028 at a rate of 3p per mile for battery electric vehicles and 1.5p per mile for plug-in hybrid cars, according to the OBR report.

The budget red book says this will mean the average driver of a battery electric vehicle paying “around £240 per year”. This is roughly half of the rate of fuel duty paid per mile by petrol and diesel car owners. (See: Fuel duty.)

(EVs will remain significantly cheaper to run than their combustion-engine equivalents. According to the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit thinktank, EVs would still be £1,000 cheaper to run per year than petrol equivalents, even after the new eVED charge.)

Currently, there is no equivalent to fuel duty for electric vehicles. Excise duty was brought in for EVs for the first time in April 2025, costing £10 for the first year and then rising to a standard rate of £195 per year – an increase announced in last year’s budget.

The introduction of the eVED is expected to raise £1.1bn in 2028-29 and £1.9bn in 2030-31, dependent on electric-vehicle uptake in the coming years.

The revenue generated by the eVED will “support investment in maintaining and improving the condition of roads”, the budget adds, with the government committing to £2bn in annual investment by 2029-30 for local authorities to repair and renew roads.

A consultation will be published seeking views on the implementation of eVED, the budget notes. It adds that there will be no requirement to report where or when the miles are driven, or to install trackers in cars.

The OBR report states that the additional charge of the eVED “is likely” to reduce demand for electric cars, due to increasing their lifetime costs.

Overall, it estimates that there will be around 440,000 fewer electric car sales across the forecast period relative to its previous forecast.

New support for EV buyers and manufacturers also announced in the budget could help offset 130,000 of this impact, the report notes.

This includes a boost to the electric car grant, which was launched in July and currently offers up to £3,750 off eligible vehicles.

The budget announces an increase of £1.3bn in funding for the programme, as well as an extension out to 2029-30.

Additional measures include an increase in the threshold at which EV owners have to pay the “expensive car supplement” from £40,000 to £50,000 from April 2026. This is expected to cost the government £0.5bn in 2030-31, the OBR notes.

The government will delay changes to “benefit-in-kind” (BIK) rules for employee car-ownership schemes until April 2030. This is a continuation of a policy announced in Reeve’s first budget as chancellor in 2024, which delayed the previously planned increase in BIK rates to 9% per year for electric vehicles by 2029, instead increasing them to just 2% per year out to 2029-30.

EV manufacturers will see the research and innovation Drive35 programme extended, with a further £1.5bn allocated to the project to 2035. This takes total funding for the project to £4bn over the next 10 years, according to the government.

Beyond the vehicles, the budget includes investment for EV charging infrastructure – also partly funded through the eVED revenues, it notes – with an additional £100m allocated. This builds on the £400m announced in the spending review in June.

Additionally, funding will be allocated to local authorities to support the rollout of public chargepoints, a consultation will be launched on permitting rights for cross-pavement EV charging and a 10-year 100% business-rates relief for eligible EV chargepoints will be introduced.

Fuel duty

Former Conservative governments repeatedly cancelled inflation-linked increases in fuel duty – a tax paid on petrol and diesel – every year since 2010.

Fuel duty was cut by an additional 5p per litre in 2022 by then-Conservative chancellor Rishi Sunak in response to the energy crisis.

Successive freezes in fuel duty have substantially increased the UK’s carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions by lowering the cost of driving and, therefore, encouraging people to use their cars more and low-carbon transport options less.

Last year, Reeves opted to maintain the existing freezes and cuts introduced by her predecessors.

In the new autumn budget, she has once again announced a freeze on fuel-duty rates for an additional five months from April until September 2026.

Beyond that, the government says the 5p additional cut introduced in 2022 will be reversed – “gradually returning to March 2022 levels by March 2027”. However, the planned increase in fuel-duty rates in line with inflation for 2026-27 will be cancelled.

Then, from April 2027 onwards, the government says that fuel-duty rates will increase annually to reflect inflation.

In total, the 16 years of delays to expected increases in fuel duty rates – plus the “temporary” 5p cut – will have cost the Treasury £120bn by 2026-27, compared to the expected rise in line with inflation from 2010 onwards, according to the OBR.

Increasing fuel duty is very unpopular. However, research by the Social Market Foundation thinktank suggests persistent freezes have “done little for average Brits”, with the wealthiest in the country disproportionately benefiting.

Meanwhile, the government is also responding to the long-term decline in fuel-duty receipts “as more people choose to switch to cleaner, greener electric cars” by introducing a new per-mile charge on electric-vehicle use from 2028. (See: Electric vehicles.)

North Sea oil and gas

Much of the environmentally focused coverage previewing the budget centred on government plans to allow for new oil and gas production on or near existing field sites in the North Sea.

This was formally announced in the North Sea future plan, a 127-page document outlining the government’s approach to put the region “at the heart of Britain’s clean energy and industrial future” and “deliver the next generation of good, new jobs”.

(The plan was published in response to a consultation held earlier this year on the North Sea’s future, involving nearly 1,000 responses from stakeholders, including oil and gas companies and environmental groups.)

The future plan outlines that the North Sea is an ageing oil and gas basin, “much more so than other areas of the world”, and that production has been “naturally declining over the past 25 years”.

It includes the chart below, showing past and projected oil and gas production.

It adds that the decline of the basin caused direct jobs in oil and gas production to fall by a third between 2014 and 2023, according to official statistics.

The plan also has a section on the UK’s “proud history” of international climate leadership.

It notes that the UK is committed to the Paris Agreement, which has the aim to keep global warming to well-below 2C, while pursuing efforts to keep it at 1.5C, by the end of the century.

It continues:

“Scientific evidence from the International Energy Agency, UN Environment Programme and Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) shows that new fossil fuel exploration risks exceeding the 1.5C threshold. The IPCC warns that emissions from existing fossil fuel infrastructure alone could surpass the remaining global carbon budget, reinforcing the urgency to phase out fossil fuels.”

The plan says that the UK “now has the opportunity to lead in clean energy”, which “is both a national and global imperative”.

With this backdrop, the plan reaffirms Labour’s manifesto commitment to not issue any new oil and gas licences.

However, the plan says that the government will introduce “transitional energy certificates” to allow new oil and gas drilling on or near to existing fields, as long as this additional production does not require exploration.

An analysis by the North Sea transition charity Uplift found that the amount of oil and gas that could be produced by such certificates is “relatively small”.

It suggested that new discoveries within a 50km radius of existing productions contain just 25m barrels of oil and 20m barrels of oil equivalent of gas.

(By comparison, the Rosebank oil field, which is currently seeking development consent from the government, would produce nearly 500m barrels of oil and gas equivalent in its lifetime.)

In a footnote on page 36, the plan says that these certificates will have no effect on the process for giving development consent to new oil and gas projects.

Last year, Carbon Brief reported that several large oil and gas projects are currently seeking development consent from the government.

Because they already have a license, these projects are able to get around Labour’s policy on not issuing any new oil and gas licenses and still seek final approval.

However, a landmark legal case in 2024 means that all of such projects, including Rosebank, will now have to present the government with information about how much emissions will come from burning the oil and gas they plan to produce, before they can be approved.

Responding to today’s budget news, Tessa Khan, executive director of Uplift, said that the “government is right to end the fiction of endless drilling”, but should “put an end to all new fields, including the huge Rosebank oil field”.

The North Sea future plan also says that the government will change the objectives of the North Sea Transition Authority, the government-run company that controls and regulates offshore oil and gas production.

Before the change, the NSTA was in the awkward position of being responsible for both ensuring the oil and gas sector reaches net-zero and maximising the economic recovery of oil and gas reserves from the North Sea.

Now, the government wants the NSTA to balance three objectives: to “maximise societal economic value”; support the energy secretary in meeting net-zero goals; and consider the long-term benefits of the transition for North Sea workers, communities and supply chains.

In addition, the North Sea future plan also announces that the government will establish the “North Sea jobs service”, a national employment programme offering support for oil and gas workers seeking new opportunities in clean energy, defence and advanced manufacturing.

Nuclear, ‘green finance’, critical minerals and rail

The section in the budget about “investing in the UK’s energy security” largely focuses on the government’s plans for nuclear power.

At the last spending review, the government announced £14.2bn of investment in the planned Sizewell C nuclear-power plant in Suffolk.

The plant is set to be supported under the “regulated asset base” (RAB) model, which levies an extra charge on consumer energy bills to support the cost of the development. OBR analysis concludes this will generate £0.7bn in receipts in 2026-27, doubling to £1.4bn in 2030-31.

The budget also says the prime minister is issuing a “strategic steer” on the “safe and efficient delivery” of nuclear developments through “proportionate regulation and stronger collaboration”.

It says the government will additionally issue an “implementation plan”, within three months, in response to the recently published report on nuclear regulation. It says it will “complete implementation within two years”.

The government has also updated its “green financing framework”, which sets guidelines for the type of expenditures that can raise funding from investors under the UK’s green financing programme. It has now added nuclear power to the list of eligible expenditures.

Other climate-related measures mentioned in the budget include regional funding, such as £14.5m for a new low-carbon industrial centre in Grangemouth, Scotland, and support for “critical minerals, renewable energy and marine innovation” in Cornwall.

This builds on the government’s “critical mineral strategy” released last week, which specifically highlights Cornwall as a site of “mineral wealth”, where mining for lithium, tin and tungsten is being undertaken.

The government has also announced a one-year freeze on rail fares, which it states could save commuters taking expensive routes “more than £300 per year”.",https://www.carbonbrief.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/54946720717_dc042432df_o.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 02:58:34.780860

The Saline data center could carry greater financial risk than DTE presents in its response to Nessel’s petition to intervene, Keskey said.
DTE redactions ‘a little bit insulting’ DTE’s regulatory application for the Saline data center contracts shows a lack of transparency, Keskey said.
The Saline data center will not create added costs for other customers, DTE spokesperson Wilmot told Planet Detroit.","DTE Energy‘s push to fast-track the electricity deal for a massive, 1.4 megawatt data center in Saline Township is eliciting concern from residents and environmental groups that say more time is needed to ensure the project doesn’t saddle other customers with additional costs.

DTE’s contracts contain a provision that allows the customer to terminate the deal if it is not approved by Dec. 5, 2025, DTE spokesperson Jill Wilmot told Planet Detroit.

The Michigan Public Service Commission’s next regular meeting — where it could vote to approve the electric contracts — is Friday, Dec. 5.

DTE asked the MPSC to consider its data center case ex parte, which can be requested in regulatory proceedings that don’t lead to an increase in rates, charges, or cost of service to customers. Ex parte relief can be approved without notice or a hearing, according to the state.

The MPSC announced it would hold a Dec. 3 virtual hearing on the project that Chair Dan Scripps said will “add an important element of transparency in evaluating DTE Electric Co.’s proposed special contract.”

Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said in a statement that DTE’s proposal seeks a green light from regulators for the Saline data center without formal hearings or traditional oversight. A formal, contested case is needed to ensure protections and cost reductions for customers, she said.

A contested case would give the MPSC 180 days from the date of DTE’s Halloween application to consider it, Nessel said.

The $7 billion project for Open AI and Oracle is planned for 250 acres of farmland southwest of Ann Arbor. The Saline Township board voted against rezoning land for the development, but agreed to a settlement after the township was sued by landowners and developer Related Digital.

DTE, data center developer push to quickly advance project

“Related Digital and DTE keep changing the goal posts, and they keep putting forth this false sense of urgency,” Bridgewater Township resident Josh LeBaron told Planet Detroit.

LeBaron, who lives near the data center site, said it could add to Michigan’s energy reliability problems. The MPSC “absolutely” should open up DTE’s data center application as a contested case, he said.

Developer Related Digital initially pushed to begin construction on the data center by October.

When asked to comment on the deadlines for the project, Related spokesperson Natalie Ravitz told Planet Detroit: “this is a fast moving and competitive industry,” and it’s crucial to invest in digital infrastructure to “compete in the global AI race.”

DTE’s Wilmot said the utility is following the “defined process for filing this regulatory request.” The data center customer will absorb the costs of battery storage associated with the project, which will help provide reliable service for all other customers, she said.

Dan Mahoney, director of policy and regional affairs for DTE, told the Saline City Council earlier this month that Oracle could go elsewhere if the tight timeline the utility submitted to Michigan regulators is not met, The Saline Post reported.

Nessel said that without a formal hearing and contested case, the MPSC hearing amounts to little more than “performative listening,” adding that DTE has not backed up its statements that other customers are unaffected by the Saline data center.

“The contracts remain public only under significant redactions and promises made by DTE to hold ratepayers harmless remain flimsy and unsupported in the public record,” the attorney general said in a statement.

DTE may underestimate data center risks: attorney

A contested case for DTE’s data center application would give intervenors access to redacted information in the contracts and provide more time to examine how the project could impact residential ratepayers, said Don Keskey, an attorney representing the Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association.

A contested case could ensure protections from stranded costs if the data center ceases operation before grid investments are paid off, he told Planet Detroit.

Data centers’ often massive water and energy needs have stoked fears in other Michigan communities over how the facilities could imperil water resources, hike electric bills, and jeopardize state climate goals.

The facilities’ electricity demand risks triggering an “off ramp” provision in the state’s climate law, allowing fossil fuel generation to stay online if there’s a capacity shortage.

The Saline data center could carry greater financial risk than DTE presents in its response to Nessel’s petition to intervene, Keskey said.

In its response to Nessel, DTE said its regulatory filing “requests approval of two unique, negotiated contracts specifically tailored to this customer which include bespoke provisions— such as minimum bill protections and termination fees — designed to isolate risk and ensure appropriate cost recovery from the customer.”

DTE’s assessment of Oracle’s creditworthiness, which is referenced in its response to Nessel, “may already be out-of-date,” according to the petition to intervene Keskey submitted for the nonprofit Great Lakes Renewable Energy Association.

He references a Nov. 19 Wall Street Journal article that said the company has a growing debt load and a stock price that’s down significantly from a recent peak, while Moody’s Ratings and S&P Global Ratings “have edged closer to reclassifying the company’s bonds as junk debt.”

Data center investor Blue Owl Capital is offsetting Oracle’s higher risk by charging the company higher rent than for tenants like Meta Platforms, the Journal reported.

To the extent that Oracle is backing the project, any financial difficulties or defaults the company experiences could result in DTE and its ratepayers being left to pay for investments needed to bring the project online, Keskey said.

Oracle declined to comment on this story. DTE did not respond to a question about Oracle’s creditworthiness.

DTE redactions ‘a little bit insulting’

DTE’s regulatory application for the Saline data center contracts shows a lack of transparency, Keskey said.

“Much of the contracts are redacted, and that’s a little bit insulting to the process, because there’s a lot of public interest wrapped into this project that needs protection,” Keskey said.

Pages of text are blacked out in DTE’s application under headings such as project application, operational parameters, post termination obligations, customer credit support, and more.

A contested case would help determine what ratepayer protections are included in the deal because parties could enter into a protective order and gain access to DTE’s contracts without redactions, Keskey said.

DTE’s Wilmot said certain contract terms are commercially sensitive and represent confidential customer information.

“The redacted terms do not impact the cost of service to customers, and the pricing and rate details are not redacted,” she said.

Keskey said protections and guarantees are needed now to ensure costs aren’t being passed on to other customers, adding that it could be difficult to separate the data center costs from DTE’s other expenses once the project is operational.

The MPSC established a framework for addressing such cost allocation issues with a ruling in early November that set rules for how Consumers Energy would serve data centers and other large customers.

Consumers will be required to file six cost-of-service studies and rate design proposals with the state to examine large load customers’ impact on rates. These reports will be used to set rates going forward.

No similar framework is in place for DTE.

The Saline data center will not create added costs for other customers, DTE spokesperson Wilmot told Planet Detroit.

“In its filing, DTE is asking for the Michigan Public Service Commission to approve additional terms of service that create safeguards to protect our existing customers,” she said.

The DTE proposal has a mismatch between the data center contracts and the time it will take to pay back the utility’s investments, Keskey said, adding that it could cost residential customers and other classes of ratepayers.

DTE’s application to the MPSC contains a power supply agreement of roughly 19 years, with an option for the customer to extend it by 20 years. It also contains an energy storage agreement with a duration of 15 years.

The length of these contracts is roughly equivalent to the 15-year contract terms recently adopted by the MPSC for Consumers’ largest customers.

If the customer were to violate the proposed DTE contracts above, it would need to make a termination payment that represents at least 10 years of minimum monthly payments for the power supply agreement.

‘Immense political and industry pressure’

LeBaron, the Bridgewater Township resident, said a contested MPSC case would be a start, adding that the regulator would face significant pressure to approve the project in either scenario.

He named Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer’s support for the project as a reason for the pressure.

In an Oct. 30 press release, Whitmer said the data center is “the largest economic project in Michigan history,” bringing 2,500 union construction jobs and 450 permanent, high-skilled jobs.

The project could have significant economic upsides, Charlotte Jameson, chief policy officer of the Michigan Environmental Council, said in a press release from Nessel’s office.

At the same time, it’s critical that Michiganders are not burdened by infrastructure and energy costs, and for renewable energy growth to occur in Michigan in order to “stave off a rush to build expensive methane gas plants by our utilities,” she said.

Nessel said in her Nov. 18 statement that the MPSC is under “immense political and industry pressure” to fast-track the DTE contracts.

The MPSC declined to comment on this story.

DTE’s application for approval of the data center contracts has racked up nearly 4,500 comments on the MPSC website as of Thursday. Many of them ask the commission to open up a contested case or deny the application.

LeBaron emphasized that he isn’t entirely opposed to data centers, but said they should be built on industrial sites rather than farmland — and more investments are needed to ensure the state can accommodate the facilities.

“We would probably just need to build out a better electric grid and power system before we rush to increase everyone’s rates.”",https://planetdetroit.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/AP17139686094813-min-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 22:00:12.133278

In today’s rapidly evolving automotive industry, the reliance on battery and other key materials and components, such as microchips and rare earth metals, has become more pronounced than ever. As suppliers navigate a world fraught with supply chain disruptions and geopolitical uncertainties, securing these vital materials is crucial not just for production continuity but also for maintaining a competitive edge. This article explores the risks, strategies, and innovations shaping the future of material resource procurement in the automotive industry.

Understanding the Risks

The first step in addressing any challenge is to understand the nature of the issue. The automotive industry is increasingly vulnerable to external shocks, which can range from trade disputes and political instability to natural disasters and pandemics. These shocks have the potential to disrupt supply chains significantly, making the procurement of critical materials a strategic challenge. Microchips, essential for modern vehicle electronics and autonomous driving technology, have seen shortages that lay bare the fragility of current sourcing strategies. Similarly, battery metals like lithium, cobalt, and nickel are subject to fluctuating prices and limited availability, influenced by mining constraints and environmental regulations.

One notable recent example of the complexities in securing automotive materials is the case of Nexperia, a semiconductor manufacturer with roots in the Netherlands, now owned by Chinese technology company Wingtech. Nexperia’s strategic position in Europe highlights the intricate geopolitical dynamics at play in the semiconductor market, an area critical to the automotive industry. The Dutch government, cognizant of its country’s pivotal role in the global semiconductor supply chain, has been actively working with the European Union to create policies that balance economic interests with national security concerns. Meanwhile, the Chinese government’s ambition to strengthen its foothold in the global tech market adds another layer of complexity. The tensions between these competing interests recently boiled over as the Dutch government moved to take control of Nexperia, prompting the Chinese government to retaliate by restricting Nexperia’s affiliates in China from exporting components made in China. This multifaceted situation underscores the interconnected nature of global supply chains, how countries can use these resources as weapons, and the necessity for automakers to remain vigilant and proactive in navigating such geopolitical landscapes to secure essential materials for future production needs.

Dependency on these materials, many of which are available from only a limited number of sources, creates the risk that a disruption on the other side of the world, several tiers down the supply chain, can cripple production lines, delay vehicle launches, and ultimately affect profitability. The problem is compounded in the context of electric vehicles (EVs), which require critical materials and components that have more limited sources than those for internal combustion vehicles. These issues are creating significant upward pressure on supply systems already stretched thin.

Strategic Approaches to Securing Materials

To mitigate these risks, suppliers and OEMs are adopting various strategic approaches. One key strategy is diversifying suppliers and spreading geographic risk. By nurturing relationships with suppliers in multiple countries, companies can reduce the impact of a localized disruption. Additionally, partnerships and alliances with suppliers can provide more predictable access to necessary materials. However, for such a strategy to be successful, it is critical that buyers have visibility and understanding of the full scope of their supply chains. A tier 1 supplier may think that it is diversifying its supply chain by sourcing multiple tier 2 suppliers for a component. However, if all of those tier 2 suppliers are sourcing critical materials from the same tier 3, the tier 1 still faces the risk of an interruption if there is a disruption at the tier 3.

Other companies are taking a different approach by focusing on efforts to localize, or at least shorten, their supply chains. Rather than expanding their supply chain footprint, these companies seek to mitigate risk by locating their production closer to their supply base (or requiring the supply base to locate production closer to them). Whether simply locating production within the same country, or even having plants within miles of each other, this approach seeks to mitigate risk by shrinking the distance, borders, and overall exposure to risk between buyers and suppliers.

Finally, some automakers and suppliers are exploring joint ventures or other strategic partnerships to ensure priority access to materials and components. While the exact structure of such relationships varies, they most often involve the buyer making some form of investment into, or with, the supplier – typically through an ownership stake or loans – that allows the supplier to expand capacity. These arrangements are usually packaged with a supply or offtake agreement under which the buyer has priority to the materials being produced with the increased capacity.

Innovative Solutions and New Technologies

Another significant strategy involves investing in technological advancements and innovation to promote the development of new materials and increased resource efficiency. Innovation plays a pivotal role in securing the future of automotive materials. The continued evolution of synthetic materials and composites presents new opportunities for reducing reliance on traditional metals and microchips. Enhanced, durable synthetics and lightweight composites help decrease vehicle weight and improve fuel efficiency, offering indirect mitigation of resource scarcity.

Automakers and suppliers also are focusing on developing technologies that reduce reliance on scarce materials or substitute them with more abundant alternatives. For instance, advancements in battery technology are paving the way for increased use of solid-state batteries, which require fewer critical metals than current lithium-ion models. Automakers and suppliers also are investing in recycling initiatives, turning waste into value. By creating closed-loop systems for materials like lithium and cobalt, companies can mitigate the dependency on new raw material sources. These systems not only reduce environmental impact but also contribute to supply chain resilience.

Digital transformation, including AI and blockchain, is becoming integral to managing automotive supply chains. AI algorithms can quickly identify, or even predict, potential shortages and disruptions through advanced data analytics, enabling preemptive action. Meanwhile, blockchain technology provides transparency and traceability, crucial for ensuring ethical sourcing and compliance with environmental regulations.

The development of alternative energy sources, such as hydrogen fuel cells and biofuels, also represents significant potential for reducing reliance on battery metals. Automakers are actively researching and investing in these alternatives, recognizing the need to diversify energy reliance.

Conclusion

The future of the automotive industry is inextricably tied to the continuous and secure access to vital materials. As the automotive industry grapples with unprecedented challenges and greater volatility than it has seen for decades, strategic planning, innovative solutions, and leveraging technological advancements remain key to resilience. By understanding risks and implementing diverse strategies, automakers can navigate the complex landscape and ensure the sustainability of their resource pipelines. By embracing innovation and collaborative efforts to turn challenges into new opportunities, the automotive industry can thrive amidst uncertainty and change.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-11/Transportation.Cars_.LuxuryCars.jpg.webp?itok=F3qfmWU1,N,,2025-11-26 23:58:45.406509

Now, Targa Resources, a leading provider of midstream services in North America, has stated its plans to construct a new “Speedway” natural liquefied gas pipeline connecting the Permian to Mont Belvieu, Texas. The company has big plans for the US energy market, with gas and NGL playing a vital role in the company’s ambitions.

Targa Resources to target a new energy pipeline in the Permian basin

The Permian basin has become as part of the American identity as Apple pie, with several of the world’s largest energy companies all developing projects in the region. The Permian is also home to one of the world’s largest oil deposits.

Targa Resources recently unveiled its plans to construct a new 500-mile “Speedway” NGL pipeline that will run from the Permian basin to several processing plants in Texas. The company already boasts approximately 1 million barrels per day of natural gas liquids being transported on its existing pipeline in the region, with plans to construct a new gas pipeline.

The new Speedway pipeline will connect the company’s vast assets in the Permian and any new plant additions to Targa’s fractionation and storage complex in Mont Belvieu, Texas.

Targa’s astonishing plans for the American energy market are reaching a tipping point

The new “Speedway” project will consist of 500 miles of 30-inch diameter pipeline and associated infrastructure, with an expected initial capacity of ~500 thousand barrels per day, which could be doubled to 1,000 barrels if needed. The project is expected to be completed in the third quarter of 2027, and costs are estimated at approximately $1.6 billion.

Targa is also moving forward with its plans to construct new gas processing facilities

The company has stated that, in order to accommodate any future growth in the region, it will focus on the construction of its next 275 million cubic feet per day gas processing plant, called the Yeti plant, which is also expected to come online in Q3 of 2027.

Additionally, Targa also has plans to construct five gas processing plants in the Permian that will come online over the next two years. The project comes off the back of a new deal between the United States and Japan that calls for billions to be invested in America’s gas and NGL infrastructure.

“We have benefited from meaningful volume growth across our Permian Basin assets this year, and our outlook for volume growth in 2026 continues to remain robust. Given the NGLs currently flowing through our system and numerous plant additions in progress, we will have significantly more volumes to move on Speedway when it comes into service. The strength of our outlook over the near, medium and long term is supported by multiple factors. Speedway is critical to the continued execution of our core integrated wellhead to water strategy, will generate attractive and growing fee-based cash flows, and will provide Targa with significant operating leverage once in service.” – Matt Meloy, Targa’s Chief Executive Officer

Dive Brief:

New York City Comptroller Brad Lander recommended that the city’s three pension funds drop a trio of asset managers for failing to meet the climate expectation of the city’s net-zero implementation plan, Lander’s office said in a Wednesday release.

Lander recommended the city’s pensions move on from BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora in an update to the trustees of the city’s Teachers’ Retirement System, the New York City Employees’ Retirement System and Board of Education Retirement System.

The recommendation for the city’s pension plans to drop the asset managers comes after Lander requested all of the plans’ asset managers submit written plans on decarbonization strategies and incorporation of climate-related risks earlier this year. He warned then that asset managers who don’t meet the city’s expectations were at risk of being dropped.

Dive Insight:

Lander, whose term as comptroller ends at the end of the calendar year, said all 49 of the asset managers for the city’s pension plans submitted their decarbonization plans to measure their alignment with the city’s Net Zero Implementation Plan. However, following an evaluation of those plans, BlackRock, Fidelity and PanAgora’s plans did not meet climate expectations, Lander said.

BlackRock is the pension system’s largest asset manager and currently manages $42.3 billion for all three pension plans, according to Lander’s letter to trustees. Fidelity manages $384 million for the TRS plan, and PanAgora manages $358 million for the TRS and NYCERS plans, according to the letter to the plans’ trustees. Lander said in the Nov. 26 release that the three asset managers “fail to address climate risk with the seriousness [the pension plans] expect.”

“The systemic risk of the climate crisis threatens the long-term value of New York City’s pension funds,” Lander said. “Our Net Zero plan is a core part of our fiduciary duty to protect these assets. I am pleased to report that 46 of our 49 public markets managers are aligned with our expectations for decarbonization; unfortunately, three are not.”

The NYC comptroller said he has “significant concerns regarding BlackRock’s restrictive approach” to engaging with public companies it owns more than 5% of the equities. The asset manager said it will not proactively reach out to on proxy voting issues to align with a “conservative interpretation” of the Securities and Exchange Commission’s updated engagement guidelines.

BlackRock also recently began allowing clients it doesn’t vote proxies for to opt into its Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship strategy, which Lander recommended the trustees’ formally vote to approve for the system’s non-U.S. equity index funds that BlackRock manages. For the public equity index funds BlackRock manages for the system, Lander recommended issuing a search notice to find “appropriate managers for BlackRock’s U.S. public equity index mandates to address the Systems’ climate expectations consistent with fiduciary duties.”

“While BlackRock has a global [Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship] focus list of 900 companies, it says it will not proactively reach out to U.S. companies nor set agendas for engagement; consequently, it cannot meet the Systems’ expectations set forth in the Plans,” Lander told the system’s trustees. “BlackRock also says it cannot seek to influence these companies’ actions, which means it cannot meet the Systems’ expectations set forth in the Plans with respect to their U.S. portfolios.”

In a follow-up statement issued Wednesday, BlackRock said it had responded to a direct request from the New York City Bureau of Asset Management — which oversees the investments for the city’s five public pension funds — and met with its investment team earlier in the month to provide an update on its Climate and Decarbonization Stewardship program. The asset manager said it informed NYC BAM that a version of the program was now available to all five pension plans.

“Today, you recommended that three pension plans take certain actions after your departure, including terminating BlackRock’s index equity mandate. In doing so, you accused BlackRock of abdicating its financial duty and putting New York City’s pensions at risk,” BlackRock said in the Nov. 26 statement addressing Lander. “These statements are another instance of the politicization of public pension funds, which undermines the retirement security of hardworking New Yorkers.”

Lander also suggested terminating the mandates for Fidelity and PanAgora, which both actively manage U.S. small cap equity mandates for the system. In their place, Lander said the system should seek recommendations for how to re-allocate those assets, according to the letter to trustees.

Lander recommended moving on from Fidelity, as the asset manager has “taken a restrictive approach to engaging companies outside of the U.S.,” and is voluntarily applying the SEC’s engagement guidance to both U.S. and non-U.S. companies. The comptroller said other asset managers of non-U.S. strategies have not taken the same approach, which “precludes Fidelity from meeting the Systems’ expectations and prudently addressing climate risk and opportunity in their engagement of companies.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/Wioy12d8cL2ePvzNKy9p1bh3LrurcYcBmSKuxXP7-so/g:nowe:0:7/c:1024:578/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0yMjE4NzkxMDgxLmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-26 20:59:46.926544

NYISO recommended accelerating the entry of solar, wind and storage resources already in the pipeline, preserving or replacing critical dispatchable capability like the New York Power Authority’s small gas plants and adding additional firm capacity.

“Planning and investment must begin now,” NYISO said. “Long lead times for permitting, equipment procurement, and construction mean that decisions made today will determine whether the system can meet reliability standards by the next decade.”

The Independent Power Producers of New York praised the report in a Friday release, saying it contained “honest and robust findings.” IPPNY president and CEO Gavin Donohue said the report “reiterates the State’s realization that ALL resources are needed to meet the once-in-a-generation economic growth set for New York.”

The report concludes that NYISO should “account for a wider range of plausible outcomes in reliability planning” and adopt new scenario planning concepts into its “formal procedures for determining actionable Reliability Needs.”

These concepts include evaluating a wider range of potential risks like project delays “rather than relying solely on a deterministic base case,” incorporating the probability of aging generation or catastrophic failures and using a range of plausible demand forecasts.

The latter would “[account] for economic trends, electrification, demand-side policy adoption, and technology-driven behavior changes,” NYISO said.

Earthjustice’s release argued that “there are diminishing benefits to investing more money into a system that already has adequate resources, and at a certain point New Yorkers could be asked to spend more for basically no benefit.”

Earthjustice pointed to comments on the CRP made by NYISO’s market monitoring unit, which state that the “capacity market is not currently designed to provide adequate long-term prices if the planning framework consistently ensures large capacity surpluses” and that “making the market compatible with such an approach would require changes to market parameters and/or design elements.”

The MMU noted that changes to the ICAP demand curve “could be used to offset the expected surpluses produced by the planning process. However, this would result in a market designed to inefficiently retain more capacity than is needed to satisfy reliability criteria at great cost to ratepayers.”

“Hence, it is important to carefully consider the level of conservatism that is appropriate for declaring Reliability Needs before such market changes become necessary,” the MMU said.

NYISO’s report concluded that “given the confluence of factors that the system faces, enhancements to the NYISO’s reliability planning processes are essential and must be undertaken now” and said it will “discuss the recommendations listed above with stakeholders prior to the start of the 2026 cycle of the Reliability Planning Process.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/jDV9-AZlo9AT-EBkgliji0MZr3MEpkJHfFXEW9bVGr8/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy02NzU3Mjk5NzguanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-26 20:59:42.645804

The Nashville Banner reported that Shane Trucking and Excavating, a local subcontractor responsible for excavation and fabrication, left the nine-mile tunnel project after more than four months on site. Company owner Willie Shane told the Banner that his firm had received only about 5% of payments owed, leaving him to cover payroll out of pocket. He also raised safety concerns, alleging that crews were instructed to shore deep excavation slopes with wood planks instead of concrete, prompting U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration complaints. Shane added that The Boring Co. personnel also attempted to hire away his welders, in violation of contract terms.

The contractor did not respond to requests for comment.

RELATED LINK $400M Tunnel Project Faces Scrutiny From Nashville Leaders

The dispute in Nashville comes as The Boring Co. faces scrutiny in other areas. Ars Technica reported in October that the firm was cited for nearly 800 environmental violations in Las Vegas, ranging from improper waste handling to stormwater management failures.

In a Sept. 22 notice obtained by ProPublica, the Nevada Division of Environmental Protection said The Boring Co. had violated provisions of its administrative order on consent, instructing the firm “to cease and desist non‑compliant activities, and [demanding] payment of penalties associated with those violations.” One incident described “a direct discharge of water ... from The Boring Co. construction site at 4300 Paradise Road” that was photographed by the Las Vegas Valley Water District and prompted the order.

The agency also cited The Boring Co. for inspection failures, stating that its ""inspection records reflect that its site inspections were not conducted by an independent Certified Environmental Manager,” as required under a 2022 settlement agreement .

Regulators noted that penalties could have exceeded $3 million if assessed daily under the agreement’s terms, but the total was reduced to $242,800, according to Ars Technica. The notice further documented infractions, including unsecured materials, poor housekeeping, and late or missing discharge monitoring reports.

Despite ongoing challenges, Davis continues to emphasize safety in promoting the Music City Loop, citing a federal Transportation Security Administration review conducted by the U.S. Dept. of Homeland Security.

“We asked for a full analysis of our safety and security, and they delivered,” Davis said. “The result was the Gold Standard Award—the highest rating possible—covering 17 categories of security and emergency preparedness. We earned the highest score ever recorded for a public transportation system.”

Davis concluded the livestream address detailing plans for at least 20 stations across Nashville, including a proposed two‑mile extension along Broadway and West End Avenue. Stops are slated for Music City Center and Gaylord Opryland, with a potential station at the new Nissan Stadium.

That matters, he argued, because reduced emissions from clean energy won’t be enough to curb climate change in the long run.","Clean energy — such as solar, wind and batteries — is often considered a zero-emission technology that doesn’t generate any climate-change-inducing carbon dioxide when it produces electricity.

But manufacturing the solar panels, wind turbines and battery cells for those energy sources is anything but clean.

Most production facilities require large amounts of electricity from emission-spewing coal and gas plants to make them, explained Sergey Paltsev, deputy director of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology’s Center for Sustainability Science and Strategy.

Mining the minerals needed for solar panels and batteries also requires huge amounts of mostly dirty energy and can also pollute the environment and endanger the health of local residents.

“Low-carbon sources are lower, but they’re not zero,” Paltsev said. “We definitely need to educate both decision makers and the general public on making sure that we are not making claims which are not realistic.”

It all begs the question: How clean really is green energy, and do the potential benefits offset the negative impacts?

‘THERE’S A BIG DIFFERENCE’

Manufacturing wind, solar and batteries can come with a significant upfront carbon footprint.

But nearly all research agrees that those energy sources produce far fewer greenhouse gas emissions than coal or gas over their entire lifecycle.

Coal plants, on average, generate 1,000 grams of CO2 for every kilowatt hour of energy produced, according to an analysis by the U.S. Department of Energy’s National Renewable Energy Laboratory.

Wind generates just 13 grams per kilowatt hour; solar produces 28 grams; and lithium-ion batteries generate 33 grams, according to the analysis.

The energy department’s research published in 2021 determined the average carbon emission rate based on a review of hundreds of independent studies.

“When you are comparing around 10 grams versus 1,000, that’s a big difference,” Paltsev said. “We need to keep that scale in perspective.”

To put those numbers in perspective, solar panels only need to operate for 4-8 months to offset their manufacturing emissions; wind turbines need around three months to two years; and lithium batteries take 1-3 years.

Fossil fuels also generate huge amounts of toxic air pollution that killed more than 8 million people worldwide in 2018, according to a Harvard University study released in 2021.

While manufacturing solar, wind and other clean energy sources produce some air pollution, the technology is completely clean once operational.

Reducing air pollution through clean energy sources could help save 400,000 American lives by 2050, according to Princeton University’s 2021 Net Zero America study.

“Coal is really out there in terms of the bad impacts,” Paltsev said. “So at this point, even though wind and solar isn’t at zero emissions, it’s still better.”

GETTING GREEN CLEAN

But even with clean energy’s clear track record of producing less pollution and earth-warming gases, its downside shouldn’t be ignored, argued Dustin Mulvaney, an environmental studies professor at San Jose State University.

Today, many solar panels and batteries contain toxic chemicals that could be hazardous to human health, but still slip under the regulatory radar.

A case in point: The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in December banned the use of trichloroethylene, which increases risks of certain cancers, in nearly every industry. Battery manufacturers, however, don’t have to phase out their use for 20 years.

“Here’s a hazardous chemical that’s in the battery supply chain that is not necessarily being adequately addressed,” said Mulvaney. “The EPA is putting this green halo on batteries, saying we forgive all of the bad sides to this.”

Mining lithium for electric- vehicle batteries is also notoriously bad for the environment, using vast amounts of water in sometimes arid locations while employing heavy machinery that generates tons of emissions.

Silicon mining for solar panels also poses major health risks to workers, who face permanent and sometimes fatal lung diseases by inhaling toxic silica dust. Mining can also pollute groundwater and degrade soil.

Most solar panels, wind turbines and some batteries also end up in landfills at the end of their lifecycle, which negatively impacts the environment.

Although the research is clear that clean energy produces less carbon emissions than fossil fuels, there currently is no metric measuring the overall, life-to-death environmental impact of green technologies, noted Paltsev with MIT.

Mulvaney argued that although it’s imperative to reduce the impacts of climate change through green energy, the people who do deal with its negative side effects, like polluted groundwater or increased health risks, shouldn’t be ignored.

“I think it’s dangerous to dismiss these impacts,” he said. “Even if 7 billion people benefit and only 20 people suffer on the planet, I think those 20 people deserve attention.”

APPROACHING ZERO

But new technology and improved manufacturing processes for clean energy sources are quickly diminishing those adverse impacts. Companies like Arizona-based First Solar have developed a panel that doesn’t use silicon, greatly reducing its carbon footprint and water usage compared to traditional arrays.

The publicly traded company with facilities in four countries also started the first global solar recycling program, and today recovers 90% of the materials in each module it produces.

The American Battery Technology Company is innovating ways to recycle lithium batteries and extract the rare metals inside to sell back into the battery-supply chain. The system reduces the need for mining and produces American- sourced metals with less environmental impact, according to the company.

Even China, where around 80% of all solar panels are manufactured, has since 2011 halved the CO2 produced through its manufacturing processes, according to the International Energy Agency. Still, total emissions from solar manufacturing there have almost quadrupled in the same time as production skyrockets.

Paltsev said how quickly green energy can move towards net-zero emissions in the U.S. really depends on policymakers and the economic incentives that they can provide.

That matters, he argued, because reduced emissions from clean energy won’t be enough to curb climate change in the long run. Greenhouse gases are also coming from non-energy sources like agriculture and deforestation, Paltsev noted.

Until zero emissions are reached across the globe, temperatures will continue to rise and contribute to a surge in catastrophic weather events around world.

“At some point, I think there will be a huge demand for much more aggressive actions, because when you see things which are destroying your way of life, you will start asking more and more loudly that policymakers do something,” he said.

GOING NUCLEAR: Nuclear energy startup Fermi America has hired The Vogel Group’s trade guru Samir Kapadia to lobby on “issues related to gigawatt scale private electric grid development in Amarillo, Texas,” according to a newly filed disclosure report.

— The company, founded in January by former Energy Secretary Rick Perry along with his son, Griffin Perry, and GOP donor Toby Neugebauer, is part of a new wave of startups founded by executives with little to no experience in nuclear energy that are nevertheless pulling in billions of dollars from investors betting that founders’ close ties to the White House will allow them to leapfrog established competitors in the race to meet the energy demand created by the AI boom, Evan Halper reports today for The Washington Post.

— Fermi went public at the start of October with a valuation of $12.5 billion despite the fact that it has yet to generate any revenue. Later that month, the company announced two deals with South Korean manufacturers that will build equipment for four planned nuclear reactors on Fermi’s Amarillo complex.

— Vogel Group is only Fermi’s second lobbying hire in Washington. In July, the company signed Jeff Miller, Stefan Passantino and Lucas Wallwork of Miller Strategies to lobby on “general issues related to regulatory approval and trade.” Miller, himself close with Trump, reported earning $150,000 from Fermi for his first three months of work.

ABORTION AND THE ACA: Lawmakers enjoying Thanksgiving with their families have a fight over extending Affordable Care Act subsidies waiting for them when they return to Washington. Promising to complicate negotiations is the question of abortion and whether any extension should include increased limits on abortions under the ACA.

— Anti-abortion groups have spent months lobbying Congress and the White House to include such limits and are now asking President Donald Trump to take a firm position in favor of new restrictions, POLITICO’s Alice Miranda Ollstein, Jordain Carney and Cheyenne Haslett report.

— Should the White House decline to take a position on new ACA abortion restrictions or advance a subsidy extension plan without those restrictions, that “would ultimately fracture the wide-reaching coalition that got President Trump re-elected,” a spokesperson for Americans United for Life said.

— “But given this difficult landscape, conservative lobbyists are skeptical that passage is possible even if Trump endorsed abortion restrictions,” our colleagues write. “Those in close contact with lawmakers say it’s unlikely an extension of the subsidies could win 60 votes in the Senate — or even 50.”

CEOS FUND TRUMP CRITICS: The Business Roundtable distributed $2.6 million in grants and contributions in 2024, with part of that money going to various organizations that have since criticized the Trump administration and its policies, Taylor Giorno reports for NOTUS.

— The group gave $150,000 to The American Action Forum, a think tank that has slammed Trump’s moves on tariffs and H-1B visas. This fall, the organization’s president said Trump’s economy was “dead in the water.”

— An additional $50,000 went to Third Way, which has called Trump’s decision to deploy the National Guard in Los Angeles “a dangerous escalation” of his immigration strategy. $30,000 went to Democratic group ModSquad Foundation and another $15,000 went to the National Immigration Forum. Two climate groups also received $50,000 each.

— “Business Roundtable partners with groups across the political spectrum and works closely with the Trump Administration and members of Congress to advance pro-growth policies,” a spokesperson for the organization told NOTUS.

PROFESSORS PAC: A university professors union has launched its first political action committee, opening up a new avenue for educators to push back on the Trump administration’s attacks on colleges and universities by supporting candidates opposed to the pressure campaign.

— The American Association of University Professors, an affiliate of the major teachers union the American Federation of Teachers, launched the PAC yesterday. “The AAUP is committed to engaging on every level, from organizing on the ground in our communities, to fighting back in the courts, to the American democratic process,” the union’s president told Kate Ackley of Bloomberg Government.

— The AAUP files regular lobbying disclosure reports, but has not reported any actual lobbying activity since 2021. However, lobbying activity is up overall this year among institutes of higher education, particularly among Ivy League schools that have been the targets of federal grant freezes and civil rights investigations.

Two notable players are First Solar FSLR and Canadian Solar CSIQ. While both are leaders in the clean-energy ecosystem, they operate in different segments and offer distinct competitive advantages.

As global industries accelerate their shift toward cleaner and more sustainable energy sources, solar power has emerged as one of the fastest-growing solutions. This momentum is reflected in the rapid expansion of solar photovoltaic (PV) installations across residential, commercial and utility-scale markets worldwide. Governments are offering incentives, corporations are prioritizing decarbonization, and consumers are increasingly adopting renewable technologies — all of which are fueling the surge in solar deployment.

The Case for FSLR Stock

First Solar is aggressively expanding its manufacturing capacity to capture growing global solar demand. In the third quarter of 2025, it produced 3.6 gigawatt (GW) and sold 5.3 GW of modules, with total nameplate capacity reaching 23.5 GW across facilities in the United States, India, Malaysia and Vietnam. The company is also adding a new 3.7 GW U.S. module finishing line, set to begin operations in late 2026. These expansions are expected to strengthen its global presence and support future revenue growth.

First Solar’s new $1.1 billion AI-enabled manufacturing facility in Louisiana is a major strategic boost for the company. The plant adds 3.5 GW of annual capacity, strengthening First Solar’s rapidly expanding U.S. manufacturing footprint and supporting rising demand for its Series 7 modules. Its advanced AI systems improve quality control and operational efficiency, helping lower costs and increase production yields. The facility also uses U.S.-sourced materials and avoids dependence on Chinese supply chains, enhancing supply-chain security and aligning with U.S. clean-energy policy incentives.

Cummings committed to the Longhorns on the trip and went public with his pledge moments ago.
“There’s a lot of reasons why I chose Texas,” Cummings said.
“It’s a great city and everyone is so passionate about Texas football,” Cummings said.
“Johnny Nansen is my lead recruiter and he’s a great guy and a great coach.","Carlsbad (Calif.) athlete Rocky Cummings has flipped his commitment from Cal to Texas.

Cummings committed to Cal back in June but a handful of Power 4 programs, including Texas, jumped in over the last month and the two-way standout officially visited over the weekend.

Cummings committed to the Longhorns on the trip and went public with his pledge moments ago.

“There’s a lot of reasons why I chose Texas,” Cummings said. “I loved the environment there and really liked the city of Austin. Texas has a winning tradition, I love the coaching staff and I love the plan they have for me.

“They want to use me similar to how they currently play Tre Moore. I’ll be an outside linebacker who will also be able to rush the passer and I think it’s an all around perfect fit for me.”

Cummings said the weekend visit was his first time in Austin.

“It’s a great city and everyone is so passionate about Texas football,” Cummings said. “The game atmosphere was incredible and it was a lot of fun being there and taking it all in.

“Johnny Nansen is my lead recruiter and he’s a great guy and a great coach. He has been with coach Sark for a long time and he’s a really smart coach and knows how to win and I’m excited to play for them.”

Steve Sarkisian’s son Brady was Cummings’ host on the visit.

“I was with Brady and Spencer Shannon, a couple of Cali guys,” Cummings said. “They were great and said Austin is actually a lot like California so easy to adapt to.

“When I talked with coach Sark, he told me the same. He’s a great coach and easy to talk with. I’m just really excited about this opportunity. If you had told me a year ago I would be going to Texas, I’m not sure I would have believed it but I’m definitely thankful and excited to get going.”

Cummings is a very intriguing two-way player and has the ability to play on either side of the ball in college. He was recruited as a linebacker by Texas but is a talented tight end as well although we do think his upside is highest on defense.

He has a projectable 6-foot-4, 220 pounds frame and we could see him adding 20-25 pounds or so and playing some as an edge rusher as well as linebacker.

Cummings actually plays more of an edge role at Carlsbad so moving to linebacker will be an adjustment. You see his athleticism pop on offense and he’s a fluid mover so there’s confidence Cummings can develop in to an impact player.

“He’s a freak athlete, he really is,” Lancer head coach Thad MacNeal said. “I always knew he was this type of prospect to be recruited by schools like Texas and Notre Dame.

“He’s a classic late bloomer who missed some games as a junior because he was sick but he’s a very talented player and not even close to reaching his full potential. I can’t wait to see what he looks like in a few years but I have no doubt he can play at that level.”

Through eight games this season, Cummings has 11 catches for 187 yards and eight touchdowns to go with 27 tackles, four for loss, three sacks, and 10 hurries.",https://on3static.com/uploads/dev/assets/cms/2025/11/23220241/DSC09655-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 18:01:15.489112

Significantly, no similar requirement is made in the Interim Final Rule with respect to other types of Energy Infrastructure covered by the Energy Dominance program.
And, on November 18, Constellation Energy announced a $1 billion loan from DOE to restart Three Mile Island nuclear facility.","On October 15, 2025, AEP Transmission LLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of American Electric Power Company (AEP), closed a $1.6 billion term-loan financing guaranteed by the US Department of Energy (DOE), marking the first DOE loan guaranteed financing to close since President Trump’s inauguration in January. AEP operates the nation’s largest electric transmission system, spanning more than 40,000 miles and serving over five million customers. The company sought DOE financing to rebuild and reconductor approximately 5,000 miles of transmission lines across five states – Indiana, Michigan, Ohio, Oklahoma and West Virginia – modernizing grid infrastructure and improving reliability for millions of consumers.

The credit facility was structured as a low-interest term loan advanced by the Federal Financing Bank and fully guaranteed by the DOE under its Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment authority. The federal financing backed by DOE’s guarantee will significantly reduce borrowing costs and allow AEP to accelerate capital deployment at a time when private financing for large-scale transmission upgrades may be constrained.

The AEP transaction may very well serve as an early model for subsequent electric power infrastructure financings under the DOE’s newly branded Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment and Energy Dominance Financing Programs.

A Program Built to Bridge Innovation and Capital

The DOE’s loan guarantee program was created under Title XVII of the Energy Policy Act of 2005 (then called “Incentives for Innovative Technologies”) to help finance innovative energy technologies that, at time of financing, wouldn’t meet market norms for “commercial technology.” By providing federal guarantees for loans provided by the Federal Financing Bank, or potentially private lenders, the program aimed to close the financing gap between innovative technology and market-tested (i.e., bankable) deployment.

Over the years, the DOE’s Loan Program Office (LPO), created to administer the loan guarantee program, financed projects that redefined the US energy landscape: utility-scale solar farms, advanced vehicle manufacturing, and more recently, next-generation carbon-capture facilities among them. Through these investments, DOE has been perhaps the principal actor in the US helping to move new-generation clean energy technologies from the margin to the mainstream.

Following the inauguration of President Biden, the loan guarantee program received a boost from both the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (IIJA) and the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), which among other things increased the funds authorized for the program. The IRA also created a new category of projects eligible for funding under Section 1706 of Title XVII named the Energy Infrastructure Reinvestment Financing program (EIRF). In its guidance, the Biden era LPO described the new funding as aiming to provide a “bridge to bankability,” especially for new projects that contribute to the reduction of greenhouse gas pollution that may have trouble arranging financing from commercial lenders.

A New Mandate: Financing Energy Dominance

The new Trump Administration has significantly shifted US energy policy, rejecting the concept of climate change, and emphasizing instead fossil fuels as the means to achieving energy security and dominance.

The new Congress reflected President Trump’s pivot in passing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act (OBBBA). The OBBBA revised Section 1706, rebranding it as the “Energy Dominance Program” and changing its emphasis from promoting clean energy generation to facilitating projects using fossil resources, as well as mining projects, for the sake of national security. The OBBBA rescinded the unobligated funds inked by the IRA for Section 1706 but at the same time appropriated $1 billion to DOE to “carry out activities” under section 1706 (of which not more than 3 percent is to be used for administrative expenses) and authorized $250 billion in new loan guarantees for the revised Energy Dominance program through September 30, 2028.

Consistent with the policy shift to encompass fossil resources, Section 50403 of the OBBBA removed a Section 1706 eligibility criterion that a project must “avoid, reduce, utilize, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions.” Additionally, program eligibility is expanded to include projects that will “increase capacity or output” or “support or enable the provision of known or forecastable electric supply at time intervals necessary to maintain or enhance grid reliability or other system adequacy needs.” The OBBBA also revised the definition of “Energy Infrastructure” to become a facility (and associated equipment), used to enable “production, processing, transportation, transmission, refining and generation needed for energy and critical minerals.”

On October 28, DOE published an Interim Final Rule which amends the DOE’s loan guarantee regulations to implement the Energy Dominance Financing provisions of the OBBBA. Among other provisions it will add a requirement that an electricity utility infrastructure project applying for funding from the 1706 program demonstrate that the financial benefits from a DOE guarantee will be shared with its customers, or the associated community served by it. Significantly, no similar requirement is made in the Interim Final Rule with respect to other types of Energy Infrastructure covered by the Energy Dominance program. While it is “effective” as of October 28, the period for public comment on the Interim Final Rule expires on December 29, 2025. The text of he rule and information on how to provide comments can be found here.

The above notwithstanding, Title XVII survived mostly unchanged, except for the revised Section 1706. As an important example, the OBBB did not change Section 1706 (a)(1) under which the AEP financing was closed, and which contemplates guarantees for projects to “retool, repower, repurpose or replace energy infrastructure that has ceased operations.” Moreover, the OBBBA did not amend Section 1703 of the Energy Policy Act, which authorizes DOE loan guarantees for projects that “avoid, reduce, or sequester air pollutants or anthropogenic emissions of greenhouse gases and employ new or significantly improved technologies as compared to commercial technologies in service in the United States at the time the guarantee is issued”, including, among others, Renewable Energy Systems, carbon capture projects and those projects that increase the domestically produced supply of critical minerals. However, the OBBBA in practice defunded the innovative energy program (among other programs) for future projects.

The AEP Transmission Financing: A Case Study in Transition

Bracewell’s representation of AEP in this transaction provides some unique insights into how DOE’s pre-existing loan guarantee framework will evolve to operate effectively within the new energy-dominance policy environment. AEP, like several utilities in the DOE queue, applied for funding and executed a preliminary term sheet before President Trump’s second inauguration in January.

The AEP deal advanced under challenging conditions – not only the change in administration after term sheet signing, but also the longest ever federal government shutdown that halted some agency operations. Despite these challenges, the transaction closed smoothly in October, aided by a pragmatic and flexible approach implemented by both the AEP and DOE teams to navigate the DOE’s existing procedural complexities, while balancing the policies and interests of DOE in following governmental norms with the commercial interests of AEP in achieving a resilient and administratively manageable financing structure under its 30-year tenure.

The willingness of both parties to overcome challenges within existing statutory and policy constraints was essential. The transaction helped establish a working model for balancing regulatory compliance with project-level realities. It provides a roadmap for future DOE-guaranteed financings, not only for the small group of forthcoming utility-oriented financings already in the queue, but also for new projects under the OBBBA’s expanded eligibility scope.

Looking Forward

Under the energy-dominance framework and its expanded reach, the DOE loan guarantee program is poised to continue to be a strategic financing platform encompassing the full spectrum of US energy infrastructure, with an emphasis on innovation, reliability, security and independence, and agnostic on type of fuel or feedstock. To prove this point, in late October DOE closed a second loan, a $1.5 billion loan to Wabash Valley Resources to finance the restart and repurposing of a coal to ammonia fertilizer facility in Indiana that was idled since 2016. The revamped facility will produce 500,000 mtpy of anhydrous ammonia from coal from a nearby mine and pet coke as feedstock. And, on November 18, Constellation Energy announced a $1 billion loan from DOE to restart Three Mile Island nuclear facility.

For utilities and other project investors, the lesson is clear: US federal credit support remains one of the most powerful tools for accelerating capital into a changing environment for the energy infrastructure that underpins US economic strength.",https://natlawreview.com/sites/default/files/styles/article_image/public/2025-11/Clean-Energy-Wind-Farm-41331.jpg.webp?itok=7kVQRy5Z,N,,2025-11-26 18:01:29.231223

Rivian’s Q3 Earnings and Financial Health

In the world of trading, adapting to the market dynamics is crucial for success. Savvy traders understand that emotional decisions often lead to hasty and potentially risky trades. As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade says, “I never chase price. The best opportunities allow me to enter on my terms, not when I’m feeling pressured.” By waiting for the right moment and conditions to align with their strategies, traders can avoid impulsive mistakes and make more calculated trades. By adhering to a disciplined approach, traders can ensure they act decisively yet cautiously, maintaining control over their trades rather than succumbing to market pressures.

Rivian’s third quarter of 2025 was a telling narrative of progress and opportunity. Revenues soared to $1.56B, surpassing analyst expectations set at $1.51B. Although the company posted an EPS loss of $0.96, which did not meet the consensus of $0.86, the vehicle production and delivery figures were commendable. Rivian produced 10,720 vehicles while delivering 13,201 units, indicating strong consumer demand and operational effectiveness.

A noteworthy achievement was the narrowing of losses compared to the previous year, accompanied by a gross margin increase to 2%. The continued commitment to R&D and strategic financing reflects Rivian’s calculated approach to innovation and expansion. Noteworthy in the financial discussion is the keen focus on gross profit growth, which surged over the past year, shining a light on systemic improvements within the company’s manufacturing efficiencies and cost management.

Key financial ratios provide deeper insights into Rivian’s current standing and future potential. The operating margin paints a tumultuous picture at -57.4%, suggesting the need for vigilant cost control as they strive for profitability. The valuation ratios, with a price-to-cash flow at 178.8 and price-to-book ratio at 3.67, indicate an expensive stock from an investor’s perspective, yet the potential for long-term value growth remains undeniable. Rivian’s robust current ratio of 2.7 highlights strong liquidity, making it well-equipped to meet short-term obligations.

Despite these achievements, Rivian’s balance sheet reveals an ongoing battle with debt, with a leverage ratio of 3 signaling high risk. The financial structure must continue evolving to support sustainable growth and shareholder value.

Deciphering the Impact of News on Market Moves

In analyzing how recent developments intersect with market performances, we find several pivotal narratives at play. The financial results and targets highlighted in news articles echo robust optimism from market analysts. Take, for instance, the raised price targets by Tigress Financial and Stifel. This denotes not merely confidence but an expectation that Rivian has more to offer in terms of innovation and returns on investment.

Moreover, the proposed lavish compensation for CEO RJ Scaringe tends to reinforce expectations of aggressive strategy moves designed to transform challenges into scalable opportunities. Rivian’s positioning in the EV market entails navigating headwinds from legislative shifts, such as the removal of EV tax credits, which present both short-term pressure and long-term strategic adaptation opportunities.

Further, the planned participation in key industry events and discussions, like the Barclays Global Automotive and Mobility Tech Conference, underscore Rivian’s strategic outreach for partnerships, branding, and possible unveiling of new technological advancements. This kind of visibility augments the company’s profile, potentially translating into strengthened investor confidence and market interest.

Summary and Predictive Outlook

The narrative surrounding Rivian’s financial journey and news ramifications illustrates a company at a crossroads between substantial potential and existing hurdles. The developments captured in the earnings report, complemented by strategic participation announcements and ambitious forecasts, build a facet of expectation and cautious optimism among traders and analysts. As Tim Bohen, lead trainer with StocksToTrade says, “I never chase price. The best opportunities allow me to enter on my terms, not when I’m feeling pressured.” This philosophy echoes through Rivian’s adept navigation of industry highs and lows, along with its decisive management actions, which paint a promising canvas. Their ability to turn R&D investments and strategic engagements into tangible value will remain crucial. While the road ahead harbors uncertainties with evolving regulatory landscapes and capital allocation criticality, Rivian’s dedication to its long-term vision of innovation and expansion mirrors potential sustained growth. As the market continues to evolve, Rivian stands ready, armed with its strategic insights and a bold vision, to reshape the EV narrative and deliver on its promise of automotive excellence.

Osaka Gas Targets US Power Plant Investments on AI-Driven Demand Back to video

“An enormous number of data centers are being built in the US right now — in short, there’s a shortage of electricity,” Fujiwara said. Population growth will also contribute to an organic increase in energy demand, he added.

Article content

The needs of US tech firms looking to expand their data facilities are set to account for nearly a tenth of total US power demand by 2035, outpacing demand from electric vehicles and other sectors, and gas is expected to serve about 65% of that, according to BloombergNEF.

Osaka Gas already has stakes in several gas-fired power plants in the US. The 120-year old company, which is a major provider for Japan’s western region, is looking to expand its overseas businesses.

Article content

It acquired Sabine Oil & Gas Corp. in 2019 as an inroad to American shale gas development, and expects it to produce an equivalent of 3.8 million tons of liquefied natural gas this fiscal year ending March. Sabine’s production will be gradually increased by cycling through assets in the Texas region, meaning older fields will be replaced with those with more reserves, the president said.

The company became the first Japanese firm to enter India’s city gas distribution business in 2021, when it invested in a local firm through a consortium. While there is no specific timeline, Osaka Gas eventually wants to sell LNG to India, Fujiwara said. Vietnam, which revised its energy policy in April to call for a massive increase in power generation capacity, is another attractive country for opportunities in both natural gas and renewable energy, he said.

Article content

Osaka Gas handled roughly 11 million tons of LNG in the year ended this March, and Fujiwara highlighted diversification and long-term contracts as key to managing geopolitical risks. Fuel from North America and Oceania currently make up a large portion of their portfolio, and the company is also eyeing supply from Southeast Asia and Middle East, he said.

Top of mind are things such as Waters of the United States (WOTUS), the Renewable Fuels Standard, pesticides and more.

EPA Deputy Administrator David Fotouhi joined Agriculture of America on Wednesday to discuss a number of topics and provide some perspective and updates for farmers and ranchers. That started with a recap of the the latest news on WOTUS.

“We had a big announcement last week, a new proposed definition of Waters of the United States, which of course governs the scope of the Clean Water Act and essentially determines whether folks need a permit to conduct work on surface water,” according to Fotouhi. “And so I think for farmers and ranchers, we’ve heard over the last few months that we needed to provide additional clarity and certainty about this rule. We are operating in a scenario where the Biden administration frankly made things worse. They issued a definition in 2023 that increased the amount of confusion, not just for farmers and ranchers, but for small business owners and home builders and others across the country who just want to know, do they or don’t they need a permit for undertaking work on their property? So we’ve issued a proposed definition that we think is fully consistent with the Supreme Court’s recent decision on this matter and other legal precedents that we took into consideration.”

In regards to questions surrounding the Renewable Fuels Standard, EPA’s Deputy Administrator emphasized the need to take the time to get any guidance or rules done correctly.

“We totally understand how critical the RFS is to farmers across the country. And it’s something that from day one, the administrator has been laser-focused on getting right and coming up with durable decisions about,” according to Fotouhi. “We found significant backlogs in this program when we arrived here in this new administration. The last administration was late in getting out its proposed volumes. It was also very delayed in considering some of the small refinery exemptions that had been submitted to EPA.”

He added that “we’re making great progress on the SREs and the renewable volume obligations. We understand that it’s really important and incumbent on us to get that done in a timely manner and in a durable manner as well so that folks can have certainty about what the standards will be moving forward. So I don’t have specific timing to share with you today, but we’ve made significant progress.”

Commenting on the Chancellor’s Budget announcements, RenewableUK’s Deputy Chief Executive Jane Cooper said:

“We’re pleased to see the Chancellor has supported our call to drive domestic electricity bills down by moving some energy policy costs into general taxation. It’s fairer, as it’s based on people’s ability to pay, so families on low incomes will benefit most. We also welcome her moves to make electricity cheaper for industry, as this will reduce costs for the energy sector’s supply chain and accelerate electrification, both of which will, in turn, reduce electricity costs, benefitting billpayers.

“The Chancellor’s commitment to invest in measures to speed up the planning system, including recruiting 350 extra planning officers in England, is a timely intervention which will enable us to roll out vital new clean energy capacity significantly faster, strengthening the UK’s energy security.

“It’s exciting to see the Government approving two new freeports in Scotland and Wales. These are the latest examples of the renewable energy sector revitalising ports across the country by building centres of excellence. We also welcome the announcement of investment in renewable energy projects in Cornwall through a new local Industrial Growth Fund.

“We’re grateful that the Chancellor has taken up our suggestion to remove the Climate Change Levy from the production of green hydrogen, as this will encourage the growth of our innovative clean hydrogen industry and help to maintain our global lead in this cutting-edge technology.

“This package of measures will help our industry to deliver greater energy security and create even more jobs while ensuring fairness for consumers”.

The combined companies will be a bigger player in the $23 billion Class 4-6 battery-electric medium-duty commercial vehicle market.

Nov 26, 2025

Motiv Electric Trucks/Workhorse Group

Workhorse Group shareholders have voted to approve the merger with San Francisco Bay Area-based Motiv Electric Trucks, which was first announced in August.

Both companies build last-mile, light- and medium-duty battery-electric commercial vehicles, a market currently valued at $23 billion.

[Related: Workhorse and Motiv merge to form new North American electric medium-duty truck manufacturer]

The vote took place at the annual shareholders meeting in Cincinnati, Ohio. Workhorse is based in Union City, Indiana. The combined companies will be named Workhorse, Clean Trucking previously confirmed.

The deal is expected to be completed in the next few weeks.

""We appreciate the support of our shareholders as we reach this important milestone in our pending merger with Motiv to create a leader in the medium-duty EV commercial vehicle market,"" said Rick Dauch, CEO of Workhorse. ""We are now poised to complete the transaction and officially bring together two innovators in the medium-duty electric vehicle space and better serve our blue-chip customer base. We look forward to enabling our shareholders to benefit from the upside potential of our combined company.""

[Related: Megawatt charging explained: What it is and why it matters]

Under the merger agreement, Motiv's largest investor will become the majority owner of the newly combined company once the all-stock deal closes. Workhorse shareholders will continue to retain a meaningful stake. As part of the transaction, Workhorse has also completed a sale-leaseback and raised additional funding through convertible notes. In total, the merged company carries an estimated value of about $105 million.

Motiv CEO Scott Griffith will continue in that position for the combined company, while Workhorse CEO Rick Dauch will move into an advisory role.

The companies also outlined the key benefits of the merger:

Creating a category leader positioned for rapid innovation and scalable growth. Joining Motiv’s diverse product portfolio and top fleet relationships with Workhorse’s proven vehicles, manufacturing capabilities and national dealer network is expected to create a platform for long-term growth. Workhorse’s Union City facility has the capacity to eventually produce up to 5,000 trucks per year.

Leveraging combined scale and strengths to reduce unit costs. Workhorse and Motiv believe that the combined company will compete more effectively with the industry’s pure-play electric and legacy OEMs. Workhorse and Motiv believe the combined company will capitalize on new opportunities to serve more customers with a more competitively advantaged electric offering than gas/diesel trucks and buses on a TCO basis.

Joining complementary customer bases. Workhorse and Motiv believe the next phase of large-scale adoption of medium-duty electric trucks in North America will be driven by national-scale commercial fleets with tested and piloted multi-depot EV truck operations. Together, Motiv and Workhorse have served 10 of the largest medium-duty fleets in North America3, positioning the combined company to expand adoption through these existing relationships with likely early scalers.

Establishing a strong financial foundation. The companies believe that the transaction strengthens the combined company’s financial position and creates opportunities for margin expansion, enabling greater flexibility to pursue future growth initiatives. With a simplified capital structure, the combined company also expects to be better positioned to raise additional capital post-close.

Presenting significant synergy opportunities. The companies believe there is the potential to achieve at least $20 million of cost synergies, including through R&D, G&A, and facility cost-reductions by the end of 2026. The combined companies also intend to utilize a product and engineering approach to maximize the use of common software, hardware, and IP across its Class 4-6 platforms to pursue additional cost savings, an enhanced technology baseline and a best-in-class customer experience with limited downtime and optimized TCO.

Hydrogen Fuel Cell & BEV Survey

The following survey was sent as a link in an email cover message in February 2023 to the newsletter lists for Overdrive and CCJ. After approximately two weeks, a total of 176 owner-operators under their own authority, 113 owner-operators leased or assigned to a carrier and 82 fleet executives and 36 fleet employees from fleets with 10 or more power units had completed and submitted the questionnaire for a total of 407 qualified responses. Cross-tabulations based on respondent type are provided for each question when applicable.

,Clean Energy ,2025-11-26 20:43:30+00:00,www.ans.org,The DOE reorganization's impact on nuclear,Not Available,,,,,https://www.ans.org/news/article-7582/the-doe-reorganizations-impact-on-nuclear/,"The following changes have been made to offices previously housed under Science: The Arctic Energy Office (AE) has been moved from Science to Energy.
The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) has been moved from Science to Energy.
Energy is also home to a number of newly listed offices: Office of Electricity (OE).
According to an anonymous DOE staffer who spoke to E&E News, DOE staff received no explanation of the reorganization prior to the announcement.
On the other hand, the dismantlement of OCED is likely to have implications on how the DOE supports the advanced nuclear sector.","The reorganization chiefly involves the slight renaming of existing offices, the creation of others, and the apparent scrapping of still more.

High-level changes: Along with its press release, the DOE posted its new organization chart.

The DOE is headed by the Office of the Secretary, under which there are three major suboffices, along with a handful of stand-alone offices. Those major suboffices are listed below:

The Office of Security (S5) and National Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA), which has remained broadly unchanged by this reorganization.

The Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Innovation (S4) which has been slightly renamed to cut “and Innovation” from its title (it will be referred to as “Science” hereafter).

The Office of the Under Secretary for Infrastructure (S3), which has been renamed the Office of the Under Secretary for Energy (hereafter, “Energy”).

NNSA changes: S5 and the NNSA have the fewest organizational changes. No offices under its jurisdiction have been cut, but one has been added to the chart: the Office of Communication (NA-COMM). NA-COMM existed before this reorganization. It is unclear why it was not listed in previous organizational charts.

S4 changes: The changes in Science and Energy are much more substantial. The following changes have been made to offices previously housed under Science:

The Arctic Energy Office (AE) has been moved from Science to Energy.

The Office of Nuclear Energy (NE) has been moved from Science to Energy.

The Office of Electricity (OE) has been moved from Science to Energy.

The Office of Critical and Emerging Technologies (OCET) is no longer listed.

The Office of Energy Efficiency & Renewable Energy (EERE) is no longer listed.

The Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management (FECM) is no longer listed.

The only office previously housed under Science to remain through this reorganization is the Office of Science (SC). In addition, Science is now the home of four new offices:

Office of Technology Commercialization (OTC).

Office of Strategy & Technology Roadmaps (OSTR).

Office of Fusion (OF).

Office of Artificial Intelligence and Quantum (AIQ).

S3 changes: Energy is also the site of a significant number of changes. Below are the offices that are no longer listed under Energy:

Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED).

Office of Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP).

Grid Deployment Office (GDO).

Office of Manufacturing & Energy Supply Chains (MESC).

Office of State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP).

Loan Programs Office (LPO).

Energy is also home to a number of newly listed offices:

Office of Electricity (OE).

Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office (HGEO).

Office of Energy Dominance Financing (EDF).

Within Energy, the Office of Indian Energy Policy & Programs (IE) and the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security & Emergency Response (CESER) are the only two to remained unchanged by this reorganization.

A few more cuts: Outside of the three major suboffices of the DOE, most offices (like General Counsel and Public Affairs) remained unchanged, but there are some key cuts and additions. The 2025 reorganization chart shows the following cuts: the Office of the Ombudsman, the Office of Enterprise Assessments (EA), the Office of Hearings & Appeals (HG), the Office of Technology Transitions (OTT), the Office of Energy Justice and Equity (EJE), the Office of Project Management (PM), and the Office of Small & Disadvantaged Business Utilization (OSDBU).

As for new creations outside of the major suboffices, there is the new Office of Minority Economic Impact (MI) and the new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation (CMEI).

Takeaways and the unknowns: Beyond the release of the updated organizational chart, the DOE has yet to announce what these sweeping changes mean for the department or the energy sector at large.

The public apparently isn’t alone in the dark. According to an anonymous DOE staffer who spoke to E&E News, DOE staff received no explanation of the reorganization prior to the announcement. That article also quoted two other unidentified people familiar with the reorganization who said reductions in force are not expected to immediately follow these changes, though layoffs remain possible. Those potential layoffs would pile onto an already significant staff reduction following Department of Government Efficiency–related cuts earlier this year.

Going off department names alone still allows for some relatively safe speculation. For instance, it is probable that the newly listed EDF (not to be confused with the utility Électricité de France) will function similarly or identically to the LPO. Whether more structural changes will come to the office is currently unknown, but Energy Secretary Chris Wright has continually said he plans to direct most of the office’s funding to new nuclear.

Notably, the creation of the CMEI aligns with the U.S. Geological Survey’s identification of uranium as a critical mineral earlier this month. Again, it is unclear as of now how an interdepartmental collaboration between the DOE and Interior would progress (if at all) in critical minerals.

Broadly, these changes seem to reflect a move away from renewables and a move toward geothermal, fossils, and nuclear—which is in line with the Trump administration’s energy policy. The creation of the Office of Fusion is also notable as an indicator of more pronounced executive support for the field. On the other hand, the dismantlement of OCED is likely to have implications on how the DOE supports the advanced nuclear sector.

Ultimately, time will tell how these sweeping changes will impact the DOE, its staffers, its partners, the sector, the country at large, and the next administration’s energy agenda.",https://cdn.ans.org/i/favicon-128.png,N,,2025-11-26 19:00:58.034107

Lula preserved the provision but sent a provisional presidential decree establishing a three-phase licensing model similar to the system currently in place.
When vetoing the licensing bill in August, Lula submitted the decree and a separate bill to correct provisions the Executive branch considered legally problematic.

According to Zé Vitor, lawmakers will now use the government’s bill to negotiate parts related to the upcoming veto override.","On Tuesday, Senate President Davi Alcolumbre (Brazil Union of Amapá) convened a joint session of Congress for Thursday (27) to vote on the Lula administration’s vetoes related to the licensing bill and the State Debt Full Payment Program (Propag).

Until last week, the government had been trying to negotiate an agreement with Alcolumbre and Senator Tereza Cristina (Progressive Party, PP, of Mato Grosso do Sul), one of the top figures in the agribusiness caucus, to preserve at least some of the vetoes. But after President Lula nominated Jorge Messias to a seat on the Supreme Court, the relationship between Congress and the Lula administration deteriorated, paving the way for a complete override of the vetoes, according to sources involved in the talks.

Approved by lawmakers in July, the bill faced strong criticism from environmentalists and parts of the administration, including the Ministry of the Environment. Even before the floor vote, opposition parties were preparing to challenge the law in court.

“The tendency is to overturn every veto so we can ensure a robust and effective law. We’re confident about these provisions,” said Zé Vitor, who is also part of the rural caucus.

According to the congressman, however, the Parliamentary Front for Agriculture (FPA) and other groups opposed to the vetoes are debating whether to revive a point removed from the bill: the Special Environmental Permit (LAE) with a single-phase model—licensing in one step.

The LAE is a new permit created by Congress and championed by Alcolumbre to speed up the approval of projects deemed strategic for the country, provided they are cleared by a Government Council. Lula preserved the provision but sent a provisional presidential decree establishing a three-phase licensing model similar to the system currently in place.

When vetoing the licensing bill in August, Lula submitted the decree and a separate bill to correct provisions the Executive branch considered legally problematic.

The decree covers only the LAE and expires on December 5. Rural caucus members and other blocs had filed 833 amendments to the decree, effectively reinstating the original bill that had been partially vetoed. But with just a week left before it expires, and with the decree not yet approved by a special committee or by the Lower House or Senate plenaries, the strategy has shifted. According to Zé Vitor, lawmakers will now use the government’s bill to negotiate parts related to the upcoming veto override.

The bill submitted by the Executive branch alongside the decree attempts to address controversial provisions approved by Congress, such as the creation of the Permit by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC)—a self-declared permit that lawmakers had proposed for projects with medium environmental impact. The government kept the LAC only for low-impact activities.

Suely Araújo, public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory, said the likely override of the vetoes would represent “absolutely unacceptable setbacks,” including widespread use of self-licensing, violations of Indigenous and quilombola rights, and disregard for the federal government’s regulatory authority.",https://s2-valorinternational.glbimg.com/Aq_i0SVMGB0-o4Nkh65PzVdTkxo=/4051x0/filters:format(jpeg)/https://i.s3.glbimg.com/v1/AUTH_63b422c2caee4269b8b34177e8876b93/internal_photos/bs/2025/B/A/YFEcOAS3SHb9MkTALQKA/davi-alcolumbre-2.jpg,N,,2025-11-27 00:58:57.348499

You must direct them to pursue affordable clean energy innovation to lead Idaho Power toward the clean energy future you claim to support.
Instead, you’re willing to throw out your clean energy commitments for short-term financial gain.","Dear Lisa Grow, Idaho Power CEO,

We, Treasure Valley youth, are deeply concerned about the dangerous proposal in your latest 20-year energy plan to build new fossil fuel infrastructure, especially as the Trump administration continues to aggressively attack clean energy projects, climate action and environmental justice across the country.

You have long touted your commitments to clean energy and affordability, but your recent actions suggest otherwise. We’ve been fighting back year after year as you increase fees on our power bills and make affordable rooftop solar increasingly inaccessible for our families and neighbors. Now you plan to build two expensive new gas plants by 2030, rely on the volatile gas market for at least two more decades, and decrease investments in clean energy and peak reduction programs.

We have given you countless opportunities to listen to the voices of the youth and prioritize clean energy for its benefits to the grid, public health, and our communities. Now, it’s time we call your “Clean Today, Cleaner Tomorrow” slogan what it really is: greenwashing.

Your clean energy goals are empty promises to make you look good and feel good. Your top VP, Adam Richins, revealed at a stakeholder meeting last fall that the utility likely won’t meet its goal for 100% Clean Energy by 2045 because he thinks it will just be too expensive.

You know that clean energy is already the most cost-competitive source of new power. It is your job to hold your executive staff accountable for this kind of misdirection and cowardice. You must direct them to pursue affordable clean energy innovation to lead Idaho Power toward the clean energy future you claim to support.

Instead, you’re willing to throw out your clean energy commitments for short-term financial gain. Your base salary alone is nearly $1 million per year. You regularly celebrate Idaho Power’s increasing stock dividends, and, as a monopoly utility in our state, you get a guaranteed rate of return on all your projects.

We’re done with corporations and millionaires like you abusing our economy, ruining our democracy and polluting our environment, just to make more money for themselves. We’re sickened by Trump’s call for more toxic coal, oil and gas, and your willingness to play along.

Are the lives of Idahoans worth less to you than your paycheck and political points?

Here’s a reality check: the climate crisis is already spiraling out of control, and your choices now have a direct impact on our future. Our health suffers due to high heat and our sports games are cancelled due to smoke. Our schools close because the wildfire smoke is so bad that you can see it lining the hallways. Our elderly and disabled family members rely on electricity for life-sustaining medical care, and will face health and safety threats with more frequent power outages.

Whether we like it or not, this is our life, this is what we know, and it will only get worse as climate change intensifies.

We didn’t make the decisions that got our climate to this point and put our community’s safety and security and our futures at risk. But we’re here to harness the power we have to fight for a better future— for a just transition now.

You have the power to prioritize the safety and security of our community, or to abandon us entirely and imperil our future with extreme heat, food insecurity, flooding, and wildfires. To understand the current impacts of climate change and affordability of clean energy, and knowingly invest in risky and expensive fossil fuel infrastructure is an act of violence and a breach of trust to local youth and to your customer base, who has no choice but to purchase energy from you. Want to regain our trust? Prove us wrong. No new gas.",https://www.idahostatesman.com/public/latest-news/t5cu0q/picture312965310/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/IMG_9984.jpeg,N,,2025-11-26 18:00:55.770435

According to the U.S. Department of Energy, more than 70% of the grid is over 25 years old, and demand is rising faster than upgrades can keep pace. DOE reports show U.S. power outages have increased sharply over the past decade, driven by extreme weather, population growth, and the rapid electrification of homes, vehicles, and industry.

“They’re talking 2030 is kind of the look they took and, it’s not a great look ahead, to be honest with you. A lot of demand and not a lot of new generations coming online. So, they’re talking maybe as many as 100 times the outages in 2030 as we have today, which is four years and change away. Not very, not very far.” That’s Michael Newland, Director of Agriculture Business Development for the Propane Education and Research Council or PERC.

He says that for farms, those outages aren’t just inconvenient, they’re costly. That’s why PERC promotes propane-powered equipment—not as a replacement for electricity, but as a reliable on-farm backup.

Newland continued, “We do about 50% of the confinement buildings, back up on those, to run critical systems: ventilation fans, water systems, feed systems. But we can do much more than that. So, we do all the way from that 15-kW generator attached to the house, all the way up to one megawatt and sometimes bigger industrial sites, commercial sites, you know, so we could do a lot with propane in the, in the power space.”

With DOE projecting continued strain on the grid through the next decade, energy experts say farms may need layered solutions—from grid modernization and renewables to dependable standby power.

“Is it cost effective today. And what’s that look like into the future? And I think you can really understand the pricing and the risk is if you can’t run it and you can’t run your combine for a day or two or a week, or what’s that look like in the fall?” Newland added.

It is designed to be mobile-friendly and optimized for low-connectivity users.

“Anajia” means “observatory” in Wayuunaiki; the language most spoken amongst local indigenous communities in La Guajira.

The La Guajira region is predominantly Indigenous territory. It is sparsely populated and contains limited economic infrastructure. It is a deserted peninsula in the Northwest corner of Colombia jutting out into the Atlantic Ocean with consistent onshore trade winds. Accordingly, it is home to perhaps the world’s greatest source of untapped onshore wind potential; enough to power the entire country. The national government thus sets La Guajira at the center of its clean energy goals.

Federal law protects local communities from foreign resource extraction by requiring free, prior, and informed consent before companies can work in the region. Given a history of neglect and exploitation from the coal industry, local community members can lack trust with national government actors and large corporations.

Anajia Guajira aims to close information and communication gaps to prevent avoidable miscommunication among stakeholders. Local communities retain the right to deny the development of onshore wind in their particular community. Regardless of their decision, each community should be informed and share lessons with one another.

This tool is part of a larger effort by SEI to enhance the inclusive development of onshore wind in the region. Another key effort involves training local community members to serve as accredited advisors who are required by national law to be consulted before granting FPIC.

The US Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) on Nov. 25 proposed a rule extending the deadline for closing certain coal combustion residual (CCR) disposal sites. The proposal would apply to plants with coal-fired boilers set to permanently shut down after April 11, 2021, that currently dispose of CCR in unlined surface impoundments larger than 40 acres, and that lack alternative capacity either on-site or elsewhere to accept CCR and other waste in the interim. The proposed rule would give such plant operators an extra three years to cease operating the boilers and to complete the closure of the CCR disposal sites, postponing the closure deadline from Oct. 17, 2028, to Oct. 17, 2031. ""President Trump understands that maintaining baseload capacity is critical to providing affordable and reliable energy for all Americans,"" Steven Cook, principal deputy assistant administrator for the EPA's Office of Land and Emergency Management, said in a statement. ""Today's proposal offers flexibility for coal-fired power plants, so they have the time needed to meet requirements and can continue to help secure prosperity and [the] energy independence of our nation,"" Cook said. 11 PLANTS AFFECTED According to the EPA, the rule could affect 11 coal-fired power plants across the country. Three of the plants - Baldwin, Kincaid and Newton, all owned by Vistra Corp. - are in Illinois. Two other plants, Big Cajun II and Brame, are located in Louisiana, with another two, Coleto Creek and Welsh, in Texas. Other facilities that could be affected are the Intermountain Generating Facility in Utah, Miami Fort in Ohio, Naughton in Wyoming and R.M. Schahfer in Indiana. Vistra also owns Coleto Creek and Miami Fort. Operators of all the plants had previously applied for an exemption from an EPA requirement to close the coal ash ponds by 2021, but the agency has not yet ruled on those requests. The EPA said it would hold a virtual public hearing on the matter on Jan. 6, 2026, and would accept public comment through the following day. Environmental activists blasted the EPA's proposal to extend the closure deadlines. In a Nov. 25 statement, Earthjustice questioned the legality of the move and said it would lead to increased pollution. ""Coal power companies have been letting unlined coal ash ponds leak toxic pollutants into nearby water in violation of the law for more than a decade,"" Earthjustice Senior Counsel Lisa Evans said. ""In 2023, the EPA designated coal ash a national enforcement priority, but now this EPA is asking coal power companies how long they would like to continue dumping toxic coal ash into dangerous unlined ponds."" REGULATORY REFORM Since taking office in January, Trump has vowed to bolster the domestic coal industry and promote coal-fired power generation, including by unwinding environmental regulations established by former President Joe Biden's administration. As part of that process, the EPA earlier this year issued a final rule extending deadlines for coal plant operators to meet CCR groundwater monitoring requirements. In addition, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced in September that the agency would propose a rule extending compliance deadlines set by the Biden administration's Effluent Limitation Guidelines rule. That rule, finalized last year, set a ""zero-discharge limit"" for various pollutants, including heavy metals and nutrients such as nitrogen, in various coal plant wastewater streams. Zeldin also said the EPA would modify the rules governing implementation of its regional haze program to reduce the impact on coal plant operators. The regional haze program seeks to minimize the impact of haze on visibility in national parks and federally designated wilderness areas. Concurrent with those initiatives, the US Energy Department announced $625 million in new funding programs to bolster coal-fired generation, including $350 million aimed at recommissioning or modernizing coal plants to boost grid reliability. — Jason Fargo, jason.fargo@spglobal.com-- Edited by Michael Lustig, newsdesk@spglobal.com--Platts Electricity Alert--",https://s.tradingview.com/static/images/illustrations/news-story.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 16:01:29.113710

Approved by lawmakers in July, the bill faced strong criticism from environmentalists and parts of the administration, including the Ministry of the Environment.
Lula preserved the provision but sent a provisional presidential decree establishing a three-phase licensing model similar to the system currently in place.
When vetoing the licensing bill in August, Lula submitted the decree and a separate bill to correct provisions the Executive branch considered legally problematic.
According to Zé Vitor, lawmakers will now use the government’s bill to negotiate parts related to the upcoming veto override.","With COP30 behind them and tensions with the government rising in recent days, lawmakers are moving toward overturning all 63 vetoes issued by President Lula to the environmental licensing bill, according to the bill’s rapporteur, Congressman Zé Vitor (Liberal Party, PL, of Minas Gerais), a leading member of the agribusiness caucus.

On Tuesday, Senate President Davi Alcolumbre (Brazil Union of Amapá) convened a joint session of Congress for Thursday (27) to vote on the Lula administration’s vetoes related to the licensing bill and the State Debt Full Payment Program (Propag).

Until last week, the government had been trying to negotiate an agreement with Alcolumbre and Senator Tereza Cristina (Progressive Party, PP, of Mato Grosso do Sul), one of the top figures in the agribusiness caucus, to preserve at least some of the vetoes. But after President Lula nominated Jorge Messias to a seat on the Supreme Court, the relationship between Congress and the Lula administration deteriorated, paving the way for a complete override of the vetoes, according to sources involved in the talks.

Approved by lawmakers in July, the bill faced strong criticism from environmentalists and parts of the administration, including the Ministry of the Environment. Even before the floor vote, opposition parties were preparing to challenge the law in court.

“The tendency is to overturn every veto so we can ensure a robust and effective law. We’re confident about these provisions,” said Zé Vitor, who is also part of the rural caucus.

According to the congressman, however, the Parliamentary Front for Agriculture (FPA) and other groups opposed to the vetoes are debating whether to revive a point removed from the bill: the Special Environmental Permit (LAE) with a single-phase model—licensing in one step.

The LAE is a new permit created by Congress and championed by Alcolumbre to speed up the approval of projects deemed strategic for the country, provided they are cleared by a Government Council. Lula preserved the provision but sent a provisional presidential decree establishing a three-phase licensing model similar to the system currently in place.

When vetoing the licensing bill in August, Lula submitted the decree and a separate bill to correct provisions the Executive branch considered legally problematic.

The decree covers only the LAE and expires on December 5. Rural caucus members and other blocs had filed 833 amendments to the decree, effectively reinstating the original bill that had been partially vetoed. But with just a week left before it expires, and with the decree not yet approved by a special committee or by the Lower House or Senate plenaries, the strategy has shifted. According to Zé Vitor, lawmakers will now use the government’s bill to negotiate parts related to the upcoming veto override.

The bill submitted by the Executive branch alongside the decree attempts to address controversial provisions approved by Congress, such as the creation of the Permit by Adhesion and Commitment (LAC)—a self-declared permit that lawmakers had proposed for projects with medium environmental impact. The government kept the LAC only for low-impact activities.

Suely Araújo, public policy coordinator at the Climate Observatory, said the likely override of the vetoes would represent “absolutely unacceptable setbacks,” including widespread use of self-licensing, violations of Indigenous and quilombola rights, and disregard for the federal government’s regulatory authority.

“The next step will be immediate judicial action before the Supreme Court. Instead of legal certainty, they are creating uncertainty. The final version of the law will be challenged, as will many projects licensed under rules that conflict with the Constitution,” she warned.

Dispatch Constraints and Cost Recovery The DOE reasoned that Constellation’s Eddystone Generating Station—located in Eddystone, Pennsylvania—remains critical for grid reliability heading into the winter.
“Generator performance will be critical to maintaining reliability this winter,” said Michael Bryson, Senior Vice President of Operations.
While the assessment finds resource levels sufficient for typical winter conditions, MISO cautioned that extreme weather continues to pose serious reliability challenges.
PJM and MISO—the two regions affected by DOE’s latest emergency orders—are both categorized as normal risk in NERC’s 2025–2026 Winter Reliability Assessment, though NERC flags operational challenges that could emerge under extreme conditions.","The Department of Energy (DOE) extended its run of federal grid interventions into winter over the past week, issuing a Section 202(c) emergency order on Nov. 18 for Consumers Energy’s 1,420-MW J.H. Campbell coal plant in Michigan and another on Nov. 25 for Constellation’s 760-MW Eddystone Units 3 and 4 in southeastern Pennsylvania in a bid to keep both power plants available for dispatch through mid-to-late February 2026.

The orders direct the respective grid operators—the Midcontinent Independent System Operator (MISO) for Campbell and PJM Interconnection (PJM) for Eddystone—to ensure the plants remain available for operation and to employ economic dispatch to minimize costs to ratepayers. The latest orders—which mark the third round for each plant since spring—push federal intervention past the nine-month mark for Campbell and into early 2026 for Eddystone, well beyond their initially scheduled May 2025 retirements.

In its Nov. 25 PJM announcement, Energy Secretary Chris Wright said the order “is needed to strengthen grid reliability and will help provide affordable, reliable, and secure power when Americans need it most.” In the Nov. 19 MISO announcement, Wright cited “the last administration’s dangerous energy subtraction policies targeting reliable and affordable energy sources,” adding that “Americans deserve access to affordable, reliable and secure energy regardless of whether the wind is blowing or the sun is shining, especially in dangerously cold weather.”

The measures reflect yet another facet in a broader institutional pivot within the DOE. On Nov. 20, 2025, notably, the agency unveiled an updated organizational chart that elevates the Office of Cybersecurity, Energy Security and Emergency Response (CESER)— the office that issued the new Section 202(c) orders—while creating new offices for Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy, Energy Dominance Financing, and Artificial Intelligence and Quantum. Compared to the DOE’s 2024 structure, the realignment has effectively eliminated the Office of Energy Justice and Equity, the Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations, and the Grid Deployment Office. The move has seemingly sidelined the Biden administration’s clean-energy infrastructure focus while consolidating the Trump administration’s mission around fossil fuel preservation, emergency grid management, and advanced technology.

Dispatch Constraints and Cost Recovery

The DOE reasoned that Constellation’s Eddystone Generating Station—located in Eddystone, Pennsylvania—remains critical for grid reliability heading into the winter. Units 3 and 4, each rated at 380 MW, are subcritical steam units capable of burning natural gas or oil and had been scheduled for retirement on May 31, 2025. The plant proved vital during the summer, generating over 26,000 MWh during heat waves, and now stands as a key dispatchable asset in PJM’s increasingly winter-peaking system, the DOE said. Citing a widening gap between retiring generation and new capacity, the DOE echoed PJM’s warnings of “growing resource adequacy concerns” and pointed to the difficulty of restarting oil-fired units once decommissioned as further rationale for keeping the plant online through February 2026.

For Consumers Energy’s J.H. Campbell plant in West Olive, Michigan, the DOE extended a similar order, requiring the 1,420-MW coal-fired facility to remain available through February 17. Once targeted for early retirement, Campbell supplied an average of 509,000 MWh per month this summer, which helped MISO manage dozens of grid alerts triggered by heat, outages, and limited reserves, the DOE claimed. The DOE warned that older dispatchable units are retiring faster than new ones can come online, and despite recent gas investments, cited North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) data showing heightened risks of energy shortfalls in both summer and winter. Restarting a shuttered coal unit like Campbell, the agency noted, could take months—making continuous operation the only viable safeguard for near-term reliability.

Both orders direct the grid operators to employ “economic dispatch” to minimize costs to ratepayers, with daily notification requirements to DOE documenting compliance. Operations are constrained to times and parameters determined by each RTO to minimize adverse environmental impacts, though the orders do not waive obligations to pay emissions fees, allowances, or offsets that occur during emergency operation. All operations must comply with applicable environmental requirements “to the maximum extent feasible” while remaining consistent with emergency conditions, and DOE requires operational updates from both RTOs by mid-December 2025.​

One significant limitation in both orders is that the plants “shall not be considered capacity resources” under Section 202(c) emergency dispatch. That designation prevents them from clearing future capacity auctions or being counted toward resource adequacy requirements once the orders expire, and it appears to be designed so that the emergency intervention does not become a permanent market fixture. Utilities are directed to file tariff revisions or waivers at FERC to effectuate the orders, with rate recovery available under Section 824a(c) of the Federal Power Act.​

The orders also appear to acknowledge the practical difficulties of restarting retired fossil units. For Campbell, DOE notes that any stop-and-start operation creates heating and cooling cycles that could cause failure requiring 30 to 60 days to repair, and that disassembly or other terminal actions would complicate resumption. Similarly, for Eddystone, DOE emphasizes that once oil-fired units are retired, resuming operations would be difficult due to employment, contract, and permitting challenges. Both utilities are granted sufficient time for an orderly ramp-down following the expiration of the orders, consistent with industry practices.​

Brewing Legal Challenges

However, the orders have already drawn sharp criticism and legal challenges. Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel filed a motion to stay DOE’s third order for Consumers Energy’s Campbell coal plant on Nov. 20, 2025, asserting that the directive is “arbitrary and illegal” and based on an “outdated reliability assessment report to fabricate the emergency.” Nessel also filed petitions for review to the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit on the prior two Section 202(c) orders that halted Campbell’s planned retirement, though no rulings have yet been issued.​

“DOE is using outdated information to fabricate an emergency, despite the fact that the truth is publicly available for everyone to see,” Nessel said. “DOE must end its unlawful tactics to keep this coal plant running when it has already cost millions upon millions of dollars. My office will continue to fight back against these arbitrary orders and ensure residents aren’t forced to foot the bill for these unreasonable costs.”

Consumers Energy disclosed in its latest earnings report that during the initial 90-day J.H. Campbell emergency-order period (May 20–Aug. 20, 2025), the utility incurred a net financial impact of $53 million after accounting for $67 million in MISO market revenues. For the second 90-day order period (Aug. 20–Nov 19, 2025) through Sept. 30, it reported a net compliance cost of $27 million after applying $17 million in MISO revenues. To address regional cost allocation, Consumers filed a complaint at FERC in June 2025 seeking modification of the MISO tariff to establish a cost-recovery mechanism. FERC granted the complaint in August 2025 and ordered MISO to submit a revised tariff. MISO filed its compliance proposal in September 2025, but FERC approval remains pending.

Grid Operators Brace for Tight Margins Despite Adequate Winter Capacity

PJM, the grid operator for 13 states and D.C., said in its Nov. 3, 2025, Winter Outlook that it expects to have 180,800 MW of available resources to serve a projected peak of 145,700 MW—2,000 MW above last winter’s record. While sufficient to meet demand under typical conditions, PJM warned that its reserve margin has narrowed to 7,500 MW, down from 8,700 MW the prior year, and that poor generator performance could leave the system exposed during extreme cold. The organization is implementing several preparedness measures, including unannounced generator tests, expanded site inspections, and enhanced coordination with gas pipelines. “Generator performance will be critical to maintaining reliability this winter,” said Michael Bryson, Senior Vice President of Operations.

MISO, which operates the grid across 15 states and parts of Canada, projected in its Nov. 14, 2024, Winter Readiness Outlook that winter demand could surpass 107 GW, with 122 GW of supply expected to be available under normal grid and outage conditions. While the assessment finds resource levels sufficient for typical winter conditions, MISO cautioned that extreme weather continues to pose serious reliability challenges. “Situational awareness is critical for managing the impact of extreme weather events,” said JT Smith, executive director of Market Operations. The forecast highlights regional weather variation—normal in the North, warmer in the Central region, and drier in the South—and emphasizes the importance of seasonal planning as the grid transitions away from conventional generation. MISO, notably, also pointed to the benefits of its seasonal resource adequacy construct but stressed the need for ongoing stakeholder engagement and improved tools to maintain operator visibility as the system evolves.

NERC Warns of Winter Vulnerabilities

In its Nov. 18–released Winter Reliability Assessment, the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) reinforced DOE’s concerns, warning that large swaths of the North American grid face elevated risk of electricity shortfalls if extreme cold grips the continent. While resources are expected to be sufficient under normal conditions, NERC suggested that demand has outpaced resource growth, adding 20.2 GW of forecasted peak load compared to only 9.4 GW in additional capacity, and could spike further in deep freezes.

PJM and MISO—the two regions affected by DOE’s latest emergency orders—are both categorized as normal risk in NERC’s 2025–2026 Winter Reliability Assessment, though NERC flags operational challenges that could emerge under extreme conditions.

In PJM, NERC notes that rising peak demand and winter outage patterns could tighten available reserves during severe cold. The assessment says the region “will need to monitor resource performance and deliverability throughout the winter period, especially during high-risk hours where solar is unavailable, and gas constraints could emerge.” PJM’s modeling shows that while the region can reliably meet its 134.8-GW winter peak forecast, extreme conditions could push load above 144 GW, significantly compressing reserve margins once forced outages and derates typical of winter weather are applied.

In MISO, NERC points to similar vulnerabilities in the North and Central subregions. Winter peak demand could reach 102.2 GW under an extreme scenario, compared to 97 GW under the region’s 50/50 forecast. NERC warns that extreme cold, low wind output, and fuel constraints may increase reliance on non-firm imports and emergency demand response.

The report shows the widespread uptake of clean energy technologies by Bay Staters all across the state. To highlight our findings and to show how these technologies work in practice, we organized a clean energy home tour.

The report focuses on action by individuals and families to adopt clean energy, but communities play an important role as well. Lynn Griesemer, Amherst Town Council President, highlighted all the work Amherst has done to help residents save energy. “Our Director of Sustainability, Stephanie Ciccarello has done great work around heat pumps and gaining access to state funding to support local programs,” said Griesmer. “We have our goals that reflect goals of the state, and I am, as many people are, discouraged about federal investments, but I am very encouraged with the strong investment of the state in environmental issues and particularly in saving energy.”

Griesmer also talked about the Community Choice Aggregation program (CCA) that Amherst is leading in collaboration with Northampton and Pelham. Many Massachusetts cities and towns have created CCAs, which purchase electricity for their residents on an opt-out basis. According to the National Renewable Energy Laboratory, more than 470,000 Bay State residents as of 2024 have clean electricity purchased on their behalf by CCAs.

Heather’s clean energy home

Heather, an Amherst resident, has consistently made clean energy improvements to her home. For her there are so many benefits of keeping a clean energy home including health, comfort and knowing that she is making an impact on the environment. She enthusiastically showed us the variety of improvements she made to her home.

“There is not a clean energy improvement that hasn’t also made my life better,” said Heather, while highlighting the safety benefits of her induction stove. “You should try any induction stove, expensive or cheap, as they are just so much better than gas alternatives. They heat up faster, are safer and your home is so much healthier when you’re not burning something inside.”

With the home being fully electrified, and around half of her power coming from her solar panels on her roof, the family is able to charge their EV and plug-in hybrid in their garage.

In state waters, there are three offshore oil platforms — one off of Santa Barbara County and two in the Huntington Beach area.
According to a November 2021 report from the California Energy Commission, offshore production from facilities in federal waters equated to just 1% of all crude oil processed in California refineries.
Within state waters, the report said offshore facilities accounted for about 6% of total California production from 2011 through 2020.","A bipartisan group of lawmakers on the state and federal levels spoke out Tuesday against plans by the Trump administration for new offshore drilling in the Golden State.

“There’s very little support for drilling on our coastline,” California Assemblymember Laurie Davies, R-Laguna Niguel, said at a news conference in Solana Beach. “If we need to support or reject offshore oil drilling in the 74th Assembly District (in Orange County), it’s not gonna be just no, it’s gonna be hell no.”

Rep. Mike Levin, D-San Juan Capistrano, called on his colleagues in Congress to pass legislation he has introduced that would prevent new leasing for the exploration, development, or production of oil or natural gas in federal waters along the Southern California coast, from San Diego to the northern border of San Luis Obispo County.

“We’re going to continue to fight this legislatively and legally, and from a communications perspective and any other tools that we’ve got in the toolkit,” Levin said.

Last week, the U.S. Department of the Interior announced a five-year plan that included proposals for six offshore leases in federal waters off the coast of California. The southern-most potential lease site would extend from San Diego to San Luis Obispo.

If enacted, the move would mark the first new oil and gas leases in federal waters off the coast of California since 1984.

The draft map also includes expanding offshore drilling in Alaska and along the eastern portion of the Gulf of Mexico, renamed the Gulf of America by President Donald Trump via executive order earlier this year.

Before any lease sales are finalized, the Department of the Interior will host a 60-day comment period in which members of the public can make their voices heard.

There are already 23 oil and gas production facilities in federal waters off the coast of California, according to the State Lands Commission, although some of them are no longer profitable to maintain. Twenty-two of those produce oil and gas, while the other is a processing facility.

In state waters, there are three offshore oil platforms — one off of Santa Barbara County and two in the Huntington Beach area. Earlier this year, a facility called Platform Esther off Seal Beach was decommissioned by the Lands Commission.

There’s also a set of artificial islands that produce oil, including the THUMS Islands in San Pedro Bay near Long Beach.

According to a November 2021 report from the California Energy Commission, offshore production from facilities in federal waters equated to just 1% of all crude oil processed in California refineries. Within state waters, the report said offshore facilities accounted for about 6% of total California production from 2011 through 2020.

Interior Secretary Doug Burgum signed the proposal to expand offshore drilling last week as part of the Trump administration’s larger efforts for “unleashing American energy.”

“The Biden administration slammed the brakes on offshore oil and gas leasing and crippled the long-term pipeline of America’s offshore production,” Burgum said in a statement. “By moving forward with the development of a robust, forward-thinking leasing plan, we are ensuring that America’s offshore industry stays strong, our workers stay employed and our nation remains energy dominant for decades to come.”

Californians pay the highest average price for a gallon of gasoline in the country. According to AAA, the average price in San Diego on Tuesday stood at $4.787, compared to the national average of $3.055.

“We all want to see energy costs come down but this is not the way to do that,” Levin said. “The amount of harm that this could do for the de minimis amount of new oil that you would produce, even under the best estimates from the fossil fuel industry … (is) simply not worth it.”

Levin’s bill, HR 2862, is called the Southern California Coast and Ocean Protection Act. Brought forth in April, it’s awaiting a hearing in the House Natural Resources Committee.

Levin, along with seven other Democrats, introduced the bill that seeks limits in states such as North Carolina, Florida, Rhode Island and New Jersey, as well as legislation that would extend drilling bans along the entire coast of California.

Davies pointed to Senate Bill 237 — recently passed by the California Legislature — as a way to give California drivers some relief at the pump. It included provisions aimed at increasing crude oil production in the state and eased permitting requirements in Kern County, the heart of the state’s Oil Patch.

By Gaea Cabico, Sentient

In the United States, climate change is polarizing, but one environmental challenge draws rare bipartisan agreement: food waste.

Even as the Trump administration rolls back key climate and environmental protections, in July, senators from both parties reintroduced legislation to simplify food expiration labels — one longtime driver of unnecessary waste. In September, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency launched a national initiative to connect food donors with communities and keep edible food out of landfills. Under the Biden administration, the U.S. unveiled a national strategy to reduce food waste and expand recycling of organic waste.

Despite this rare consensus, progress has been slow. In 2023, the U.S. still squandered roughly a third of its food supply, according to the food waste nonprofit ReFED. Food waste is responsible for 8-10% of all global emissions — about five times the emissions from the entire aviation industry. The United Nations’ Food and Agriculture Organization estimates that if food waste were a country, it would be the world’s third-largest emitter of greenhouse gasses, after China and the U.S.

Experts tell Sentient that the problem persists because political follow-through is limited, climate action still focuses heavily on energy and transportation and ultimately, food waste itself is difficult to tackle. It occurs at every stage of the supply chain, from farms to fridges, making comprehensive action essential.

It’s also a missed opportunity, especially since wasting food is widely seen as wrong. “Nobody wakes up wanting to waste food,” said Dana Gunders, president of ReFED, during a summit at New York City Climate Week on Sept. 22.

Many people don’t realize that food waste reduction is a crucial and often overlooked climate strategy. Addressing food loss and waste has enormous climate potential, “but it’s still an underexplored area,” says Brian Lipinski, head researcher on food loss and waste at the environmental research nonprofit World Resources Institute.

The climate cost of wasted food

Most food waste happens in homes, restaurants and retailers, but nearly all of its climate impact is already baked in by the time the food is thrown away. Every piece of wasted food squanders all the emissions that went into producing and transporting that food.

About 92% of food waste emissions happen during food production — when land is converted from forests or grassland to farmland, when resources are used to grow crops or raise livestock, during transport in which most vehicles run on diesel or gasoline and during cold storage. Once that food is tossed, those emissions are wasted. Only 8% of food waste emissions come from the disposal process.

When people are wasting food, “in many ways, we are throwing out a lot of water, a lot of land, a lot of fertilizer, natural habitat, a lot of things,” Paul West, a senior scientist at the climate nonprofit Project Drawdown, tells Sentient.

Fruits and vegetables make up almost half — 44% — of all U.S. food waste, according to ReFED. Meat and seafood, though also quick to spoil, are wasted less often because they are more expensive.

But wasting even a small portion of a burger has far greater environmental impact than wasting the same amount of fruits, vegetables or chicken, says West. That’s because producing beef requires vast amounts of land, water and fertilizer, and cattle also release methane — a short-lived but powerful greenhouse gas — with each cow burping about 220 pounds annually.

“If we are going to eat beef and dairy, make sure not to waste it,” says West.

Why prevention matters most

Experts see reducing food loss and waste as one of the most impactful and practical ways to slow the warming of the planet.

Project Drawdown calls it an “emergency brake” solution — a measure that can rapidly slash emissions using tools we already have, without waiting for new technologies or nature-based fixes. Other such measures include halting deforestation and shifting away from meat and dairy.

“Preventing food from becoming waste is really the most effective solution, not only from an emissions perspective,” says Minerva Ringland, senior manager of the climate and insights team at ReFED, “but it’s also saving the most money and keeping everyone fed as much as possible.”

In the United States, 35% of food waste comes from households, while 18% comes from manufacturing and 17% from food service, and 24% happens on farms. Household waste is high because people often buy more than what they need, especially in bulk, misinterpret date labels, prepare too much food and may not know how to store or repurpose ingredients. Limited access to composting programs also makes it harder for consumers to avoid landfills.

Experts suggest households can curb waste by planning meals, buying only what’s needed, using smaller portions and repurposing leftovers. Emily Broad Leib, director of the Harvard Food Law and Policy Clinic, says the U.S. needs a national consumer awareness campaign, similar to the United Kingdom’s Love Food, Hate Waste campaign. She notes that the Biden administration set aside funding to develop such a campaign, but it has since stalled. Many people don’t realize how significant the issue of food waste is, she says — not just for the environment but for their own finances.

But reducing food waste at home is not just about telling people to be more careful or intentional about their purchases. After all, food waste is rarely intentional. Maybe you buy an ingredient for one recipe and never use the rest, or forget the leftovers in your fridge and they go bad. Lipinski says that retailers and food service providers can help consumers avoid waste by offering smaller portions, clearer guidance and smarter packaging.

Government agencies can lead by example in reducing food waste in their dining halls, federal buildings, schools and military bases by requiring vendors to donate surplus food, Broad Leib suggests.

These strategies are worth the effort because preventing food waste at its source offers climate benefits about 10 times higher than other strategies since it reduces the need for producing additional food.

Beyond prevention, the EPA identifies donation and upcycling — turning food into new products — as the most preferred approaches. However, 40% of donated food still goes to waste, and both strategies require energy for transport, storage and processing.

According to the EPA, using wasted food as animal feed, leaving crops unharvested, composting and anaerobic digestion do much less to offset the environmental impacts of food production than preventing food waste in the first place.

Where most wasted food ends up

Most of the country’s surplus food still ends up in landfills, compost facilities, incinerators or anaerobic digesters, according to ReFED. Only about 2% is donated. Food makes up about nearly a quarter of combusted municipal solid waste that ends up in landfills.

In landfills, food waste decays and releases methane, a gas 80 times more potent than carbon dioxide at trapping heat over a 20-year period. Landfills produce 17% of human-related methane emissions in the U.S., after oil and gas and livestock digestion. A majority of the methane released from landfills in the U.S. comes from food waste, according to the EPA. A separate analysis by ReFED estimates that surplus food generates nearly 3 million metric tons of methane each year.

Improving landfill management is one of Project Drawdown’s highly recommended climate solutions. To capture or reduce methane emissions, some landfills install systems that divert landfill gas so that it can be burned for energy and sold to industries or utilities, helping replace fossil fuels. Methane that cannot be used for energy is typically burned off using flares.

Another approach uses biocovers — layers of organic material that foster bacteria that convert methane into carbon dioxide and water. Leak detection and repair programs can monitor methane leaks using drones, satellites or on-site sensors, which helps operators spot and fix leaks.

Encouraging composting instead of putting food scraps in landfills also helps. But West says that while composting and landfill management matter, “you’ll have many times more impact if you stop the waste in the first place.”

A change to these policies could help curb food waste

For something so uncontroversial, food waste has proven remarkably hard to fix.

In 2015, the U.S. set an ambitious goal of halving food loss and waste by 2030 — a target experts say is quickly becoming out of reach. No state is on track to meet the target, researchers from ReFED and University of California Davis found in an analysis published in January. They warned that food waste levels are unlikely to fall without stronger state and federal action focused on prevention measures such as standardized date labeling, food rescue and repurposing. Current policies, they noted, focus too narrowly on recycling methods like composting rather than addressing the problem across the entire food system.

Standardized date labeling is one of the most cost-effective fixes, ReFED argues. In the U.S., 6% of all food waste is due to confusion over date labels. Many U.S. consumers don’t know the specifics, but there is no national standard for date labels. Some products have “Sell by” dates, others have “Best before” dates, and still others have “Use by” dates — and they often mean different things in different states. The dates on packaging are “not designed for consumers to understand clearly,” Ringwald says.

As a result, many people toss food after the printed date, assuming it is unsafe to eat. This confusion leads Americans to discard about 3 billion pounds of perfectly fine food worth $7 billion each year.

“Sell by,” “Best before,” and “Use by” dates usually indicate how long a product will stay at peak quality, not whether it is still safe to eat. According to the USDA, the “Best if used by” or “Best before” date shows when the product will taste or look its best. “Sell by” indicates how long a store should keep a product on the shelf, and is meant for communication between manufacturers and retailers, but is often mistaken by consumers for an expiration date.“Use by” is the last date the product is at its best quality.

If you have a can of beans in your cupboard with a “Sell by,” “Use by,” or “Best before” date, it does not necessarily mean you should throw it once that date passes. ReFED says that many foods such as canned goods, nuts and dry packaged goods can remain edible past the printed date.

To address this, ReFED advocates for a two-label system: “Best if used by” and “Use by.” “Best if used by” indicates product quality: it may not taste its best, but it is still safe to consume. This label is recommended for use for canned goods, bread, raw meats, frozen foods and pasteurized products. Meanwhile, “Use by” would apply to highly perishable items or those that pose a risk to safety over time like deli meats, unpasteurized milk and soft cheeses, and smoked seafood. These products should be eaten by the date on the package and tossed afterward.

If passed, the bill reintroduced in the Senate would make that standard nationwide. Similar measures have been introduced in the past but have not advanced. ReFED estimates that standardizing labels could keep at least 425,000 tons of food — or 708 million meals — out of landfills each year.

“Even though the issue is something that both Republican and Democratic administrations have cared about and worked on, there’s a lot of momentum that gets lost in between administrations,” Broad Leib says. The lack of sustained policies, she adds, has prevented the U.S. from making meaningful progress in reducing food waste.

‘Pockets of progress’

Still, there are signs of progress, especially at the state level. That’s probably where we’ll see more momentum under the Trump administration, says Lipinski.

In 2024, California signed the country’s first legislation to adopt a clear two-label system on food products. Starting July 1, 2026, the law will also ban the use of “Sell by” dates.

Another is the implementation of state-level mandates that prohibit sending commercial food waste to landfills. States including California, Connecticut, Rhode Island, Vermont and Massachusetts have enacted such bans. However, a study published last year found these policies have largely fallen short — except in Massachusetts, which succeeded in reducing the amount of food waste sent to landfills by 13%.

Researchers found that Massachusetts has the country’s most extensive food waste composting network, making it easy and low-cost for businesses and households to follow the ban. The state’s rules are straightforward, with no exemptions, and authorities conduct far more inspections and issue more fines for violations than in other states. These differences point the way toward better implementation in other states.

Experts say that stronger incentives for grocers and restaurants to donate food could also make a significant difference. Some states like California now require some commercial establishments to donate edible food that they would otherwise throw out.

“We’re seeing pockets of progress everywhere,” says Ringwald. Because food waste is a complex problem, she adds, “We’re going to need a lot of solutions.” The key is turning these scattered successes into coordinated and sustained action across the supply chain, which can save money, slash emissions and put food on tables.",https://www.theinvadingsea.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/food-waste-banner.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 19:59:16.755103

Global Light Vehicle Sales

In October, the Global Light Vehicle (LV) selling rate posted its second strongest month of the year at 96 million units per year. The market grew 3% year-over-year, as sales reached 8.2 million units globally. Approximately 75 million vehicles have been sold year-to-date—up 5% from the same period in 2024.

Key markets recorded mixed results. In the U.S., sales declined notably due to the expiration of EV tax credits. Meanwhile, sales in Western Europe continued to advance thanks to new incentives supporting electrification and minor improvements in consumer confidence. In China, sales posted “a record result” for the month, as consumers rushed to purchase vehicles before the NEV tax discount decreases next year.

“November sales are expected to decrease 3.9% year-over-year. In part, this is a reflection of a relatively strong month in November 2024. However, tariff effects and economic uncertainty are expected to play a part in subduing demand in Europe and North America, while China could see a slight slowdown as subsidies ease. The global selling rate is expected to reach 92.7 million units in November, down from a rate of 95.8 million units in November 2024,” explains David Oakley, manager of Americas vehicle sales forecasts at GlobalData.

Overall, he says global trade stabilized slightly over the past month, noting “some progress” in resolving the Nexperia chip crisis.

“Despite uncertainty remaining over the health of the global economy, we see total 2025 sales at 91.4 million units, up by around 200,000 from our forecast a month ago and representing growth of 3% year over year,” he continues.

U.S. New Vehicle Market

Total new-vehicle sales for November 2025, including retail and non-retail transactions, are projected to reach 1,255,900—a 5.2% decrease year-over-year, according to a joint forecast from J.D. Power and GlobalData.

“November’s results reflect another notable—yet anticipated—decline in the new vehicle sales pace, driven largely by the pull-ahead of electric vehicle (EV) purchases prior to the expiration of federal EV tax credits on September 30th. That expiration prompted many shoppers to accelerate buying decisions, resulting in a surge in EV sales that temporarily inflated the overall industry sales pace,” says Thomas King, president of the data and analytics division at J.D. Power.

Two months later, King says the industry continues to feel the effect of accelerated purchases. EVs are expected to account for just 6% of new vehicle retail sales in November, which is consistent with the month prior but well below the 12.9% recorded in September.

As a result, “Automakers are recalibrating pricing strategies following the expiration of EV tax credits, tariff dynamics and evolving fuel economy requirements, along with the transition to the new model year,” he says, noting these factors create some distortions in typical seasonal discount patterns.

For example, discounts on EVs are expected to average $11,869 in November, up $260 year-over-year but down $928 compared to October 2025. Discounts on non-EVs are estimated at $2,960, an increase of $161 from a year ago.

Key Takeaways, Courtesy of J.D. Power:

Retail buyers are on pace to spend $46.8 billion on new vehicles, down $3.2 billion year-over-year.

Internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles are expected to account for 77.5% of new vehicle retail sales, an increase of 2.3% from a year ago. Plug-in hybrid vehicles (PHEV), electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid electric vehicles (HEV) are estimated at 1.1%, 6% and 14.5% of new vehicle retail sales, respectively.

Trucks/SUVs are on pace to account for 82.6% of new vehicle retail sales, up one percentage point year-over-year.

Leasing is expected to account for 20.5% of sales this month, down 2.7% from a year ago.

The average new vehicle retail transaction price in November is estimated at $46,029, up $722 year-over-year.

Average monthly finance payments are on pace to hit $760, up $19 from a year ago. The average interest rate for new-vehicle loans is 6.05%, down 0.27% year-over-year.

Total retailer profit per unit—which includes vehicle gross plus finance and insurance income—is expected to be $2,161, up $6 year-over-year but down $54 compared to last month.

Fleet sales should total 197,358 units in November, down 7.5% year-over-year. Fleet volume is expected to account for 15.7% of total light-vehicle sales, down 0.4% from a year ago.

Looking ahead, “The industry enters the holiday sales season facing a mix of affordability challenges, evolving incentive strategies and lingering effects from the EV pull-ahead earlier this year. While interest rates have eased and used-vehicle values remain strong—providing some support for trade-in equity—the number of leases set to expire in December is projected to be more than 15% lower than the same period a year ago and 50% lower than in 2023, thus limiting the typical year-end boost,” King says.

“Automakers are expected to maintain disciplined pricing and restrained incentives, particularly in non-EV segments, as they balance profitability with the need to stimulate demand. How aggressively manufacturers choose to adjust discounting and promotional activity during December will be critical in shaping the close of 2025,” he continues.

U.S. Used Market

The Manheim Used Vehicle Value Index (MUVVI) registered 205.0, reflecting a 1.1 % increase in wholesale used-vehicle prices (adjusted for mix, mileage and seasonality) during the first 15 days of November compared to October; however, the index posted a 0.2% decline year-over-year.

“Wholesale depreciation rates were elevated in October, burning off a bit of the higher valuation levels seen most of this year. In early November, we’ve observed more moderate trends, which was a glimmer of what we saw right at the last week of October. So far this month, our estimates for retail sales show a slightly higher pace of sales, a great piece of information given how little economic data is out there right now,” says Jeremy Robb, interim chief economist at Cox Automotive.

Later this summer, when DOE sought proposals for the government’s plans to build AI data centers on federal land, the agency indicated an explicit interest in geothermal.
The Office of Geothermal Technology, previously a sub-office within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, merged with the Office of Fossil Energy (previously the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management) to become the Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office.
Tim Latimer, the CEO of the enhanced geothermal company Fervo, is extremely optimistic about the agency’s restructuring.
But exactly how much support LPO — and DOE more broadly — will be able to offer to geothermal still isn’t entirely clear.","For advanced geothermal, the first year of the second Trump term has been a good one. The tech’s rise into political prominence began last November, when then-nominee Trump announced former fracking executive Chris Wright, former Liberty Energy CEO, as his pick to lead the Department of Energy.

Wright was a strong proponent of geothermal prior to his nomination — Liberty, for example, is an investor in enhanced geothermal company Fervo — and emphasized his support for the technology during his confirmation hearing. His nomination was met with optimism by geothermal advocates who hoped it would bring additional funding and focus to the sector. Stakeholders also hoped that, with Wright in such a prominent role, the administration would preserve technology-neutral tax credits, and tackle permitting reform.

If the last 11 months are anything to go by, that early optimism appears to have been well placed; geothermal is well on the way to getting what it wanted from the Trump administration.

In July, when the GOP’s “One Big Beautiful Bill” took a hacksaw to the Inflation Reduction Act, geothermal was largely spared, thanks in part to Wright’s own advocacy efforts. Later this summer, when DOE sought proposals for the government’s plans to build AI data centers on federal land, the agency indicated an explicit interest in geothermal.

And earlier this month, geothermal got something of a promotion amid DOE’s structural reshuffling. The Office of Geothermal Technology, previously a sub-office within the Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy, merged with the Office of Fossil Energy (previously the Office of Fossil Energy and Carbon Management) to become the Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Energy Office.

Tim Latimer, the CEO of the enhanced geothermal company Fervo, is extremely optimistic about the agency’s restructuring. “The thing we’ve always complained about with geothermal is not anybody being against us, but people not being for us, and being forgotten about,” Latimer told Latitude Media. The reorganization, he added, “is a very clear signal of where this administration’s priorities are.”

The geothermal industry doesn’t expect to be supported at the same level as a resource like nuclear, he conceded. But nonetheless, Latimer is hopeful that policymakers are starting to see geothermal as a resource that can advance faster with less money: “You’re starting to see a push for parity there with geothermal catching up [to nuclear] from a policy standpoint.”

Geothermal’s turn at LPO?

Over the last year, the Trump administration has doubled down on federal funding and support for nuclear energy via a series of executive orders, the re-issuance of funding opportunities, a a “strategic partnership” with nuclear giant Westinghouse to build a series of new reactors with at least $80 billion in federal funding — though exactly how and when that latter funding will be spent remains an open question.

Geothermal won’t necessarily need those same tools or the same dollar figure, Latimer said, because “it’s at a much lower cost and lower risk than nuclear development.”

One financing tool Fervo is particularly excited about is the Loan Programs Office, recently rebranded the Energy Dominance Financing Office.

“The Loan Programs Office has always been a really important way to catalyze deployment of novel technologies, and I’d be expecting that, given that DOE leadership and the administration have made clear that geothermal is a priority, that there’s probably a lot of available funding mechanisms through that office,” Latimer said. “I’m very bullish on the idea that the existing authorization through the Loan Programs Office will be utilized to a great extent.”

LPO, once responsible for deploying $400 billion in federal funding, has seen a rotating door of directors, massive DOGE-mandated staff cuts, and at least one canceled Biden-era loan.

Title 17, LPO’s flagship program designed to support the deployment of innovative clean energy technologies, is likely the strongest fit for geothermal projects seeking financing. In fact, the office has already inked at least one deal for a geothermal project under that authority; in February 2011, the office issued a $97 million loan guarantee to finance a 22 megawatt geothermal power plant in Oregon.

But exactly how much support LPO — and DOE more broadly — will be able to offer to geothermal still isn’t entirely clear.

In its budget recommendations for DOE for FY26, published earlier this week, the Senate Energy and Water committee ordered LPO to “prioritize projects that expand the domestic supply of critical minerals” for Title 17 funding.

The recommendation maintains the administration’s proposed expenses, but is much more optimistic than the White House about the office’s returns. The Senate expects LPO to collect around $240 million from Title 17 loans next year, well above the $170 million in last year’s budget, and the nearly $92 million in the White House budget.

That higher number suggests lawmakers expect increased Title 17 deal activity, explained former LPO congressional affairs advisor Kyle Winslow. The Senate also declined to provide additional credit subsidies for nuclear, and to narrow loan authority to just a few technology categories, Winslow noted in his breakdown of the budget.

The budget proposal doesn’t reflect the recent restructuring of DOE offices, but in general, geothermal doesn’t appear to have been spared from the widespread cuts it proposes. Nuclear, meanwhile, was one of the only energy programs insulated.

In fact, the proposal actually contains a (gentle) rebuke of how DOE has been approaching the technology: “The committee is concerned the Department is solely focused on development of geothermal systems to generate electricity and is not appropriately considering the development of deep, direct use geothermal systems as a source of heat production.” (Geothermal is widely used as a source of heat in places like Iceland and New Zealand, though those applications are still nascent in the U.S.)

At the same time, the proposal encourages DOE to conduct geothermal “data acquisition” in regions where mapping of subsurface resources are sparse; it allocates funding including $100 million for “enhanced geothermal system demonstrations” and $75 million for research and development.

The Senate also endorses DOE spending on a few key areas that align closely with secondary commercial goals for geothermal companies, namely data center integration and underground storage.",https://www.latitudemedia.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Latitude-1920px-32-Image-2025-11-26T124222.195.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 15:00:34.754294

Under those provisions of the Clean Water Act, the Regional Water Quality Control Boards’ review and permitting process is more streamlined.
Once published in the Federal Register, the proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days.","Key Points

The U.S. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a joint proposal updating the definition of “Waters of the United States,” which will be open for public comment after its official publishing in the Federal Register.

The proposed rule would narrow the definition of Waters of the United States and include exclusions for determining whether waters and wetlands are subject to permitting under the federal Clean Water Act.

While viewed as a significant deregulation that could impact sensitive environments throughout the United States, the proposed rule’s deregulatory impact in California would be more limited, given California’s broader regulation of Waters of the State under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.

On November 17, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers together announced a proposed rule updating the definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS), in another effort to align with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision.

As we previously discussed, the WOTUS rule was revised twice under the Biden administration, once in March 2023 to update the definition prior to the Sackett decision, and again in August 2023 to conform to Sackett by eliminating the “significant nexus” test that the decision invalidated.

This most recent revision defines key terms for determining which waters are subject to the Clean Water Act, such as “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary.” It also addresses key exclusions by adding an exclusion for groundwater and clarifying pre-existing exclusions for ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems. The EPA published a fact sheet on its website that covers the most notable of these proposed changes.

This proposed rule’s effect, if finalized, will have less of a deregulatory effect in California than in other states, however, given California’s expanded regulation of “Waters of the State” through the Porter-Cologne Act. The Porter-Cologne Act leaves few, if any, California waters unregulated. If anything, this narrowing of the scope of WOTUS may increase regulatory complexity in California by requiring, in some instances, that regulated entities obtain a Waste Discharge Requirements permit under the Porter-Cologne Act rather than a general permit available under the Clean Water Act. Individual permits under the Porter-Cologne Act may lead to a more burdensome review process compared to permitting under sections 404 & 401 of the federal Clean Water Act. Under those provisions of the Clean Water Act, the Regional Water Quality Control Boards’ review and permitting process is more streamlined.

Once published in the Federal Register, the proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days. The EPA’s pre-publication notice advises that the rule will appear on the Government Printing Office’s govinfo website and on Regulations.gov in Docket No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.",https://jdsupra-static.s3.amazonaws.com/profile-images/og.16364_5428.gif,N,,2025-11-26 19:01:12.130185

From automotive to steel, chemicals to solar, European industry is losing ground to global rivals. Millions of good jobs are at risk as the continent’s industrial base teeters on the brink.

IndustriAll Europe demands a change in narrative from European leaders and business executives too focused on regulatory “omnibuses” to save our actual bus industry. A singular focus on deregulation will only amplify this crisis of demand, not solve it.

Europe’s strength lies in its social model and skilled workforce. Good industrial jobs—stable, well-paid, unionised—are the backbone of social cohesion. They provide stability, dignity and prosperity. Worker participation, not exploitation. Rule of law rather than government by tweet provides political stability for investors.

Yet instead of leveraging this advantage, policymakers flirt with deregulation and austerity. Lowering social standards will not attract investment; it will erode Europe’s unique value proposition.

From industrial powerhouse to dependency? Not on Our Watch

The Syndex report is blunt: 2026 is the make-or-break year for investment decisions to renovate our energy-intensive industries. In downstream sectors, Europe is losing leadership in electric vehicles, semiconductors and clean technology. Investment is stagnant, research and development spending lags behind the United States and China, and our share in strategic technologies—artificial intelligence, quantum computing, advanced robotics—is shrinking.

The European Union’s R&D intensity remains below 2 per cent of GDP, compared with 3.45 per cent in the US and nearly 5 per cent in South Korea. Meanwhile, European firms lead the world in dividend payouts, even in sectors in crisis. Profits must be reinvested in R&D and production, not siphoned off to shareholders.

Sovereignty is at stake: rare earths, batteries and even basic pharmaceuticals are imported. China controls 85 per cent of rare earth refining; the US secures supply through intervention. Europe accounts for less than 10 per cent of global chip production today, compared with 24 per cent in 2000. Meanwhile, global overcapacity and dumping practices—especially in steel and solar—are crushing European producers.

Without decisive action, the green and digital transitions will be outsourced, and Europe will become a consumer market for technologies made elsewhere. The rules have changed: the US and China are playing hardball. Europe must do the same. While Washington and Beijing deploy aggressive industrial strategies, Europe clings to outdated dogmas of free trade and fiscal austerity.

Europe woke up to the need for industrial policy late in the day. Now we must catch up—moving far more quickly, with unity and ambition. If we do not act now, the promise of a fair green and digital transition will collapse into dependency and decline.

Good jobs, investment and ambition: Europe’s Last Chance to Lead

All is not lost. We have to play to our strengths.

Europe must abandon naivety and embrace a bold industrial strategy anchored in investment, fair trade and good jobs. Massive investment, conditional on job quality and local content, is the only way forward.

Energy policy is equally critical: without affordable, low-carbon electricity, decarbonisation projects will continue to stall. Europe must accelerate grid investment and reform pricing rules to shield industry from volatility.

Free trade must not be a suicide pact. Our “18 trillion euro” internal market must leverage domestic demand, quality jobs and investment through demand-stimulating measures. Access to the EU market—and the 450 million people living and working in the bloc—should not be cost-free for foreign investors and trading partners.

External trade policies must both build strong, reciprocal international partnerships and ensure a level playing field through a robust carbon border adjustment mechanism, anti-dumping measures and local content rules to protect Europe’s transforming industry.

Transformation will not happen without factories—and factories will not survive without good jobs. Europe’s strength lies in its skilled workforce, yet all the sectors analysed face labour or skills shortages, despite restructuring, and an ageing workforce. The new European Quality Jobs Act announced by the Commission president in her State of the Union speech in September must ensure that we anticipate change rather than permanently react to crises—through mandatory transition plans and recruitment drives.

Our industries need young blood. The lessons of the post-war GI Bill in the US should inspire an apprenticeship and graduate recruitment drive for young workers joining the labour market and women entering industry.

Europe is not condemned to decline. But naivety will mean dependency—and dependency will mean deindustrialisation. The choice is stark: invest in clean industrial value chains and quality employment now, or surrender to foreign dominance. Further delay means more plant closures, lost skills and shattered communities. Europe’s manufacturing, mining and energy workers are clear: now is the time to act.

According to the company, the project will add up to 3 gigawatts of data center capacity to the region, which Amazon says will go beyond its needs of 2.4 gigawatts.

“This is a massive win for Hoosier ratepayers,” Indiana Gov. Mike Braun said in Amazon’s news release. “This agreement will ensure a surplus in new energy development that will deliver real savings to Hoosier ratepayers.”

Since 2010, Amazon has invested more than $31.3 billion in Indiana, according to the release, contributing more than $29.9 billion to the state’s GDP and supporting 24,500 full- and part-time jobs, plus thousands more indirect jobs across various facilities.

The latest investment adds to the $11 billion investment Amazon announced last year in St. Joseph County, Indiana.

Sites for the new data centers have not been finalized yet, but the Chicago Tribune reports that Amazon is in negotiations with multiple communities, according to Brandon Oyer, head of Americas water and power at Amazon Web Services.

According to the Tribune report, again citing Oyer, the data centers would ideally be up and running in 2027.

Amazon says the data centers will support AI and cloud computing technologies. In order to support the electrical grid and build the capacity necessary for such an energy-intensive project, Amazon is partnering with NIPSCO to create a new subsidiary, NIPSCO Generation (GenCo).

Through this subsidiary, Amazon says it will pay fees to use existing power lines and cover the costs for new power plants, power lines and other equipment needed for the project. Amazon claims this will incur no additional cost to local residents and businesses.

According to Vince Parisi, NIPSCO president and CEO, the agreement with Amazon means about $1 billion is savings over 15 years to existing NIPSCO customers.

“By structuring this agreement thoughtfully, we’re ensuring our current customers are protected, without increasing their rates, while we expand our capacity to meet growing demands,” Parisi said in the release. “This project isn’t just about powering data centers, it’s about powering possibilities for our communities through thousands of new jobs, an expanded tax base, and building a skilled workforce in Northern Indiana for long-term growth and prosperity.”

Sparsh Global School installed a 430 kW rooftop solar power system at its campus in Greater Noida, Uttar Pradesh, to advance its sustainability goals and reduce electricity costs. The project, executed by Solluz Energy, is expected to generate nearly 600,000 kWh of clean electricity every year. Before the solar system was commissioned, the school’s power consumption averaged around 2,500 units per day, making energy efficiency and cost stabilization a key priority. According to Solluz Energy, the school’s decision to go solar was driven by a strong commitment to lowering its environmental impact and building a more eco-conscious campus.

Telangana Power Generation Corporation invited bids to set up 375 MW/1,500 MWh standalone battery energy storage systems (BESS). The first project (187.5 MW/750 MWh) will be connected to the 400/220 kV Maheswaram substation, and the other project (187.5 MW/750 MWh) will be connected to the 400/220 kV Choutuppal substation.

A 240 tons per day biomass pellet manufacturing facility in Rewari, Haryana, has been inaugurated by Union Minister for New and Renewable Energy Pralhad Joshi. The facility will help expand the supply of biomass-based clean fuels for thermal power generation and reduce their dependence on coal. The plant will manufacture biomass pellets from agricultural residues, including paddy straw, mustard straw, and cotton stalks, for co-firing in coal-fired power plants.

The Delhi Electricity Regulatory Commission approved the New Delhi Municipal Council’s plea to procure 200 MW of solar power from the Solar Energy Corporation of India (SECI) under the interstate transmission system (ISTS)-connected solar project (Tranche–XI). The Commission approved a tariff of ₹2.61 (~$0.029)/kWh, along with a trading margin of ₹0.07 (~$0.00079)/kWh payable to SECI, for 25 years. SECI had floated a request for selection on March 31, 2023, for the allocation of 2,000 MW of solar capacity under ISTS solar (Tranche-XI). The petitioner, NDMC, filed a petition to secure 200 MW of solar power to meet its renewable purchase obligation, address rising electricity demand, particularly during summer peak months, and support its objective of transitioning to 100% renewable energy.

The Italian Council of Ministers allocated €250 million (~$288 million) to support the Transizione 5.0 tax credit program for businesses transitioning to renewable energy sources. Additionally, €10 million (~$11.5 million) each has been allocated under the program for 2026 and 2027. Transizione 5.0 supports energy transition projects that improve energy efficiency, digitalize production processes, and involve self-consumption. However, it emphasizes that companies can claim credit for either the updated Transizione 5.0 tax credit program or the earlier 4.0 tax credit program. Companies that have applied for both tax credits must choose one. The Council of Ministers also approved extending the application deadline for the Transizione 5.0 tax credit from November 7 to November 27.

The UNFCCC COP30 climate summit in Belém, Brazil, ended without any mention of fossil fuels, after oil-producing countries Russia and Saudi Arabia blocked a deal to phase out coal, oil, and gas. India joined the naysayers, while the European Union (EU) and the UK made a strong pitch for a transition roadmap. Some 80 countries supported the EU and UK’s initiative, but during negotiations, the proposal stalled due to opposition from petrostates. After the summit, the EU delegation said, “At COP30, despite our persistent efforts and the European Parliament’s clear mandate on mitigation and the phase-out of fossil fuels, we faced a unified BRICS–Arab front and a Presidency unwilling to match our level of ambition, and we must regret that the final outcome did not go further.”

By contrast, metallurgical uses could absorb up to 60 per cent of Indonesia’s nickel output by 2035, or more than a million tonnes a year.
EV market reality The findings challenge a key assumption behind Indonesia’s industrialisation strategy – that nickel-driven downstreaming will automatically create a thriving domestic EV ecosystem.
ESI’s base-case scenario projected that if Indonesia develops nickel downstream into construction materials, household appliances and electronics, domestic nickel consumption could hit 900,000 tonnes annually, up from 400,000 tonnes in 2024.
In a best-case scenario, Indonesia could capture part of China’s market share, boosting domestic nickel consumption to 1.5 million tonnes annually, or around 64 per cent of last year’s mine output.","[JAKARTA] Indonesia should pivot to a “dual-track” industrial strategy that supports both electric vehicle (EV) development and the expansion of metallurgical industries, given that new research shows EVs will use up only a fraction of the country’s surging nickel output in the next decade.

A report released on Wednesday (Nov 26) by the Asia-focused energy finance think tank Energy Shift Institute (ESI) said that while EV-related industries often dominate headlines and attract high-profile foreign investors, metallurgical uses of nickel – such as in stainless steel, plating and nickel alloys – are far more scalable and better aligned with Indonesia’s existing industrial strengths.

These sectors absorb significantly more nickel, face fewer export barriers than cars or batteries, and offer deeper opportunities for developing the country’s small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs).

The ESI report said: “Indonesia simply produces more nickel than its domestic EV sector will ever need. A dual-track strategy that builds both EV adoption and metallurgical industries will ensure more resilient long-term growth.”

Indonesia, the world’s second-largest producer of stainless steel, exported 4.7 million tonnes in 2024.

Yet, it also imported US$44.2 billion in stainless steel end products, including tubes, screws, cookware and industrial components. This imbalance highlights a missed opportunity, ESI noted.

“Nurturing local manufacturing clusters around stainless steel and other metals could create more jobs, build domestic brands and deliver broader economic spillovers than the EV push.”

South-east Asia’s largest economy has been promoting its EV ecosystem to drive growth, capitalising on its position as the world’s largest nickel producer.

However, EV adoption in Indonesia still lags, making up under 5 per cent of the country’s 168 million vehicles on the road.

ESI estimated that even if Indonesia produces a million EVs a year by 2035 and expands the use of nickel-heavy nickel manganese cobalt (NMC) batteries, the sector would still consume under 1 per cent of the country’s 2024 nickel output.

By contrast, metallurgical uses could absorb up to 60 per cent of Indonesia’s nickel output by 2035, or more than a million tonnes a year.

EV market reality

The findings challenge a key assumption behind Indonesia’s industrialisation strategy – that nickel-driven downstreaming will automatically create a thriving domestic EV ecosystem.

ESI highlighted that global car production is largely regional; only 3 per cent of light vehicles are traded across continents, limiting Indonesia’s potential as a major EV exporter.

Battery manufacturing trends further complicate the picture. Cheaper lithium iron phosphate batteries, which contain no nickel, now dominate EV sales in China and South-east Asia, undermining the rationale for policies promoting nickel-heavy NMC batteries.

ESI’s base-case scenario projected that if Indonesia develops nickel downstream into construction materials, household appliances and electronics, domestic nickel consumption could hit 900,000 tonnes annually, up from 400,000 tonnes in 2024.

Doing so will mean the country will gain access to lower-cost emissions reductions through ITMOs.","Canada is off track to meet its 2030 emissions target and its nationally determined contribution (NDC), which means more policy ambition will be needed to get closer to its targets and align with net zero emissions. A decade of carbon policy has led to real emissions cuts, but this progress remains modest given rising economic activity, lagging energy efficiency, and increased emissions from an ever-expanding oil and gas sector.

Canada will need a sustained policy effort to bring down emissions and a full toolbox to get it done. Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes—or ITMOs—are not new, but with global rules now firmed up, they offer an important tool to deliver both emission reductions and support carbon competitiveness.

This blog lays out what they are and why they’re relevant for Canada’s climate competitiveness strategy. You can read more on the topic in the Canadian Climate Institute’s scoping paper.

What are ITMOs and why should Canada use them?

ITMOs under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement offer a credible, cost-effective way to complement domestic emissions reductions.

Essentially, ITMOs are formalized agreements between two countries where an emissions reduction that takes place in a host jurisdiction is verified and then transferred or sold to another country. The receiving country then applies the emissions credit to its own emissions inventory (or NDC, in the parlance of the United Nations).

ITMOs let countries count verified emissions reductions achieved abroad through technology transfer and climate finance, provided both partners agree and apply strict accounting rules to avoid double counting the emissions reductions. ITMOs can be generated through co-operative activities or programs jointly designed and implemented by the participating countries.

Article 6 is now operational, with clear rules and nearly 100 bilateral arrangements in place. It creates structured pathways for countries to use verified emissions reductions abroad to meet national targets.

For Canada, this opens a practical, high-integrity tool to complement domestic action and manage the rising costs of reducing emissions. Importantly, the use of Article 6 bolsters carbon competitiveness, helping Canadian firms win in fast-growing clean technology markets.

ITMOs can cut the cost of Canada’s emissions reductions and expand options

ITMOs let countries pursue lower-cost ways to cut emissions abroad, avoiding the most expensive domestic options. This matters for Canada, where hitting medium-term targets will require increasingly expensive options to reduce greenhouse gases, especially in heavy industry.

For example, carbon capture utilization and storage costs upwards of $150 per tonne for industrial sources such as those proposed for the Pathways Alliance project. With heavy industry responsible for about 42 per cent of national emissions, relying only on domestic reductions quickly becomes expensive.

Modelling for the Canadian Climate Institute shows that achieving a 45 per cent reduction below 2005 levels by 2035 implies average carbon costs in the range of $150 per tonne. Shifting even 10 megatonnes of domestic reductions to ITMOs could avoid around $2 billion in costs in 2035. With slowed policy ambition relative to past Emissions Reduction Plans and rising national emissions from more and gas development, the potential savings rise fast. Current international price forecasts of $45 to $100 per tonne imply substantial savings when compared to the costs of reducing these emissions in Canada.

There are trade-offs, however. Capital deployed abroad to catalyze new additional emissions reductions support jobs and investment elsewhere. But lower compliance costs reduce economic headwinds at home, helping protect investment and productivity. And where international partnerships from ITMOs include technology or commercial benefits—namely, that ITMO emissions reductions use technology from Canadian companies—the net economic return improves here at home.

ITMOs can support Canadian trade, technology, and geopolitics

Embedding ITMOs in Canada’s trade and finance strategy could help deepen opportunities for Canadian firms in fast-growing global markets for clean tech and low-carbon energy.

Global trade data shows that Canada sold $5.5 billion worth of low-carbon value chain products into the Global South in 2023, across a range of raw materials such as critical minerals and final products including high efficiency electric motors. This success points to a clear strategy: focus on areas where Canada already leads such as methane reduction, electricity generating technology, and advanced manufacturing.

On liquefied natural gas (LNG), bundled approaches that integrate Canadian LNG with clean energy investments and broader energy transition strategies in importing countries could qualify for Article 6 treatment, but have significant potential pitfalls and are far from the “sell gas, bank credits” model many believe to be true.

To be considered under Article 6, LNG exports would likely need to be embedded in a comprehensive decarbonization plan in the host country, with emission reductions that are demonstrably additional to higher-emitting energy use.

Canada should follow Japan’s model and move now

A deliberate approach involving building bilateral agreements and drawing on lessons from Japan’s Joint Crediting Mechanism (JCM) could convert these strengths into credible ITMO supply and expand global trade partnerships for Canada.

Japan’s experience shows how an organized, long-term approach to Article 6 can deliver emissions reductions, technology deployment, and trade gains. Its JCM is a dedicated platform for bilateral deals that deploy Japanese clean technologies abroad, generate verified emissions reductions, and share credits between Japan and partner countries. Japan now has agreements with 31 countries and more than 250 projects, mostly in clean power and efficiency.

Japan’s early action delivered first-mover advantages by rolling out a fully integrated strategy:

Co-ordinated governance: Environment, trade, energy, technology, and foreign ministries jointly support deal development, financing, and demonstration projects.

Focused bilateral platform: The JCM accelerates deployment of Japanese technology, including advanced manufacturing, through standardized rules and state-backed investment, lowering transaction costs and enabling credit sharing.

Capacity building: The Article 6 Implementation Partnership supports implementation in partner countries, with more than 80 countries and 200 organizations participating.

Regional alliances: Japan convenes regional forums to drive decarbonization partnerships and secure project pipelines.

Private-sector integration: Government tools de-risk private investment and support firms pursuing international mitigation projects.

By developing a comprehensive governance system early on, Japan is gaining a project pipeline of low-cost emissions reductions options it could apply to its own emissions inventory while diversifying trade.

Canada has a narrow window to move from discussion to delivery. Learning from Japan, the path forward is clear:

Establish a national Article 6 co-ordination mechanism linking Environment and Climate Change Canada, Global Affairs, and Natural Resources to manage bilateral co-operation and crediting.

Launch bilateral pilot projects with willing partner nations to demonstrate Canadian technology and build institutional capacity.

Leverage existing finance tools such as those provided by the Export Development Corporation to de-risk priority projects and mobilize private capital.

Integrate ITMOs into Canada’s broader climate and trade strategy, ensuring provincial participation and alignment with broader competitive efforts.

Canada needs to put the ITMO policy pieces in place now

Canada needs to act quickly to secure early-mover advantages as global Articles 6 markets scale up and trading relationships form. Doing so will mean the country will gain access to lower-cost emissions reductions through ITMOs.

To take advantage of this opportunity, Canada needs to stand up a co-ordinated federal platform that pushes pilot transactions, builds capacity, tests approaches, and signals broader intent to trading partners. Linking Canada’s ITMO strategy with trade, finance, and clean tech support tools can drive export opportunities and strengthen competitiveness, all while supporting sustainable development outcomes in the Global South.

That’s a lot of benefits for a single policy lever. But time is short and Canada should act now to start putting the policy pieces in place, so they’re available when needed most.",https://climateinstitute.ca/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/what-are-ITMOs-why-they-matter.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 17:00:42.348563

Hamburg, Rostock (renewablepress) - With today's inauguration of a state-of-the-art generator converter test bench at its Rostock site, the Nordex Group is focusing on expanding and strengthening its technological expertise in grid integration for its wind turbines.

The new test bench will enable faster, more comprehensive testing and development of high-performance converters; a critical component in modern wind turbine electrical systems. Converters transform turbine-generated electricity into power that can be fed into the grid while regulating frequency and voltage. They play an essential role in maintaining grid stability and protection, making them a key component in the efficient and stable use of renewable energies in the changing energy mix of electricity grids.

Converters also play a key role in flexibly adapting to evolving international grid requirements and in implementing grid forming strategies that that will underpin future grid stability. Each country has unique grid topologies and specifications from grid operators that are continuously evolving, placing new demands on wind turbines.

With systems installed in more than 40 countries, the Nordex Group has harnessed extensive engineering expertise in power electronics and in meeting different grid requirements over the years. With its new test bench, the Nordex Group is now also focusing specifically on its turbine converter in-house development and quality assurance. “With the new test bench, we at Nordex are strengthening our ability to develop our own converter solutions to meet the changing international requirements of continuously growing grid connection specifications; the grid codes,” explains Helmut Resing-Wörmer, Head of Test and Prototype at the Nordex Group. “We're testing under real-world conditions in Rostock to ensure our systems’ reliability and grid compliance. Grid compliance is a decisive competitive advantage, and the converter represents another core component and competence for Nordex.”

“By building in-house development capabilities and expertise in converter technology, we’re laying the groundwork for flexible, tailored grid integration solutions, thereby ensuring the future viability of our products,” adds Dr. Christian Wessels, VP Global Electrical Engineering at the Nordex Group.

Traditionally, grid connection testing has been conducted exclusively in the field using turbine prototypes, which can be time-consuming and challenging. The Power-Hardware-in-the-Loop (PHIL) test bench enables comprehensive grid compliance testing of electrical drive systems. Equipped with an advanced grid simulator, the test bench allows Nordex to simulate a wide range of grid conditions, including voltage, power and frequency fluctuations, voltage dips or grid faults, doing away with the need for field testing. This makes it possible to obtain valid measurement results very early in the development cycle and save time. Power connection tests are then continued in the field. With this approach Nordex ensures that current and future turbine generations can be reliably integrated into the power grids and comply with applicable grid codes faster in the respective markets, while at the same time complexity and new grid requirements are increasing.

The inauguration event welcomed representatives from government, research institutions, and partner companies, including Ms. Kerstin Deller, Deputy Head of Energy Research at the Federal Ministry for Economic Affairs and Energy.

The Nordex Group has invested over EUR 4 million to build the test facility in Rostock. The test bench was executed by R&D Test Systems from Denmark and Ingeteam Power Technology from Spain as well as regional and local companies from Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania, including Ingenieurbüro Wollboldt and GTN Getriebetechnik Nord, and WISAG Elektrotechnik Berlin-Brandenburg The RKL Rostock Competence Center for Power Electronics and the University of Rostock also provided support. “In recent years, an engineering network of companies and research institutes has established itself in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania and particularly in Rostock, focusing on grid integration and grid stability. With the expansion of wind energy facilities, these plants are becoming increasingly important for the stability of the power grid. Our current investment in the converter test bench will support the energy transition to achieve set climate targets,” adds Resing-Wörmer.

The Nordex Group Rostock facility manufactures nacelles, hubs, drive trains, and control cabinets for all turbine models, and houses the company's Blade Competence Center with its rotor blade test rig. The new converter test bench further expands Rostock’s role as a Nordex center of excellence.

Executed through Contemporary Star Energy, S.L.—a 50/50 joint venture formed to accelerate affordable, sustainable electric mobility—the gigafactory announced in 2024 is designed to be carbon-neutral and aims to begin production by the end of 2026 with a capacity of up to 50 GWh, enough to power roughly one million electric vehicles (EVs) annually. The facility will support high-quality B- and C-segment Stellantis BEVs produced in Europe and strengthen the continent’s battery supply chain.

A carbon-neutral anchor for Europe’s EV value chain

Zaragoza is engineered to have an impact across industrial, technological, and environmental dimensions. At full scale, the targeted output corresponds to more than 30 million tons of CO2 avoided over vehicles’ lifetimes and savings of over 125 million barrels (about 17 million tons) of crude oil. The project is expected to create more than 4,000 direct jobs and thousands of indirect roles, catalyzing a competitive local ecosystem around advanced battery manufacturing.

Technically, the gigafactory will embed next-generation design and production methods, including Cell-to-Body integration that places cells directly into vehicle structures to boost efficiency, packaging, and safety. The plant will apply Industry 4.0 standards to deliver intelligent, automated, and traceable processes and rely on more than 80% renewable energy. The partners describe Zaragoza as designed to be Europe’s first carbon-neutral lithium battery factory, underscoring the project’s sustainability credentials alongside its scale.

Andy Wu, CEO of Contemporary Star Energy, emphasized the venture’s ambition and pace: “At our Zaragoza plant, we are introducing extreme modularity in product design and manufacturing, integrating cutting-edge cell-to-body technology. This achievement, made possible through a strong and visionary partnership with CATL, will bring unprecedented flexibility while embedding the latest LFP technology into Stellantis’ STLA S platform vehicles. And this is just the beginning. We are already collaborating on advanced solutions like cell bottom venting for NCM chemistry and taking decisive steps to secure raw materials through a strategic MOU—strengthening our supply chain for the future.”

Battery supply chain watch

Battery Technology previously reported that CATL’s Lithium Mine Closure caused a surge in prices and stocks, signaling potential supply chain disruptions. But Bloomberg recently informed that “a key Chinese lithium mine run by Contemporary Amperex Technology Co. Ltd. is preparing to reopen as soon as early next month.” Bloomberg stated that CATL has “formulated a preliminary plan to restart its Jianxiawo mine by early December,” while stressing the plan “is subject to regulatory approval” and that the company is “still awaiting sign-off from the authorities.”

As CATL and Stellantis move from groundbreaking to execution, the Zaragoza gigafactory positions Contemporary Star Energy to scale European battery supply with a focus on affordability and sustainability. Upstream developments could prove pivotal, with a timely restart of its Jianxiawo mine quickly reducing feedstock uncertainty and supporting the joint venture’s ramp.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/bltb299798942522069/blt9aef5c7044e78d43/6761cc70267b885ac4bf5d63/HERO-Stellantis-CATL-JV-Signing.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-26 14:00:20.849375

That’s what we’re working through.” And yet, Rhode Island still must meet the legally binding mandate to reduce carbon emissions, with the first benchmark in 2030.
Establishing the goal line As of 2023 — the most recent data available — Rhode Island produced 9.52 million metric tons of carbon, 19.5% less than the 1990 levels used as a baseline, according to data collected and analyzed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.
“Especially when we look beyond 2030, we have a significant challenge in reducing transportation emissions,” Gray said.
Every home and business in Rhode Island must have a heat pump installed by 2050 to meet the decarbonization mandate, per report modeling.","Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray had reason for optimism when he and other state administrators kicked off their work in November 2024 charting a path to achieving the state’s decarbonization mandates.

“When we first started working on this, Trump hadn’t taken office,” Gray, who heads a consortium of state agencies overseeing the implementation of Rhode Island’s Act on Climate law, said in an interview Wednesday. “We still had very strong federal policies, federal authorities and grants in place. Those three things were really, very important.”

On Tuesday, the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council released a draft of its first comprehensive review of existing progress and future forecasting to help achieve the state’s net-zero emissions law. The 31-page report is open for public comment through Dec. 10.

And as Gray wrote in his opening letter, recent shifts in federal policy and funding have eroded his confidence in achieving Rhode Island’s aggressive emissions reduction plan.

“These shifts will have devastating and immediate consequences for Rhode Island’s climate planning,” Gray wrote. “While this Strategy focuses on impacts to our climate-change portfolio, the broader federal rollbacks are poised to trigger severe disruptions across energy, environmental protection, health care, and food-security systems, placing extraordinary strain on state agencies and undermining long-standing strategic investments.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act yanked more than $75 million in federal funding to Rhode Island for clean energy programs and related research and infrastructure projects. Before that, Biden-era federal tax credits for renewable energy were canceled, more stringent state vehicle emissions standards paused and offshore wind projects set to power New England’s grid were halted or pulled back. Even the federal grants for the climate council to hire a consultant to model state emissions output in future years were temporarily frozen.

“We’re trying to figure out ways to do this without necessarily direct monetary incentives everywhere,” Gray said.

Asked what alternative, nonfinancial incentives might be, Gray responded “I don’t know. That’s what we’re working through.”

And yet, Rhode Island still must meet the legally binding mandate to reduce carbon emissions, with the first benchmark in 2030.

“Rhode Island will forge ahead in the face of this shifting landscape and continue to collaborate across all agencies in 2026 and beyond,” the report states.

The council is charged with updating its assessment in subsequent reports issued every five years through the 2050 deadline for completion.

Establishing the goal line

As of 2023 — the most recent data available — Rhode Island produced 9.52 million metric tons of carbon, 19.5% less than the 1990 levels used as a baseline, according to data collected and analyzed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The emissions inventory report published last week stressed the need to accelerate incentives and policies that promote a clean energy transition, warning that the existing pace of progress was not enough to meet the first incremental benchmark in 2030.

However, according to the climate council’s models, Rhode Island will meet the 2030 benchmark, which calls for reducing total emissions 45% from the 1990 baseline. This is largely thanks to state incentive programs and policy choices, such as discounts for property owners to switch to heat pumps, weatherize and make their homes energy efficient, and buy or lease battery-powered and hybrid cars, the report stated.

But achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 remains just of reach without “additional ambition,” the council’s draft strategy report states. The report outlines broad steps to speed up the clean energy transition, targeting the biggest culprits of carbon emissions: transportation, home heating and electricity use.

“We still have the challenge of ‘how do we achieve this,’ but at least now we kind of all know what the goal line is,” Gray said of the strategy report.

In order to achieve the 2050 net-zero mandate, for example, Rhode Island needs to accelerate its adoption of hybrid and battery-powered vehicles, including cars, trucks, and off-road sources like boats and airplanes. Specifically, the report recommends nearly tripling annual electric vehicle sales, from the 13,000 sold this year in the state to 36,000 by 2030.

Gray is eyeing the transportation sector with extra concern, noting that Trump has sought to repeal federal waivers letting states, including Rhode Island, adopt more stringent vehicle emissions standards.

Much of Rhode Island’s ability to achieve reductions in transportation sector emissions relies on its authority to set lower emissions standards for new cars and trucks.

“Especially when we look beyond 2030, we have a significant challenge in reducing transportation emissions,” Gray said.

Federal rollbacks have not cooled the state’s incentive program to help property owners convert from oil or gas to electric-powered heat pumps. But surging winter electricity prices have dissuaded some heat pump converts from using their new systems, Gray said.

“We need stability and certainty in electric rates so people actually use their heat pumps,” he said.

Meanwhile, the heat is on to keep selling these greener home heating alternatives.

Every home and business in Rhode Island must have a heat pump installed by 2050 to meet the decarbonization mandate, per report modeling. Achieving this overhaul requires increasing heat pump sales from the 3,000 sold in 2025 to 15,000 a year by 2030, according to the report.

Sticker shock

Convincing cash-strapped consumers and business owners to look to long-term savings versus the upfront costs of a hybrid car or heat pump conversion is not easy, Gray acknowledged. Cost was a top concern cited by residents in a series of community meetings organized by the climate change council this fall.

“There’s got to be more hesitancy now to say ‘where is this all going’ given the rhetoric coming out of the federal government,” Gray said.

But there is also a price for doing nothing — $940 million in “social costs” by 2050, according to the report.

“Decarbonization reduces spending on fossil fuels, avoids the economic and health damages caused by climate change, and delivers cleaner air and healthier communities across the state,” the report states.

Going green will also boost the state economy, adding an estimated 6,500 jobs by 2035 for work on offshore wind projects, battery storage and residential heating and cooling, the report states.

The report concludes with a call to action.

“The decarbonization and transition of our economy must be done carefully, and deliberately with affordability in mind, to meet the goals set forth in the Act on Climate,” it states. “It is important to emphasize that acting on climate change cannot be championed by state government alone. Businesses, municipalities, nonprofit leaders and residents will continue to be called up to prioritize action towards the goals of the Act on Climate.”",https://rhodeislandcurrent.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_5282-2048x1536-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 15:00:13.443088

For the first time, individuals with green skills working in non-green job roles constitute 53% of all green hires.
This suggests that green skills are increasingly seen as contributors to efficiency and resilience, not just environmental outcomes.
Shortages in energy and utilities The utilities sector, which includes renewable energy generation, has the highest concentration of green talent at 29.6%, according to the report.
Research from C40 Cities suggests that up to 51% of future demand for green talent may go unmet without such strategic intervention.","The call for professionals with sustainability expertise is growing almost twice as fast as the development of those skills within the workforce, according to LinkedIn's 2025 Green Skills Report.

The findings could indicate that, while momentum for the climate transition is building, the global workforce may not be equipped to deliver it.

LinkedIn analysed data from its more than one billion members. The results show that the hiring rate for green jobs increased by nearly 8% annually between 2021 and 2025, while the share of workers possessing green skills grew by just 4.3%.

""The gulf between demand and supply of skilled workers continues to put this at risk,"" says Sue Duke, Vice President of Public Policy and Economic Graph at LinkedIn.

While the general level of climate knowledge is improving, with 17.6% of workers now having at least one green skill, the pace of growth is not sufficient. The growth in climate skills has also slowed from 5.5% in 2023-24 to 4.3% in 2024-25, raising further concerns.

Where green hiring is growing

According to LinkedIn’s statistics, the technology, information and media industry saw the highest average yearly growth in green hires between 2021 and 2025, at 11.3%.

This increase could reflect the sector's dual challenge of managing the resource intensity of technologies like AI while also creating the technology needed for climate solutions.

Within the AI talent pool specifically, skills such as operational efficiency experienced a 579% year-on-year growth, while maintenance and repair increased by 190%.

These increases are happening as technology-adjacent sectors expand their environmental footprint.

Green skills as a competitive advantage

A notable change is occurring in how green competencies are being applied. For the first time, individuals with green skills working in non-green job roles constitute 53% of all green hires.

This suggests that green skills are increasingly seen as contributors to efficiency and resilience, not just environmental outcomes.

A 2023 survey by Deloitte found that half of business leaders were already training their employees on sustainability, with another 41% planning to introduce programmes within two years.

Workers with these skills now hold a distinct advantage, securing jobs at a rate 46.6% higher than the wider workforce. Energy management became the fastest-growing green skill category globally over the past year, reflecting demand related to AI infrastructure and renewable energy.

Shortages in energy and utilities

The utilities sector, which includes renewable energy generation, has the highest concentration of green talent at 29.6%, according to the report.

Despite this, its share of green hiring reached 33.4%, which indicates that even this highly specialised industry is finding it difficult to recruit enough qualified workers.

The International Energy Association (IEA) has forecasted that global electricity consumption will rise considerably in the next three years. It believes renewables and nuclear power are set to meet 95% of this growth, meaning the need for skilled individuals will be immense.

In the US, the nuclear energy sector's hiring rate is already 33.4% higher than the national average, highlighting the demand.

LinkedIn's research also shows that women are underrepresented in industries with high demand for green skills such as utilities, construction and technology.

The report suggests skills-based hiring could help address this imbalance, with research showing it increases women's representation in qualified talent pools by 26% in the US construction.

LinkedIn’s researchers have called for governments to embed workforce development into their climate and energy policies and for education systems to be updated to better reflect sustainability competencies.

Research from C40 Cities suggests that up to 51% of future demand for green talent may go unmet without such strategic intervention.

But at the same time, rising temperatures are in some cases opening the door for certain organisms that can thrive under these changes: invasive species.
Despite these threats, the Trump administration has poked holes in invasive species research funding and mitigation efforts across the country in recent months.
Similar destruction has followed as other invasive animal species spread across the world, from Burmese pythons in Florida to brown rats in New Zealand.

But at the same time, rising temperatures are in some cases opening the door for certain organisms that can thrive under these changes: invasive species.

From melting sea ice to longer growing seasons, global warming is unlocking new pathways for the spread and proliferation of certain non-native plants, animals, fungi and bacteria, according to a growing body of research. These new arrivals can wreak havoc on ecosystems and agricultural land, sometimes outcompeting native species and costing the global economy more than $400 billion in damages annually—including $21 billion in the United States alone, estimates suggest.

Despite these threats, the Trump administration has poked holes in invasive species research funding and mitigation efforts across the country in recent months. Scientists say this decrease in resources could have major long-term ecological and economic consequences.

Unintended Hitchhikers: The rise of long-haul transportation and trade has made the world more connected than ever before. Unfortunately, the cars, trains, planes and boats that carry us, food and products can also pick up some unintended hitchhikers along the way in the form of seeds, insects, bacteria and even birds and mammals. Whether attaching to the bottom of a boat, stowing away in a cargo plane or even getting stuck on someone’s shoe, these species often incidentally travel from their ecosystem to new places where they can spread.

That’s exactly what happened with the spotted lanternfly, an insect from China that scientists believe made its way to the U.S. on a shipment of stone in 2012. Since then, the lanternflies have spread to at least 15 states across the Eastern U.S., reaching populations of up to 150,000 some years in Pennsylvania alone, The Guardian reports.

While these polka-dotted insects may look harmless, a 2019 study estimated that spotted lanternflies can cause $324 million in damages and cause the loss of 2,800 jobs by killing trees that are crucial for apple and wine production or support birds, bats and reptiles in the region. Similar destruction has followed as other invasive animal species spread across the world, from Burmese pythons in Florida to brown rats in New Zealand.

Many non-native species in the U.S. are plants, said Bethany Bradley, an invasive species expert at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. The term “non-native” is used to describe organisms that do not naturally occur in an area and are introduced by human activities, but they are only classified as “invasive” if the species causes harm to the broader ecosystem, according to the National Park Service.

The reason that many invasive plants outcompete native ones is that they are fast-growing, produce numerous seeds and can better handle shifts in temperature or soil.

Once an invasive species is well-established, “basically, you end up with this introduced plant taking over an ecosystem,” Bradley told me. She co-authored research published in 2023 that found certain common invasive plant species may be able to spread more rapidly under climate change in the Northeastern U.S. Though these states are currently unsuitable for certain invasive plant growth, rising temperatures could change that.

Some invasive plant species may be what’s known as a “sleeper,” which are “right on the edge of its tolerance, and so if it warms up a little bit more, maybe you transition from an established population to one that is actively invading,” Bradley said.

Silver lining: Her research also found that 62 percent of currently abundant invasive species will see a decrease in habitat for large populations in the Eastern U.S. under 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit of warming. That being said, close to a third of global species overall will be at risk of extinction if temperatures rise by even 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit, according to a 2024 study.

Climate-Fueled Invasion: Other climate impacts could also drive the spread of invasive species, such as longer growing seasons or new shipping routes opening up as sea ice melts, according to the U.S. Geological Survey. On the flip side, invasive species can also exacerbate climate impacts.

For example, the deadly wildfire that tore through Lahaina in 2023 was made worse by the highly flammable, fast-growing, nonnative grasses introduced by farmers decades ago. Invasive grasses frequently fuel fires in the Western U.S.—and are typically the first to grow back after the fire, as well.

The most critical and least expensive stage to tackle invasions is when there is a small number of the species in a particular area, according to Sara Kuebbing, a researcher at the Yale School of the Environment.

“You need someone to identify, ‘Oh no, there’s something that we think is about to take off [and] it’s ready to spread’—and that usually happens,” she told me. “What fails is the institutions and the will a lot of times to contain it at that point.”

She pointed back to the spotted lanternfly, which would have required several states to come together at the early detection phase and dedicate the resources necessary to study how best to tackle the invasion and shut it down. This did not happen, as evidenced by the many spotted lanternflies I saw fluttering through the forest on a recent trip to upstate New York.

But governments are working to better collaborate on invasive species issues. In the Midwest, the U.S.-Canadian Great Lakes Fishery Commission has been working with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to control invasive sea lamprey populations in the Great Lakes, which span the Canadian border. A single one of these toothy, eel-like critters can eat 40 pounds of fish a year, so the commission targets the lamprey by spraying pesticide while they are still in the larval stage.

My colleague Anika Jane Beamer reported in February that the program was affected when the Trump administration laid off a large swath of USFWS employees, including several who worked with the commission, and enacted a travel ban and hiring freeze that delayed the remaining staff’s ability to carry out lamprey control measures.

She checked back in earlier today with Greg McClinchey, director of policy and legislative affairs for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission. He said the team raised this issue with supportive members of Congress, got the changes reversed and have had no complications since then, but did lose about five weeks “before we got everything back on track.”

The team is not yet sure if the delay will result in more lamprey later this year.

“What we know for sure is we can’t have what happened in ’25 happen again in ’26,” McClinchey said.

Also in the Midwest, President Donald Trump signed a memorandum in May directing the administration to “expeditiously implement the most effective mechanisms, barriers and other measures” to keep invasive Asian carp out of the Great Lakes, a rare show of support for environmental projects by the administration. However, other invasive species projects have been hit hard by Trump administration actions.

Since 2012, the federally managed Northeast Climate Adaptation Science Center, hosted at the University of Massachusetts Amherst, has worked to increase collaboration on invasive species management in the region. Bradley, who works in the center, helped create a regional network that has become a primary source for mapping invasive plant movement and sharing research on the subject across the region.

She said that states recently asked the center to develop a database of current and emerging invasive plants across the Northeast, but the project largely stalled after the Department of the Interior rejected a proposal for the university to continue hosting the center when it was up for a rebid in February. The Interior Department did not respond when I asked why the administration made this decision and if it will fund the invasive species work through a different mechanism.

Because of lapsed funding, graduate student researchers have been shifted to other projects or are focusing on teaching instead of research. Bradley isn’t sure when she’ll be able to prioritize the project again and is worried that she won’t have the resources to accept students in the future.

“It means that we’re just in this … zombie mode,” Bradley said. “Basically, we’re not dead, but we’re not alive, and it’s been a weird space. We’re still in this long waiting period of hoping that Congress’ support will ultimately be enough to convince the administration that this is a program that does good things.”

As climate change accelerates, Thanksgiving dinner staples are increasingly at risk, Simmone Shah reports for Time. For example, farmers are struggling to maintain high yields of cranberries and apples due to drought and changing growing seasons, while turkeys face major threats from extreme heat.

“The impacts of climate change on food production will be increased costs for consumers, without a doubt,” Mario Herrero, professor of food systems and global change at Cornell University, told Time. “The seasonality changes [impact] planting dates. It will make it either more expensive to maintain the yields, or we will need to just accept a lower supply—and lower supply with the increased demand for food that we have leads to higher prices.”

This year the United Kingdom has seen more wildfires than at any other point since recordkeeping began in 2012, Matthew Taylor reports for The Guardian. The Global Wildfire Information System estimates that more than 116,000 acres had burned by November. Experts say the U.K., which is typically too wet for frequent fires, is ill-prepared for these blazes, and the Fire Brigades Union there has called for more investment as the climate changes.

According to documents reviewed by The New York Times, as many as 100 seasonal workers at the National Park Service have not yet received a portion of their back pay after being furloughed during the government shutdown. The law requires that these federal workers be paid “at the earliest date possible after the lapse ends,” and advocacy groups and politicians are saying this pay is overdue. As my colleague Jake Bolster reported, states and nonprofits stepped in to help fill operational gaps at national parks during the shutdown, but some fear that this could help the Trump administration justify further shrinking staffs.

Postcard from … Indonesia

This week’s postcard is courtesy of … me! I recently went on vacation for a few weeks to Indonesia, and spent the last three days of the trip trekking the forests of Sumatra with a guide in search of wild orangutans. Within a few hours of the journey, the skies opened and we were pummeled by rain—and yes, I forgot my pack cover, so almost everything I brought got soaked.

Thankfully, my phone somehow survived so I could snap this photo of a female orangutan effortlessly climbing from branch to branch. It was a magical moment to spend with a creature that is so closely related to us. All the bug bites, dripping clothes, food poisoning and aching muscles were completely worth it.

That’s what we’re working through.” And yet, Rhode Island still must meet the legally binding mandate to reduce carbon emissions, with the first benchmark in 2030.
Establishing the goal line As of 2023 — the most recent data available — Rhode Island produced 9.52 million metric tons of carbon, 19.5% less than the 1990 levels used as a baseline, according to data collected and analyzed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management.
“Especially when we look beyond 2030, we have a significant challenge in reducing transportation emissions,” Gray said.
Every home and business in Rhode Island must have a heat pump installed by 2050 to meet the decarbonization mandate, per report modeling.","Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management Director Terry Gray had reason for optimism when he and other state administrators kicked off their work in November 2024 charting a path to achieving the state’s decarbonization mandates.

“When we first started working on this, Trump hadn’t taken office,” Gray, who heads a consortium of state agencies overseeing the implementation of Rhode Island’s Act on Climate law, said in an interview Wednesday. “We still had very strong federal policies, federal authorities and grants in place. Those three things were really, very important.”

On Tuesday, the Executive Climate Change Coordinating Council released a draft of its first comprehensive review of existing progress and future forecasting to help achieve the state’s net-zero emissions law. The 31-page report is open for public comment through Dec. 10.

And as Gray wrote in his opening letter, recent shifts in federal policy and funding have eroded his confidence in achieving Rhode Island’s aggressive emissions reduction plan.

“These shifts will have devastating and immediate consequences for Rhode Island’s climate planning,” Gray wrote. “While this Strategy focuses on impacts to our climate-change portfolio, the broader federal rollbacks are poised to trigger severe disruptions across energy, environmental protection, health care, and food-security systems, placing extraordinary strain on state agencies and undermining long-standing strategic investments.”

The One Big Beautiful Bill Act yanked more than $75 million in federal funding to Rhode Island for clean energy programs and related research and infrastructure projects. Before that, Biden-era federal tax credits for renewable energy were canceled, more stringent state vehicle emissions standards paused and offshore wind projects set to power New England’s grid were halted or pulled back. Even the federal grants for the climate council to hire a consultant to model state emissions output in future years were temporarily frozen.

“We’re trying to figure out ways to do this without necessarily direct monetary incentives everywhere,” Gray said.

Asked what alternative, nonfinancial incentives might be, Gray responded “I don’t know. That’s what we’re working through.”

And yet, Rhode Island still must meet the legally binding mandate to reduce carbon emissions, with the first benchmark in 2030.

“Rhode Island will forge ahead in the face of this shifting landscape and continue to collaborate across all agencies in 2026 and beyond,” the report states.

The council is charged with updating its assessment in subsequent reports issued every five years through the 2050 deadline for completion.

Establishing the goal line

As of 2023 — the most recent data available — Rhode Island produced 9.52 million metric tons of carbon, 19.5% less than the 1990 levels used as a baseline, according to data collected and analyzed by the Rhode Island Department of Environmental Management. The emissions inventory report published last week stressed the need to accelerate incentives and policies that promote a clean energy transition, warning that the existing pace of progress was not enough to meet the first incremental benchmark in 2030.

However, according to the climate council’s models, Rhode Island will meet the 2030 benchmark, which calls for reducing total emissions 45% from the 1990 baseline. This is largely thanks to state incentive programs and policy choices, such as discounts for property owners to switch to heat pumps, weatherize and make their homes energy efficient, and buy or lease battery-powered and hybrid cars, the report stated.

But achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 remains just of reach without “additional ambition,” the council’s draft strategy report states. The report outlines broad steps to speed up the clean energy transition, targeting the biggest culprits of carbon emissions: transportation, home heating and electricity use.

“We still have the challenge of ‘how do we achieve this,’ but at least now we kind of all know what the goal line is,” Gray said of the strategy report.

In order to achieve the 2050 net-zero mandate, for example, Rhode Island needs to accelerate its adoption of hybrid and battery-powered vehicles, including cars, trucks, and off-road sources like boats and airplanes. Specifically, the report recommends nearly tripling annual electric vehicle sales, from the 13,000 sold this year in the state to 36,000 by 2030.

Gray is eyeing the transportation sector with extra concern, noting that Trump has sought to repeal federal waivers letting states, including Rhode Island, adopt more stringent vehicle emissions standards.

Much of Rhode Island’s ability to achieve reductions in transportation sector emissions relies on its authority to set lower emissions standards for new cars and trucks.

“Especially when we look beyond 2030, we have a significant challenge in reducing transportation emissions,” Gray said.

Federal rollbacks have not cooled the state’s incentive program to help property owners convert from oil or gas to electric-powered heat pumps. But surging winter electricity prices have dissuaded some heat pump converts from using their new systems, Gray said.

“We need stability and certainty in electric rates so people actually use their heat pumps,” he said.

Meanwhile, the heat is on to keep selling these greener home heating alternatives.

Every home and business in Rhode Island must have a heat pump installed by 2050 to meet the decarbonization mandate, per report modeling. Achieving this overhaul requires increasing heat pump sales from the 3,000 sold in 2025 to 15,000 a year by 2030, according to the report.

Sticker shock

Convincing cash-strapped consumers and business owners to look to long-term savings versus the upfront costs of a hybrid car or heat pump conversion is not easy, Gray acknowledged. Cost was a top concern cited by residents in a series of community meetings organized by the climate change council this fall.

“There’s got to be more hesitancy now to say ‘where is this all going’ given the rhetoric coming out of the federal government,” Gray said.

But there is also a price for doing nothing — $940 million in “social costs” by 2050, according to the report.

“Decarbonization reduces spending on fossil fuels, avoids the economic and health damages caused by climate change, and delivers cleaner air and healthier communities across the state,” the report states.

Going green will also boost the state economy, adding an estimated 6,500 jobs by 2035 for work on offshore wind projects, battery storage and residential heating and cooling, the report states.

The report concludes with a call to action.

“The decarbonization and transition of our economy must be done carefully, and deliberately with affordability in mind, to meet the goals set forth in the Act on Climate,” it states. “It is important to emphasize that acting on climate change cannot be championed by state government alone. Businesses, municipalities, nonprofit leaders and residents will continue to be called up to prioritize action towards the goals of the Act on Climate.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80416/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/img_5282-2048x1536-1-1024x7681764176469.jpg?h=ddb1ad0c&itok=CeO1Gfhl,N,,2025-11-26 13:02:33.989184

He’d learned those lessons hundreds of miles north, in a suburban district in upstate New York, where early adoption meant long nights, slow chargers and plenty of guesswork.

But this time it was different. In New York, he had to do it all: secure grants, navigate RFPs, scrap old buses and install chargers that took eight hours to recharge after a single route. In South Carolina, the buses arrived, chargers installed, paperwork complete and keys ready to be handed over. Yet, despite the smoother rollout, one challenge remains the same: selecting the routes the ESBs would run on, and in South Carolina, that’s a 175-mile rural route.

Johnson, the current director of transportation at Dorchester School District 4 in South Carolina, said at his previous school district — Bethlehem Central School District in New York — ESB adoption was much more nuanced. He recalled overseeing everything from applying for grants to infrastructure set up. When he started the ESB journey in 2021, the technology was still considered new and limited charging options were available, leaving him to select Level 2 chargers with no charge management software.

“There was a lot of community support for it,” he said of purchasing EVs, noting it was a process. “Those buses were purchased through [The New York State Energy Research and Development Authority] NYSERDA, and we were able to work with our bus dealership, which was Matthews Bus in New York State. They were a really big resource.”

However, he said the NYSERDA Grant had stipulations of what routes the buses needed to be on. So, instead of placing buses on the shortest district routes, they had to be placed on Johnson’s longest routes in New York. The district purchased two more EVs outside of the grant, which they deployed on shorter routes.

In South Carolina, Johnson said the state was awarded funding from Round 1 of the Environmental Protection Agency Clean School Bus Program. And because the state owns and maintains all school buses, it handled bus procurement, infrastructure setup, charger selection, and utility collaboration. Dorchester was awarded eight ESBs. Six have already been delivered, with four currently on the road and two awaiting minor work. However, once the buses were delivered, Johnson was able to immediately start driver training and route assignments.

Routes in Dorchester, however, are long, ranging from 90 to 175 miles a day, far above the typical ESB ideal use case. The lack of shorter routes, Johnson said, creates deployment constraints. Though with the DC fast chargers installed, buses can charge in the middle of the day, allowing them to be used in both a morning and afternoon route. This was a huge difference, as in New York his chargers would take eight hours to charge, making them sometimes unable to be used during the afternoon runs. In contrast, the DC fast chargers take around three hours and only run into challenges if there’s a mid-day route that needs coverage.

In addition to their ESB operation training, drivers must ensure the buses are plugged in after each route and have sufficient charge before each trip. Plus, in New York, drivers had to consider the weather, as the range dropped about 20 miles in colder months.

“I have no surprises now when it comes to the EV buses,” Johnson said. “When something comes up, I know the steps to go through, from working with the dealership, or … with the bus distributor.”

Johnson advised transportation directors looking to implement ESBs to plan thoroughly and early, evaluating everything from route lengths to charging times and dwell windows. Plus, he said, it’s important to choose the right infrastructure where fast chargers may be essential for rural or long-mileage districts. He also advised directors to understand the grant requirements.

He noted that while initial development will reveal operational challenges, it’s a learning curve and soon directors will be familiar with the ESBs like they are with their diesel buses. Overall, he concluded, with the right planning and charging strategy, EVs don’t need to be limited to the shortest routes.",https://i0.wp.com/stnonline.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Unknown-18-1-scaled.jpeg?fit=2560%2C1920&quality=100&strip=all&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-26 13:02:37.433755

There’s a slight hitch in Constellation’s plan to construct a new natural gas-fired power plant in Maryland: The potentially prohibitive cost of delivering natural gas to the proposed Harford County site.

“We will need some help on that,” Constellation CEO Joe Dominguez told a room full of policymakers, businesspeople and lobbyists Thursday. “I was told that the gas interconnection — the extension of the gas to the site to enable these things — is something like $800 million.”

His comments came in a speech at the Maryland Chamber of Commerce’s 2025 Policy Forum at the University of Maryland, College Park. Dominguez laid out Constellation’s plans for more energy generation, challenged state lawmakers to help — both financially and in terms of policy — and railed against the idea that electric utilities, such as Exelon, would be allowed to get back in the business of power generation, in competition with Constellation.

The remarks also came as Constellation is hoping to get fast-track approval for new power generation, one of a number of measures approved this year under the Next Generation Act, as lawmakers responded to high energy bills enraging consumers.

Constellation submitted three projects to Next Generation Act approval: a larger natural gas generating facility and a smaller version, as well as a proposal for 800 megawatts of battery storage, which could contribute power onto the grid during times of peak demand.

Dominguez, for the first time, identified Constellation property near the Perryman Generating Station in Aberdeen, as the site for all three projects.

The Perryman site already hosts oil- and gas-fired generating units, but Dominguez said transporting additional natural gas to the site would still come at a steep cost, according to the company’s internal estimates. Constellation could turn to the General Assembly for help, he said.

He noted that some states, for instance, have used bonds to finance desired energy projects, Dominguez said. But, whereas regulated utilities, like those in Maryland, usually receive a guaranteed return on their investment of 10%, the state requires utilities to build the infrastructure at cost.

“They say to the utilities: ‘Look, we’ll raise, in a bond, the money and give it to you. But you don’t add 10% to the bill,’” Dominguez said in an interview.

As for the cost of connecting the Perryman plan to natural gas lines, Baltimore Gas & Electric spokesman Nick Alexopulos said in a statement that his company “has not provided Constellation Energy or any other merchant generator an estimate for work related to proposals submitted under the Next Generation Energy Act.”

“BGE is committed to working with merchant generators and other partners to solve the state of Maryland’s energy security challenges,” Alexopulos said. BGE is an Exelon company.

Dominguez said Constellation also wants assurance from Maryland policymakers that they actually want new gas generation to respond to ever-increasing power demand projections, largely from data centers. Otherwise, Constellation won’t build it, he said.

Just a few years ago, Maryland lawmakers passed the Climate Solutions Now Act, which requires the state to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions 60% from 2006 levels by 2031. Gov. Wes Moore (D) has backed a goal to meet the state’s electricity needs with 100% clean energy by 2035.

Things shifted slightly when soaring utility bills paved the way for the Next Generation Act — and potentially new gas-fired generation — but the idea of a new gas plant has unsurprisingly attracted ire from climate groups.

“You shouldn’t say: ‘I’m really upset no one is building natural gas-fired generation, and simultaneously have a policy that says anybody who builds merchant gas-fired generation has got to be out of business by 2035,” Dominguez told the crowd on Thursday.

The Next Generation Energy Act created a new regulatory fast-track through the Maryland Public Service Commission for certain energy projects. Policymakers did not explicitly call for new natural gas. Instead, they said zero-emissions projects should outnumber emissions-generating ones, and they required that any new gas plant have the potential to transition to hydrogen fuel.

Besides Constellation, only two other companies put in applications for the fast-tracked project by the Oct. 31 deadline — one for an upgrade at an existing gas plant in Prince George’s County and another entirely confidential proposal. The PSC has until late December, 60 days after the deadline, to decide which proposals will receive the expedited consideration

The PSC also opened a procurement for the state to buy battery energy storage technology, which attracted proposals from BGE and Potomac Edison, among others.

Exelon wants to build a power plant in Maryland, reversing decades of deregulation policy

If electric utilities like Exelon were to reenter the power generation business, it would reverse a Maryland policy that has stood for more than a quarter-century. It would also mean that ratepayers would foot the bill.

Constellation had been part of Exelon, but it was spun off.

“It is curious to us, as you can imagine,” Dominguez said. “Constellation was launched a little bit over 40 months ago. It was launched by Exelon because Exelon decided it did not think it was prudent to put its owner’s money into the generation business.”

“Every bit of expertise, including operating all the land, all the equipment, came with us to Constellation,” Dominguez added.

In response, Alexopulos from BGE said it’s clear that Exelon’s campaign has “struck a nerve.”

“The generation needed in Maryland won’t build itself. Instead of focusing on who shouldn’t build, we are focused on who will,” Alexopulos wrote. “Private energy generation corporations have not offered meaningful solutions sufficient to solve the supply crisis at the heart of rising energy costs, as the most recent bids for energy development in Maryland show once again.”",https://www.power-eng.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/image-22-1.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 14:00:51.770940

Is there anything else you believe is important to note about the ERCOT market, either now or potentially in the future?","The company is experienced in the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (ERCOT) market, where the upcoming Real-Time Co-Optimisation Plus Batteries (RTC+B) market changes will soon take place.

RTC introduces a new process where energy and Ancillary Services (AS) are dispatched interchangeably in the Real-Time Market, according to ERCOT. Currently, ERCOT secures AS in the Day-Ahead Market and rarely reallocates them between resources in the Real-Time Market.

This change is highly significant for BESS, which in ERCOT primarily earns revenue from Ancillary Services. It will now be dispatched on a locational basis every five minutes, shifting from a system-wide approach. Furthermore, the Plus Batteries (+B) reform will treat BESS as single units rather than combining generation and load.

Energy-Storage.news: How does Habitat optimise BESS in ERCOT?

Michael Kirschner: I use the analogy of an F1 car. You build a fast car for a specific purpose, but it doesn’t translate to driving a Honda.

Storage as an asset involves new challenges, higher-frequency controls, sophisticated responsiveness, ancillary product stacking, and dynamic system operation. Managing multiple positions requires co-optimisation and shifting obligations based on system conditions like locational marginal pricing (LMP) or system-wide metrics.

Doing this manually takes 8,760 hours annually across all products, which is brutal, so our goal is automation. Think of it as a self-driving car: install the code and infrastructure, then let it handle most tasks, with human oversight for unexpected events.

Our integrated platform delivers this: instead of a generic software-as-a-service (SaaS), we offer a tailored package for traders, operated under your optimisation agreement. You can customise it per your risk preferences, manage collateral, and get actionable insights, allowing you to focus on your core strengths while we ensure seamless integration.

What are some of the biggest things you feel like have changed since Habitat’s been optimising BESS projects in ERCOT?

RTC+B has got to be number one. It’s effectively a full reset of the system. They’re updating all their code. All of history is effectively, I don’t want to say scrapped, but I’m old enough to remember when ERCOT went through the switch to LMPs back in 2008 or 2009, and COVID. Both of those events created a singularity in some sense, where on the other side of it, you can’t use history as a guide.

As we approach 5 December 2025, which is the cutover date for RTC+B implementation, and it looks like they’re on track.

We’ve had to effectively build our tech stack twice. We built it once for the original service offering, and now we’re rebuilding it for the RTC+B framework, making it ready for what we expect to be a more volatile period as everyone re-normalises to the rules.

What are the biggest changes through RTC+B?

Well, like all governmental or quasi-governmental rules, it’s fairly complex and obtuse. I don’t think anyone really understands it, but I’ll do my best. At a high level, it’s not that difficult to understand. Other ISOs, such as PJM, do it already.

The day-ahead transaction is now purely financial, unlike before, when it involved physical assets, which was especially significant for batteries in ancillary services. Traditionally, operators submitted forecasts for load, solar, and other variables before 10 am to determine clearing prices and asset dispatch.

Now, ancillary service obligations are adjusted in real time, rather than carried over from day-ahead commitments. This shift means units must adapt quickly to changes like outages or transmission issues, often encountering illiquid markets and high penalties, which made participants conservative.

The new system allows for more flexibility, enabling assets to be reassigned obligations in real time, likely increasing volatility while lowering average prices. This change aligns with a more efficient system, potentially benefiting battery storage, and effectively shifts the day-ahead process from physical to financial.

Will optimisers be well-positioned once RTC+B starts, or will it cause headaches initially before being figured out?

Batteries and optimisers focus on volatility, profiting from price spreads regardless of market direction.

The real challenges lie in load management, risk mitigation, and how operators, especially those with non-battery assets, like combined cycle gas turbines (CCGTs) and demand response, adapt. Different players will deploy at different times, based on economic factors, technical readiness, and confidence.

Some may exit markets under new rules, causing thinner trading and potential price volatility. High prices encourage participation, stabilising the market.

The optimiser’s role remains the same, act early, adapt as competition arises, and maximise value by shifting between markets. Overall, the approach may shift slightly, but priorities stay consistent.

How precise must these strategies be for optimisation?

At the end of the day, I’m an old options trader, and I think about all of this in the context of options trading. You’re always playing in a probabilistic world. If I knew exactly what was going to happen, I’d have retired already. The goal of modelling is not to predict the future. The goal of modelling is to predict a relationship between inputs that yields outputs, which manifest when they are present.

A good model doesn’t tell you the future. A good model tells you that when the weather is mild, prices are mild, and when weather is extreme, prices are extreme, and it gets them relatively matched in order of magnitude. Then the job of the modeller, the job of the optimiser, is to determine the probabilities of those things within the context. It’s like, ‘yeah, it’s a mild summer, but tomorrow could be really hot.’ There’s local information, and we’re trying to incorporate that and be very specific about it.

We’re not trying to have a crystal ball. Typically, if you know that much information, either you’re breaking a law or you don’t need to be in the business anymore. Our job is to identify opportunities, assess the probability weightings, and be strategic about how we dispatch them. We want to contextualise that with the risk preferences of our clients. It’s not often about just making an extra dollar. It’s being smart about the dollar that we’re making.

Sometimes, that dollar can work against you – if you experience an outage, unit trips, or a part of your asset fails, such as an inverter, or if you lose communication – you’ll have to buy back that position. If you fall down, and you were the reason the price was low because you sold too cheaply, when you buy it back, it’s going to cost you quite a bit to cover, and that’s going to hurt your performance.

We assess everything with a risk-adjusted approach, using probabilistic outcome distributions and context-specific methodology for local, regional, and ERCOT-wide situations. Automation ensures consistency, quick updates, and efficiency, reducing manual errors.

Our goal isn’t always to be number one, but to consistently stay in the top decile across uncertainties, accepting that mistakes happen, while aiming to play well.

Is there anything else you believe is important to note about the ERCOT market, either now or potentially in the future?

ERCOT is akin to a prototype space due to its energy-only focus and steady growth, making it an ideal environment for development.

Our current operations are ERCOT-only, but by 2026, we plan to expand to other ISOs, leveraging our platform to serve more clients across the US.

Real-time optimisation will evolve with the integration of virtual power plants (VPPs) and green technologies, like ammonia, hydrogen, and data centres, which can cycle up and down. Our digital twins, initially battery-based, can be adapted for these new assets to enable automation and portfolio optimisation.

ERCOT is uncertain about future changes but is exploring new technologies and services, like batteries for transmission support, which require new business models. ERCOT acts as an innovation incubator in the energy sector; it’s fun to watch the ride if nothing else.",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/UBS-battery.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 14:01:07.770704

Associated Press

WASHINGTON (AP) — The Trump administration is seeking to abandon a rule that sets tough standards for deadly soot pollution, arguing that the Biden administration did not have authority to set the tighter standard on pollution from tailpipes, smokestacks and other industrial sources.

The action follows moves by the administration last week to weaken federal rules protecting millions of acres of wetlands and streams and roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live. In a separate action, the Interior Department proposed new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.

The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule last year that imposed strict standards for soot pollution, saying that reducing fine particle matter from motor vehicles and industrial sources could prevent thousands of premature deaths a year.

Twenty-five Republican-led states and a host of business groups filed lawsuits seeking to block the rule in court. A suit led by attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia argued that the EPA rule would raise costs for manufacturers, utilities and families and could block new manufacturing plants.

In a court filing this week, the EPA essentially took the side of the challengers, saying the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.

“EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule” before Feb. 7, the agency said in a brief filed with the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Vacating the Biden-era rule would revert the soot standard to a level established a dozen years ago under the Obama administration. The Trump EPA is set to propose its own rule early next year.

Environmental groups said the agency’s action — which follows a pledge by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to roll back the soot rule and dozens of other environmental regulations — threatens public health and undermines its obligations under the Clean Air Act.

“EPA’s motion is a blatant attempt to avoid legal requirements for a rollback, in this case for one of the most impactful actions the agency has taken in recent years to protect public health,” said Hayden Hashimoto, an attorney at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force.

EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said the 2024 rule would cost “hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars to American citizens if allowed to be implemented.” The rule “was not based on the full analysis of available science that the statute requires,” she said, adding that EPA will conduct a thorough review as required by the Clean Air Act.

The Biden rule set maximum levels of 9 micrograms of fine particle pollution per cubic meter of air, down from 12 micrograms established under former President Barack Obama. The rule sets an air quality level that states and counties must achieve in the coming years to reduce pollution from power plants, vehicles, industrial sites and wildfires.

“An abundance of scientific evidence shows that going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act,” Hashimoto said.

EPA said in creating the rule that the new standard would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits and 4,500 premature deaths, adding up to about $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the rule would especially benefit children, older adults and those with heart and lung conditions, as well as those living near highways, factories and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean-air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of healthy communities at Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm that represents environmental groups in the legal case.

President Donald Trump “has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money,” Simms said, adding under Zeldin, the EPA “has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives or serving children, families or communities.”

The task force’s top recommendation is to create a Clean Hydrogen Coordinating Committee, likely under the recently created Natural Resources Commission, with dedicated staff to knit together policy, permitting, workforce and economic development. The committee would succeed the task force after it expires.

Funding for more staff at the Department of Conservation & Energy and the Department of Environmental Quality is also suggested. This would allow regulators to process carbon capture and hydrogen projects faster while still handling environmental monitoring and enforcement, the report said.

A standing committee is needed to manage “a wide variety of needs across the state’s public/private landscape,” including environmental protection, regulatory streamlining, workforce training and taxpayer dollars to leverage private investment, the report said.

The task force also calls for the state to stay closely engaged with Louisiana’s congressional delegation to defend key federal incentives – especially tax credits for clean hydrogen and carbon sequestration – it describes as “crucial” to making projects financially viable.

“Louisiana is very well positioned, especially alongside Texas, to be sort of a prime mover in clean hydrogen,” said Matt Reonas, a policy planner with the state’s Office of Conservation and Energy. “The current hydrogen economy complements the state’s kind of conventional energy resources, especially natural gas.”

Louisiana already consumes about 2.5 million metric tons of hydrogen a year – roughly a third of total U.S. industrial use – largely for oil refining, ammonia fertilizer and methanol production along the Mississippi River corridor.

That makes the state “one of the nation’s top producers and consumers of hydrogen,” according to the report. Existing plants, pipelines and ports give Louisiana a head start over other regions trying to attract new investment, the report said.

At the same time, nearly all of that hydrogen is “grey” – produced from natural gas without capturing carbon pollution. The task force frames “blue hydrogen,” made from natural gas but paired with carbon capture and underground storage, as Louisiana’s primary near-term opportunity. Renewable “green hydrogen” and nuclear-powered “pink hydrogen” are longer-term options, the report said.

The report strongly endorses carbon capture and sequestration, a controversial technology that has met resistance in a number of Louisiana communities.

“The emerging hydrogen economy in Louisiana complements the state’s conventional energy mainstays especially with the demand for natural gas utilized in the production of grey hydrogen and blue hydrogen,” the report said. “For the latter, it is imperative that Carbon Capture and Sequestration plans move forward at scale.”

Evolving federal regulations have led to the cancelation of some hydrogen projects in the U.S., but Louisiana has bucked that trend, according to Lindsay Cooper Phillips, senior Gulf Coast regional policy manager with the Clean Air Task Force. She pointed to Hyundai’s planned $6 billion hydrogen-integrated steel mill in Ascension Parish as an example of a major commitment.

Hyundai officials told the task force in June the project faces significant challenges, including the high cost of hydrogen production and uncertainty around federal tax incentives.

President Trump’s One Big Beautiful Bill Act, signed into law in July, made some changes to tax credits that clean energy companies have relied on.

The bill ends the 45V clean hydrogen production tax credit starting in 2026, stripping away a key federal subsidy underpinning Louisiana’s growing hydrogen and ammonia sector.

Companies including CF Industries, Air Products and Plug Power warned that losing the credit could raise costs and jeopardize near-term hydrogen projects.

The legislation kept some incentives, including an investment tax credit and the 45Q carbon capture credit.",https://neworleanscitybusiness.com/files/2025/11/3.-68e07508105a0.image_.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 14:01:47.373619

Wes Moore a “Thanks … for nothing” card.

“We were thinking about what we wanted to thank this governor for,” said Jorge Aguilar with the group Food and Water Watch, as he held the snarky greeting card outside the Department of the Environment in Baltimore. “Our membership could not think of many things, because we think he has not delivered on many of his promises.”

Aguilar and 10 other advocates walked over from a nearby park with the large card in hand to deliver it to the environment department, where they were greeted by the department’s chief of staff, Scott Goldman.

Aguilar handed Goldman the card, walking him through the group’s many criticisms of the Moore administration. Those concerns largely centered around what the advocates see as a lack of follow-through on Moore’s energy platform that he campaigned on. They also worry Moore has backed policies that actively backtrack on clean-energy efforts.

“He signed the Next Generation Energy Act, which is going to promote new gas plants and new power plans,” Aguilar told Goldman. “This is after he promised to reach 100% clean energy by 2035. Instead, we’re going in a different direction.”

Aguilar said Moore has been “promoting data centers” which will “demand a lot of energy and a lot of water” at the expense of Maryland residents. He also pointed to the governor’s veto of a bill that would have studied the potential financial, environmental and energy effects of data centers in Maryland.

“So our hope is that in 2026, the administration rights these wrongs and does better for Maryland,” Aguilar said. “We’re here really to deliver the message that we’re pretty upset.”

Aguilar said there’s “a lot of good stuff” happening at the department, but the advocates lay the blame on Moore for “not showing leadership” in his climate policies.

Goldman respectfully listened to the group’s concerns and accepted the card.

“I will take this in, and thank you for doing all this, being out in the rain,” Goldman told the advocates. “I know we all want the same thing, I know the governor does as well.”

The Other Kevin Anderson

Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday tapped Kevin Anderson to be the new delegate from Lower Shore District 38A.

For those scratching their heads about now, we’re not talking about the Kevin Anderson who served as Maryland secretary of Commerce until January and still works in the administration. This is Howard “Kevin” Anderson, a Somerset County Republican who is the third generation to run the family farm and seed business.

Anderson fills the seat left empty by the sudden death last month of Del. Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore) who had just filed to seek election to a fifth term when he died.

Anderson was one of five candidates from the district, which includes Somerset County, southern Worcester County and a bit of Wicomico County south of Salisbury. He was chosen by the three counties’ Republican Central Committees earlier this month and forwarded to Moore.

In making the announcement, Moore called Anderson “a son of the Eastern Shore, with deep roots in Somerset County and a lifelong commitment to growing Maryland’s agricultural sector.”

“He understands the needs of his community firsthand, and I am confident that he will serve his constituents with dedication and distinction,” Moore said in a statement. “I look forward to working in partnership with Kevin to build a Maryland that leaves no one behind.”

Anderson owns and operates Wimberly Farms in Somerset County, growing corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley together with his father, wife, and two daughters, according to the announcement from the governor’s office. It said Anderson and his father also operate a seed conditioning facility where they clean, treat and bag soybean, wheat, and barley seeds, the third generation to do so.

He earned the National Young Farmer Achievement Award in 2002 from the American Farm Bureau Federation, and was named a National Outstanding Young Farmer by the Outstanding Farmers of America in 2007.

Anderson sits on the Maryland Grain Producers board of directors, and serves as vice president of the Maryland Crop Association, in addition to serving on various statewide boards, local civic clubs, and organizations to promote the seed industry.

Sandoval is new pension system investment officer

Dianne Sandoval has been tapped as the next chief investment officer for the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, the system’s board of trustees announced last week. She begins the job in January.

In her new role, Sandoval will be responsible for oversight of all pension system investments, leading the investment team, developing and implementing investment strategies, and ensuring the long-term financial health of Maryland’s pension system. She will work closely with the Board of Trustees and the Executive Director to achieve the System’s investment objectives.

Sandoval has more than 30 years of investment management experience in both the public and private sectors, according to a pension system announcement.

“We are thrilled to welcome someone with such vast experience as Dianne Sandoval to our team,” said Treasurer Dereck Davis, the SRPS board chair. “Her extensive expertise and visionary leadership will be invaluable as we continue to improve services for our members and provide strategic direction across the entire investment portfolio.”

She currently serves as the head of portfolio design for HESTA, an Australian superannuation fund that manages more than $100 billion in assets for more than 1 million members in the health and community services sectors. She has also worked at a large sovereign wealth fund and spent more than 12 years in a range of senior positions across asset allocation and strategy, private equity, and high yield/investment grade credit at CalPERS.

Comptroller Brooke Lierman, the board vice chair, said board members “recognized Dianne’s enthusiasm for and understanding of the unique responsibility of the CIO of a public pension fund. I look forward to working with her to grow our fund and ensure the security of our dedicated public employees.”

Sandoval said she was homored to be tapped for the job and “deeply committed to leveraging my global experience and expertise to drive innovative, resilient investment strategies that deliver exceptional outcomes for … Maryland’s public servants—its teachers, first responders, state workers, and local heroes who keep this state running.”

Braveboy names Okoye to planning board

Prince George’s County businessman Billy Okoye was sworn in last week as the newest member of the Prince George’s County Planning Board of The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, succeeding Dorothy Bailey, the former vice chair of the board.

Okoye, who was appointed by County Executive Aisha Braveboy and confirmed by the County Council, joined his first board meeting last week.

Prince George’s Democrats choose Harris to fill vacant District 27 Senate seat

“His experience in business, community advocacy, real estate, and technology will offer a new dynamic to our forward-thinking Planning Board and award-winning agency,” said Prince George’s County Planning Board Chairman Darryl Barnes.

Okoye, who has real estate broker’s licenses in Maryland and the District of Columbia, was founder and principal broker of Sold 100 Real Estate Inc., according to a planning board press release, as well as group managing director of BMO General Contractors. He serves as chairman of the United African Advisory Board which works to strengthen community engagement and representation under Braveboy’s office.

“My professional journey has given me a practical ground-level understanding of our County’s vision for growth as outlined in the 2035 plan – the guiding framework for sustainable and equitable development across communities,” Okoye said in a statement. “I look forward to our collaborative work to revitalize the inner-Beltway neighborhoods into vibrant, transit-oriented economic hubs that attract jobs and opportunities.”

The five-member Prince George’s County Planning Board oversees planning and zoning in the county, as well as administering the county’s public recreation program.

So for now, the batteries will draw power only from the electric co-op, Patterson said.
Once they connect to PJM, the batteries will charge when system-wide electricity consumption is down and spot prices are low.
“Burning fossil fuels is not an efficient way to generate energy,” Benforado said.
They’re efficient on the power side but also on the price side.” The march toward batteries continues Texas proves the financial case for batteries.","Two new battery projects on Virginia’s remote eastern peninsula could signal a growing trend in the clean-energy transition: midsize energy-storage units that are bigger than the home batteries typically paired with rooftop solar, but cheaper and quicker to build than massive utility-scale projects.

The 10-megawatt, four-hour batteries, one each in the tiny towns of Exmore and Tasley, represent this “missing middle,” said Chris Cucci, chief strategy officer for Climate First Bank, which provided $32 million in financing for the two units. Batteries are a critical technology in the shift to renewable energy because they can store wind and solar electrons and discharge them when the sun isn’t shining or breezes die down.

When it comes to energy storage, “we need volume, but we also need speed to market,” Cucci said. “The big projects do move the needle, but they can take a few years to come online.” And in rural Virginia, batteries paired with enormous solar arrays — which can span 100-plus acres — face increasing headwinds, in part over the concern that they’re displacing farmland.

The Exmore and Tasley systems, by contrast, took about a year to permit, broke ground in April, and came online this fall, Cucci said. Sited at two substations 10 miles apart, the batteries occupy about 1 acre each.

Beyond being relatively simple to get up and running, the systems could help ease energy burdens on customers of A&N Electric Cooperative, the nonprofit utility that owns the substations where the batteries are sited, said Harold Patterson, CEO of project developer Patterson Enterprises.

Wait times to link to the larger regional grid, operated by PJM Interconnection, are up to two years. So for now, the batteries will draw power only from the electric co-op, Patterson said. Once they connect to PJM, the batteries will charge when system-wide electricity consumption is down and spot prices are low. Then, the batteries’ owner, Doxa Development, will sell power back when demand is at its peak, creating revenue that will help lower bills for co-op consumers.

“That's the final step to try to drive down power prices” for residents of Virginia’s Eastern Shore, Patterson said. “Get it online and increase supply in the wholesale marketplace.”

Moving away from gas

Though the batteries aren’t paired with a specific solar project, they are likely to lap up excess solar electrons on the PJM grid. And since they’ll be discharged during hours of heavy demand, they could help avert the revving up of gas-fired “peaker plants.”

“Peaker plants are smaller power plants that are in closer proximity to the populations they serve, and [they] are traditionally very dirty,” Cucci said. “They’re also economically inefficient to run. Battery storage is cleaner, more efficient, and easier to deploy.”

Gas peaker plants are wasteful partly because of all the energy required to drill and transport the fuel that fires them, said Nate Benforado, senior attorney at the Southern Environmental Law Center, a nonprofit legal advocacy group.

“Then you get [the fuel] to your power plant, and you have to burn it,” Benforado said. “And guess what? You only capture a relatively small portion of the potential energy in those carbon molecules.”

Single-cycle peaker plants, the most common type, can go from zero to full power in minutes, much like a jet engine. Their efficiency ranges between 33% and 43%.

“Burning fossil fuels is not an efficient way to generate energy,” Benforado said.

“Leaning into batteries is the way we have to go. They’re efficient on the power side but also on the price side.”

The march toward batteries continues

Texas proves the financial case for batteries. The state has its own transmission grid, no monopoly utilities, and no state policies to speed the clean-energy transition. Yet it’s gone from zero to some 12 gigawatts of batteries in five years.

In Virginia, A&N Electric Cooperative isn’t the only nonprofit utility investing in energy storage: The municipal utility in the city of Danville, on the North Carolina border, announced earlier this year that it’s building a second battery project of 11 megawatts. Its first system, a 10.5-megawatt battery, which went online in 2022, is on track to save customers $40 million over two decades, according to Cardinal News.

“You look at Texas, where developers are trying to make money on projects,” said Benforado. “And now you see co-ops and municipalities saying, ‘This can save our customers significant amounts of money.’ That, to me, is very telling about the economics of batteries.”

Those economics are even rosier in light of the federal tax credits available for grid batteries, among the few green incentives to survive the budget bill that congressional Republicans passed this summer. Those credits start phasing down in 2033.

While nonprofit utilities in Virginia aren’t impacted by a 2020 state law that requires investor-owned Dominion Energy and Appalachian Power Co. to decarbonize by 2045 and 2050, respectively, they help show what’s possible for the state.

“We need to build things,” Benforado said, especially in the face of skyrocketing demand from data centers. “The question is, are we going to build clean resources or not? We need to build batteries, not gas.”

Climate First Bank and Patterson Enterprises, for their part, have more midsize energy-storage systems in the works. In fact, in December they expect to break ground on another 10-megawatt project — in Wattsville, 20 miles up the road from Tasley.

“We are talking to a lot of developers on projects ranging from 2 megawatts to 10 or 15 megawatts,” Cucci said. “A lot of those players are saying, ‘Let's shift a little more heavily into storage.’”",https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6GAlfd5fx9X1cvY34QKLZw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02OTY7Y2Y9d2VicA--/https://media.zenfs.com/en/canary_media_articles_453/68166266137308ccd0446a43f801cb9a,N,,2025-11-26 12:03:41.630131

Along with its investment, FedEx placed an initial order for 53 Harbinger electric trucks. Harbinger will deliver chassis—a mix of Class 5 and Class 6 models—ready for upfit by the end of this year.

Harbinger’s proprietary EV stripped chassis includes all major vehicle systems, which the company designs and manufactures in-house in the US. Harbinger’s vehicles are purpose-built from the ground up to be electric. As Chief Production Officer Gilbert Passin told Charged, this vertically integrated approach helps keep costs down, and delivers higher-performing, more durable vehicles than those built on legacy fossil fuel platforms.

“Any vehicle that holds up to our rigorous on-road testing and offers state-of-the-art safety features with lower total cost of ownership is win-win for drivers and for our business,” said Paul Melander, SVP of Safety and Transportation at FedEx. “As we work toward a goal to electrify the entire FedEx pickup and delivery fleet by 2040, this trifecta of performance, price and operational resilience is what we need to be able to continue to scale.”

Federal agencies have recently expanded funding for critical minerals and magnet recycling projects, signaling stronger policy support for domestic refining capacity.
Rare earth recycling represents an emerging sector for domestic supply chain development.","Electronic Recyclers International has agreed to supply ReElement Technologies with end-of-life magnet materials for rare earth oxide refining, the companies announced.

Under the arrangement, ERI will aggregate and pre-process magnet-bearing materials from its eight US processing facilities and deliver feedstock to ReElement’s Indiana operations. ReElement currently operates a commercial validation facility in Noblesville and is remodeling a 400,000-square-foot complex in Marion that is expected to start up in early 2026.

“ERI is a trusted partner to leading US technology companies and hyperscalers and their ability to efficiently source and process recycled magnet material is unmatched,” said Mark Jensen, chairman and CEO of ReElement Technologies.

ERI Chairman and CEO John Shegerian said the partnership would create “new US-based capabilities in rare earth processing with domestic and global implications.”

ReElement, a portfolio company of American Resources Corporation, says it has begun pilot shipments of rare earth oxides from its Noblesville facility, reporting purity levels exceeding 99.99%. The company reports it is taking orders from commercial and defense customers, though sustained production at volume awaits completion of the Marion facility.

Neither company disclosed tonnage commitments, processing capacity targets or capital investment figures for the expansion. ReElement has not released processing costs or pricing comparisons with imported rare earth oxides. But the partnership comes as demand grows for domestic alternatives to Chinese rare earth processing, which controls an estimated 70-90% of global refining capacity and as OEMs such as Apple explore routing end-of-life device magnets into domestic refining streams. Rare earth elements including neodymium, dysprosium and praseodymium are critical for permanent magnets used in electric vehicles, wind turbines and defense systems.

ReElement has referenced federal support including collaborations with the US defense agency and equipment financing, citing a $1.4 billion partnership, a figure that may represent projected contract value over multiple years or include development funding rather than actual procurement commitments. Federal agencies have recently expanded funding for critical minerals and magnet recycling projects, signaling stronger policy support for domestic refining capacity.

Creating a domestic market for recovered magnet waste

For ERI, which processes more than a billion pounds of electronics annually, the deal provides a domestic outlet for magnet-bearing materials as electric vehicles and e-mobility devices approach end of life. The company uses AI-driven identification systems to locate rare earth-containing components in its material streams.

Rare earth recycling represents an emerging sector for domestic supply chain development. Currently, less than 1% of rare earths globally are recycled, creating significant opportunity as companies work to scale operations and optimize processing economics to compete with established import channels.

ReElement has begun pilot shipments from its Noblesville facility, reporting purity levels exceeding 99.99%. The company plans to scale production at its Marion facility, which is expected to feature modular refining technology. As with most emerging operations in this sector, commercial-scale validation will come as the company ramps up throughput and publicly reports operational metrics. Other projects are testing bolt-on systems inside e-scrap plants to capture rare earths from shredded device streams.

Broadly, market fundamentals support the growth of magnet recycling, with multiple companies scaling capacity to handle end-of-life magnets from electronics streams. Feedstock availability is expanding with EV adoption and wind turbine retirements, policy support is strengthening for critical materials and ERI’s established infrastructure provides the material aggregation capabilities that are essential for consistent supply.

The partnership’s success will be measured by ReElement’s ability to achieve sustained commercial production at the Marion facility over the next 18-24 months, transitioning from pilot operations to full-scale throughput.

The collaboration sees the launch of a new ultra-fast EV charging site in Canton, Michigan—the first of several planned locations across the region—with additional sites slated for Dearborn and Livonia. The partnership aims to fill the void of the region’s fast charging deserts that have long been a detriment to EV uptake in the area.

The Metro Detroit area currently has 60 public sites with around 300 Level 2 chargers and 30 DC Fast Chargers (DCFC), but the region has struggled to meet the growing demand for fast and reliable charging options. The city’s plans to add up to 40 DCFC stations and 250 Level 2 chargers on city-owned land, for example, are still in development, leaving gaps in accessibility for both new and existing EV drivers.

In response, ChargePoint is rolling out ChargePoint Express Plus fast charging stations—capable of simultaneously charging two vehicles at peak speeds—at the Dabaja Brothers’ Canton site, enabling EV drivers to recharge their vehicles while shopping, dining or visiting local attractions.

This deployment is part of a broader plan to install over 40 charging ports across Dabaja-owned properties, powered by ChargePoint’s software platform, which offers real-time insights, performance monitoring and flexible pricing adjustments.

Rick Wilmer, CEO of ChargePoint, emphasised the importance of expanding EV infrastructure: “This initiative will rapidly infill the ‘fast charging deserts’ across the Detroit area, allowing drivers to quickly recharge their vehicles when and where they need to.”

Integrating EV charging into everyday spaces

The partnership between ChargePoint and the Dabaja Brothers Development Group shows how the integration of fast charging stations into high-traffic everyday spaces, such as shopping centres and dining hubs, not only supports EV drivers but also encourages local businesses to embrace the energy transition.

Michigan has received US$52 million in federal funding to build out its EV network, focusing on fast chargers along major highways. The state aims to transition its fleet to zero-emission vehicles (ZEVs) by 2033, with milestones set for infrastructure development by 2025 and 2026. The deployment of ChargePoint Express Plus stations, with their advanced cooling architecture and ability to sustain peak charging speeds, represents a significant step toward meeting this demand.

Yousef Dabaja, owner and operator of the Dabaja Brothers Development Group, explained the motivation behind the project: “We started this project because we saw a gap in our community—there was almost nowhere to charge an EV in Canton, and a similar lack of charging across Metro Detroit. Together with ChargePoint, we are bringing fast, reliable charging to the community.”

Metro Detroit’s EV infrastructure currently provides a charger every three to five miles, but the addition of ultra-fast charging stations in Canton, Dearborn and Livonia will further enhance accessibility and convenience for EV drivers. In addition, DTE Energy’s Emerging Technology Fund supports innovative projects like curbside chargers and battery energy storage solutions to improve grid resilience.",https://eu-images.contentstack.com/v3/assets/blt452efb5f3e725f7e/bltdb6c664f7772f067/69271278ad67799dc0d33ac4/ChargePoint-Dabaja_Brothers-canton-Michigan-charging-deserts.jpg?disable=upscale&width=1200&height=630&fit=crop,N,,2025-11-26 12:03:38.942827

(Bernhard Capital sold Bernhard in 2021, which has since rebranded as ENFRA.)
""We're a national company,"" said Jeff Jenkins, who got his start under Bernhard at Shaw and co-founded Bernhard Capital with him.
Bernhard Capital is small compared to national heavyweights like Blackstone, which has more than $1 trillion under management.
As Bernhard Capital continues to do that, those who worked with Bernhard said his legacy will live on in the deals, the investments and the jobs they create.","When Jim Bernhard sold The Shaw Group to CB&I in 2013, some thought he might retire.

Then nearing 60, Bernhard had grown his company from a small Baton Rouge-based pipe fabrication company into a publicly traded powerhouse with 25,000 employees, $6 billion in annual revenues and a global footprint in industrial infrastructure, energy and disaster mitigation services.

Already one of the wealthiest and most successful businessmen in Louisiana, it wouldn’t have been unreasonable if he had opted to kick back in his retirement — or pursue a second act in politics, where he was an influential Democratic Party donor.

Instead, Bernard assembled a team of his top executives from Shaw and went on to build Bernhard Capital Partners. The private equity firm, with $5.5 billion under management, is now the largest between Houston and Atlanta and one of the fastest growing in the country.

Over the past decade, the firm has launched five funds, raising money from large institutional investors and amassing a portfolio of 21 companies. Today, Bernhard Capital’s companies have 20,000 employees, nearly as many as The Shaw Group did at its peak.

In the wake of Bernhard’s death on Nov. 16, those who knew and worked with him have been reflecting on the size and scope of what he created during a career that spanned nearly five decades. To build a company of The Shaw Group’s stature would be a feat for anyone to accomplish in their lifetime.

Bernhard essentially did it twice.

“He was a big-picture guy,” said Lenny Lemoine, President and CEO of The Lemoine Company, a Baton Rouge-based construction firm that Bernhard Capital acquired in 2019 and has since tripled in size. “What some of us consider large scale was, to Jim, just what it should be.”

Growth and expansion

The story of how Bernhard built The Shaw Group is well known. He founded the company as a pipe and steel fabricator in 1986 and it quickly grew, expanding into construction and, eventually, energy services. In the 1990s, he took the company public, branching into new geographic markets and sectors like disaster management and nuclear power.

Among its 30 acquisitions over the years were IT Group, Stone & Webster, and Westinghouse Electric Corp.

When he sold the company for $3 billion in cash and stock, CB&I paid a 70% premium relative to the company’s stock price, which, at the time, was one of the largest premiums ever paid for a public company, records show.

Less well known is what Bernhard Capital does and how significant its impact is, notably in Louisiana, where 10 of its portfolio companies are based and 18 others have a presence. Together, they include nearly 7,000 Louisiana-based employees.

Bernhard Capital started out a little more than a decade ago with an initial investment fund and four companies — Epic Piping, a pipe fabricator; ATC Associates, an environmental consulting firm; Bernhard, LLC, a commercial construction and engineering firm; and, Brown and Root, formed when Bernhard Capital acquired Wink Engineering and the industrial services group from Houston-based KBR.

The fund exceeded its initial $750 million target and its four companies began to grow exponentially. Bernhard LLC, in 2016, acquired four more companies, including the firm founded by Jim Bernhard’s grandfather in 1919, Bernhard Mechanical. The new, larger company provided a variety of energy-related services, as well as mechanical and electrical construction and maintenance for clients that included state office buildings, hospitals and LSU. (Bernhard Capital sold Bernhard in 2021, which has since rebranded as ENFRA.)

Bernhard Capital launched more funds and raised more money. It acquired local architecture and construction companies, like Grace Design and Lemoine, both of which have since expanded into new services and markets.

More recently, it has branched into regulated utilities. It now owns seven natural gas, water and wastewater utilities, with another utility deal in New Mexico pending regulatory approval. Among its holdings is Delta Utilities, which purchased Entergy’s natural gas business earlier this year and now operates from corporate offices in downtown New Orleans, serving 800,000 customers and employing nearly 900 workers.

""We're a national company,"" said Jeff Jenkins, who got his start under Bernhard at Shaw and co-founded Bernhard Capital with him. ""Obviously, we are concentrated across the south but our footprint is national.""

Big picture perspective

Doing deals as a private equity firm better suited Bernhard than running a publicly traded company. At Shaw, he famously disliked the short-term focus on quarterly earnings, the investor calls and the tiresome questions about every decision.

At Bernhard Capital, he could take a longer-term approach.

“Being private, it is not about quarterly earnings and revenues but building great companies to last forever,” Jenkins said.

Granted, private equity firms are just as focused on creating returns for their investors as are publicly traded companies; they just do it differently. And Bernhard Capital has proven adept at it. Over the past decade, it has “exited” or sold six of its companies, most recently Brown & Root, with a seventh recently announced.

Though the size of the exits are not public, PitchBook has ranked its funds among the best performing in the country in total returns, which have averaged 20% net returns.

'Whole different way of thinking'

Those who knew and worked with Bernhard say one of the reasons he was so successful was that he understood businesses much better than most.

“He was one of the smartest guys I ever met,” said Jerry Hebert, CEO of Grace Design Studios, the Baton Rouge-based architecture and design firm that Bernhard Capital acquired in 2022 and subsequently quintupled in size.

Hebert remembers that in 2017, he called Bernhard, whom he knew only casually at the time, seeking to “pick his brain” about growing the firm. They met for lunch at the City Club in Baton Rouge and Bernhard spent more than an hour giving Hebert advice.

“By the time we were done, I realized he thought a whole different way,” Hebert said. “We were trying to make a living. He was trying to grow companies.""

Five years later, Bernhard Capital offered to buy a majority share in the firm. In the years since, Grace Design has acquired seven more firms around the country and now has 24 offices with 480 employees.

“He was focused on making our business the best it could be,” Hebert said.

Lemoine, who watched Bernhard diversify and grow his Baton Rouge-based construction company from $400 million in revenues in 2019 to about $1.2 billion today, said another reason for Bernhard’s success was his ""relentless drive to keep pushing.”

“Most people had no clue of just how ambitious and how fearless he was,"" Lemoine said.

“We are just getting started,” he said. “We are only 12 years old. We have an amazing team that has been together since the beginning.”

The firm's latest fund has a $2 billion target, its largest yet, records filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission show.

Bernhard Capital is small compared to national heavyweights like Blackstone, which has more than $1 trillion under management. But it has established itself as a “middle market” player, roughly defined as firms with between $6 billion and $10 billion under management — with a focus on energy services and infrastructure.

“We build great companies in the middle market and the larger PE firms take them to the next level,” Jenkins said.

As Bernhard Capital continues to do that, those who worked with Bernhard said his legacy will live on in the deals, the investments and the jobs they create.

“He focused a lot of time and effort on the state,” Hebert said. “He could have gone anywhere. He stayed here to try to make it better for the people who lived here. That will live on for a long time.”",https://bloximages.newyork1.vip.townnews.com/nola.com/content/tncms/assets/v3/editorial/a/e8/ae8934ad-4298-5489-b9e4-0b01373e126c/5e9d0a546cd62.image.jpg?crop=1211%2C636%2C0%2C389&resize=1200%2C630&order=crop%2Cresize,N,,2025-11-26 18:01:32.939551

While the Genesis Mission EO says the mission will “dramatically accelerate scientific discovery” and “enhance workforce productivity,” the DOE gets more specific, saying the Genesis Mission will “double the productivity and impact of American science and engineering within a decade.” Gil, as under secretary for science and Genesis Mission director, said, “We are linking the nation’s most advanced facilities, data, and computing into one closed-loop system to create a scientific instrument for the ages, an engine for discovery that doubles R&D productivity and solves challenges once thought impossible.”","Before AI-powered modeling and automation tools can impact science and research, they need data. In the Genesis Mission EO, Trump directs the DOE to compile data—including open data, data derived from federally funded research, and proprietary data—into an AI platform that the DOE says “will be the world’s most complex and powerful scientific instrument ever built.”

The premise: According to the EO, the United States is facing challenges “comparable in urgency and ambition to the Manhattan Project that was instrumental to our victory in World War II and was a critical basis for the foundation of the [DOE] and its national laboratories.”

The Genesis Mission will build an integrated AI platform called the American Science and Security Platform to collect “federal scientific datasets” and the tools needed to train models and create AI agents to “test new hypotheses, automate research workflows, and accelerate scientific breakthroughs.”

The platform will include high-performance computing resources at national laboratories and “secure cloud-based AI computing environments.” It will be subject to classification, supply chain security, and federal cybersecurity standards and best practices to meet security requirements “consistent with its national security and competitiveness mission.”

The mission will combine “the efforts of brilliant American scientists, including those at our national laboratories, with pioneering American businesses; world-renowned universities; and existing research infrastructure, data repositories, production plants, and national security sites—to achieve dramatic acceleration in AI development and utilization.”

Who’s in charge: The EO defines a management structure that will see political appointees make decisions about the platform and research goals.

Secretary of Energy Chris Wright is charged with setting priorities and “ensuring that all DOE resources used for elements of the mission are integrated into a secure, unified platform,” and “may designate a senior political appointee to oversee day-to-day operations of the mission.” Under Secretary for Science Darío Gil will lead the initiative for the DOE and will “mobilize the Department of Energy’s 17 national laboratories, industry, and academia to build an integrated discovery platform.”

While Gil will lead the initiative within the DOE, the White House Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP) will provide oversight of the Genesis Mission and the research conducted under it. As outlined in the EO, the assistant to the president for science and technology (APST)—that is, the director of the OSTP, a position currently held by Michael Kratsios—“shall provide general leadership of the Mission, including coordination of participating executive departments and agencies (agencies) through the National Science and Technology Council (NSTC) and the issuance of guidance to ensure that the Mission is aligned with national objectives.”

According to Secretary Wright, “Under President Trump’s leadership, the Genesis Mission will unleash the full power of our national laboratories, supercomputers, and data resources to ensure that America is the global leader in artificial intelligence and to usher in a new golden era of American discovery.”

Brandon Williams, administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, said the Genesis Mission will “embody the very best of American ingenuity, turning science and innovation into security.”

Near-term plans: The EO starts a clock on several specific tasks, including the following:

Within 60 days—The DOE is to send Kratsios a “detailed list of at least 20 science and technology challenges of national importance” that could be addressed by the Genesis Mission and “that span priority domains consistent with National Science and Technology Memorandum 2 of September 23, 2025,” including advanced manufacturing, biotechnology, critical materials, nuclear fission and fusion energy, quantum information science, and semiconductors and microelectronics.

Within 90 days (strictly speaking, within 30 days of the DOE’s submittal of a list to the OSTP’s Kratsios)—Kratsios is to review the proposed list and, working with participating agency members of the NSTC, “coordinate the development of an expanded list that can serve as the initial set of national science and technology challenges to be addressed by the Mission, including additional challenges proposed by participating agencies through the NSTC, subject to available appropriations.”

Within 120 days—The DOE is to develop a plan for incorporating datasets from federally funded research, other agencies, academic institutions, and private-sector partners.

Within 240 days—The DOE is to review capabilities for “robotic laboratories and production facilities with the ability to engage in AI-directed experimentation and manufacturing, including automated and AI-augmented workflows and the related technical and operational standards needed.”

The shift ties federal dollars more directly to verified infrastructure data after updated state inventories sharply reduced the estimated number of lead lines in U.S. drinking water systems.

EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said the new distribution reflects the agency’s effort to ensure funding is “properly distributed to achieve maximum impact” as utilities move into the next planning cycle. Improved inventories now allow the agency to “tackle this challenge more efficiently than ever before,” he said in the announcement.

The revised national estimate stems from the first full round of service-line inventories required under federal Lead and Copper Rule Revisions.

Those inventories were due Oct. 16, 2024, and EPA spent the past year analyzing state submissions. The updated data—now presented in a public dashboard—shows about 4 million lead service lines nationwide, down from the prior 9.2 million estimate that existed before mandatory reporting.

Recent analyses of EPA-reported data show wide geographic variation in documented lines, with states such as Illinois, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Florida reporting some of the highest known concentrations.

EPA Assistant Administrator for Water Jess Kramer said the sharper data picture means the $3 billion “will go farther” because utilities “are identifying fewer lead pipes than previously believed,” the agency said.

Funding will be distributed through the Drinking Water State Revolving Fund’s lead service line replacement program created under the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act.

It can support locating, planning, design and full replacement of lead service lines. EPA also released a memorandum outlining additional flexibilities states may use when deploying this appropriation.

States that have not obligated or spent funds dating back to fiscal 2023 must submit updated plans explaining how they will deploy those awards before qualifying for additional allocations.

Under the Safe Drinking Water Act, EPA is required to redistribute unused SRF dollars, and the agency said it will work with slower-moving states to ensure money is promptly directed to systems with documented replacement needs.

A Thirsty Public

Environmental and public-health groups largely welcomed the recalibration. Clean Water Action said the decision to tie allocations to updated inventories is “a common-sense and welcome improvement” that helps direct federal support to communities with the clearest replacement needs.

The Natural Resources Defense Council has described the broader federal lead-pipe replacement framework as a significant step toward safer drinking water, noting that more precise inventory data strengthens implementation and oversight.

Water-sector organizations also responded as EPA shifted dollars based on verified data. The American Water Works Association reiterated its support for removing all lead service lines as quickly as feasible, while emphasizing that full funding—particularly for portions located on private property—remains essential for equitable and workable implementation.

Regional officials framed the corrected inventories as key to funding fairness. The Great Lakes and St. Lawrence Cities Initiative commended EPA’s use of updated state data, saying the revised allocation approach helps ensure Great Lakes states receive an appropriate share of federal lead service line replacement funding.

EPA’s action comes as utilities refine their maps of remaining lead lines and prepare multi-year capital plans.

The Seventh Drinking Water Infrastructure Needs Survey estimates $625 billion in drinking-water infrastructure needs over 20 years, including extensive pipe replacement.

Why the Fuel Cell Vehicle Market Matters — and Why Now

As the world accelerates its transition to zero-emission mobility, hydrogen-powered vehicles are emerging as a critical pillar alongside battery electric vehicles (BEVs). Fuel cell vehicles (FCVs) offer a unique value proposition: energy-efficient propulsion, long driving ranges, and rapid refueling — while producing only water vapor as emissions.

These advantages are especially relevant in applications where range, turnaround time, or heavy-duty performance matter. As governments worldwide tighten emissions norms and push for decarbonized transport systems, the market for fuel cell vehicles is gaining traction.

A latest global analysis research from Acumen Research and Consulting (ARC) offers broader view on industry data and explains where the Fuel Cell Vehicle Market is heading — and what key factors are shaping its evolution.

Fuel Cell Vehicle Market Size, Forecast & Growth Projections

According to the ARC report titled Fuel Cell Vehicle Market Size - Global Industry, Share, Analysis, Trends and Forecast 2024-2032 the global fuel cell vehicle market was valued at approximately USD 2.2 billion in 2023.

More bullishly, another snapshot of ARC's data shows a 2024 valuation of USD 2.79 billion.

Looking ahead, the market is forecast to expand to nearly USD 65.2 billion by 2032, implying an impressive compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 46.7% from 2024 to 2032.

That kind of growth would mark a dramatic shift in the global transportation sector — turning FCVs from niche, pilot-project vehicles into mainstream zero-emission alternatives.

What's Fueling the Growth — Key Market Drivers

1. Tightening Emissions Regulations and Zero-Emission Policies

Around the world, governments are accelerating their push toward carbon neutrality. Stricter emissions norms, clean-air mandates, and broader climate policies are prompting automakers to explore alternatives to internal combustion engines. As a low-emission, hydrogen-powered technology, fuel cell vehicles align well with those policy goals.

The ARC analysis highlights that environmental regulations favoring zero-emission vehicles and growing investments in hydrogen refueling infrastructure are among the main drivers of the fuel cell vehicle market.

2. Advances in Hydrogen Infrastructure & Fuel Cell Technology

The infrastructure for hydrogen refueling — long a bottleneck for widespread FCV adoption — is gradually scaling. As more hydrogen stations are established, the practicality of owning and operating fuel cell vehicles improves significantly.

At the same time, technological progress in fuel cell systems, including more efficient designs and cost reductions, is enhancing viability. Cheaper hydrogen production (especially when linked to renewable energy) is emerging as a critical enabler.

3. Advantages for Commercial, Heavy-Duty, and Long-Range Mobility

Unlike BEVs, which may struggle with long-haul or heavy-duty use due to battery weight or charging times, FCVs offer a compelling solution for commercial transport, logistics, buses, trucks, and other applications where range and fast refueling matter.

The ARC report underlines that commercial and industrial end-users are forecast to be significant adopters.

4. Growing Consumer and Corporate Demand for Sustainable Transport

As awareness of climate change and environmental health increases, both individual consumers and fleet operators are showing growing interest in clean mobility solutions. This societal shift — combined with governmental incentives and subsidies — is helping drive adoption of fuel cell vehicles.

Segment Insight — Which Vehicles, Users and Regions Lead

By Vehicle Type

Among different categories, passenger cars dominate the global FCV market. According to ARC, the passenger-car segment accounted for approximately 84% market share in 2023.

However, light commercial vehicles (LCVs) and heavy commercial vehicles (HCVs) — including buses, trucks, and other utility vehicles — are gaining momentum. Given FCVs' advantages for long-distance or heavy-duty usage, these segments offer major growth potential as infrastructure expands.

By End-User

While individual consumers represent a portion of the market, commercial and industrial users are projected to drive much of the growth. That includes fleet operators, logistics companies, public transportation agencies, and businesses seeking sustainable transport solutions.

Other end-use categories — residential, transportation (public transit), data centers, even military and defense — are mapped in the full report, reflecting a wide application scope for fuel cell technology.

Fuel Cell Vehicle Market Regional Dynamics

• Asia-Pacific (APAC): Currently leads the fuel cell vehicle market globally, supported by early adopters like Japan, South Korea, and China. Investments in hydrogen infrastructure and favorable policies have helped APAC capture a substantial share.

• Europe: Expected to record the fastest growth from 2024 to 2032, driven by strict emissions regulations, aggressive green mobility regulations, and expanding hydrogen refueling networks.

• North America and Other Regions: With increasing interest in zero-emission transportation and supportive regulatory frameworks, regions outside APAC and Europe are gradually catching up. Vehicle manufacturers are exploring FCV rollouts and hydrogen infrastructure is slowly expanding.

Challenges and Restraints — What Could Slow Down the Surge

Despite the promising outlook, several significant hurdles remain:

• High Initial Cost: Fuel cell vehicles remain expensive compared to conventional internal combustion engine vehicles or even BEVs, chiefly because of the cost of fuel cell stacks, hydrogen storage systems, and the platinum catalysts commonly used.

• Hydrogen Infrastructure Deficit: Although hydrogen refueling networks are expanding, they remain sparse outside major urban or industrial centers — especially in emerging economies. Lack of widespread infrastructure limits consumer confidence and adoption.

• Supply Chain & Production Bottlenecks: Scaling up production of fuel cell components (e.g., stacks, hydrogen tanks), establishing logistics for hydrogen distribution, and building refueling infrastructure pose significant logistical, regulatory, and financial challenges.

• Competition from Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs): BEVs — with mature infrastructure, growing consumer acceptance, and declining costs — remain strong competitors. In applications where charging infrastructure is already widespread, or where driving ranges are modest, BEVs continue to hold advantage.

These restraints mean that while the forecast is optimistic, achieving it will require coordinated action among automakers, energy firms, infrastructure providers, and policymakers.

What to Watch — Key Trends Shaping Fuel Cell Vehicle Market Dynamics

• Rapid Expansion of Hydrogen Infrastructure

Governments and private stakeholders are increasingly investing in hydrogen refueling networks. Plans for hundreds of new hydrogen stations globally will be a major catalyst for adoption — especially for commercial fleets and long-distance transport. According to ARC, hydrogen infrastructure expansion is a ""vital success factor"" for the FCV market.

• Technological Advancements and Cost Reductions

Innovations in fuel cell technology — including more efficient fuel cell stacks, cheaper catalysts, and improved hydrogen storage — will reduce the total cost of ownership, helping FCVs compete more effectively with BEVs and combustion vehicles.

• Rising Adoption in Commercial & Industrial Fleets

Because of their long range and fast refueling, FCVs are particularly well-suited for logistics companies, public transport, heavy-duty trucks, buses, and other fleet applications. As businesses strive for sustainability, this represents a major growth opportunity.

• Regional Expansion and Diversification

While APAC leads today, Europe is expected to outpace other regions in growth rate over the next decade. Increased regulatory pressure, rising consumer awareness, and proactive policies in many countries are reshaping the regional balance of the Fuel Cell Vehicle Market.

• Collaborations Across Automotive, Energy and Tech Sectors

Conglomerates and traditional automakers — along with energy companies and hydrogen infrastructure providers — are forming partnerships to scale FCV production, deploy refueling stations, and accelerate R&D. These cross-sector collaborations will be important drivers of market maturity.

Impacts on Clean Energy, Transport & Sustainability

The anticipated rise of fuel cell vehicles doesn't just reflect a shift in automotive technology — it's part of a broader transformation toward sustainable, low-emission mobility. Here's why the growth of the Fuel Cell Vehicle Market could matter at a global scale:

• Decarbonizing Transport: Transportation remains one of the largest contributors to greenhouse gas emissions globally. Widespread FCV adoption could significantly reduce CO₂ and particulate emissions, helping countries meet climate goals and improve urban air quality.

• Energy Diversification: Hydrogen — especially when produced from renewable sources — can diversify the energy mix and reduce reliance on fossil fuels. Integrating hydrogen into mobility fosters a more resilient energy ecosystem.

• Industrial and Economic Growth: Building hydrogen refueling infrastructure, manufacturing fuel cell systems, and scaling FCV production can create jobs, stimulate investment, and trigger innovation across multiple industries.

• Future-Ready Transport Solutions: For heavy-duty, long-distance, or commercial transport (e.g., freight, buses), fuel cell vehicles offer a viable, scalable alternative — especially in regions where battery-electric solutions are challenged by infrastructure or range limitations.

Key Variables That Could Shape Market Outcome

While forecasts point to robust growth, the ultimate trajectory of the Fuel Cell Vehicle Market will depend on several critical variables:

• Speed of Hydrogen Infrastructure Deployment: The availability and geographical spread of hydrogen refueling stations will influence how quickly FCVs move from niche to mainstream. Slow infrastructure roll-out could delay adoption.

• Cost of Hydrogen and Fuel Cell Technology: Cost reductions — whether through cheaper catalysts, improved manufacturing scale, or renewable-based hydrogen production — will be crucial for making FCVs cost-competitive.

• Policy & Regulatory Support: Continued incentives, subsidies, tax benefits, and regulation favoring zero-emission vehicles will play a big role. Conversely, lack of regulatory support could slow momentum.

• Competition from BEVs and Other Clean Technologies: Battery electric vehicles are continuously improving in range, charging time, and infrastructure. FCVs will need to demonstrate clear advantages, especially for commercial and heavy-duty segments, to maintain their value proposition.

• Public Perception and Market Acceptance: Consumer awareness, safety concerns about hydrogen, and willingness to switch to novel technologies all influence adoption rates. Education and outreach will matter.

A Promising Road Ahead for Fuel Cell Vehicles

The latest global analysis from Acumen Research and Consulting underscores a compelling narrative: the Fuel Cell Vehicle Market is on the cusp of a major transformation. With projections pointing to growth from a modest few-billion-dollar market today to tens of billions by 2032, FCVs are poised to become a key component of clean, sustainable mobility.

But this is not an automatic transition. Realizing that potential depends on coordinated efforts across manufacturing, infrastructure development, policymaking, and market education. The interplay of technological progress, regulatory support, and commercial demand will determine how quickly — and how widely — fuel cell vehicles are adopted.

For stakeholders in the automotive, energy, and sustainable transport sectors, the next several years are likely to be formative. As hydrogen infrastructure scales and fuel cell technology matures, fuel cell vehicles may well transform from a niche green novelty to a mainstream mobility solution — one capable of helping decarbonize transport while meeting the practical needs of range, performance, and convenience.

Once the infrastructure and administrative systems are established for EV mileage charging, extending the scheme to petrol and diesel vehicles becomes a more straightforward proposition.","UK Chancellor Rachel Reeves has confirmed a new mileage-based charge for electric vehicles that will come into effect in April 2028, marking the start of what could be a broader move to distance-based tolling – also known as road-user charging (RUC) – for all vehicles, as the UK Treasury seeks to offset declining fuel duty revenues.

The UK’s Office for Budget Responsibility has revealed that EV drivers will pay 3p per mile while plug-in hybrid owners will pay 1.5p per mile, with both rates increasing annually with inflation. The charge is expected to raise approximately £1.4 billion per year by 2029-30

For the average UK driver covering 8,500 miles annually, the new charge adds £255 to their road tax bill in 2028-29, on top of the existing £195 Vehicle Excise Duty. Speaking in Parliament, Reeves stated the measure aims to create “a fairer system for all drivers” as EV adoption accelerates.

“We strongly welcome today’s announcement by the Government setting out, for the first time in more than a decade, a shift to a distance-based national road pricing scheme,” says ITS UK’s chief executive Max Sugarman “The EV mileage charge is much needed in order to meet the emerging gap in tax revenue from falling fuel duty receipts, as our vehicle fleet electrifies, and means we can finally move to a fairer, more effective road tax system, that charges based on usage.”

However, the announcement is raising questions about implementation mechanisms as the government has said it is opting for a self-reporting system, rather than technology-based solutions proven effective in the United States.

It is reported that drivers will be asked to estimate their annual mileage at the start of the year and pay the charge upfront alongside VED. If they exceed their declared mileage, they would be required to top up the difference; if they drive fewer miles, the remainder could roll over to the following year.

The reliance on personal mileage predictions presents several implementation challenges for authorities. The self-reporting mechanism creates potential issues with accuracy, compliance and enforcement that technology-based alternatives have already addressed. Without electronic verification, the system depends on driver honesty and potentially cumbersome manual verification processes, likely through MOT testing or annual declarations, although a mechanism for verifying mileage has not been confirmed.

“The UK transport technology sector offers the proven capabilities and expertise to deliver this new road pricing scheme in a smarter, more effective way than a simple odometer reading,” says Sugarman. “The industry has the tools to introduce a road pricing system, utilising digital connectivity and roadside infrastructure, that can give policy-makers greater levers to manage their transport networks, and deliver a more effective system for the Treasury too, covering issues, for example, around foreign vehicles. We look forward to working with the Government, on behalf of the sector, as they consult on these proposals.”

Edmund King, AA president, acknowledged the complexity adding: “We will work with the government to ensure that whatever people drive, they will be treated fairly. We recognise that fuel-duty revenue is declining as drivers switch to electric vehicles. The AA is uniquely placed to assist Government in designing a fair and transparent system. The challenge is clear: it must be simple, trusted, and equitable for all road users.”

US technology-based road user charging

In contrast to the UK’s proposed self-reporting approach, several US states have successfully implemented road-user charging programmes using technology to accurately track mileage without relying on driver estimates.

Oregon launched the nation’s first operational road usage charge system, OReGO, in July 2015 after conducting pilot programmes in 2006-07 and 2012-13. The programme allows EV and high-efficiency vehicle owners to pay 2 cents per mile using various technology options including plug-in devices, built-in vehicle telematics, or manual odometer readings verified through a smartphone application. Participants receive fuel tax credits for combustion engines, and the system has operated continuously for nearly a decade.

Utah operates a similar voluntary programme for electric vehicles where drivers pay 1 cent per mile tracked through electronic devices, with the state promising participants “you’ll never pay more in the program, but you may pay less” than the alternative flat registration fee. Virginia’s Mileage Choice programme provides another operational model, allowing drivers to pay their Highway Use Fee per mile rather than as a lump sum.

These operational programmes demonstrate that technology-based distance charging is not merely theoretical but has proven feasible in practice. The systems offer multiple tracking options to address privacy concerns, from simple odometer readings to more sophisticated connected vehicle technologies, while maintaining accuracy and reducing opportunities for evasion.

Potential pathway to universal road pricing

While the UK charge initially targets only electric and plug-in hybrid vehicles, industry observers suggest this could represent the first step toward comprehensive distance-based road pricing for all vehicle types. Once the infrastructure and administrative systems are established for EV mileage charging, extending the scheme to petrol and diesel vehicles becomes a more straightforward proposition.

The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders expressed concerns about timing: “We recognise the need for a new approach to motoring taxes but at such a pivotal moment in the UK’s EV transition, this would be entirely the wrong measure at the wrong time.”

The 2028 implementation will follow a public consultation period launched after the Budget announcement, providing an opportunity for the government to consider more robust technological solutions and potentially draw lessons from international experience with road user charging systems.

As fuel duty revenues decline across developed nations – the UK currently collects over £25 billion annually from fuel duty – distance-based charging represents an increasingly common policy response. The critical question for UK traffic authorities is whether the self-reporting model will prove sufficient or whether technology-based alternatives will ultimately be necessary to ensure accuracy, fairness and compliance in a modernised road funding system.",https://s44873.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/AdobeStock_586524540.jpeg.webp,N,,2025-11-26 11:05:21.410267

30%: Tariff Turmoil At Kia May Threaten EV4, EV Pickup Truck

Kia Tasman Weekender concept

For a while, I've been saying the obvious: whoever first figures out a Toyota Tacoma-sized EV truck with decent range for the U.S. market is going to print money. Especially if the pricing isn't outrageous. But that's looking less and less likely to be the reported electric Kia Tasman variant, and tariffs old and new are to blame.

At last week's LA Auto Show, Kia America's VP of marketing, Russell Wager, spoke to us as well as Car and Driver. And he told the magazine that tariff costs are a huge part of why the Korean automaker is retooling all of its current plans. For many years, the tariff rate on South Korean imports stood at zero. Under President Donald Trump, they shot up to 25% most of this year, and now it's down to 15%, the same as it is for Japan and Europe.

That means they're playing a different ball game now, and as I speculated before, it's why the affordable Kia EV4 sedan is a no-go for the U.S. now. From C&D:

But as a top U.S. executive of the Korean brand explained to Car and Driver this past week at the Los Angeles auto show, unease over Kia's upcoming EVs is only a portion of the tariff-related turmoil it faces this year that might reshape product lineup and pricing.

We asked Kia America VP of marketing Russell Wager to get a little more specific about what's behind the indefinite delay on the EV4 confirmed in October for what it had termed changing market conditions. Standing alongside the debut of a sharp new Telluride SUV lineup at the show, Wager quipped: ""Can you give me the answer of when the tariffs are going to be resolved in Mexico, Canada, and Seoul? If you give me that answer, I'll be as specific as possible.""

[...] Part of the issue is that they can't currently know where EV demand will settle. The U.S. EV market had been growing steadily, up to about 10 percent prior to the ending of the EV tax credit; but Kia saw just 4 percent last month. Wager said he doesn't think we'll see a true indicator until February or March 2026 because the end of the tax credit may have pulled some shoppers six months forward.

Wager said that if they can get to a stable tariff situation, the case for the EV4 will be reevaluated. ""At that point in time we look at it and say, are we at 25 [percent], are we at 15—and then we can build our business case. It was originally designed and engineered when the tariffs were zero percent.""

Emphasis mine there. And Wager added that while Kia previously announced an electric truck for the U.S. market—presumed to be derived from the Kia Tasman sold elsewhere in the world—that plan is also back to the drawing board. That truck would face 15%-25% tariffs plus the existing Chicken Tax, so it's kind of a no-go.

C&D's article is worth a read in full. But let's unpack this a bit more here.

It's true that Korea's Hyundai Motor Group builds a lot of cars in America, its largest and most important global market. It now has a giant plant in Georgia meant to make EVs and hybrids. But it has nowhere near the vast American manufacturing footprint as, say, Toyota. And that almost doesn't matter. Toyota is still looking at a $9 billion tariff bill in the current financial year. Ford Motor, which makes 80% of its cars in the U.S., is looking at $2 billion in annual tariff costs.

And Hyundai and Kia? That's $1.24 billion and $835 million in just the third quarter. Even U.S. production still means sourcing foreign parts and incurring serious tariff costs.

When you think of the increased costs of developing EVs and batteries, and making both more affordable, it's no wonder that carmakers have to put their eggs in other, more profitable baskets—even if they happen to make those cars in America. It's not just the lack of tax credits that's hurting electric momentum now.

60%: Are Safety Features Making New Cars Too Expensive?

RAV4 Safety

But it's not fair or accurate to blame the skyrocketing costs of new cars just on tariffs. That had been happening since around the pandemic. Is it outright corporate greed, or just too many required safety features on new vehicles? That's what Senate Republicans aim to say at a hearing in January, according to the Wall Street Journal:

Senate Republicans in January plan to criticize requirements for safety technology, such as automatic emergency braking and alarms to remind drivers that a child is in the back seat, arguing they are ineffective and will unnecessarily drive up the cost of cars, according to people familiar with the situation.

Chief executives of Detroit’s three automakers and a senior Tesla executive have been summoned to appear at a hearing of the Senate Committee on Commerce, Science and Transportation—set for Jan. 14—to explain why vehicles have become so expensive. General Motors and Ford Motor are weighing whether to send their CEOs to the hearing, spokespeople said; Jeep-maker Stellantis declined to comment.

Sticker shock is hitting car buyers as the U.S. broadly faces what many consider to be a growing affordability crisis. The average price of a new vehicle hit $50,000 this fall, up from closer to $38,000 before the coronavirus pandemic. Meanwhile, all facets of car ownership—from repairs to loans to insurance—have become costlier.

“Americans have been clear that they are hyper-focused on affordability,” Sen. Ted Cruz (R., Texas), who chairs the committee, said in announcing the hearing.

The story says that Republicans on the committee aim to say that seat belts and vehicle crashworthiness have done the most to improve safety, but that happened decades ago, and the results have been diminishing since. About 40,000 people in America die in traffic crashes each year. Automakers and their lobbying groups have long complained about safety tech requirements they feel are onerous, but there are other reasons for rising vehicle costs as well, including the shift to large trucks and SUVs in America, inflation, a need to invest in new technologies, and so on.

I do wonder how they'll square this with their desire to advance autonomous vehicles in America, which presumably will need advanced safety features so they don't add to that death toll.

Meanwhile, automakers know they have to find some way to stay ahead of the likes of BYD and the other Chinese firms. And for Volkswagen, that means running a Chinese automaker playbook. So far, it seems to be working. From Bloomberg:

Volkswagen AG said it will be able to slash electric vehicle development costs in China by as much as 50% for some models, bolstering the German automaker’s efforts to catch up with fast-moving local rivals such as BYD Co.

The manufacturer’s new €2.5 billion ($2.9 billion) test center in Hefei is enabling the reduction by integrating software, hardware and vehicle validation under one roof, VW said Tuesday. The efficiency gains, which also include 30% faster development, are measured against an older local EV platform. They’re possible in individual projects like one focusing on compact cars for the Chinese market.

“Our customers here expect rapid innovation and flawless quality,” said Ralf Brandstätter, who oversees the automaker’s Chinese operations.

Volkswagen is launching a range of ""by-China, for-China"" EVs and hybrids using local automaker partners for help. But I wonder if these manufacturing techniques could be imported to the West to cut production costs on other cars, too.

100%: What Safety Systems Are You Willing To Live Without?

It feels dubious at best that safety tech is why new cars are so expensive. But it begs the question: what can we live without, then? I've gotten pretty spoiled by backup cameras in new cars. And automatic emergency braking systems are pretty proven to save lives. So if we're cutting costs, what are we willing to sacrifice? Drop your thoughts in the comments.

The US has established a new fund to invest in critical minerals alongside Orion Resource Partners and Abu Dhabi’s ADQ, as the Trump administration seeks to challenge Beijing’s dominance of resource supply chains.

The three partners have made initial capital commitments totaling $1.8 billion and are targeting an eventual pool of $5 billion, according to a statement released by Orion on Thursday. The investment from the US International Development Finance Corp. is a key step in President Donald Trump’s push to secure minerals deals around the world.

Bloomberg News reported in September that the DFC and Orion were in talks to set up a joint fund.

Under Trump, the US government has made it a priority to shore up access to strategically important minerals such as copper, cobalt and rare earths, which are required for the defense industry and the energy transition. There is widespread anxiety among Western leaders about the future availability of such materials, given concerns about insufficient investment and China’s grip on supply chains.

“We will go where the rocks are,” Orion Chief Executive Officer Oskar Lewnowski said in an interview. “I believe the approach we’re underlining and leading with is that a public-private partnership has unique attributes that allow us to succeed where others may have not succeeded in the past.”

The DFC – created toward the end of Trump’s first term – is co-founding the Orion Critical Mineral Consortium to help the US and allied nations “develop secure, responsible, and resilient supply chains for the critical minerals that underpin future economic growth and security,” according to the statement Thursday.

The DFC’s initial investment is being matched by funds managed by Orion and ADQ. The consortium will favor “investments in existing or near-term producing assets,” rather than early-stage exploration projects, the statement said.

The fund was created “to establish a robust pipeline of secure critical mineral investments vital to advancing American economic prosperity,” Ben Black, chief executive officer of the DFC, said in the statement. Lewnowski wouldn’t rule out further investment by the DFC, but said they’re “happy” with the $600 million the DFC has already committed.

The US signed a landmark agreement with Australia this week to boost America’s access to rare earths and other minerals. The Trump administration is pursuing a similar bilateral deal with the Democratic Republic of Congo, the world’s No. 1 producer of cobalt and second-biggest source of copper. The US government has also made direct equity investments in mining companies since Trump returned to the White House.

Lewnowski declined to reveal any specific projects under consideration by the new venture but confirmed Chinese ones would not be among them.

He said the consortium is looking for new investors, including other countries, sovereign wealth funds, private-sector partners and other US agencies. The consortium will be investing in midstream and upstream projects in the supply chain, including potentially smelting.

Orion is a major financier to the mining industry, with about $8 billion in assets under management and a business spanning private equity to commodity trading. At the start of the year, the New York-based firm announced a $1.2 billion venture with Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth fund ADQ.

The London-based investment firm targets North American solar power plants.

Its NAV amounted to USD198.3 million or 64 US cents per share at September 30, down 1.1% on-quarter from USD200.5 million or 65c per share, as at June 30.

On-year, NAV slipped 14% from USD230.6 million or 75c per share.

US Solar Fund shares were down 5.4% at 25.83 pence on Wednesday afternoon in London.

According to the firm, wait times for new components and ""downtime of projects identified for capital initiatives"" dragged on quarterly performance, alongside grid outages and site theft.

Over the nine months to the end of September, production among the firm's energy assets fell by 11% due to ""technical"" factors, and declined a further 0.5% on weather conditions.

The firm intends to keep its focus on solutions for unplanned outages, having avoided further inverter losses through its ""spare parts"" strategy. Work on two sites singled out for capital investment has completed, US Solar Fund added.

It has declared a third-quarter dividend of 0.875c per share, in line with the new target for a total dividend of 3.5c, which came into effect in the third quarter.

A year earlier, the quarterly payout was 0.56c, with the prior total dividend target being 2.25c.

Christmas trees face 'perfect storm of mass mortality' Drought was also an issue this year for Christmas tree growers in Michigan, one of the nation's top Christmas tree-producing states, according to Bill Lindberg, an educator in Michigan State University Extension who works with farmers statewide.

Making Christmas trees more resilient is especially important in the face of long-term changes to the environment.
""Christmas trees are our legacy,"" he said.","Steve Ottman was born to sell Christmas trees.

Ottman, 73, said his family has been growing the holiday staple in Wisconsin since the Great Depression. But now his 50-acre Christmas tree farm just outside of Belleville is in trouble.

Drought struck parts of the state earlier in 2025, killing nearly half of his young trees. ""We're not big enough that we can afford to irrigate, so we rely on the good Lord to water our trees for us,"" Ottman said.

In the weeks leading up to Christmas, he'll still be able to harvest and sell his older trees, but in the coming years, ""we'll definitely be short,"" Ottman said.

Christmas tree farmers like Ottman around the country are dealing with drought, disease and damage from severe weather events – threats that are being exacerbated by climate change. But help is on the way: Researchers in North Carolina are working to produce genetically-superior Christmas trees that will not only withstand pests and disease, but also grow faster, be perfectly shaped and drop fewer needles around your house.

""There's always room for improvement,"" said Justin Whitehill, director of the Christmas Tree Genetics Program at North Carolina State University.

Christmas trees face 'perfect storm of mass mortality'

Drought was also an issue this year for Christmas tree growers in Michigan, one of the nation's top Christmas tree-producing states, according to Bill Lindberg, an educator in Michigan State University Extension who works with farmers statewide.

Lindberg said his colleagues are working to develop strategies farmers can use when planting young trees, like mulching and irrigation, to protect them from the erratic precipitation patterns they expect to see more of in the future.

Researchers in Michigan, which will provide the White House Christmas tree in 2025, were also recently awarded a grant to study armillaria and phytophthora root rot, which Lindberg said are ""significant challenges that growers have faced and will continue to face.""

Growers in North Carolina, another leading Christmas tree producing state, have also been fighting phytophthora root rot, a fungus that eats away at a tree's root system, according to Whitehill. He said increasingly shorter, warmer winters and worsening extreme weather events like Hurricane Helene are putting stress on the state's Fraser firs, making them even more susceptible to pests and disease.

""We're seeing more and more drought and more harsh conditions and having the roots degraded of our trees by this pathogen is sort of creating a perfect storm of mass mortality events across the US for some Christmas tree species,"" said Whitehill.

Whitehill said that while many Christmas tree growers were personally affected by Helene, the impact on the crop overall was ""really minimal"" because the trees grow at such high elevations they're protected from floodwaters. The storm unleashed devastating floods that washed away homes and killed at least 250 people across the region.

The Cartner family farm, which provided the White House Christmas tree in 2024, lost about 7,000 trees in the storm, a fraction of their total stock. Jerry Moody, the extension director for North Carolina's Avery County, previously told USA TODAY five farmers in the area that lost a collective $30 million in crops.

Landslides and other storm-related events caused approximately $125 million in losses of ornamental nurseries and Christmas trees, including the money and time spent growing those trees, according to a report from the National Centers for Environmental Information.

Perfecting the 'Cadillac of Christmas trees'

To combat these threats, Whitehill and his team are working to create the perfect Fraser fir, a variety already known as the ""Cadillac of Christmas trees."" Over the course of more than four decades, researchers have been selectively breeding the best of these firs to produce ""elite"" offspring, according to Whitehill, director of the Christmas Tree Genetics Program.

The team harvested cones from their elite seed orchard for the first time in 2025 and hope to distribute 500 pounds of seeds in the spring, Whitehill said. Though the genetically improved trees will grow faster than their standard counterparts, he said it'll still take about a decade before they make it to consumers' living rooms.

Unlike traditional Christmas trees which must be pruned to have the perfect silhouette, the elite trees will naturally have the conical shape customers expect, which will help growers reduce labor costs, according to Whitehill. And while some species of trees drop between 15% and 30% of their needles over the course of the holiday season, the elite trees are expected to shed less than 2% of their needles.

Whitehill said researchers are also using more advanced techniques and gene-editing technology to create trees that are resistant to pests and disease, a problem that can't be addressed through traditional breeding.

In order to fight phytophthora root rot, for example, researchers are ""grafting"" Fraser firs with an Asian fir species that has natural immunity, Whitehill said. He said the process essentially involves gluing the tops of Fraser firs to the root system of the resistant species.

""We hope that's going to be sort of a short term solution,"" Whitehill said. ""The long term solution to this problem we've identified is we're working to identify the genes from that resistant Asian fir species and we're trying to move those genes from the Asian species into Fraser fir.""

Making Christmas trees more resilient is especially important in the face of long-term changes to the environment. Though the North Carolina mountains are still ""the perfect spot"" for growing Fraser fir, Whitehill said changes in the amount of precipitation have already caused growers in the southern part of the state to close up shop over the years.

""It is a concern if we are unable to develop some of these solutions in the near future, in the next I would say 20 years, that it's possible there could be some shifts in Fraser fir production,"" he said.

Creating the perfect Christmas tree will inevitably be good for business in an industry that netted $533 million in sales in 2022, according to the most recent figures available from the U.S. Department of Agriculture.

But back in Wisconsin, Ottman said the best part of keeping the tradition alive is bringing joy to the customers. Ottman, who has balanced pruning and planting with a career as a police officer for thirty years, hopes his children will take over for him one day.

The government’s Clean Energy Jobs Plan confirmed that Scotland will benefit from up to 60,000 clean energy jobs by 2030, a 40,000 increase from 2023.
North Sea oil and gas production is in natural decline, with a 75% reduction in production occurring between 1999 and 2024.","The North Sea – its communities, workers, businesses and supply chains – will be at the heart of Britain’s clean energy and industrial future as the UK government has today (26 November) published a landmark plan to protect existing jobs and deliver the next generation of good, new jobs.

The North Sea will continue to power Britain for many decades to come, but declining oil and gas reserves over last 20 years has seen more than 70,000 jobs lost in the last decade and left an urgent need to act now to secure its long-term future.

After years of inaction, the government is charting a new course for the North Sea, providing a global blueprint for a fair, managed and prosperous transition to future proof the sector. The new North Sea Future Plan, published today, sets a clear path to grow clean energy industries, support the management of existing oil and gas fields for their lifespan, and help North Sea workers and communities make the transition.

The plan implements the government’s manifesto commitments to manage existing fields for the entirety of their lifespan, and to not issue new licences to explore new oil and gas fields. This puts the UK at the forefront of global efforts to tackle the climate crisis, reflecting the science of new fossil fuel exploration being incompatible with limiting warming to 1.5C.

As part of this, the government will introduce new Transitional Energy Certificates which will enable limited oil and gas production on or near to existing fields - so long as this additional production does not require new exploration and is already part of or links back to existing fields and infrastructure, and is necessary for a managed, orderly and prosperous transition.

Following extensive consultation with workers and unions, the government will also establish the North Sea Jobs Service - a world-leading national employment programme offering tailored end-to-end support for the current workforce seeking new opportunities in growing industries across the government’s industrial strategy sectors, including clean energy, defence, and advanced manufacturing.

This service will provide support in every step of a worker’s career journey - from clarity on future roles, to training and securing an offer for a good job. It builds on the expansion of the Energy Skills Passport to new roles and sectors, and up to £20 million funding from the UK and Scottish Governments, following demand for the Aberdeen skills pilot to help oil and gas workers retrain.

Energy Secretary Ed Miliband said:

The North Sea’s workers and communities have helped power our country and our world for decades. This is our plan to ensure they continue to do so for many decades to come.

This is a world-leading plan with workers, unions, businesses, and communities at its heart, and implements in full the government’s manifesto commitments. It is a plan which will ensure that the North Sea is an energy powerhouse throughout the twenty first century.

The government will also launch a new minister-led delivery board of experts from across the industry and trade unions, who will meet regularly to oversee the progress, coordination and long-term planning of the North Sea’s industrial transition.

The North Sea Future Plan is centred around the following three areas:

Growing clean energy industries

the North Sea is Britain’s greatest asset in the government’s mission to become a clean energy superpower, which has galvanised over £62 billion of private investment across Britain since July 2024

it comes alongside the most significant programme of government investment in homegrown clean energy in British history - with £63 billion in government funding over this Parliament confirmed at the Spending Review earlier this year

a new five-year plan, announced today, will help supply chain companies to plan ahead for a pipeline of projects across the North Sea

the government’s modern Industrial Strategy, announced earlier this year, will unlock billions in investment and support 1.1 million new well-paid jobs over the next decade. This includes high growth sectors where the skills and expertise of oil and gas workers are in demand - including advanced manufacturing, defence and construction

Support the management of existing oil and gas fields for their lifespan

ban on new licences will end new exploration for offshore oil and gas fields. It will also mean an end to new onshore licences in England, helping to meet the government’s commitment to end fracking

new Transitional Energy Certificates will enable limited oil and gas production in areas that are already part of an existing field, or in areas adjacent to already licensed fields, linked via a tieback - to help ensure they remain economically viable and are managed for the entirety of their lifespan. Developers will not be permitted to explore for oil and gas at these new sites

changes to the North Sea Transition Authority’s objectives and powers to reflect the changing nature of the North Sea basin. The regulator will balance decisions against three primary objectives that build on its existing role - to maximise societal economic value, support the Energy Secretary in meeting net zero goals, and consider the long-term benefits of the transition for North Sea workers, communities and supply chains

Help North Sea workers and communities make the transition

the new North Sea Jobs Service will launch next year to offer end-to-end career support for oil and gas workers to take up new opportunities in growing Industrial Strategy sectors, from clean energy to defence, and advanced manufacturing. It builds on a similar programme run by the Ministry of Defence to support armed forces leavers into new roles

upskilling workers – the North Sea Jobs Service will link up with workforce initiatives announced last month in the Clean Energy Jobs Plan - including tailored training backed by up to £20 million from UK and Scottish Governments, and the Energy Skills Passport that supports workers to move between sectors, and is set to expand to nuclear and networks, in addition to offshore wind

a new Fair Work Charter between offshore wind developers and trade unions to ensure that companies benefiting from public funding provide decent wages and strong workplace rights

Stuart Payne, Chief Executive of the North Sea Transition Authority said:

This plan provides clarity and direction for the energy industry, as well as for the North Sea Transition Authority as an organisation.

We will work together with government and industry to ensure that we continue to drive forward the transition as an enabling regulator, delivering the next chapter for the North Sea and all who rely on it.

Notes to Editors

The government is actively scaling up Britain’s clean energy industries and wider industrial supply chains. This includes:

£9.4 billion government backing for carbon capture, usage and storage projects, over this Parliament – including development funding for Acorn and Viking projects in Scotland and the Humber.

The government and Great British Energy have joined forces with industry and The Crown Estate to invest £1 billion in offshore wind supply chains, announced earlier this year.

A commitment of at least £5.8 billion from the National Wealth Fund over this Parliament to invest in ports, hydrogen, carbon capture, gigafactories, and green steel, as announced earlier this year.

Over £500 million government funding in hydrogen infrastructure, which will support the development of the first regional hydrogen network to be in operation from 2031.

Over £2 billion in government funding allocated to eleven hydrogen projects last year. A further 27 hydrogen projects have progressed to the next stage of the second hydrogen allocation round – as announced earlier this year.

The North Sea Future consultation response is available here.

On 1 October the Energy Secretary confirmed plans to bring forward legislation to end new onshore oil and gas licensing in England, including new licences that could be used for high volume hydraulic fracturing for shale gas extraction (“fracking”).

The government published new environmental impact assessment guidance in June which allowed offshore developers to restart applications for consent to extract oil and gas in already-licensed fields - a process which had been paused since the Finch Supreme Court judgment.

Data from Offshore Energies UK shows that over 70,000 jobs were lost in the North Sea oil and gas sector between 2016 and 2023.

In Scotland, any expansion of the Energy Skills Passport to nuclear would only be in relation to nuclear decommissioning.

“DEC's Air Pollution Mitigation grant program builds on the successful Community Air Monitoring initiative to identify sources of pollution in partnership with community stakeholders.
DEC uses existing air quality data, air quality model results, and information on local sources of air pollution to better understand the community's concern.
In August 2024, DEC completed the collection and analysis of air quality data for the statewide Community Air Monitoring Initiative.
This initiative gathered air quality data in 10 disadvantaged communities with some of the highest air pollution burdens across New York.","New York State Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC) Commissioner Amanda Lefton today announced $1 million in grant funding for two projects that will support effective action to reduce air pollution and exposure within disadvantaged communities (DAC) and environmental justice (EJ) communities. The awards, funded through DEC's Air Pollution Mitigation grant program, support the Statewide Community Air Monitoring (CAM) initiative and its ongoing work to identify and prioritize sources of air pollution and mitigation strategies in partnership with community stakeholders.

“Reducing the impacts of air pollution and vehicle emissions is vital to the long-term health and well-being of New Yorkers living in disadvantaged and environmental justice communities,” Commissioner Lefton said. “DEC's Air Pollution Mitigation grant program builds on the successful Community Air Monitoring initiative to identify sources of pollution in partnership with community stakeholders. Under the leadership of Governor Kathy Hochul, DEC remains committed to this transformational work and looks forward to the results of the New Rochelle and Buffalo projects.”

The funded projects are designed to reduce or mitigate emissions or air pollution in areas with higher air pollution levels and negative quality of life impacts from noise and odors due to an inequitable distribution of air pollution sources.

The following projects were awarded funding:

Buffalo Prenatal-Perinatal Network, $500,000: funding will support a project to enhance indoor air quality and maternal health by utilizing cost-effective air filtration devices and community education initiatives. The project will focus on improving health outcomes for sensitive populations in Buffalo’s disadvantaged communities, including African American and Hispanic families and their newborns.

Energy Justice Law and Policy Center, $500,000: funding will support efforts by Clean Air New Rochelle, led by the Energy Justice Law and Policy Center in partnership with the city of New Rochelle, to monitor air quality in DACs within The LINC. The $45 million City-proposed mitigation-focused infrastructure project is in a high-traffic corridor area with goals to restore street connections, improve traffic flow, install green infrastructure, and create community spaces. Energy Justice Law’s project will engage communities to monitor and evaluate these reduction methods in areas near sensitive populations by evaluating the effectiveness of air pollution exposure reduction strategies, including effects of traffic rerouting the planting of trees and the use of vegetative barriers near busy roadways.

Buffalo Prenatal Perinatal Network, Inc. CEO Luanne Brown said, “Pregnancy is a critical window when environmental stressors like air pollution can have profound impacts on both mother and child, something that often bears a disproportionate impact on disadvantaged communities like Buffalo. With support from Governor Hochul and the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and in collaboration with our partners, Dr. Lina Mu and Meng Wang, School of Public Health and Health Professions, University at Buffalo, hundreds of pregnant women will receive a low-cost air purifier to reduce household air pollution. This community-based intervention program will help reduce maternal complications, improve birth outcomes, and provide long-term benefits for child development.”

Energy Justice Law and Policy Center founder and Executive Director Raya Salter said, “This grant allows us to pair cutting edge air-monitoring with community leadership. By tracking the real impacts of mitigation projects in New Rochelle’s frontline communities, we’re building a model for municipal, community-driven air-pollution solutions and, with the DEC, advancing the Climate Act.”

Community Air Quality

Residents and community-based organizations often approach DEC when they have air quality concerns. DEC uses existing air quality data, air quality model results, and information on local sources of air pollution to better understand the community's concern.

In August 2024, DEC completed the collection and analysis of air quality data for the statewide Community Air Monitoring Initiative. This initiative gathered air quality data in 10 disadvantaged communities with some of the highest air pollution burdens across New York. DEC created an overview of the initiative and detailed interactive “story maps” of the 10 communities using the monitoring results, including mapping tools to display the mobile monitoring findings, air pollution sources, and locations of sensitive populations like schools, daycares, playgrounds, public housing, and nursing homes.

As part of the Community Air Monitoring Initiative, DEC continues to partner with communities around New York to help address air pollution and quality of life impacts and the emissions contributing to climate change. DEC is working with CAM communities to collect input and recommendations for air pollution reduction strategies that will be compiled in a report and released early next year.

DEC will consult with the Climate Justice Working Group and oversee the next phase of the Community Air Monitoring initiative in collaboration with local stakeholders and other state agencies to develop statewide mitigation strategies to improve air quality in DACs based on community input.

Wes Moore a “Thanks … for nothing” card.

“We were thinking about what we wanted to thank this governor for,” said Jorge Aguilar with the group Food and Water Watch, as he held the snarky greeting card outside the Department of the Environment in Baltimore. “Our membership could not think of many things, because we think he has not delivered on many of his promises.”

Aguilar and 10 other advocates walked over from a nearby park with the large card in hand to deliver it to the environment department, where they were greeted by the department’s chief of staff, Scott Goldman.

Aguilar handed Goldman the card, walking him through the group’s many criticisms of the Moore administration. Those concerns largely centered around what the advocates see as a lack of follow-through on Moore’s energy platform that he campaigned on. They also worry Moore has backed policies that actively backtrack on clean-energy efforts.

“He signed the Next Generation Energy Act, which is going to promote new gas plants and new power plans,” Aguilar told Goldman. “This is after he promised to reach 100% clean energy by 2035. Instead, we’re going in a different direction.”

Aguilar said Moore has been “promoting data centers” which will “demand a lot of energy and a lot of water” at the expense of Maryland residents. He also pointed to the governor’s veto of a bill that would have studied the potential financial, environmental and energy effects of data centers in Maryland.

“So our hope is that in 2026, the administration rights these wrongs and does better for Maryland,” Aguilar said. “We’re here really to deliver the message that we’re pretty upset.”

Aguilar said there’s “a lot of good stuff” happening at the department, but the advocates lay the blame on Moore for “not showing leadership” in his climate policies.

Goldman respectfully listened to the group’s concerns and accepted the card.

“I will take this in, and thank you for doing all this, being out in the rain,” Goldman told the advocates. “I know we all want the same thing, I know the governor does as well.”

The Other Kevin Anderson

Gov. Wes Moore on Tuesday tapped Kevin Anderson to be the new delegate from Lower Shore District 38A.

For those scratching their heads about now, we’re not talking about the Kevin Anderson who served as Maryland secretary of Commerce until January and still works in the administration. This is Howard “Kevin” Anderson, a Somerset County Republican who is the third generation to run the family farm and seed business.

Anderson fills the seat left empty by the sudden death last month of Del. Charles Otto (R-Lower Shore) who had just filed to seek election to a fifth term when he died.

Anderson was one of five candidates from the district, which includes Somerset County, southern Worcester County and a bit of Wicomico County south of Salisbury. He was chosen by the three counties’ Republican Central Committees earlier this month and forwarded to Moore.

In making the announcement, Moore called Anderson “a son of the Eastern Shore, with deep roots in Somerset County and a lifelong commitment to growing Maryland’s agricultural sector.”

“He understands the needs of his community firsthand, and I am confident that he will serve his constituents with dedication and distinction,” Moore said in a statement. “I look forward to working in partnership with Kevin to build a Maryland that leaves no one behind.”

Anderson owns and operates Wimberly Farms in Somerset County, growing corn, soybeans, wheat, and barley together with his father, wife, and two daughters, according to the announcement from the governor’s office. It said Anderson and his father also operate a seed conditioning facility where they clean, treat and bag soybean, wheat, and barley seeds, the third generation to do so.

He earned the National Young Farmer Achievement Award in 2002 from the American Farm Bureau Federation, and was named a National Outstanding Young Farmer by the Outstanding Farmers of America in 2007.

Anderson sits on the Maryland Grain Producers board of directors, and serves as vice president of the Maryland Crop Association, in addition to serving on various statewide boards, local civic clubs, and organizations to promote the seed industry.

Sandoval is new pension system investment officer

Dianne Sandoval has been tapped as the next chief investment officer for the Maryland State Retirement and Pension System, the system’s board of trustees announced last week. She begins the job in January.

In her new role, Sandoval will be responsible for oversight of all pension system investments, leading the investment team, developing and implementing investment strategies, and ensuring the long-term financial health of Maryland’s pension system. She will work closely with the Board of Trustees and the Executive Director to achieve the System’s investment objectives.

Sandoval has more than 30 years of investment management experience in both the public and private sectors, according to a pension system announcement.

“We are thrilled to welcome someone with such vast experience as Dianne Sandoval to our team,” said Treasurer Dereck Davis, the SRPS board chair. “Her extensive expertise and visionary leadership will be invaluable as we continue to improve services for our members and provide strategic direction across the entire investment portfolio.”

She currently serves as the head of portfolio design for HESTA, an Australian superannuation fund that manages more than $100 billion in assets for more than 1 million members in the health and community services sectors. She has also worked at a large sovereign wealth fund and spent more than 12 years in a range of senior positions across asset allocation and strategy, private equity, and high yield/investment grade credit at CalPERS.

Comptroller Brooke Lierman, the board vice chair, said board members “recognized Dianne’s enthusiasm for and understanding of the unique responsibility of the CIO of a public pension fund. I look forward to working with her to grow our fund and ensure the security of our dedicated public employees.”

Sandoval said she was homored to be tapped for the job and “deeply committed to leveraging my global experience and expertise to drive innovative, resilient investment strategies that deliver exceptional outcomes for … Maryland’s public servants—its teachers, first responders, state workers, and local heroes who keep this state running.”

Braveboy names Okoye to planning board

Prince George’s County businessman Billy Okoye was sworn in last week as the newest member of the Prince George’s County Planning Board of The Maryland-National Capital Park and Planning Commission, succeeding Dorothy Bailey, the former vice chair of the board.

Okoye, who was appointed by County Executive Aisha Braveboy and confirmed by the County Council, joined his first board meeting last week.

Prince George’s Democrats choose Harris to fill vacant District 27 Senate seat

“His experience in business, community advocacy, real estate, and technology will offer a new dynamic to our forward-thinking Planning Board and award-winning agency,” said Prince George’s County Planning Board Chairman Darryl Barnes.

Okoye, who has real estate broker’s licenses in Maryland and the District of Columbia, was founder and principal broker of Sold 100 Real Estate Inc., according to a planning board press release, as well as group managing director of BMO General Contractors. He serves as chairman of the United African Advisory Board which works to strengthen community engagement and representation under Braveboy’s office.

“My professional journey has given me a practical ground-level understanding of our County’s vision for growth as outlined in the 2035 plan – the guiding framework for sustainable and equitable development across communities,” Okoye said in a statement. “I look forward to our collaborative work to revitalize the inner-Beltway neighborhoods into vibrant, transit-oriented economic hubs that attract jobs and opportunities.”

When the state announced it was building a freeway that would bypass the town of Ayden, Larry Dennis was uncertain about how it would affect traffic near Bum’s Restaurant, the barbecue shop his family has run since the early 1960s.

But he was sure about one thing: Bum’s logo would appear on the blue highway sign telling drivers where they could find food without veering too far off the freeway.

“My dad liked road signs and billboards, and I always wanted to be on one of those little signs the state puts up,” Dennis said. “Everybody doesn’t listen to the same radio station, and they might not be listening when your ad goes off. Same thing for newspapers, TV, that kind of stuff. But if I put that sign up, it is out there working 24/7.”

Dennis knew what he wanted. But he didn’t know how to get it. He thought that the state Department of Transportation picked which businesses get the blue-sign treatment. After asking around, he learned businesses have to pay to get on the signs. He called the local DOT office and signed a contract. When the blue “FOOD” signs went up at Exit 113 in 2023, there was Bum’s.

Until this year, that was the process everyone followed. For $1,200 a year—$600 for roadside signs in both directions and another $600 for signs on each ramp—owners of North Carolina restaurants, gas stations, hotels, and visitor attractions could get their logos onto the ubiquitous blue freeway signs.

Businesses that were more than one turn off the highway could pay another $300 for an extra sign to help drivers find them.

The price was the same for all of the 6,000-plus blue signs on freeways, interstates, and interchanges on those roadways, from where N.C. 11 passes through Ayden (average daily traffic: fewer than 20,000 cars) to the Interstate 40 junction in Asheville (average daily traffic: more than 61,000).

That all changed in July, when the state privatized the program. After more than 40 years managing it as a break-even operation, the DOT passed it on to the North Carolina Signing Program, a subsidiary of Lonestar Logos, which runs similar programs in Texas and Virginia. On July 1, the program adopted a new fee structure that more than triples what some advertisers have paid for a spot on the blue sign. Now, N.C. freeways are divided into four tiers, with rates that rise based on the average number of cars that pass each day.

Privatization advocates say the change frees DOT staff to focus on other work and will bring more revenue to the state. The company managing the program expects to collect nearly $13 million from advertisers during the 2025-2026 fiscal year, and the state would get 70% of that revenue—about $9 million, according to information shared at an April 2025 BOT working session. Under DOT management, the program generated about $5 million annually.

“When I look at something that we provide that can be privatized and offer better efficiency not only for the state but for the end user, I’m interested in it,” said state Sen. Mike Lazzara, an Onslow County Republican who co-chairs the Senate Transportation Committee. “If someone is doing something for a living, they’re going to put 110% into it.”

The Long Road to Privatization

The ubiquitous blue signs began appearing along North Carolina freeways and interstates in the early 1980s. A state law passed in 1981 charged DOT with managing the program and charging enough in fees to offset expenses.

Legislators and the DOT began seriously considering privatization in the mid-2010s. The 2014 state budget included it in a list of programs DOT should study privatizing. That DOT staff study concluded that because a private company could invest more in marketing the program, “the State may stand to gain more by privatizing it than by managing a revenue-generating program internally.” The 20-member state Board of Transportation, which sets policies and priorities for DOT, recommended privatization in late 2014.

The board revisited the issue at least twice over the next six years but hit two barriers: existing state law and concerns about how it would affect small businesses. The 1981 law that created the logo program mandated that it only raise enough revenue to cover its own expenses. Changing that law would be a necessary first step to privatization. And small business owners raised concerns that they would be priced out of a profit-seeking logo program, according to records from board meetings.

The issue re-emerged during the 2023-24 legislative session. An early version of the state budget included a privatization mandate that was ultimately added to a larger transportation measure that became law in June 2024.

Lazzara, whose committee approved privatization, cited post-pandemic cost increases as a factor. Under DOT management, the logo program raised about $5 million a year, but managing the contracts and maintaining the signs cost nearly as much. With more freedom to market the program and no other maintenance responsibilities to balance, Lazzara said, a private operator can work more efficiently.

“If a sign is damaged in a storm, work zone activity, accident—they’d go fix that,” DOT traffic engineer Brian Upshaw said during a presentation in April 2025. “The department has historically done that, but the expectation is that we’d get a higher level of service.”

The North Carolina Signing Program, NCSP, ultimately won an eight-year contract with a proposal that guarantees the state a minimum annual payout of $6 million. The state’s share could eventually surpass $11 million, according to projections shared at an April Board of Transportation meeting.

“I think that’s something we were really interested in because revenue for DOT is declining,” Lazzara said.

Lonestar began its push before the logo program was privatized. It hired a lobbying firm, Maynard Nexsen, in March 2024, and its Texas-based CEO Matt Johnston donated $1,000 to the 2024 reelection campaign of Rep. Phil Shepard (R-Onslow), the co-chairman of the House Transportation Committee and co-sponsor of the privatization amendment.

Shepard didn’t respond to phone or email requests for an interview for this story.

Asked via email about the nature of its lobbying activities last year, the company sent a statement from Johnston.

“When North Carolina issued a request for proposal, we were honored that NCSP was chosen to partner with the Department of Transportation,” it said. “We have a lot of work to do, and we look forward to working with the North Carolina DOT to make the North Carolina logo program a model in the United States.”

NCSP is a separate corporate entity from Lonestar Logos, but several employees hold roles with both companies. Johnston is president of both Lonestar and NCSP, according to company websites. Six other officials have roles with Lonestar, NCSP, and the Lonestar businesses that manage the Texas and Virginia logo sign programs. In its proposal, the company committed to hiring 8 full-time, North Carolina-based employees.

State records indicate NCSP’s primary challenger for the contract, Interstate Logos, didn’t retain a lobbyist or donate to any legislator’s campaign. Interstate, which manages logo programs in 25 states, projected less total income ($5–6 million annually) and promised a smaller share of revenue to the state (60%).

Lazzara said he and fellow legislators spoke to several potential vendors while weighing privatization, but he didn’t recall any specific conversations with Lonestar representatives or lobbyists representing the company.

North Carolina is the last state in the Southeast to privatize its logo program. Virginia’s program, which Lonestar took over in 2020, generated more than $6.3 million in 2023, according to Lonestar’s proposal to DOT. Interstate manages programs in Georgia ($8.5 million), South Carolina ($5.7 million), and Tennessee ($3.4 million).

For Businesses, More Costs and Competition

By the end of its eight-year contract, NCSP projects annual revenues of more than $19 million, nearly four times what DOT made in its last year managing the program (July 1, 2024–June 30, 2025).

The company plans to meet that mark with amped-up marketing tactics and by charging many businesses more than the state could. DOT didn’t market the program at all, Mayhew said at the April meeting, which is one reason “there are many signs that have empty panels.” NCSP plans to target new advertisers near existing logo signs with mail, phone, and digital marketing campaigns, according to the company’s proposal. It would also work with DOT to put logo signs at new interchanges.

NCSP’s new fee structure divides N.C. freeways into four tiers, with roadside and ramp sign ad rates rising with traffic:

While NCSP manages the program, the Board of Transportation still has to approve rates, and much of the discussion at its April session was about the increase. Melvin Mitchell, a Rocky Mount-based board member, said he’d gotten several calls from concerned business owners.

“They don’t have a problem with the increase itself, but they’re just taking such a large increase,” he said.

Brian Fox, who was chair of the board at the time, said that tying fees to traffic might open up competition the flatter structure didn’t allow.

“In urban areas, sometimes there’s 20 businesses [near an intersection], but there’s only room for nine logos” on each sign, he said. “One of the complaints I’d heard for years was that because our price is so low, there’s no market.”

The board approved the new tiers in May.

In the first three months since NCSP took over, the changes appear to have drawn more businesses than they’ve priced out. In an October report, NCSP said it had removed 94 logos and added 126 new ones. The state’s share of that revenue: nearly $4.9 million.

At exit 113 on the N.C. 11 Bypass, the Bum’s Restaurant logo still stands. Larry Dennis didn’t have to make any big decisions because his fees didn’t change. Even if traffic on the N.C. Highway 11 Bypass shot up enough to move him out of the cheapest tier, he’d strongly consider paying the price.

“If there were 60,000 people driving by, I might not even have time to look at the sign,” he said. “With all the people seeing it and wanting a barbecue sandwich, I bet I could really see a return from it.”",https://i0.wp.com/www.theassemblync.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/IMG_6305-scaled.jpg?fit=2560%2C1707&ssl=1,N,,2025-11-26 11:06:56.407932

But in Mr. Newsom’s state it is still effectively illegal to build nuclear plants.
The law was one of the first of its kind: In total, 15 other states eventually banned or restricted the construction of nuclear plants.
Nuclear power offers certain advantages: It can provide steady, round-the-clock, low-carbon electricity on very little land.
After all, it already provides almost 20 percent of the nation’s total electricity and almost half of its low-carbon electricity.","At the annual United Nations climate conference in Belém, Brazil, this month, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California, the most prominent American in attendance, made some unexpected comments about nuclear power. In one interview, he noted that nuclear energy has gone from being a contested energy source to a key to America’s “low-carbon green growth strategy.”

That’s certainly true in New York State and for companies like Google that are hoping to build nuclear power plants so they can transition off fossil fuels.

But in Mr. Newsom’s state it is still effectively illegal to build nuclear plants. In 1976, when the antinuclear movement was gaining ground, California passed a law prohibiting the permitting of new nuclear facilities until the federal government found a permanent solution to the waste they produce. The law was one of the first of its kind: In total, 15 other states eventually banned or restricted the construction of nuclear plants. Nine of those states — nearly all blue — still have statewide moratoriums in place.

It’s time to revisit them. Nuclear power has gone from widely shunned to more widely embraced because it has something for everyone, whether you’re a climate pragmatist, a pro-growth abundance enthusiast or seeking, in the Trump administration’s parlance, “energy dominance.” The states that are still blocking new plants should acknowledge that it will be difficult to eliminate greenhouse gases without some role for nuclear, and should consider changing their laws.

California is perhaps the best example of why new nuclear projects should be allowed to compete against other energy sources.

When the state jumped into the fight against climate change, it passed landmark laws, including one, in 2018, committing California to get all of its electricity from carbon-free sources by 2045. That year, state regulators approved a plan to close California’s last operational nuclear plant. The vision embodied an environmentalist dream to run California on essentially sun, wind and water — and to show how other states and nations could do the same.

By several metrics, that dream is getting closer to reality: The costs of solar and batteries have plummeted, and California has deployed them at a breakneck pace. This year, through October, clean energy met or exceeded demand for a portion of the day on at least 259 days on the grid that serves most of the state.

But some scientists and energy experts have doubted the wisdom of running the state on sun, wind, water and batteries alone. In 2021, a group of them argued that “clean firm” (that is, not weather-dependent) sources of power, such as nuclear and geothermal, could complement those more variable resources. The next year, Mr. Newsom and the State Legislature decided to extend the life of the state’s only remaining nuclear plant, Diablo Canyon, until at least 2030. New reactors, however, are not on the horizon. A recent state bill would have exempted small modular reactors from the moratorium, but it failed.

When I was writing this on a rainy afternoon in Southern California, about 10 percent of the electricity on the grid came from solar, 9 percent from nuclear, 13 percent from batteries and 43 percent from gas. Which means there’s still a long way to go to get to a grid that’s reliable all the time and free of fossil fuels — especially when the demand for electricity is rising.

It would be prudent to keep all low-carbon options on the table, including nuclear. Nuclear power offers certain advantages: It can provide steady, round-the-clock, low-carbon electricity on very little land. And while the United States has failed to establish a permanent repository for the waste, spent fuel has been securely stored at nuclear-reactor sites and other authorized storage sites around the country.

Critics worry about the timeline and cost of building plants, for good reason. In the United States, two new reactors in Georgia were completed years late and billions of dollars over budget. Small modular reactors are designed to be safer and lower cost, but they are still in the pipeline and have yet to prove that they can fulfill that promise.

Nuclear energy is far from a panacea. But it at least deserves to compete on a level playing field. After all, it already provides almost 20 percent of the nation’s total electricity and almost half of its low-carbon electricity. And there are legitimate concerns about the alternatives, too, including geothermal and batteries, to say nothing of fossil fuels. The state laws treat nuclear as singularly dangerous, but fossil fuels kill far more people.

California and the other eight states with statewide restrictions on nuclear energy have an opportunity to double down on their clean energy goals and show that they are achievable. (At least two of these states, Massachusetts and New Jersey, have recently indicated interest in pursuing advanced nuclear reactors, an emerging technology.) They should recognize that all energy sources come with trade-offs, and remove outdated legal barriers to nuclear power to meet the complex challenges of the century.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/26/opinion/26tuhus-dubrow/26tuhus-dubrow-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 10:00:07.521061

Creating Uncertainty Environmental groups are already suggesting legal action could invalidate all land use plans that allowed oil and gas drilling on federal lands.
Federal permitting could grind to a halt, land plans could be tossed out every time power shifts in Congress, and existing land plans could be heavily litigated, Rugwell said.
Myers, who served as Interior Department solicitor during the George W. Bush administration, also said that using the 1996 law doesn’t invalidate later land plans.
Sgamma, however, said that provision prevents courts from tossing out land plans if the BLM didn’t send them to Congress.","Chaos is likely to ensue on federal lands after lawmakers for the first time in US history used the Congressional Review Act this fall to toss out land use plans restricting fossil fuel development, natural resources attorneys say.

After the rollback of Biden-era resource management plans, nearly every federal decision made on 245 million acres of public land over the last 30 years regarding oil and gas, environmental protection, and other purposes is in jeopardy, said John Ruple, a law professor at the University of Utah.

“This is a question that keeps me up at night,” said Ruple, one of 25 natural resources law professors who signed a September letter warning Congress of the implications of using the CRA to invalidate land use plans.

The legal theory is that almost every federal land management authorization issued since the CRA became law in 1996 is “without legal force or effect because the underlying plans were invalid,” he said.

Congress over the last two months has passed resolutions under the CRA disapproving Bureau of Land Management plans developed by the Biden administration in Alaska, Wyoming, North Dakota, and Montana. All still awaited President Donald Trump’s signature as of Tuesday.

The BLM didn’t respond to questions about how Congress’ use of the CRA will change its land planning process.

‘Zoning’ for Public Lands

A resource management plan is like zoning for public lands, “rules of the road” determining which land within a certain area the BLM manages is to be used for specific purposes, said Susan Jane Brown, an attorney for the Oregon-based nonprofit environmental law firm Silvix Resources.

The US Forest Service and the National Park Service create similar plans for the land they oversee—often covering hundreds of thousands of acres and usually staying in effect for decades. All of the plans determine what’s allowed in a given area, including which land is set aside for oil and gas leasing, grazing, off-road vehicle use, renewable energy development, logging, and other uses.

Republicans have assailed the Biden administration’s land plans, which focused heavily on restricting drilling and other development partly by protecting environmentally sensitive lands known as “areas of critical environmental concern.”

Biden’s “abuse” of that designation should be reversed, Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah) said during a Nov. 19 Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee hearing.

The Government Accountability Office in June declared the plans are rules under the Administrative Procedure Act. This gives lawmakers the ability to disapprove of them under the CRA, which requires rules to be submitted to Congress before taking effect.

But no land use plan from any agency has ever been submitted to Congress, Ruple said. And if all land plans are rules under the law, it invalidates all plans approved since 1996 and all decisions based on them, including oil and gas and logging permits, and much more, he said.

It’s a “recipe for chaos” on federal lands, exacerbated by the CRA’s prohibition on new rules being “substantially similar” to the rule rejected by Congress, said Mark Squillace, a natural resources law professor at the University of Colorado Law School, who signed the September letter.

Avoiding a “substantially similar” land use plan would force agencies to question hundreds of decisions they’ve already made, Squillance said.

It’s unclear how the BLM will go about changing plans in a way that is different enough from rejected ones to fully comply with the law, in part because “substantially similar” is subjective, said William Myers III, partner at Holland & Hart LLP in Boise.

Creating Uncertainty

Environmental groups are already suggesting legal action could invalidate all land use plans that allowed oil and gas drilling on federal lands.

“The oil and gas industry should be alarmed that Congress has effectively put the legal validity” of more than 5,000 oil and gas leases on nearly 4 million acres into question, said Erik Schlenker-Goodrich, executive director of the Western Environmental Law Center in New Mexico.

The CRA injects so much uncertainty into land use planning that it could destabilize the entire process, said Mary Jo Rugwell, president of the Public Lands Foundation and a retired BLM Wyoming state director.

Federal permitting could grind to a halt, land plans could be tossed out every time power shifts in Congress, and existing land plans could be heavily litigated, Rugwell said.

“This could raise a myriad of legal questions that would be extremely difficult to resolve,” she said.

But Kathleen Sgamma, an oil and gas industry consultant, said Congress’ move hasn’t invalidated all BLM land use plans and environmental groups’ claims otherwise are “a real stretch.”

If groups sue, the BLM could validate old plans by sending them to Congress, said Sgamma, who withdrew her nomination this year as Trump’s pick to be BLM director.

Myers, who served as Interior Department solicitor during the George W. Bush administration, also said that using the 1996 law doesn’t invalidate later land plans.

“If that were the case, could one expand that concern and just say that all federal agency actions not submitted to Congress that are within the broad scope of the CRA’s definition of a rule are now invalidated?” he said. “That would wipe out all manner of federal rules over the last 30 years.”

Judicial Review

The use of the CRA raises another legal question, which is how judicial review applies, said Myers.

While the CRA says it’s not subject to judicial review, it’s unclear whether that means it’s actions taken by Congress or by an agency that aren’t subject to review, he said.

Sgamma, however, said that provision prevents courts from tossing out land plans if the BLM didn’t send them to Congress.

Federal agencies won’t have much incentive to create thoughtful, science-based management plans if they think their work will be easily invalidated, Schlenker-Goodrich said.

“The CRA opens the door to destructive, chaotic forces,” he said.",https://db0ip7zd23b50.cloudfront.net/dims4/default/b32a7a0/2147483647/crop/3689x1422+40+324/resize/960x370%3E/quality/90/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbloomberg-bna-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fca%2F78%2F5648dee64d18813d62228a4b7748%2Fgrazing-your-public-lands.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 08:59:49.660536

© Ingrid- Together, the companies aim to bring 200 MW

Stockholm/Zossen (renewablepress) - Ingrid, the leading Nordic flexibility and grid-tech company, and Energiequelle GmbH, a leading international renewables developer, operator and service provider, have signed a co-development agreement to deliver 200 MW of grid-scale Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS) throughout Germany. Under the partnership, Energiequelle will lead project development, while Ingrid will finance, operate, and optimize the assets using its in-house trading and optimization platform. The BESS projects will be strategically deployed in distribution grids across Germany, targeting locations where flexibility is most needed. Most projects are expected to reach ready-to-build status in 2026.

“This is a landmark partnership for Ingrid in Germany and an important step in our European growth strategy. By 2030, we aim to optimize more than 1 GW of flexible assets in Germany and thereby address challenges in the power grid. Energiequelle’s proven track record and deep market knowledge make the company an ideal partner for us on this journey,” says Axel Holmberg, CEO of Ingrid.

Ingrid already operates or is constructing more than 450 MW (650 MWh) of battery storage and has raised over 300 million euros in capital, making it the leading developer, owner and optimizer in Scandinavia. This includes Finland’s largest storage facility at 70 MW (140 MWh). In addition to energy storage and the optimization of BESS and renewable energy, Ingrid also offers structures for green energy supply and offtake as well as innovative grid services. Alongside its expansion into the German market, the company is also entering France and Spain.

“Our mission is to advance the energy transition with innovative, reliable, and flexible solutions. Ingrid’s expertise in delivering and optimizing large-scale energy storage is a strong complement to our development capabilities. Together, we can create long-term value for society and expand grid stability as part of the energy transition,” says Michael Raschemann, founder and Managing Director of Energiequelle.

Since its founding in 1997, Energiequelle has built around 2,000 MW of grid infrastructure and connected more than 1,700 MW of wind energy to the grid. In addition, Energiequelle develops innovative energy supply solutions for industrial companies, particularly using photovoltaics and battery storage. The company operates in Europe and South Africa.

The deployment of battery storage increases the resilience of power grids, supports the integration of renewable energy, and improves the economics for renewable energy producers. As a result, battery storage is becoming a key pillar of the German energy system on the path to climate neutrality. It also enables better participation in energy and flexibility markets while simultaneously increasing security of supply, as more domestic and dispatchable power becomes available. Electrification in industry and municipalities is also accelerated. Ultimately, these measures lead to stable and affordable energy prices, strengthen regional competitiveness, and support a faster energy transition.

I grew up in Villa D’Adda, a small town near Lake Como, surrounded by gardens and nature and with a long history of hydroelectric power. In fact, on my walks I could look across the river and see the hydroelectric plants built over a hundred years ago to power the town’s factories. These old plants are cultural landmarks, and they fascinated me as a child! I wanted to know how they worked, and how they supplied the power to make other things work, like turning on a lightbulb or charging a phone.

I was also intrigued to be part of this major transformation: the shift towards renewable energy and sustainable power systems.

With a major in Electric Power Engineering, I was fortunate to get the opportunity to work for Hitachi’s Power Consulting team in Sweden. I was hired into a team full of PhDs, and I benefit from that tremendously. Most of my colleagues are much more experienced than I, yet from day one, I have observed they are just as committed to learning as I am. They give me top-notch advice and are always available when I have a question or need a sounding board.

Together we do everything from studies and analysis to drawing the master map and helping with energy strategies or coming up with completely new innovative energy solutions – impacting the planet and lives of millions of people really.

The power system studies are often done early in the planning process for huge projects which include hundreds of people. But our customers need us for all kinds of projects, and we might need to jump in at any point along the way. The variety means that there is never a dull moment! I’ve worked on power system analyses for offshore wind and power-from-shore projects, insulation coordination studies, cost estimations, energization studies, and more.

My team is responsible for designing systems that meet both technical and regulatory requirements while collaborating with other equipment and technology providers. Since these projects involve so many people and external elements, collaboration and coordination is paramount! Towards the end of a project, we double-check that all the pieces of the puzzle fit together perfectly. This could involve, for example, building a model for the TSO (transmission system operator) that verifies the solution’s compliance with power grid regulatory codes.

I feel so fortunate to have chosen the path that I did. I get to help customers solve their technology challenges and contribute to a more sustainable energy future for all. I could not have picked a better career or place to build it!

To wit, the auto show continues its comeback, as I saw last week while strolling the halls of the Los Angeles Auto Show.

Until about a decade ago, the global automotive press gathered several times each year in cities such as Detroit, New York, and Geneva in cavernous convention halls filled with elaborate manufacturer displays. Show preview days, open only to the media, were packed with press conferences hosted by automakers. Sometimes the presentations were given by dry CEOs in gray suits droning about sales and production numbers, and other times they were all show business, like the time in Detroit when Bob Lutz drove a Jeep Grand Cherokee through a window. These were fun, exciting industry gatherings, a chance for automakers to promote not just their new products but reveal their forward thinking via concept cars.

The shows were incredibly expensive, with some of the most lavish displays costing tens of millions, but automakers figured it was worth it because of the media coverage and opportunity to display their merch to the consumers who walked the convention hall floors during public days. But with the rise of digital marketing and the supposed ability of marketing analysts to minutely measure the return on investment of every dollar spent, the fuzzy returns of auto-show stands were deprioritized. Then the pandemic hit and with it, we thought, the auto show was dead.

There are strong signs, however, that the glorious future-forward shows, and at least some of their previous razzle-dazzle, are returning. Last month the Japan Mobility Show, which used to be called the Tokyo Motor Show, had not just sober new-car introductions but freakishly fascinating concept cars like a Lexus six-wheeled minivan and a Honda rocket. Yes, a rocket.

Last week’s event in Los Angeles offered only a fraction of Tokyo’s pizzazz, but there were a couple of noteworthy reveals, including an unfortunately named but interesting off-road concept called the Hyundai Crater. Jeep revealed the Recon, a butch off-road EV that I bet will find plenty of buyers when it inevitably adds a gasoline engine. While not new, I also appreciated seeing Chevy’s CX Concept, a potential future Corvette, in the flesh.

This week, I’m especially thankful that many car companies again believe in the power of showcasing visionary products that people can see in real life rather than just computer-generated images in a TikTok video. Carmakers, like all publicly traded companies, are under pressure to produce profits, so I imagine there’s intense debate in boardrooms about spending millions on an activity that cannot be directly tied to sales figures.

I’m thankful to you, too, for reading this weekly dispatch, so here’s hoping you and your family have a wonderful holiday. In between holiday gatherings this weekend, please dig into the latest from Hagerty:

Jason Cammisa says goodbye to the mail truck.

7 vintage off roaders for under $40K.

Heat transfer can help to decarbonise some of the hardest to abate areas of the energy value chain by improving efficiency, supporting clean heating and cooling, enhancing grid stability and balancing variable output for renewables like wind and solar with changing power demand.

Today, heat exchanger technology from Heatric, part of Parker Hannifin’s Filtration & Energy Solutions Division, is already demonstrating that the path to a net-zero world can be realised by rethinking heat transfer.

At the heart of Heatric’s approach is the Printed Circuit Heat Exchanger (PCHE), a technology first pioneered in 1980. Each heat exchanger flow path is designed bespoke to meet the operational and process requirements. A diffusion bonding process is used to create the heat exchanger core, resulting in the exchanger core material reaching greater integrity.

The specialist design and manufacturing allow Heatric PCHEs to be up to 85% smaller and lighter for the same thermal and hydraulics characteristics than conventional heat exchangers.

Heatric PCHE’s ability to withstand high pressures and temperatures in combination with highly specific thermal tuning, contribute to delivering greater thermal efficiency, which is vital to maximising process performance and proving commercial viability in pilot projects.

sCO2 and efficient energy generation

Alongside its use in traditional gas compression for the existing fuels, Heatric PCHE technology is also enabling the future of clean energy power generation applications.

In Texas, for example, Heatric PCHE technology is playing a central role in a power project centred on the novel use of supercritical carbon-dioxide (sCO2). By turning a problem into the solution, the demonstrator plant aims to prove the viability of a working fluid alternative to steam, which offers significant efficiency gains over the conventional steam cycle.

The project has already completed the first phase of testing in late 2024, generating about 4MWe. sCO2 can reach very high temperatures, which imparts a higher cycle efficiency, driving down costs and minimising the environmental impact.

Under development since the 1950s, limitations in conventional shell and tube heat exchangers have stalled sCO2 development as a working fluid alternative to steam. With the emergence of Heatric PCHE technology, enabling efficient heat transfer at higher temperatures and pressures, the 10MWe project could be realised.

The pilot project features three separate Heatric PCHEs; reaching temperatures of up to 600°C coupled with pressures of 290 bar. The extreme conditions, large temperature gradients, and the need for a heat exchanger with a compact footprint all predicate the use of PCHE technology.

Along with the efficiency gains, using supercritical CO2 also allows for a far more compact turbine and generator to be utilised. The turbomachinery components in this project are about a tenth the size of the steam equivalent for example, with the turbine having a diameter of just 12 cm. This pilot project is both pushing the envelope of sCO2 cycle viability and proving a cleaner, scalable alternative to baseload power generation.

Decarbonising district heat

An efficient use of Heatric PCHE technology is also playing a significant role in decarbonising the domestic heating for an entire city in Denmark, linking renewable electricity, heating and cooling in a high efficiency, innovative process.

The city has deployed a new domestic heating system as part of its plans to become a carbon-free city by 2030. This installation uses sCO2 as the working fluid, which is compressed and expanded in a closed-loop cycle providing the outputs of either hot or cold water or electricity. Again, the ability to manage high pressure and high temperatures is critical to the success of this application.

EU’s electrification and heating and cooling plans open for consultation

In this project a new domestic heating system is powered by renewable electricity from wind farms and will use heat exchangers to transfer heat into the water, supplying district heating to around 100,000 people.

The system has accelerated the decommissioning of an existing coal-fired plant with clear environmental benefits for the residents. As a low-emission alternative to conventional fossil-fuelled heating and cooling technologies, this application shows the value of efficient heat exchange to address of the energy transition sectors showing high barriers to abatement.

In addition, and crucially for the deployment of variable output renewables, systems like this one also support greater grid management by absorbing excess power when it is available and releasing it to the grid when required. Any excess energy is stored in large, insulated water tanks and successive heat exchange cycles are used to extract that energy when required, putting heat exchange at the core of this unique and forward-thinking approach to an existing thermal problem.

Energy storage

The limited storage capacity for generated power globally is a key barrier to a renewables-based energy system, with greater scale required to manage the hourly variation in power generation to meet a constantly changing energy demand profile.

Without enough storage capacity, potential energy is wasted when supply exceeds demand. Conversely, when demand exceeds renewable energy supply, additional generation - typically thermal fossil-fuelled gas turbine gensets, are bought online.

Efficient heat exchange presents an opportunity here, as demonstrated with a recent landmark project in the UK. Heatric will supply its PCHE technology for a full-scale long duration energy storage (LDES) project under development. Once operational, this bulk energy storage system represents a key milestone for UK energy infrastructure by minimising energy waste and maximising energy security for the UK.

The 50MWe (300MWh) energy storage facility has been developed and refined through a long-term collaborative relationship with Heatric stretching back to 2009, allowing Heatric PCHEs to provide the critical evaporative heat exchange functions that form the core of the cryo-plant.

The project is due to begin commercial operations in 2026, and the project relies on the high efficiency Heatric PCHEs to minimise any potential energy losses during the process of heat capture and release.

As a long-term energy storage application, minimising heat loss whilst awaiting power demand is a critical factor in ensuring input power is not wasted. The project marks an important step on the road towards net zero and enabling the expansion of cleaner power infrastructure.

Given the growing demand for clean energy solutions, novel heat transfer approaches are vital to address the challenge of climate change at both the scale and timeframe necessary to have a meaningful impact.

To date, thousands of Heatric Printed Circuit Heat Exchangers are in operation in on- and offshore applications, serving in critical global ‘must-run’ applications to ensure maximum uptime on gas processing operations in extreme environments.

Whilst Heatric PCHE is a technology with decades of experience reliably meeting the needs of the most demanding environments, combining heat transfer expertise and fresh design approaches offers a surprisingly elegant route to a greener energy future.

You could live in a home built to your precise needs that stays cozy and cool all year long. You could swim in a heated pool filled with ultra-pure recycled water. You could grill a steak grown in a factory, from cell on up, marbled, textured, and flavored to perfection. You could visit a nature preserve on land reclaimed from mines and farms, teeming with once-endangered animal life. You could get whisked comfortably and quietly anywhere by robots, whether down the street or the other side of the world. You could plan every weekend outing for the next month, counting on reliable, far-reaching weather forecasts. And all of your garbage would break down into its constituent elements, destined to be reassembled into new shoes, cars, and refrigerators.

Key Takeaways

Harnessing energy has been a key driver of increasing prosperity — life expectancy, wealth, productivity. But availability, cost, and environmental impacts have long been major constraints on the energy we can use.

Now, a new generation of clean energy is providing vastly more power and rapidly scaling up.

With ample cheap power, we can solve some of our most pressing problems and begin to think of new applications.

Abundant clean energy can enable vastly more food, water, travel, and industry while undoing greenhouse gas emissions.

However, more energy cannot simply get around major social concerns like inequity, job losses, and regulatory hurdles.

This is all speculation, but the pace of improvement in clean energy and the scale of its deployment put these ideas within the realm of possibility.

Energy shapes the limits of what a society can build, sustain, and imagine, and the more of it we have at our disposal, the further we can push those boundaries. What we would decide to do with vastly more energy has huge implications for our politics, our economy, our environment, and our prosperity.

This year, the world is poised to spend $2.2 trillion on clean energy — power from the wind, the sun, the water, and splitting atoms. It also includes upgrades to the power grid, new forms of energy storage, and increased efficiency.

This investment has mostly been trumpeted as a way to help limit climate change. Humanity’s collective deployment of clean energy and increasing efficiency so far has already helped take some of the worst-case scenarios off the table.

However, climate change is a low political priority now. A more compelling case for clean energy is that it’s often the best way to get cheap energy, and to get a lot of it. The deployment of wind and solar power around the world continues to defy expectations, while the growth trajectory of energy storage is following close behind. This suite of technologies is taking off around the world — not because of a carbon tax or even environmental concerns, but because clean energy is simply better at meeting the needs of a moment when energy appetites are growing.

Suppose we alter the framing and approach solving climate change not as a task merely of curbing emissions, but of increasing access and lowering costs of better ways to power the world even further. It’s an approach that leads with prosperity and quality of life, while creating a more stable climate in the process.

If we make it a priority to get more clean energy, that raises the interesting — and fun — question of what we should do with it. After all, we’re not collecting energy for the sake of energy but to do stuff.

Cheap, clean, plentiful energy doesn’t just help people save money on their power bills; it unlocks new industries, makes thorny political problems moot, and helps repair the planet. These use cases are important motivations for why the transition to clean energy needs to happen and how it can bring about a better world for all of us. It’s why we’re doing this at all.

What abundant clean energy can unlock

We can exchange heat and electrons for just about anything on Earth. How much energy a person uses is an effective proxy for how well off they are — how much food they can eat, how comfortable they are at home, how educated they are. We can see this play out in the cost and quality of lighting, which, in the UK alone, dropped 99.9 percent since 1700, tracing how economies grew as people shifted from campfires, to kerosene lamps, to LED bulbs, and beyond.

Energy by the numbers

The global energy landscape is changing rapidly. Fossil fuels are still the dominant ways we heat, power, and get around the world, but renewable energy capacity is rocketing upward.

Total global energy consumption is about 186,000 terawatt-hours per year, or about 58 times the total output of every nuclear power plant on Earth right now.

The top three sources of energy are oil, coal, and natural gas, meeting 76 percent of the world’s energy needs.

The world emitted a record 53.4 gigatonnes of carbon dioxide equivalents in 2024. Energy consumption accounted for 37.8 gigatonnes of CO2, about 70 percent of the total.

Burning fossil fuels for energy accounts for 75.7 percent of the world’s greenhouse gas emissions, followed by 11.7 percent from agriculture, 6.5 percent from industry, 3.4 percent from waste, and 2.7 percent from changes in land use.

About 21 percent of the world’s energy consumption goes toward producing electricity.

Wind, solar, and hydropower accounted for 92 percent of new electricity capacity added worldwide in 2024.

The world will need anywhere from double to triple the amount of electricity by 2050, depending on the economic growth trajectory.

“Energy is prosperity,” said Eric Toone, chief technology officer at Breakthrough Energy, a high-tech clean energy funding firm founded by Bill Gates in 2015. “Energy is the capacity to do work. Energy is the capacity to build things, to make things, to move things.”

The potential of near-unlimited energy has been tantalizing researchers for decades, since the last big energy revolution, the dawn of the nuclear age.

“It is not too much to expect that our children will enjoy in their homes electrical energy too cheap to meter, will know of great periodic regional famines in the world only as matters of history, will travel effortlessly over the seas and under them and through the air with a minimum of danger and at great speeds, and will experience a lifespan far longer than ours, as disease yields and man comes to understand what causes him to age,” said Lewis Strauss, chairman of the Atomic Energy Commission, in 1954. “This is the forecast for an age of peace.”

Nuclear power didn’t make this dream come true. It did provide huge amounts of electricity, but its construction and operating costs rose as other energy sources got cheaper. Meanwhile, environmental activists and some policymakers shifted their energy strategy to conservation rather than expanding the pool of power. Yet, the prospect of producing energy in such vast quantities that its cost is a minor concern is still one that lures scientists, engineers, and investors. And the recent technology trends do give some observers hope that this dream is within reach.

“Long-term, I think there’s good reason to think that at least lots of places in the world will have much less expensive and more stable energy, especially once they’ve made the investment in the next generation infrastructure,” said Daniel Vermeer, a researcher at Duke University studying the future of energy. “And I think that’s going to happen in a lot of places.”

How much more energy? “I think we’re looking at double the electricity production,” Vermeer said.

So, in the best tradition of economic thought experiments, let’s assume a can opener. What do we open first?

Transform our food system

If we vastly increase our energy supply from current levels, food and water are where we can get the most bang for the British Thermal Unit (BTU). “It’s so fundamental to human prosperity,” Vermeer said. “It’s also where people will see benefits the fastest.”

First, we can get a lot more out of our existing farms

We already spend a huge amount of our energy to produce food, and agriculture accounts for one-third of humanity’s greenhouse gas output. The fertilizer used to grow crops alone accounts for 5 percent of the world’s greenhouse gases — more than aviation and shipping combined — and most fertilizers rely on natural gas as a feedstock. If we had the power and materials to produce more zero-emissions fertilizer, farmers could extract greater yields from the same amount of land. And decarbonizing the supply chain with electric tractors and trucks to bring food to markets would further increase efficiency. Getting the most out of our existing farms will be essential to feeding the world’s growing population. Otherwise, expanding farms will continue to devour forests and wildlands.

Your tastiest fruit will grow closer to you

The next generation of farming techniques could create similar yields on even smaller plots of land, allowing food to be produced year round, nearer to major population centers or even within them. One approach is vertical farming, where crops are grown vertically in controlled indoor environments instead of horizontally across fields. Many vertical farming techniques are already being used today. But with more cheap energy to run pumps, lights, and fans, we can scale this up further.

We can sip from the seas

Water is essential to all life as we know it, and we haven’t been doing a great job of judiciously using it. In recent years, some major cities have been teetering on the brink of running out of water. And with average temperatures rising, many regions are poised to see more severe droughts.

However, two-thirds of the world is covered in water, and widespread desalination would allow the world to tap into that vast, currently undrinkable supply. The main techniques for desalination are distillation and reverse osmosis, and right now, both require a lot of energy. But, if there’s a lot of cheap power on tap, then desalination could be a primary source of water for some communities, allowing freshwater rivers and aquifers to recharge. It would also resolve many of the political conflicts around water.

Our meals can give us perfect nourishment

Unlimited energy could allow us to bioengineer our food sources from individual nutrients to maximize nourishment. Precision fermentation, or electro-food, is an emerging technology that uses specially designed microorganisms like yeast or bacteria to make proteins, fats, or nutrients like those found in animal products. Instead of raising cows or chickens, you could “brew” milk, eggs, or meat ingredients in fermentation tanks — just like the process of making beer.

Cheap, clean electricity can power these breweries as they use captured carbon and hydrogen as ingredients. Companies are already selling animal-free dairy and egg proteins made this way. As renewable power becomes abundant, precision fermentation could scale up, feeding growing populations with a fraction of the land, water, and emissions of traditional agriculture

Imagine grilling the perfect burger

Now, let’s take precision fermentation even further. Cultivating cells into whole steaks is starting to become possible, but it’s an expensive and involved process. If this could truly get off the ground, it would have huge knock-on benefits for the environment. Raising livestock right now draws a huge toll in terms of land use, energy and water consumption, and waste production, not to mention the immense ethical problems embedded in raising and killing animals for food. If we can turn energy into meat that replaces conventional livestock, that would solve so many environmental issues all at once. But, convincing people to eat it remains a barrier. Already, there are seven states that have banned lab-grown meat. “Laboratory agriculture and producing things without animals is possible from a technical perspective, but we have to get a lot more sophisticated about how people make those decisions,” Toone said.

Can AI play a positive role here?

Whether or not you’re bullish on AI, it’s clear that more of our jobs and lives hinge on access to computing power and storage. Right now, data centers are a big part of the story of growing electricity demand, and speculation about their future energy needs is already starting to drive up electricity prices for ordinary people.

But with fewer energy constraints, more computing tools could become available to more people, and these resources can then be used to resolve some of our biggest energy and environmental challenges. It may also be a necessary investment for the US to retain a competitive edge. “I, for one, have become completely convinced that it’s necessary to win at AI for national security,” said Neil Chatterjee, a former commissioner on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. “How do we generate the power to win the AI race while keeping electricity affordable and not backsliding? There’s no simple solution, but I’m confident we can get there.”

How can we mitigate their worst effects?

Utilities can require tech firms to pay a deposit to for their future power needs so they don’t over-inflate their needs. Data centers can also face mandates to bring their own generation and energy storage, which could also support the broader grid.

Operators of these facilities can shift energy-intensive tasks to low-demand periods, though this flexibility may be limited. Their size incentivizes efficient electricity use, and computing will likely grow more energy-efficient over time as the technology improves.

AI can further accelerate the clean-energy transition by streamlining permitting applications for wind and solar projects, improving materials design, enhancing weather forecasting, and strengthening models of energy demand.

More energy will help us clean up our mess

With food and water sorted, we can then start to chip away at the root cause of climate change: the rising concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere from burning fossil fuels that are heating up the planet. Halting climate change thus means stopping these emissions entirely. And in the increasingly likely scenario where we overshoot our goal of limiting global average temperatures from rising more than 1.5 degrees Celsius, it also means deliberately pulling carbon back out from the environment. It’s not enough to simply produce more energy; the world needs negative greenhouse gas emissions.

We can begin to undo climate change on a planetary scale

Humanity currently spews more than 40 gigatons of carbon dioxide into the atmosphere every year. So, to move the needle, we need to think about carbon management solutions that can work on this scale.

There are a few ways to do this. One is capturing carbon dioxide at the source. At conventional coal and natural gas-fired power plants, carbon capture systems currently impose a large parasitic load, around a quarter of the generator’s power output. That makes it hard to build a business case for carbon capture at fossil fuel power plants. But other industrial processes, like steel production, also emit carbon dioxide, and point-source capture can decarbonize this and other processes that don’t currently have an easy zero-emissions alternative.

We can also capture carbon dioxide straight from the air. There are already companies developing machines that can filter carbon from the atmosphere. Some businesses are also working on ways to pull carbon dioxide dissolved in seawater. The challenge is that it requires a lot of energy to move the amount of air and water needed to draw out significant amounts of carbon, which in turn raises the cost.

“Two things have to happen: One is that we have to continue to work to bring down the cost of air capture,” Toone said. Currently, it costs around $500 per ton to pull carbon dioxide out of the air. The goal is to get it down to $100 per ton or less. “Then societies have to become affluent enough that they’re willing to do it and recognize the dangers caused by climate change,” Toone added.

Another approach is enhanced weathering, which speeds up natural processes where rocks like limestone react with carbon dioxide in rainwater, forming a chemical bond that permanently locks it away.

If you don’t lock away carbon dioxide, you can put it to work. It’s an important raw ingredient for chemicals and materials. You can use it to make fuels reconstituted from the air, polymers, enzymes, concrete, as well as make your drinks bubbly. This has the potential to become a trillion-dollar industry.

All of our waste could be renewed

Waste is a mounting problem, and many synthetic materials like plastics have no natural mechanisms that break them down, making them a problem that can last for generations. Recycling plastic materials has largely failed to live up to the promise, and the bulk of plastic waste ends up in landfills. To meaningfully reuse and reconstitute polymers, the process needs to be competitive with producing virgin materials, which means the energy you use for recycling has to be dirt cheap. When we get there, we may be able to close the loop, making, unmaking, and remaking everything we need with minimal extraction from the Earth.

The next place to look is transportation. Cheap fossil fuels have shrunk the world, allowing people to cross continents and oceans in hours rather than months. How we get around is now the second-largest source of greenhouse gas emissions. Four-wheeled vehicles already have a glide path to zero emissions with electrification. The tougher challenges are going to be electrifying or decarbonizing bigger vehicles like ships and airplanes.

Cleanly cruise the high seas

Container ships are the gargantuan worker ants of the global economy, transporting just about every tangible good around the world. Right now, most container ships burn some of the cheapest and dirtiest fuels imaginable, but with abundant clean energy, they could draw on cleaner sources of power. These ships may be too big to run on batteries, but with much cheaper, clean electricity, shipping companies can generate hydrogen, ammonia, methanol, or synthetic versions of conventional fuels, moving cargo without the carbon footprint.

Take to the skies

Climate-friendly flying is still trying to get off the ground. Right now, there aren’t any batteries that come anywhere close to the energy density of fossil fuels. Some airlines are deploying electric aircraft on shorter routes. However, without a breakthrough, long-haul flights will need to run on synthetic zero-emissions fuels, which demand vast quantities of low-cost energy. Or, they’ll need a mechanism like direct air capture to offset their emissions.

The really far-out ideas

With even more energy, we can begin thinking about commercializing promising innovations that exist only in labs or are still on the drawing board. Many of these ideas sound far-fetched, but abundant clean energy moves them into the realm of possibility.

Materials built molecule-first Imagine designing stuff the way you’d build a playlist: starting from tiny pieces and crafting exactly what you need. Shoes that bounce just right. Home insulation that actually understands seasons. Skin grafts that heal without scars. We already 3D print things, but scaling it is pricey and slow. Smarter, custom materials could make industrial printing faster, cleaner, and way less wasteful.

Space that’s closer — and cleaner Getting to orbit still takes a ton of energy, and today’s rocket fuels leave a pretty heavy carbon footprint. Pulling carbon dioxide out of the air could help offset launches, and cleaner electricity can make low-carbon fuels from the start. The result: space access that’s not just cheaper, but easier on the planet.

Solar power that never sleeps Above the atmosphere, sunlight doesn’t quit. Space-based solar collectors could soak up that uninterrupted energy and beam it back to Earth via microwaves. No clouds, no sunsets — just steady power when we need it.

Become a spacefaring civilization And instead of dragging every nut and bolt off Earth, we could mine asteroids for the raw materials already floating out there. That opens the door to building more in space — moon bases, deep-space missions, the whole sci-fi starter kit — without the crushing cost of launching every ounce from Earth.

An immense surge of clean energy will have unintended consequences, too

Even if we could realize all of the exciting potential of this clean energy-powered future, some new problems could emerge if we’re not careful.

First, there will be a big dislocation in the job market. There are almost 2 million people in the US working in coal, oil, and gas sectors — mining, building, transporting, and combusting these fuels. They will need new jobs or a soft landing pad that will help them move or retire. “We’re potentially seeing huge shifts in governance and unionization around the world,” said Adam Cowart, who is on the faculty of foresight at the University of Houston.

Additionally, “abundant” does not necessarily mean “equal” when it comes to energy. In the year 2025, there are still 685 million people in the world who don’t have access to electricity, and there’s no guarantee that increasing the global supply of energy will benefit them without concerted policies to match.

Having more energy could also end up indulging people’s worst impulses. Already, we’ve seen across much of the world that as fuels and electricity get cheaper, people end up driving bigger cars over longer distances, running their thermostats less efficiently, and eating more meat.

Valerie Thomas, professor of industrial engineering at the Georgia Institute of Technology, noted that our recent history shows that we have not used the energy we already have in a judicious way. “If we look back in history just a little bit, what do we do? We use it up on things maybe we don’t even understand, like bigger houses with more air conditioning, or we would commute even longer distances,” Thomas said. It will take concerted effort to make sure new energy doesn’t just go to frivolous uses.

And in her work looking at some of the poorest populations in the world, Thomas said she found that the key limits to prosperity are often things like local corruption, a lack of prenatal care, not enough vaccines, political instability, and bad economic policies. “What tends to be the barrier to the good life? I don’t think it’s energy,” Thomas said. That said, the world’s poorest stand to gain the most from the transition to clean energy, not just for having more useful power in their lives but breathing in less pollution and having more economic autonomy.

The post-energy abundance world is not one where every problem is solved, but it’s one with greater prosperity, improved human welfare, and generally a more stable climate. It will raise its own challenges, so there’s no scenario where we can take it for granted.

The fossil fuel era, and much of human history, was governed by constraints. The age of clean energy is poised to be one that’s more limited by imagination and choices, and the remaining solutions will be much more fun to implement.

Mercuria Energy America, LLC, the Texas Business Court (11th Division) considered a North American Energy Standards Board (NAESB) contract to buy and sell natural gas. With three opinions to discuss, this post will be longer than usual.

When the storm hit Texas, seller Marathon failed to deliver all of the gas required under the contract and declared force majeure. The parties disputed whether the force-majeure clause excused Marathon’s failure to deliver. The court, having granted in part and denying in part dueling motions for summary judgement, issued this opinion because an opinion would “benefit the parties and the jurisprudence … “.

Reasonable efforts – what is an “alternative Gas supply”?

The court rejected Purchaser Mercuria’s argument that Marathon had a duty to buy replacement gas on the spot market to meet its delivery obligations or to buy back its delivery obligation.

The standard NAESB form requires any party claiming force majeure to “make reasonable efforts to avoid the adverse impacts of a Force Majeure and to resolve the event or occurrence once it has occurred in order to resume performance.” The parties modified this provision by adding “the party claiming excuse shall have no obligation to seek alternative Gas supplies in order to satisfy any obligation hereunder.” The court read “hereunder” broadly to encompass the duty to use “reasonable efforts” to avoid the impacts of force majeure.

Relying heavily on – and agreeing with – earlier Winter Storm Uri decisions, the court explained what counts as “alternative Gas supplies”. Supplies that could substitute for the gas the seller could not deliver are typically the seller’s own gas supply. Because spot-market gas is not part of the seller’s gas supply, it is not one of the “alternative Gas supplies” covered by the provision. The modified provision relieved Marathon of an obligation to obtain spot-market gas as a “reasonable effort” under the contract.

No buybacks

The court then turned to buybacks. Buybacks are always possible in gas contracts and simply shift money between the parties. The purpose of a force-majeure clause is to excuse nonperformance. Requiring the seller to buy back its delivery obligation would render force majeure protection meaningless, as it would never excuse a failure to deliver.

Damages

In a subsequent opinion a week later, the court addressed damages, in particlar liquidated damages. The contract’s remedy provision used the “Spot Price Standard,” which measures the difference between the seller’s obligations and the actual quantity delivered, multiplied by the positive difference, if any, between the contract price and the spot price. Marathon argued that the Spot Price Standard was unenforceable because the gap between the spot-price damages and actual damages was too great.

For the liquidated-damages clause to be unenforceable, there must be an “unbridgeable discrepancy” between spot‑price damages and actual damages. Although the parties agreed on several points—such as the contract price and the dates and amounts of the seller’s delivery shortfall—neither party conclusively proved the amount of either spot-price damages or actual damages.

Liquidated damages provisions are typically enforceable but damages are limited to “just compensation for the loss or damage actually sustained.” They cannot operate as a penalty. To decide whether the Spot Price Standard was enforceable, the court first had to determine damage amounts. Neither party established the correct amounts. Marathon’s calculations indicated Mercuria benefited from Marathon’s failure to deliver because Mercuria used gas it had already purchased before the breach. In rejecting this argument the court stated that any unbridgeable discrepancy is measured at the time of breach. Mercuria’s actual damages would be the difference between the market price at the time of breach and the contract price.

The evidence necessary to establish Mercuria’s actual and spot‑price damages was not before the court, so the court could not determine whether the liquidated damages clause was enforceable. This was a summary judgment and the existence of fact issues precluded a final ruling. Those issues will be resolved at trial..

The holdings

The extreme weather associated with Winter Storm Uri constituted a force‑majeure event under the contract,

Marathon exercised reasonable efforts to mitigate the storm’s effects,

Marathon had no duty to buy replacement gas on the spot market to meet its delivery obligations or to buy back that delivery obligation.

The court could not determine whether the contract was unenforceable as a matter of law because of an “unbridgeable gap” between Mercuria’s actual and spot-price damages.

A third opinion

The court referred to its opinion issued on September 18, 2025, in which the court determined that several transactional confirmations must be read together with the Base Contract as a single, integrated agreement. The court withheld judgment on how that ruling might affect what was required under the contract.

Caveat

The three opinions together contain 67 pages. If gas sales contracts are your thing, you should read all three opinions. Otherwise, proceed to the musical interludes.

While we are going long, your musical interlude will do the same with cool movie themes.

We’ll find out.

A partisan battle is shaping up as part of the massive highway-policy bill that is rewritten every few years. The last cycle started in 2021 with the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law under former President Joe Biden, which dedicated billions of dollars for EVs and their charging networks. That cycle is ending with the Trump administration trying (but not quite succeeding) to prevent those dollars from being spent.

Now, lawmakers are starting to write a new surface transportation reauthorization bill they hope to enact by next October.

AUTOMATION FAIR 2025 IN CHICAGO BROUGHT TOGETHER MORE THAN 15,000 ATTENDEES FROM ACROSS INDUSTRY

The event highlighted how rapidly changing market conditions are affecting global manufacturers. Automation Fair offered attendees more than 250 educational sessions delivered over four days, including seven industry tracks: Automotive & Battery, Food & Beverage, Life Sciences, Mining, New & Traditional Energy, OEM/Machine Builders, and Water & Wastewater.

One example from the Automotive & Battery track was Automotive Viewpoint: Navigating the Crossroads, How Policy Shifts Are Reshaping Automotive Manufacturing and Automation. Panelists included Craig Resnick, VP at ARC Advisory Group; Mark Barrott, Partner at Plante Moran; James Glasson, VP, Global Industry, Auto, Tire and Advanced Mobility, Rockwell Automation; and Bill Sarver, Global Director of Rockwell Automation’s Smart Manufacturing – Automotive/EV Battery & Tire business.

Auto manufacturers are navigating declining EV tax credits in the US, tariffs, shifting regulatory environments, affordability concerns, supply chain fragmentation, and rising operational complexity. These changes are prompting companies to prioritize adaptability, visibility, and flexibility across production networks.

Panelists noted that technologies such as the digital thread, end-to-end data visibility, and AI-enabled optimization are becoming essential for managing quality, reducing variability, improving production predictability, and maintaining competitiveness. Craig Resnick, VP at ARC Advisory Group, says these technologies are increasingly critical because they improve product quality, lower warranty costs, and minimize recalls—benefits that often deliver a short-term return on investment while also reducing the indirect costs associated with declines to brand reputation and quality ratings. “It's really a matter of making sure that the vehicle that is produced is of top quality and is going to hopefully not require recalls down the road.”

While early excitement around connected, shared, autonomous, and electric vehicles has evolved, manufacturers are now focused on cost transformation, consolidated components, modular platforms, and scalable digital systems.

The integration of robotics, AMRs, fleet management, and intelligent logistics into unified plant operations.

Manufacturers are also preparing for new workforce expectations, with digitally fluent roles, expanded training requirements, hybrid learning environments, and advanced tools that allow operators to supervise broader areas instead of single machines.

Panel Insights: Building the Factory of the Future

Industry leaders from the automotive, mining, construction, and consumer goods sectors discussed how they are approaching autonomy, flexibility, and resilience in their operations. Panelists included Alberto Gomez of Procter & Gamble, Ann Especk of Bechtel, Gaetano Cantalupo of Lucid Motors, and Rafael Bittar of Vale Mining.

Key themes included:

People-powered transformation, with workforce empowerment central to operational redesign.

Process stabilization before automation, ensuring foundational systems are ready for scaling.

Scalable use cases, such as touchless quality, predictive maintenance, automated material handling, and model-based process control.

Reducing downtime, increasing throughput, and improving safety through AI-driven monitoring.

New workforce models, combining data science, process engineering, cybersecurity, and multi-disciplinary plant roles.

Flexible, modular plant designs, supporting rapid product introduction and adjusted production mix.

The panel emphasized that autonomy is not aimed at replacing workers but at redefining roles, improving safety, increasing throughput, and enabling operators to focus on higher-value tasks.

Major Announcement: New Greenfield Manufacturing Site in Wisconsin

During the event, Rockwell Automation announced plans to build a new greenfield manufacturing campus in Southeastern Wisconsin. The facility will become one of its largest production sites, forming a core part of its multi-year investment strategy in plants, digital infrastructure, and workforce development.

In Chamber of Commerce v. EPA, petitioners highlight several issues posed by EPA’s promulgation of its Final Rule and request the court to vacate the rule. For one, they contend that the EPA misinterpreted the standard for hazardous substance designations under CERCLA. Specifically, petitioners argue that the agency misinterpreted the term “may present substantial danger” under section 102(a) of CERCLA by not providing “fixed boundaries” relating to EPA’s discretion in designating “hazardous substances” under the rule. Petitioners assert that the EPA’s mere consideration of a “non-exhaustive list of factors in an unknown manner” to decide “remote possibilities of harm” does not satisfy “fixed-boundary” requirements for agency interpretation of statutory terms as established in Loper Bright Enterprises v. Raimondo, 144 S. Ct. 2244 (2024). Petitioners further cite CERCLA provisions mandating a higher threshold for agency designations of “hazardous substances” as compared to requirements for “pollutants or contaminants.” Finally, petitioners argue that the EPA’s interpretation of “may present substantial danger” under the rule is inconsistent with prior agency guidance imposing concrete, quantitative thresholds for predictable and reviewable limits concerning designation of “hazardous substances.”

Next, petitioners argue that the EPA employed a flawed cost analysis that did not provide an adequate notice and comment period in violation of the Administrative Procedure Act (APA). To the later point, according to petitioners, the EPA failed to disclose its Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), which the agency relied on to justify the promulgation of its Final Rule. As discussed by petitioners, while the RIA estimated “direct” costs of the rule (e.g., costs related to reporting releases), it only provided a qualitative discussion of the rule’s “indirect” costs (e.g., future cleanup costs). According to petitioners, some of the substantive errors in the EPA’s RIA include its reliance on assumptions that National Priorities List (NPL) sites would incur no new cleanup costs and that cleanups would occur only at a small subset of non-NPL sites, its failure to acknowledge cleanup costs at federal sites and impacts on small entities and certain industry sectors (e.g., waste management, recyclers, construction, and demolition), and its miscalculation of the rule’s alleged offsetting benefits (e.g., identifying enhanced waste management practices exclusively as benefits while ignoring corresponding costs).

Finally, petitioners contend that the EPA acted arbitrary and capriciously by not sufficiently understanding the rule’s implications. Petitioners identify several unknowns that have not yet been addressed by the agency following the promulgation of its Final Rule, including identification of site locations, remedies, methodologies for quantifying PFAS concentrations, costs associated with implementation of the rule, and the rule’s wider implications on real estate transactions.

Case and Agency Updates Relating to Chamber of Commerce v. EPA

There have been numerous case and agency updates since the Chamber of Commerce filed its opening brief in November 2024. In January 2025, the EPA filed a brief defending the rule and responding to petitioners’ claims in Chamber of Commerce v. EPA. The brief defends the EPA’s substantial danger finding as required for first-time hazardous substance designations, refutes the petitioners’ arguments that inherent uncertainty about future response actions precludes the agency from acting, and argues that the EPA did not violate APA requirements through promulgation of its Final Rule.

In February 2025, the EPA filed a motion to hold the case in abeyance to allow the incoming Trump EPA time to review the underlying rule and determine how to proceed moving forward. Later that month, the D.C. Circuit Court granted EPA’s request pending the new EPA leadership’s review of the rule.

In April 2025, the EPA announced that it would work with Congress to exempt passive receivers from CERCLA liability. Passive receivers are those who did not introduce PFAS into the environment, such as current property owners who do and did not use PFAS, wastewater treatment plants to the extent they receive PFAS-impacted influent, waste disposal facilities when receiving PFAS-impacted household waste, and drinking water suppliers with PFAS-impacted surface- or groundwater supplies.

In September 2025, the EPA filed a motion asking the Court to lift the abeyance after it announced that it would defend and retain the rule. The motion includes a declaration from a senior adviser to the EPA’s Office of Land and Emergency Management (John Evans) stating that the agency would continue to “engage with Congress and industry to establish a clear liability framework that ensures the polluter pays and passive receivers are protected.” In October 2025, the D.C. Circuit Court granted EPA’s motion and set a December deadline for final briefs.

Protecting so-called “passive receivers” raises significant questions, including the criteria for determining qualifying entities, scope of the protections provided, and potential consequences of enforcement actions and cost allocations on EPA-identified sites involving such entities. The EPA has signaled to Congress that it should adopt new statutory language to address concerns associated with passive receiver liability.

PFOA and PFOS contamination remain viable grounds for Superfund liability today. While litigation is ongoing and may change the PFAS federal regulatory landscape, industries across the supply chain—including in manufacturing, water treatment, and waste management—should expect enhanced scrutiny as the EPA establishes future rules expanding monitoring, reporting, and corrective action requirements for PFAS. Companies and stakeholders can take proactive steps now, including tracking potential releases of PFAS in their waste streams, monitoring potential PFAS contamination during environmental due diligence for transactions, and staying up to date on potential liability that may arise from real property investments.",https://www.americanbar.org/content/dam/aba/images/aba-stock/16x9/16x9-workers-1336267389.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 08:59:58.745447

As DSPs, business owners get access to “branded Amazon vehicles customized for delivery,” among other deals, as stated by the company on its website.
Amazon currently has “more than 35,000” electric delivery vans operating globally, which includes not only the United States but also Canada and Europe.
The first Rivian vans were first seen in Germany two years ago.","A few units of unbranded Rivian electric delivery vans (EDV) have been spotted in an Amazon center in Indiana, sparking speculation about its purpose.

On Tuesday, Reddit user ‘Affectionate_Rent701’ shared that they had spotted a few units of what appears to be Rivian‘s Delivery 500 van — a slightly smaller version of the Delivery 700 vans that are included in Amazon‘s fleet.

Additionally, the vans did not display the retail giant’s branding.

The vans that operate under the company are blue and feature its logo on the front, as opposed to Rivian‘s.

Several users on Reddit Forum ‘AmazonDSPDrivers’, a subreddit for Amazon Delivery Service Partners, have speculated about the purpose of these vans, which are unusual in the area.

User ‘Exotic-Relation-3980’ pointed out that the vehicles seemed to be in the DIN4 lot, a detail later confirmed by the original poster.

The DIN4 lot is part of Amazon‘s fulfillment center in Greenwood, Indiana, which also includes a 100,000-square-foot warehouse.

User ‘Herbagerber’ wrote that their “DSP is renting 9 or 10 of them for peak season, I think they’re a bit shorter than the regular EDV’s.”

EDV Leasing

It is unclear whether the “renting” process of these specific units is done with Amazon or an external company.

As DSPs, business owners get access to “branded Amazon vehicles customized for delivery,” among other deals, as stated by the company on its website.

While the partner is “responsible for procuring delivery vehicles for its operations,” it “has negotiated a ‘flexible lease’ option that enables you to lease Amazon-branded vehicles designed specifically for this program from a third-party fleet management company.”

Replying to the previous mentioned comment, the original poster said, “I thought we all were assigned them.”

“There’s I swear to god like 30-40 blue branded ones with the seats still wrapped taking up the whole north end of the lot. So we’ll see who gets those,” they added.

Service Vans

Replying to a comment by ‘LordTinkleBottom,’ who wrote that these vans had been “originally designed as service technician vehicles for Rivian,” the original poster noted that a service shop is currently under construction at the lot.

“Another 5 just showed up this morning. They’re building a service shop on my lot right now as well. Wonder if it’s related,” they wrote.

This could indicate that the vans will be used on Rivian‘s Mobile Service, which has been provided through adapted delivery vans since 2023 and is likely set to expand to Europe after only being available in North America.

Amazon, which is currently the largest shareholder in Rivian (set to be surpassed by Volkswagen), purchased 100,000 Rivian EDVs back in 2019, with the EV maker committing to deliver them until 2030.

Recently, Rivian‘s chief executive RJ Scaringe hinted at a contract expansion beyond the 100,000 units.

Amazon currently has “more than 35,000” electric delivery vans operating globally, which includes not only the United States but also Canada and Europe.

The first Rivian vans were first seen in Germany two years ago. There are currently “over 300” EDVs operating in the continent, according to Amazon.

The two companies stated in 2023 that they have “designed a shorter, thinner van than its US counterpart, in order to better fit in Europe’s cities.”

The vehicles are used to “deliver packages across major cities including Munich, Berlin and Dusseldorf.”",https://eletric-vehicles.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/these-babies-showed-up-on-my-lot-last-night-v0-zviyvovb9f3g1-e1764157219759.webp,N,,2025-11-26 07:59:40.817699

Clean, renewable energy is therefore not just preferable — it’s indispensable for responsible digital growth.
The message is unmistakable: AI and clean energy will rise together — or not at all.","Artificial Intelligence is no longer a concept — it’s the new current of progress. It builds cars that think, hospitals that predict, and cities that learn.

Every innovation now runs on invisible streams of data — and behind every byte of data, there is a pulse of electricity.

Data centres hum through the night.

Cloud systems and high-capacity computing never sleep.

As this digital web expands, one truth becomes clear: AI’s rise depends on energy that never stops and never pollutes.

That is the idea behind Avaada’s “Always Clean, Always On” — a commitment to power the intelligence of tomorrow with renewable energy that is constant, conscious, and infinite.

The Power Needs of a Digital Civilization

The next wave of digital growth will not come from code alone — it will come from electricity that flows without interruption.

Autonomous mobility:

Real-time sensors and navigation require seamless power to keep roads safe and vehicles connected.

Smart & automated manufacturing:

Robots, analytics, and precision tools depend on stable computing.

Clean energy ensures no downtime and no compromise.

Urban digital infrastructure:

Smart lighting, public safety, and intelligent traffic systems thrive on consistent power supply.

Reliability defines performance.

Cloud-based healthcare:

Hospitals and diagnostic systems depend on electricity to process, store, and access life-critical data without delay.

Digital learning & immersive content:

Virtual classrooms

Metaverse experiences

Remote collaboration

All rely on continuous computing — and thus, continuous clean power.

Meeting these needs with fossil fuel-based energy would raise emissions and slow climate progress.

Clean, renewable energy is therefore not just preferable — it’s indispensable for responsible digital growth.

Avaada’s Renewable Portfolio: Power That Never Sleeps

With 6 GWp of operational renewable capacity and 26 GWp under development, Avaada is building one of India’s most advanced ecosystems for Round-the-Clock Clean Power — ready to meet the energy appetite of AI and data-driven industries.

Solar Energy:

Large-scale solar farms harness the sun’s consistency to provide cost-effective, zero-emission electricity.

Wind Energy:

Projects located in high-yield corridors complement solar production and balance day-night generation.

Hybrid Projects:

Blending solar and wind ensures steady output across seasons.

Reduces dependence on thermal backup.

Pumped Hydro Storage:

Stores excess renewable power and releases it when demand peaks.

Enhances grid stability.

Battery Energy Storage Systems (BESS):

Stores short- and medium-term energy reserves.

Vital for data centres and manufacturing plants that cannot afford even seconds of interruption.

Beyond electricity, Avaada is also building capacity in Green Hydrogen and its derivatives, enabling deep decarbonisation for sectors like:

Chemicals

Steel

Heavy transport

Together, these technologies make Avaada not just a power producer — but a 24×7 reliability partner for the AI economy.

The Global Shift: Why Clean Power Defines the Future

Across the world, four trends are rewriting how countries and companies plan their power needs:

Growth Driver — What It Means

Digital Adoption: Continuous operation of data centres and cloud systems requires dependable power.

Sustainability Mandates: Businesses are adopting renewables to meet ESG and compliance goals.

AI-Driven Innovation: AI’s expansion depends on uninterrupted, clean, high-density electricity.

Climate Urgency: Nations are accelerating the shift from fossil fuels to renewables for long-term climate goals.

The message is unmistakable: AI and clean energy will rise together — or not at all.

Always Clean, Always On — Campaign Insight

To make this truth visible to millions, Avaada brought the message to Kaun Banega Crorepati (KBC), India’s most trusted public platform.

The campaign uses a simple conversation with AI to show how every digital search sets off billions of micro-operations — each consuming electricity.

And then comes a timeless reminder from Mr. Amitabh Bachchan:

“Aaj ek AI search, kal crore AI searches… sochiye, kal kitni urja chahiye hogi in sab ko?

Aur agar woh urja hi na rahi… toh sawal bhi ruk jayenge, jawab bhi… sirf andhera.”

(One AI search today, a billion tomorrow — imagine the energy it will need. And if that energy runs out, there will be no questions, no answers — only darkness.)

The message is simple yet profound:

The future of intelligence must be powered by energy that is clean, constant, and conscious.

Powering the Intelligent Planet

AI is transforming how humanity thinks, creates, and connects. But its brilliance will depend on what powers it.

Avaada’s Always Clean, Always On initiative ensures that progress doesn’t come at the planet’s expense — that every watt driving innovation is sustainable, stable, and eternal.

Because the intelligence of tomorrow should not burn — it should bloom.

It is as important as ever that states like Minnesota step up and play a vital role in advancing the goals of global climate action.
As the U.S. has shirked away from international cooperation, China has stepped into its vacuum, sending nearly 800 delegates to Brazil.
More than half of the minerals needed for the global energy transition are located on or near Indigenous lands.
These are the kinds of initiatives that can help Minnesota lead on the global climate stage.","I had the privilege of representing Minnesota at the recent United Nations Climate Conference of Parties. I’ve been attending these summits alongside Minnesota’s educators, elected officials and business leaders for the past 10 years. It is as important as ever that states like Minnesota step up and play a vital role in advancing the goals of global climate action.

Over 50,000 people from 193 nations gathered at the mouth of the Amazon in Belém, Brazil, for a two-week summit to spur further action to limit the planet’s warming and protect vulnerable people and places. Indigenous peoples were present in overwhelming numbers at this COP, with banners that read “Not about us without us” — demanding inclusion in decision making.

For the first time in the 30-year history of COP climate summits, the U.S. did not send a single federal government official to the talks. The other missing nations were Afghanistan, Myanmar and San Marino. Even North Korea sent a delegation to Brazil.

As the U.S. has shirked away from international cooperation, China has stepped into its vacuum, sending nearly 800 delegates to Brazil. From plenary sessions to back corridors, I heard praise upon praise for how Chinese industrial policies have brought down the costs of solar panels and electric vehicles for all.

While the federal government’s presence was lacking, the U.S. was not entirely absent from COP30. A coalition of 100 local leaders, governors and one sole member of Congress — U.S. Sen.Sheldon Whitehouse, D-R.I. — delivered a singular message: Our cities and states are working to be reliable and stable partners in the fight for climate action.

Gov. Gavin Newsom stole the stage at COP30, moving from venue to venue declaring his climate ambitions. Taking the torch of international cooperation from the federal government, Newsom went on to sign technology agreements with Brazil, Columbia and Nigeria.

Newsom’s leadership should resonate with Minnesotans and our elected officials. As Fresh Energy has calculated, if the Midwest were its own country, we would rank as the fifth-largest emitter globally. Compared with other U.S. regions, our transportation, agricultural and electricity generation systems disproportionately rely on fossil fuels like coal and natural gas.

But Minnesota is also the exception of the region. We lead the Midwest with our 100% clean electricity by 2040 law, and other states in our region are following our example.

Given this, I was disappointed that Gov. Tim Walz and members of his administration did not attend COP30 and spread our successes. Minnesota often has one of the largest delegations — representing the private, public and nonprofit sectors — at these climate summits. There were over 60 of us from Minnesota in Scotland for COP26. This year would have been a golden opportunity to showcase our progressive policies to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and achieve net-zero emissions, particularly our unique critical minerals reserves and our metals recycling industries.

While COP30 did not achieve wide consensus on the phasing out of fossil fuels, it did result in some important milestones, including the first references in the draft action plan to the social and environmental risks associated with mining critical minerals. More than half of the minerals needed for the global energy transition are located on or near Indigenous lands. Brazil’s President Lula da Silva told leaders gathered in Belém that it is “impossible to discuss the energy transition without talking about critical minerals, essential to make batteries, solar panels and energy systems.”

While this initiative was supported by dozens of countries, it was ultimately left out of the final declaration in large part due to opposition from China. Nonetheless, this COP showed us mineral diplomacy will be a key part of climate diplomacy in the future. The material realities of the clean energy transition — including the need to sustainably source lithium, cobalt, nickel, copper — can no longer be ignored.

Minnesota can be a global example of responsible mineral production that prioritizes Indigenous peoples’ participation. We can also be at the forefront of developing a circular economy for energy transition minerals so that we can protect our treasured places.

At COP30, the International Energy Agency highlighted evidence that the market value of critical minerals recycling could reach $200 billion by 2050. In 2024, the Minnesota Legislature created a Critical Materials Recovery Task Force to advise policymakers on how to increase the recovery of critical materials — including aluminum, cobalt, copper, nickel and silicon — from end-of-life products. These are the kinds of initiatives that can help Minnesota lead on the global climate stage.

I came home from Brazil with a renewed commitment to fighting climate change here at home. This work starts by channeling the leadership of other nations, and key U.S. states, to move forward on emissions reductions while pursuing economic opportunities.

Charting a path on responsible mineral production in Minnesota could demonstrate to the world how we can meet our global challenges with integrity.

As great-grandmother Mary Lyons, Ojibwe elder from Minnesota, told the attendees of COP30 in Brazil, common sense tells us to “stand up for the truth” and that “if you poison the water, you poison yourself.”",https://cdn.newsfromthestates.com/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-87/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/gettyimages-22447881371764157769.jpg?h=199d8c1f&itok=2p_zNRWn,N,,2025-11-26 11:07:06.631422

Dan Newhouse (R-Wash.) are calling on US House leadership to pass H.R. 2072/S.1020, the “Build More Hydro” bill, warning that dozens of licensed hydropower projects face termination unless Congress acts.

In a letter to Speaker Mike Johnson and Majority Leader Steve Scalise, the lawmakers said the bill would authorise the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) to extend construction deadlines for 37 ready-to-build hydropower projects across 15 states. Those projects represent more than 2.6GW of baseload generation and $6.5bn in investment.

“On July 9, 2025, S.1020 passed the Senate by unanimous consent and the House received the bill on August 1, 2025, where it remains held at the desk awaiting action,” the letter stated.

The lawmakers warned that congressional delay is already having an impact. “Approximately 100MW of hydropower has been put on hold with an additional 36MW forced into limbo by the end of the year because of congressional inaction.”

Hydropower’s broader role in the US energy system was also emphasised. “Hydropower supplies baseload electricity to over 30 million homes, provides 96% of utility-scale energy storage, and remains vital to flood control, water storage, irrigation, and grid reliability services.

“Losing these projects would undermine grid reliability at a time when we can least afford it,” the letter said.

The National Hydropower Association (NHA), which represents the US hydropower and pumped storage industry, welcomed the lawmakers’ call to action. In a statement, NHA said: “We’re in an affordability crisis, and we must do all we can to get more clean, reliable, affordable hydropower on the grid to lower costs and meet growing demand.” NHA urged industry stakeholders and the public to contact their House members to support the bill.

Daines and Newhouse asked House leadership to place the bill on the suspension calendar to advance it before the end of the year. “Advancing S.1020 before the end of the year is an essential step to protect American energy security, ensure reliable power to communities across the nation and prevent the loss of billions in investment.”",https://www.waterpowermagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2025/11/1764093830823.jpeg,N,,2025-11-26 10:00:28.379370

He's Delivered on One.,"Lisa Friedman, www.nytimes.com, lisa-friedman",,,,,https://www.nytimes.com/2025/11/26/climate/trump-energy-drilling-inflation.html,"The price of a barrel of oil has tumbled from roughly $75 when Mr. Trump took office to below $60.
His tariffs have raised the cost of steel and other commodities that oil companies require for wells and other equipment.
Prices at the pump dipped briefly earlier this year but nowhere near by half, as Mr. Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail.
At the same time, Mr. Trump is working to repeal dozens of environmental regulations that added costs for fossil fuel companies.
Bob Ryan, who heads an analysis firm Ryan Commodity Insights, said the oil industry “had higher hopes” when Mr. Trump was inaugurated.","Never before has a president swept into the White House pledging such a rapid expansion of oil and gas drilling in the United States as Donald Trump.

But nearly a year since Mr. Trump ordered his administration to unearth the nation’s vast reserves of petroleum — or, as he called it, the “liquid gold under our feet” — analysts said fossil fuel production wasn’t much higher than the record levels that existed during the Biden administration.

The price of a barrel of oil has tumbled from roughly $75 when Mr. Trump took office to below $60. His tariffs have raised the cost of steel and other commodities that oil companies require for wells and other equipment. Oil production is up, but largely because of improved efficiency, and it has not translated into more jobs for either the industry or the overall economy.

Prices at the pump dipped briefly earlier this year but nowhere near by half, as Mr. Trump repeatedly promised on the campaign trail. And the administration has taken other actions, like ordering that expensive coal-burning power plants remain open, canceling permits for offshore wind projects and encouraging exports of natural gas overseas, that in combination may have helped to raise electricity and natural gas prices for American consumers.

“The ‘Drill, baby, drill’ agenda has not materialized,” said Kenneth B. Medlock, an energy economist at Rice University’s Baker Institute for Public Policy in Houston.

And yet the uncertain investment climate for fossil fuels comes as the industry’s political influence has soared this year.

A sweeping domestic policy bill that Mr. Trump signed into law this summer is already yielding nearly $6 billion in tax breaks this year for the country’s biggest oil and gas companies, a New York Times analysis of investor statements and public records shows.

At the same time, Mr. Trump is working to repeal dozens of environmental regulations that added costs for fossil fuel companies. He has opened up millions of acres of ecologically sensitive land in Alaska to drilling, including the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge’s coastal plain, and is poised to deliver millions of acres of offshore ocean waters for new drilling as well.

The Trump administration on Monday asked a federal court to strike down limits on soot released by power plants and industrial facilities and on Tuesday said it would delay by three years a requirement that coal-fired plants clean up toxic coal waste.

The president has struck deals requiring countries in Europe and Asia to purchase American liquefied natural gas for years to come. He has hobbled wind and solar projects and electric vehicles that were cutting into oil’s market share. And his administration has blocked other nations from imposing climate rules that could drive up costs for American oil and gas companies.

And last week, as nations gathered in Belém, Brazil, for a United Nations summit to tackle climate change, Mr. Trump hosted Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia in the White House. Prince Mohammed’s oil-rich country has worked closely with the Trump administration to thwart international climate agreements — even as Saudi Arabia has an ambitious plan to diversify its own economy away from oil by 2030.

“It’s time for radical Democrats to abandon the Green New Scam experiment and embrace President Trump’s successful energy dominance agenda,” she said.

Dustin Meyer, senior vice president of policy at the American Petroleum Institute, credited Trump administration policies for the slight increase in oil production — to about 13.9 million barrels a day, compared with the previous record achieved under the Biden administration of 13.4 million barrels a day — despite the falling price of crude. The effect of leasing more public land and waters to drilling and eliminating regulations might not be seen for a few more years, he said.

“At the highest level, the administration’s understanding of the value proposition of American energy development is a notable departure from the previous four years,” Mr. Meyer said.

Mr. Trump’s critics argued that his policies had driven up prices and eliminated clean energy jobs while putting the country’s air and water at risk.

Household electricity bills have gone up 11 percent nationally since Mr. Trump took office, and more than 158,000 clean energy jobs in wind, solar and other clean energy manufacturing have been lost or have stalled since the administration eliminated Biden-era grants and subsidies, according to Climate Power, an environmental nonprofit group.

The repeal of climate regulations and canceled funds for clean energy could pump between 22 billion and 32 billion metric tons of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere by 2055, according to an analysis by the Environmental Defense Fund. That’s more than four times the current emissions produced annually in the United States.

And it could mean an additional 340,000 premature deaths, 490,000 hospital and emergency room visits and up to $6.7 trillion in higher energy and health care costs, the study found.

“We’re only just beginning to see what havoc this agenda is going to wreak,” said Abigail Dillen, president of Earthjustice, an environmental law firm.

As a candidate, Mr. Trump made a bold pitch to oil executives and lobbyists at a chopped-steak dinner at his Mar-a-Lago estate: Donate $1 billion to his White House bid, and they would save more than that in taxes and legal expenses if he returned to the White House.

In fact, Mr. Trump’s tax and policy law is projected to deliver at least $18 billion in government subsidies and tax breaks for oil, gas and coal over the next decade.

The biggest U.S. fossil fuel companies, including some of Mr. Trump’s top donors, are already reporting hundreds of millions of dollars apiece in tax savings, according to a review of investor calls and federal financial disclosures.

Cheniere Energy Inc., a major exporter of liquefied natural gas based in Houston, has told investors it expects more than $200 million in reduced taxes as a result of the law and an additional $400 million from changes the Trump administration is making to the corporate alternative minimum tax. Jack Fusco, the chief executive officer of Cheniere, donated $250,000 to Trump 47, a joint fund-raising committee that collected high-dollar donations to the president’s campaign.

Devon Energy Corporation, an independent oil and gas exploration and production company, reported that the tax law could save it more than $1.3 billion over three years. Richard Muncrief, Devon’s chief executive officer, and his wife, Gail Muncrief, donated $150,000 apiece to the Trump 47 political action committee.

And Occidental Petroleum told investors it expected $800 million in benefits, overwhelmingly from subsidies in the new law for capturing carbon and storing it so that it doesn’t reach the atmosphere. Vicki Hollub, Occidental’s chief operating executive, donated $400,000 to the Trump 47 committee.

Lukas Ross, deputy climate and energy director at Friends of the Earth, an environmental group, called the savings “the payday that Donald Trump promised in Mar-a-Lago.”

And yet, energy experts said the past year had hardly been rosy for the industry.

Oil companies may be saving billions on the tax law, but they could stand to lose just as much from Mr. Trump’s tariffs, which have increased costs for materials like aluminum and steel that are needed for drilling equipment.

Bob Ryan, who heads an analysis firm Ryan Commodity Insights, said the oil industry “had higher hopes” when Mr. Trump was inaugurated. But the first year of Mr. Trump’s presidency has been “too confusing to be positive” for most companies, he said.

It’s the price of oil that determines whether companies invest in new drilling.

“Market conditions still rule,” said Joseph Majkut, director of the Energy Security and Climate Change Program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.",https://static01.nyt.com/images/2025/11/25/multimedia/25cli-Trump-fossilfuels-01-qwmf/25cli-Trump-fossilfuels-01-qwmf-facebookJumbo.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 07:59:37.184520

KFF HEALTH NEWS ORIGINAL STORIES

KFF Health News: South Carolina’s Measles Outbreak Shows Chilling Effect Of Vaccine Misinformation

Near the back corner of the local library’s parking lot, largely out of view from the main road, the South Carolina Department of Public Health opened a pop-up clinic in early November, offering free measles vaccines to adults and children. Spartanburg County, in South Carolina’s Upstate region, has been fighting a measles outbreak since early October, with more than 50 cases identified. Health officials have encouraged people who are unvaccinated to get a shot by visiting its mobile vaccine clinic at any of its several stops throughout the county. But on a Monday afternoon in Boiling Springs, only one person showed up. (Sausser, 11/26)

KFF Health News: After Shutdown, Federal Employees Face New Uncertainty: Affording Health Insurance

Larry Humphreys, a retired Federal Emergency Management Agency worker in Moultrie, Georgia, says he and his wife won’t be traveling much next year after their monthly health insurance premium payment increases more than 40%, to $938. Humphreys, 68, feels betrayed by the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program. “As federal employees we sacrificed good salaries in the private sector because we thought the benefits from government would be better now, in retirement,” he said. (Galewitz, 11/26)

KFF Health News: Trump Almost Unveils A Health Plan

Republicans remain divided over how to address the impending expiration of more generous Affordable Care Act plan tax credits, which will send premiums spiraling for millions of Americans starting in January if no further action is taken. The Trump administration floated a proposal over the weekend that included a two-year extension of the credits as well as some restrictions pushed by Republicans, but the plan was met with strong pushback on Capitol Hill and its unveiling was delayed. (Rovner, 11/25)

KFF Health News: Listen To The Latest 'KFF Health News Minute'

Sam Whitehead reads the week’s news: Some American cities such as L.A. and Houston have more traffic fatalities than homicides, and though most children and adults would benefit from annual covid shots, few are getting them. (11/25)

PRESCRIPTION DRUG COSTS

The Washington Post: Weight-Loss, Cancer Drugs Among 15 To Get Lower Medicare Pricing, U.S. Says

The Trump administration on Tuesday said it will pay lower prices for 15 prescription drugs for people on Medicare, including GLP-1 medications Ozempic and Wegovy, inhaler Trelegy Ellipta and cancer drugs Xtandi, Pomalyst and Ibrance. The announcement followed the second round of negotiations with pharmaceutical manufacturers under a new system implemented by the Biden administration as part of the 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The act allows Medicare to directly negotiate with pharmaceutical companies over the price of medications it covers. (Vinall, 11/26)

HEALTH CARE COSTS AND COVERAGE

Politico: Trump Opens The Door To Obamacare Subsidy Extension

President Donald Trump on Tuesday suggested he was open to extending Obamacare subsidies that are set to expire at the end of the year if it would give Congress time to make changes that he supports to the federally run health care plan. “Some kind of an extension may be necessary to get something else done, because the unaffordable care act has been a disaster,” Trump told reporters on Air Force One, referring to Obamacare’s official name, the Affordable Care Act. (Haslett and Gardner, 11/25)

Politico: The Big Sticking Point In The White House's Health Care Proposal

The White House’s silence on how its health care plan deals with abortion is causing a headache for Republicans on Capitol Hill. For many GOP members, an expansion of abortion restrictions in Obamacare is a must-have. But the White House’s decision to leave the issue out of its tentative framework caught Republicans off guard, leaving them in the dark about whether the president would ultimately stake out a position publicly, according to two aides granted anonymity to disclose private discussions. (Ollstein, Carney and Haslett, 11/25)

The New York Times: Once Foes Of Obamacare, Some Republicans Push To Protect It

Representative Jen Kiggans, Republican of Virginia, once called for eliminating the Affordable Care Act. Representative Mike Lawler, Republican of New York, has repeatedly called it “a disaster.” But the two are part of a small group of G.O.P. members of Congress — most of them facing tough re-election races next year in competitive districts — who have broken with their party to push for a temporary extension of a crucial piece of the law: subsidies, currently slated to expire at the end of the year, to help Americans afford their premiums. (Jimison, 11/25)

The Washington Post: Why Health Savings Accounts Aren’t A Substitute For Real Insurance

Republicans facing voter ire over spiking health premiums are resurrecting one of their favorite ideas: give people power to pay for medical care on their own, with tax-free dollars in individual health savings accounts. The GOP is toying with the idea of taking federal subsidies that currently help people buy Affordable Care Act insurance and diverting some of the money into individuals’ HSAs, although passing legislation without help from Democrats is a tall order with Republicans’ slim Senate and House majorities. (Winfield Cunningham, 11/25)

Axios: What's Next For ACA Tax Credits? 5 Scenarios For The Subsidy Drama

President Trump's trial balloon for extending the Affordable Care Act's enhanced subsidies has been shot down, but the real moment of truth for him and Congress may come in the run-up to the next government funding cliff, in late January. (Sullivan, 11/26)

Stat: Health Insurers Trying To Avoid Costly Medicare Enrollees Draw Scrutiny

CDC LEADERSHIP

The New York Times: Doctor Critical Of Vaccines Quietly Appointed As C.D.C.’s Second In Command

Dr. Ralph Abraham, who as Louisiana’s surgeon general ordered the state health department to stop promoting vaccinations and who has called Covid vaccines “dangerous,” has been named the second in command at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. The Department of Health and Human Services did not announce the appointment, and many C.D.C. employees seemed unaware of it. But the C.D.C.’s internal database lists Dr. Abraham as the agency’s principal deputy director, with a start date of Nov. 23. The appointment was first reported by the Substack column Inside Medicine. (Mandavilli, 11/25)

The Hill: Trump EPA Seeks Court To Overturn Joe Biden's Soot Limits

The Trump administration on Monday asked a federal court to overturn a Biden-era rule limiting deadly soot pollution. In a court filing, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) argued that the Biden-era rule tightening limits was procedurally flawed and therefore should be vacated. It said that the Biden administration took a “shortcut,” making the rule stricter “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required.” (Frazin, 11/25)

CNN: The US Has Released An ‘America First Global Health Strategy.’ Health Experts Warn It Is Risky

Health experts are warning that the Trump administration’s new “America First Global Health Strategy” could further damage public health systems already reeling from billions of dollars in foreign aid cuts following the destruction of the US Agency for International Development (USAID), and while some say the new system could bring benefits, there is agreement it marks a radical change in approach from decades of US policy. (Kent and Hansler, 11/26)

Bloomberg: How Trump’s Fight Against Fentanyl Turns To India From China

As US-India relations began to sour earlier this year, drug-control experts briefed officials in the Trump administration on how the South Asian nation fit into the murky trade in chemicals used to make fentanyl. Among the topics of discussion was whether India’s growing role in supply chains of the deadly opioid could be used to justify new tariffs on the nation’s goods, according to people familiar with the matter, who asked not to be identified because the consultations were confidential. The White House didn’t respond to a request for comment on those discussions. (Strumpf and Palepu, 11/26)

Bloomberg: USDA’s Top Economist To Leave For Missouri Policy Institute

The US Agriculture Department’s top economist is departing from the agency to lead the University of Missouri’s food and agricultural policy institute. Seth Meyer has been the USDA’s chief economist since 2021, helming an office whose responsibilities include the market-moving monthly World Agricultural Supply and Demand Estimates report. Meyer will be leading the Food and Agricultural Policy Research Institute starting Jan. 1, succeeding Pat Westhoff, who is retiring in March, the University of Missouri said in a Tuesday release. (Peng, 11/25)

The New York Times: Transportation Chief Wants Healthier In-Flight Snack Options

Sean Duffy, the transportation secretary, has been urging people for the past week to dress and comport themselves better as a way of restoring “civility” to air travel. On Tuesday, he added another item to his list of concerns: the quality of the snacks handed out on commercial flights. In an interview posted Tuesday on the conservative news site Blaze Media, Mr. Duffy said he would prefer that airlines offered options that are not heavy on butter, sugar or what he described as “crap.” He finds the standard choices of cookies or small bags of pretzels lacking, he said.

Undark: Infant Formula Needs Evidence-Based Oversight. Will MAHA Step Up?

In 2017, a headline on a local TV news website asked a distressing question: “Are dangerous chemicals lurking in your baby food?” The associated broadcast, citing “an alarming study,” reported that 80 percent of infant formulas and several other popular baby food products had tested positive for arsenic, a toxic heavy metal.

Novo Nordisk A/S’s next-generation diabetes shot lowered patients’ blood sugar and helped them lose weight in a study that may be a positive sign for the embattled drugmaker’s future portfolio.

People who took it as a once-daily oral drug shed up to 10.1% of their weight, Novo said on Tuesday. After losing its lead in the booming obesity market to US rival Eli Lilly & Co., Novo needs next-generation drugs to improve its competitive position.

Billions Spent, Still Dependent: America’s bid to reshore semiconductor manufacturing – backed by the $52 billion CHIPS Act – has yielded shiny new fabs in Arizona, but at staggering cost overruns (TSMC’s investment ballooned from $12 billion to $40 billion (opens in a new tab)) and glaring supply-chain gaps. Advanced chips made in the U.S. still must be flown back to Taiwan for final packaging, adding expense and underscoring how incomplete the domestic ecosystem remains (opens in a new tab).

“Made in USA” Missing Pieces: The U.S. underestimated the inputs needed to operate high-tech facilities. Taiwan’s TSMC, for example, replicated its production environment in Arizona but had to import essentials – from hundreds of skilled engineers to ultra-pure water infrastructure – to keep the project on track, cites Apple Insider. Labor shortages, water scarcity in the desert, and reliance on foreign equipment reveal that simply building a factory doesn’t guarantee self-sufficiency.

Rare Earth Déjà Vu: Now, a similar blind spot looms in rare earth elements (REEs). Washington, DC, under President Trump, is racing to fund mines and separation plants for critical minerals (via the legacy Defense Production Act and Inflation Reduction Act, and more imminently a series of emergency orders). Still, without a full plan with real industrial policy, new U.S. rare earth facilities could stall or remain dependent on Chinese chemicals and know-how. The refining of REEs requires hundreds of solvent extraction steps with specialized reagents as cited via REEx – guess who dominates those? China.

Lightweight Policy Without a Plan: From the CHIPS Act to the Inflation Reduction Act to the even more transactional, emergency, and tariff-driven Trump 2.0, U.S. leaders touted bold investments to reclaim supply chains, yet failed to map out an end-to-end industrial strategy. The CHIPS Act poured subsidies into fabs but neglected downstream steps like advanced packaging, as but one example (hence the ongoing reliance on Taiwan). Likewise, the IRA incentivized EV battery minerals but overlooked permanent magnets and motor components that rely on rare earths, leaving that vulnerability unaddressed (opens in a new tab) back in 2022 under Biden.

The Cost of Neglect: Lack of a comprehensive industrial policy means paying more for less security. America risks repeating the semiconductor fiasco with rare earths – spending vast sums on facilities that, in practice, still depend on imports or face delays. Experts warn, as identified in REEx, it will take 5–10 years of concerted effort to replicate China’s capabilities. Until then, the U.S. remains one supply chain shock away from crisis, having built half an industry at full price plus overtime costs.

What's Inside

Silicon Desert Mirage: Fabs Built, Supply Chain Broken

The effort to onshore semiconductor production was supposed to be a triumphant return of high-tech manufacturing to U.S. soil. Instead, it’s become a case study in how not to do industrial policy. Taiwan’s TSMC and Intel’s new chip fabs in Arizona – heavily subsidized by the CHIPS Act – have encountered soaring costs, delays, and unforeseen infrastructure needs. As Reuters reported (opens in a new tab), TSMC had to more than triple its planned Arizona investment (from $12 billion to $40 billion) just to get the first fab up and running. Construction has been beset by cost overruns and schedule slips, pushing initial production from 2024 into 2025.

Why the trouble? It turns out building a fab is one thing; operating it is another. These ultra-advanced plants require a whole ecosystem that the U.S. had allowed to wither. For instance, Arizona’s desert environment posed a basic challenge: water. A modern fab uses millions of gallons of ultra-pure water per day to clean silicon wafers. TSMC had to invest (opens in a new tab) in a 15-acre water reclamation plant to recycle and treat water on-site, aiming for “near-zero” liquid discharge. (One industry joke quips that they might as well import Taiwan’s rainwater to Arizona – a jab at how poorly matched the location is to the resource needs.)

On top of that, the highly specialized workforce needed wasn’t readily available in Phoenix. In 2023, TSMC flew in hundreds of veteran engineers from Taiwan to Arizona to train local staff and keep the project on schedule. American labor unions bristled at this, but it laid bare the reality: the U.S. lacked enough skilled semiconductor talent after decades of offshoring. REEx has warned of comparable challenges forthcoming involving REE build-up and operational realities.

Perhaps most damning, even once TSMC’s Arizona “Fab 21” produces advanced chips, those chips cannot stay in the U.S. supply chain. There is no cutting-edge packaging facility domestically to assemble the silicon into finished AI accelerators or smartphone processors. As a result, Tom’s Hardware (opens in a new tab) reports that wafers from Arizona are being shipped 7,000 miles back to Taiwan for packaging before they can go into Apple or NVIDIA products. This ridiculous loop – Made in America, then mailed to Asia for final vital touches – adds cost and time, eroding the very supply chain security that the CHIPS Act was meant to achieve. By one account, the Arizona-made NVIDIA chips will end up “more expensive than those produced in Taiwan” and yield mostly symbolic political wins, rather than real self-reliance. Time for the commonsensical to wake up.

In short, the silicon comeback touted by U.S. politicians under the Biden administration has been undermined by poor planning and no real inherent understanding of industrial policy. We built the fab but forgot the“fab ecosystem.” As an Apple Insider (opens in a new tab) investigation bluntly noted, TSMC replicated much of its Taiwan setup in Arizona, yet “the U.S. still relies heavily on foreign equipment, materials and expertise” to run it. Lithography machines must come from the Netherlands (ASML), critical chemicals and gases from overseas suppliers, and the highly advanced know-how from TSMC’s Taiwanese workforce. This is what passes for industrial policy: throw money at one link in the chain, assume the rest will magically follow. It hasn’t. And that should set off alarm bells far beyond the chip sector. Where is the U.S. media?

Rare Earths: Same Story, Different Element

The rare earth element (REE) supply chain is eerily poised to repeat these mistakes. Rare earths – as the REEx community knows, it is a group of 17 critical metals like neodymium, dysprosium, and praseodymium – are essential for electric vehicle motors, wind turbine generators, missiles, and smartphones, to name just some more notable products. The U.S. has felt the pinch of dependence here for years. China controls about 85–90% of global rare earth refining capacity and over 90% of permanent magnet production, giving Beijing a chokehold power over technologies of the future.

In response to Trump 2.0’s aggressive trade program, Washington has finally started throwing money at the problem: funding new mines, processing facilities, and magnet factories through Department of Defense grants, the Energy Department, and tax incentives in recent legislation. On paper, it looks like a race to build a “mine-to-magnet” supply chain on U.S. soil. Under Trump, the Department of War (formerly defense) has taken it a step further, making actual investments in companies such as MP Materials, owner of the only true operational rare earth mine in the U.S.

But here’s the rub: mines and money alone don’t make a supply chain. The bottleneck is in the chemistry and the extended ecosystem, just as it was with semiconductors. Digging ore out of the ground is relatively easy; turning that ore into high-purity rare earth oxides, metals, and then magnets is the hard part. Today, even a good deal of the ore from Mountain Pass, California – America’s sole rare earth mine – has, until recently, been shipped to China for processing because we lacked any full-scale separation plant domestically. That is slowly starting to change (Mountain Pass began refining some light rare earths on-site, and new facilities are planned), but the U.S. is miles behind.

Rebuilding rare earth refining is a far more complex task than many appreciate. And MP Materials deserves a lot of credit for stepping up to the government’s aggressive edicts. After all, separation of rare earths is an arduous,“dirty” process involving hundreds of stages of solvent extraction (SX). Imagine dozens upon dozens of mixer-settlers, acid baths, and chemical tweaks, separating elements that are chemically near-twins. Minor missteps in acidity or temperature can ruin purity, so deep expertise is required. As REEx often reminds, China spent decades mastering this art, tolerating the toxic waste and environmental damage that came with it. Western nations, by contrast, offloaded this sector to China long ago – one reason it’s so dominant now.

Now consider what it will take for the U.S. to stand up its own REE separation and magnet industry. It’s not just about building one shiny refinery. Where will the specialized organic solvents and acids come from? The SX process relies on reagents like P507 (a phosphoric acid ester) and various kerosene-based diluents – products largely made in Asia. Without foresight, a U.S. plant might find itself importing large volumes of Chinese-made extraction chemicals, ironically depending on China to reduce dependence on China. And then there’s the waste disposal: rare earth processing can generate radioactive and toxic waste. Will local communities accept a waste pond, or have we streamlined permits for disposal? Not really – environmental regulations remain strict (for good reason). Does a comprehensive national plan with state buy-in exist for handling the pollution aside from hoping expensive new tech can mitigate it?

The skill gap looms large, too. Only a handful of non-Chinese engineers today have hands-on experience running commercial-scale rare earth separation, according to our sources. You can’t conjure expert chemists out of thin air or fast-track 30 years of know-how with money alone. Just as Arizona’s chip fab needed Taiwanese talent, a future rare earth facility in, say, Texas or California may quietly need Chinese technical consultants or imported expertise to debug all those solvent extraction circuits. And REEx continues to chronicle how the Chinese government is cordoning off its talent. Even a trip among friends in China today is not the same as a few years ago. The mood is far more apprehensive, tense, and paranoid.

So this would be the ultimate irony – and a real possibility – if we charge ahead without training a new generation of metallurgists and chemical engineers specialized in REEs.

Early signs of trouble are already visible. One flagship project, for example, is MP Materials’ Mountain Pass mine. The company received government grants to build a refining and magnet-making operation. But after two years of effort, magnet output is still nascent, and according to some experts on condition of anonymity, heavy rare earths (like dysprosium) remain unaddressed by domestic capability. To MP Materials’ credit, they inked unprecedented deals this summer with the U.S. government, Apple, as well as Goldman Sachs and JP Morgan for a large credit line. But it will take a lot more than one company to rebuild an entire supply chain.

Another is Lynas Rare Earths’ planned Texas separation plant, supported by the Pentagon. It hopes to process heavy rare earths for the U.S., but Lynas will likely import feedstock from its Australian mine, and it may need to import chemical reagents and equipment from its Malaysian operation (or China) to get started. The firm has quietly started shipping the far more difficult heavy rare earths to Japan, yet we are not even out of the first inning of at least a nine-inning game. The point is that each “solution” is only partial—yes, even the purported “mine-to-magnet” deals. Without coordination, we risk siloed projects that don’t connect into a full supply chain.

Billions on the Table, No One at the Wheel

The core issue is the absence of a coherent U.S. industrial policy – an end-to-end strategy to rebuild an industry, not to mention a whole sector. Washington’s approach so far has been a scattershot of subsidies and executive orders, without knitting together all the pieces. Biden’s CHIPS Act and Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) injected huge sums into manufacturing and clean tech. The CHIPS Act focuses on semiconductors; the IRA includes funds and tax credits for critical minerals and EV supply chains.

Yet these initiatives, while laudable in intent, don’t close the loop.

Take the CHIPS Act: it allocated $52.7 billion for domestic chip manufacturing and R&D. Companies eagerly lined up for grants to build fabs. But the legislation and its implementation largely ignored follow-on stages like packaging and testing. Only belatedly has the Commerce Department started to encourage “ecosystem” investments (e.g., Amkor building a packaging plant (opens in a new tab)) after it became embarrassingly clear that U.S. fabs had nowhere local to send their wafers for the next step. In effect, we funded cutting-edge silicon production but not the ability to fully use that silicon in final products – a partial industrial revival at best.

The Inflation Reduction Act, meanwhile, heavily incentivizes domestic sourcing of battery materials (lithium, nickel, etc.) and critical minerals production through tax credits and grants. It even set aside $500 million under the Defense Production Act for essential mineral projects. Yet, when it comes to rare earth magnets – absolutely vital for EV motors and wind turbines – the IRA dropped the ball. The law ties EV tax credits to battery content and final assembly in North America, but imposes no such requirements on the rare-earth magnets in motors. An automaker could meet the IRA’s criteria and still use Chinese-made magnets in the drivetrain, facing no penalty. In other words, the biggest piece of legislation addressing the energy transition ignored the rare earth supply chain under Biden. That’s a glaring omission if the goal were to lessen dependence on China across the board. While Biden proudly took credit for any wins, the mounting losses, well, not a word.

Then there’s the recent flurry of Trump 2.0 actions. President Trump, during his latest term, initiated a trade war (Liberation Day) that brought critical minerals to the forefront. His administration has invoked emergency measures to encourage domestic mining and even considered using Section 232 tariffs (national security tariffs) on imported critical minerals. President Trump declared a national emergency on critical mineral imports, directing investigations and threatening high tariffs to force a shift.

China’s response was immediate – it temporarily banned exports of certain heavy rare earths and magnets to the U.S., a stark reminder of who holds the cards. Trump’s hardball tactics have indeed sparked a race to build capacity in America (no company wants to be caught dependent if tariffs or embargoes hit). Dozens of rare earth and battery metal projects have been announced or accelerated in the West since the trade war ramped up. And a certain amount of credit must go to President Trump.

But fear, money, and a fresh dose of Trump-era swagger (and yes, troubling early signs of Don-style crony capitalism creeping in) still do not amount to strategy. Without true coordination, we will see the same chaotic pattern repeat: a pilot processor in one state, a magnet plant in another, an extraction demo somewhere else — none of it guaranteed to connect into a functioning, resilient supply chain.

Maybe, this time, likely MP Materials has enough political, economic, and financial gravity to keep Mountain Pass alive through the next crisis. But if China turned off the tap tomorrow (or even next year), would America’s patchwork of early-stage projects keep the country supplied? Not even close.

As Rare Earth Exchanges has emphasized repeatedly, rebuilding an industrial ecosystem is a 5–10 year minimum undertaking — even with unlimited funding. Just permitting a new chemical facility can eat up years. Developing a skilled workforce with real separation and metallurgical expertise takes years. Turning pilot plants into commercially reliable operations takes years. This is a marathon, not a ribbon-cutting ceremony.

Yet Washington keeps behaving as if cutting a check — first under Biden (2022–2024), now under Trump 2.0 (2025+) — magically solves the problem. True Trump 2020 (Operation Warp Speed) did a lot. Many things are possible. Yes money does not magically solve the problem. It doesn’t. Without a comprehensive, end-to-end strategy, America is simply pouring money into isolated islands of activity and calling it a supply chain.

The High Price of Half Measures

The consequences of this fragmented approach — and what many inside Washington quietly suggest is becoming a disturbingly politicized and insider-driven process — are becoming painfully clear.

American taxpayers are subsidizing factories that cost far more to build and operate than their overseas counterparts – and which still leave us dependent. By some estimates, making chips in the U.S. can be 20–50% more expensive (opens in a new tab) than in Asia once you factor in higher labor and construction costs, plus the inefficiencies of a less developed local supply chain.

We’re essentially paying a premium for sovereignty, yet not getting full sovereignty in return. At this rate, we never will. Similarly, producing rare earth magnets outside China will be significantly costlier (due to pricier inputs, environmental safeguards, lack of the scale factor when compared to the state-owned entities, etc.), meaning Western manufacturers might struggle to compete unless permanently propped up by subsidies or tariffs. And what’s the probability of that occurring?

What do we get for these extra costs? If done right, it could result in a more secure, resilient supply base and high-tech jobs. But done halfway, we risk the worst of both worlds: exorbitant spending with minimal security improvement. The semiconductor saga already shows this. Despite the pomp around “Made in America” chips, key portions of the chain are still abroad, so the geopolitical risk (e.g., from a Taiwan conflict) isn’t eliminated – it’s just slightly shifted. We’ve built a very expensive fab in Arizona. However, if a crisis hit, we’d discover that we still need Taiwan and others to actually deliver a finished chip to our military or industry. That is not supply chain independence by any stretch.

The rare earth sector, we predict, will be a repeat.

Imagine 2028: several U.S. rare earth mines are operating, and a couple of separation plants have finally opened with government help. Yet if those plants import Chinese solvents, or if their output still has to be sent to foreign facilities for final purification or alloying, then a Chinese export ban involving not only ore, metals, and magnets but also chemical inputs and processes know-how would still cripple us. We’d have spent billions to domesticate REEs and still end up scrambling in a crisis. It’s a very real scenario if each link (mining, refining, alloying, magnet-making) isn’t connected domestically or with trusted allies.

Another “price” to consider is the opportunity cost of not thinking holistically. The U.S. could spend its finite dollars smartly. A comprehensive industrial policy might identify choke points and fund infrastructure for all critical inputs – e.g., incentivize chemical manufacturers to produce reagents domestically, fund training programs for specialty chemical engineers, streamline permits for facilities that handle waste, and build the end-use factories (like magnet plants and chip packaging plants) in tandem with the upstream.

Instead, we have siloed funding: CHIPS Act for fabs (with packaging as an afterthought), separate DOE grants for critical minerals, DoD contracts for magnets, etc., each marching to their own tune. No single entity is ensuring that when a new rare earth refinery opens, the acids, electricity, water, skilled staff, and offtake customers will all be in place and synchronized.

Without that coordination, the price we pay will be ongoing: higher consumer prices for products, continued vulnerability to supply shocks, and perhaps the failure of some heavily subsidized ventures that find they can’t operate competitively or have to pause for lack of inputs. The lack of industrial policy in America isn’t just an academic issue – it will hit our wallets and our national security. As one sobering example, experts estimate it will take at least five to ten years of focused effort for the West to replicate even a semblance of China’s rare earth supply chain dominance.

During that time, China will not sit idly; it’s already moving to tighten its grip, as seen with recent export restrictions and technology bans threats. The Chinese are relentless in patenting downstream innovative use cases, planning to own the future while we play catch up today—in a half-effort manner. We could find ourselves always several steps behind, reacting to the latest move without a long-term game plan – a costly and dangerous position, that unfortunately is our reality in the USA today.

A Call to Action: From Catch-Up to Coordination

The cautionary parallels between semiconductors and rare earths send a clear message: America needs a real industrial strategy, or our “tech independence” efforts will remain a mirage. One that, unfortunately, we fear politicians and Beltway insider networks monetize along the way. It’s not enough to bankroll one factory or declare victory after one groundbreaking ceremony.

We must think in ecosystems. That means asking hard questions upfront: If we build it here, do we have everything to run it here? If not, how do we develop those missing pieces now, not as an afterthought?

Policymakers should urgently consider a coordinated approach – perhaps an “Industrial Policy Council” that bridges the siloed programs. A Critical Mineralczar to coordinate and direct across the vast sprawling federal government remains key. The CHIPS Act could be coupled with packaging and materials initiatives in a single supply-chain framework. Rare earth projects should be linked from mine to magnet, ensuring that funding and incentives cover each link (mining, refining, alloying, magnet manufacturing, recycling) and the connections between them—importantly, across companies both in USA and abroad in allied nations.

Environmental permitting for critical facilities might need streamlining so that plants can actually get built in time. Alliances with trusted countries (like Australia, Japan, and EU nations) should be leveraged not only for raw materials but also for technical knowledge exchange – e.g., bringing over rare-earth experts or partnering on reagent production, so we’re not secretly beholden to Chinese inputs.

Conclusion

The alternative is to continue stumbling forward with half-measures. The U.S. chip fiasco in Arizona is a $40 billion lesson in the importance of foresight. Let’s not learn the same lesson again five years from now when a much-hyped rare earth supply chain still can’t stand on its own. America pioneered the semiconductor and built the first rare earth magnets decades ago; we have the ingenuity. What’s lacking is the political will and long-range vision to orchestrate a full revival of these industries.

In a world where supply chains equal power, partial independence is no independence at all. It’s time to shed the complacency, the short-term politics, and the creeping insider favoritism now coloring key decisions — and finally plan our industrial resurgence down to the last bolt and last drop of acid. Otherwise, we’ll keep paying top dollar only to discover that, when it really counts, the supply chain’s weakest links were never fixed – and they lie somewhere over the Pacific.",https://rareearthexchanges.com/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?action=rank_math_overlay_thumb&id=8196&type=rare-earth-exchanges&hash=17ba0f41ccc23391c2824cd370af5649,N,,2025-11-26 07:59:17.990547

The Connecticut Green Bank developed 27% of school solar installations in the state from 2015 to 2023, according to the report.
The evolution of Connecticut’s Solar MAP+ program Solar MAP+ evolved largely as a response to gaps in the state’s broader solar market, said Mackey Dykes, the Connecticut Green Bank’s executive vice president of financing programs.
The Connecticut Green Bank also started looking at municipalities that were lagging in using solar incentives, particularly smaller towns, he said.
Some of those supporters came from Branford, Connecticut, which contracted with the Connecticut Green Bank to build solar arrays on two elementary schools.","Over the past decade or so, the Connecticut Green Bank, the first green bank in the United States, has taken on an unusual role — that of a ​“public developer” of solar projects for schools, cities, and low-income housing across the state.

“There are all sorts of public institutions that take in public money and give a loan, a grant, and that’s all they do,” said Jason Kowalski, executive director of the Public Renewables Project. ​“This is completely different in what it can achieve.”

The Connecticut Green Bank’s Solar Marketplace Assistance Program Plus (Solar MAP+) actively engages in originating, developing, and even owning projects, he said. To date, the program has deployed $145 million in capital on nearly 54 megawatts’ worth of solar projects that are expected to help save a collective $57 million in energy costs, according to bank data shared with Canary Media.

Though the approach is unusual for a public entity, it needn’t be, Kowalski said. In fact, it is a model that cash-strapped state governments should consider closely as federal clean-energy tax credits disappear and energy costs rise. That’s particularly true for the 16 states, plus the District of Columbia, that have created a government-backed or nonprofit green bank since Connecticut first launched its version in 2011.

The bank’s program targets sectors that private lenders and solar developers might shy away from because of perceived credit risks or low returns on investment, Kowalski explained. It taps into low-cost financing available to state entities and builds portfolios of projects to achieve economies of scale.

Then the revenues generated from those projects are ​“recycled”: used to expand the pool of capital from which it can make loans for other projects that help achieve Connecticut’s clean energy and environmental justice goals.

While some private-sector solar industry players may see the Solar MAP+ approach as infringing on their turf, state-backed agencies ​“see it as expanding the role of the private-sector installation business,” Kowalski said.

That’s certainly the case for the school solar projects that Solar MAP+ has built, said Tish Tablan, senior program director at Generation180, a clean energy advocacy group.

A September report by Tablan’s and Kowalski’s groups and the Climate Reality Project found that Connecticut — the third-smallest state by land mass and 29th in population — ranks fifth in the country for total solar capacity installed on K–12 schools and second (behind Hawaii) in the percentage of K–12 schools with solar.

The Connecticut Green Bank developed 27% of school solar installations in the state from 2015 to 2023, according to the report. Those installations are projected to save schools tens of millions of dollars in energy costs, and more than half are in low-income and disadvantaged communities.

The same model can help schools and public buildings do more than solar, Tablan added. ​“We can look at electrification, we can look at heat pumps, we can look at solar-plus-storage, we can look at microgrids.”

This kind of financial support is increasingly important as the Trump administration cancels federal funding for clean energy projects more broadly, and in disadvantaged communities in particular, Tablan and Kowalski said. That includes the administration’s move to claw back $20 billion in federal ​“green bank” funds meant to promote precisely this kind of public-sector finance, which is now being challenged in court.

The evolution of Connecticut’s Solar MAP+ program

Solar MAP+ evolved largely as a response to gaps in the state’s broader solar market, said Mackey Dykes, the Connecticut Green Bank’s executive vice president of financing programs.

The same 2011 law that launched the bank also created state solar incentives meant to boost development across multiple sectors of the economy, Dykes said. ​“But there were some areas where we didn’t see a lot of activity. We sat down and started to figure out why that was.”

The first targets were state agencies that were lagging in solar development, despite their access to relatively low-cost capital, he said. This indicated that incentives alone weren’t the solution. It turned out that those agencies ​“needed help with documentation structures, with procurement, with project labor agreements,” he said. ​“We put that together, and projects started happening.”

“Then we realized we built this Swiss Army knife of tools that we could bring to bear in other sectors where there were gaps in solar deployment,” Dykes said. The Connecticut Green Bank also started looking at municipalities that were lagging in using solar incentives, particularly smaller towns, he said. At around the same time, he noted, ​“we realized the solar incentive program in the state was undersubscribed for school projects,” and they set out to fix that.

Bundling multiple school projects can help lower costs. Dykes cited the example of a 67-kilowatt system at an intermediate school in Portland, Connecticut. ​“You’d have trouble attracting attention for a project that small,” he said. ​“When you combine it with dozens of projects, and have developers competing with a pool of projects, the projects become more feasible,” with the Connecticut Green Bank serving as a clearinghouse for hiring installers and securing financing at a larger scale.

Tablan highlighted the similarities with Generation180’s work with schools. ​“If you ask any public-sector entity, they’re going to say budget and cost are the first concerns,” she said. Most of the country’s school solar projects have been developed via third-party ownership models, and ​“Connecticut Green Bank has taken that approach” as well, she said.

Can the public developer model expand?

The wraparound services that Solar MAP+ offers bring more than money to the equation, said Advait Arun, senior associate for capital markets at the Center for Public Enterprise. The nonprofit think tank uses the term ​“public development” to characterize the way public entities can expand beyond financing to include ​“all of the steps in a project development pipeline,” including ownership, operations, and maintenance.

That’s not a normal role for green banks, Arun said. As of the end of 2023, green banks and partners had driven a cumulative $25.4 billion in public and private investments, according to the Coalition for Green Capital, a group that includes green banks and environmental advocacy organizations. Most of that funding has focused on de-risking harder-to-finance sectors, such as energy efficiency and rooftop solar installations in low-income neighborhoods, without taking the plunge into the full range of project development activities that Solar MAP+ is involved in.

But even under this model, there are gaps that private sector financiers don’t want to fill. That’s where public-sector ownership can help, as the data on school solar’s growth in Connecticut indicates, Arun noted.

“We’re not used to this kind of thing in this country,” he said. But ​“without the Connecticut Green Bank de-risking schools for this kind of solar investment, the market would have remained smaller than it could be.”

That direct involvement has helped smaller school districts build more ambitious project pipelines over time, said Emily Basham, director of financing programs for Solar MAP+.

In Manchester, Connecticut, once the private developers caught wind of state involvement, city leaders ​“were somewhat bombarded with proposals,” Basham said. ​“They wanted to do their first projects with us, to cut their teeth on it.”

The more than $100,000 in projected annual energy savings from the solar systems at seven municipal buildings, including six schools, helped the city gain confidence in moving forward with a subsequent project that has converted one of its elementary schools into the state’s first net-zero school by adding advanced insulation systems and on-site geothermal energy, she said.

The Connecticut Green Bank’s dive into parts of the project development process has drawn fire from solar industry groups in the state.

In 2024, solar developers pushed lawmakers to restrict the bank from developing projects at schools and municipal sites, citing concerns around a lack of competitive bidding. That effort was defeated after representatives of state and local government as well as labor and clean-energy advocates at the Connecticut Roundtable on Climate and Jobs weighed in to support the bank.

Some of those supporters came from Branford, Connecticut, which contracted with the Connecticut Green Bank to build solar arrays on two elementary schools.

“We’re a municipality with limited staff and dedicated volunteers, but you can’t ask volunteers to procure and oversee a project of that size,” said Jamie Cosgrove, who recently ended a 12-year stint as Branford’s first selectman — the equivalent of the town’s mayor — to join the Connecticut Green Bank’s board of directors. ​“We use them as a trusted source, and we feel comfortable engaging with them to move forward on a number of these projects.”

The two elementary schools’ solar installations are expected to save about $248,000 over the next 20 years, Cosgrove noted — not a huge payback for a private-sector developer. ​“Maybe these projects aren’t significantly cash-flow positive. But there are other priorities we have as a municipality. We’re looking to advance our clean energy goals.”

Branford has also done plenty of work with the private sector, including a 4.3-megawatt solar array on a former gravel yard and solar projects at the town’s high school and fire station, said Jim Finch, Branford’s finance director. ​“It’s not an either-or thing,” he said.

“I don’t think it’s unreasonable for a state entity that’s identified reducing carbon emissions as a public purpose to do this kind of work,” Finch added. ​“We have organizations to deal with clean air, financing sewer projects, et cetera — we can have public purpose entities do that.”

New York could be a first target, said Kowalski of the Public Renewables Project. The New York Power Authority, the public agency that owns and develops transmission and generation in the state, has been tasked with building gigawatts of large-scale renewables. Backers of more muscular government intervention to rejuvenate the state’s faltering progress on clean energy are calling for the NYPA to follow Connecticut’s lead in building solar on school rooftops.

“Our whole report is an answer to how to respond to the tax credits getting rolled back. If there’s a shortfall, we think we have an answer,” Kowalski said. ​“Public developer models can be part of an affordability agenda on climate.”",https://img.canarymedia.com/content/uploads/Connecticut-Green-Bank-SolarMAP-Portland-Elementary-School-rooftop-solar-aerial-shot.jpg?auto=compress%2Cformat&crop=focalpoint&fit=crop&fp-x=0.5&fp-y=0.5&h=630&q=82&w=1200&s=a9ef21ef868247701f571d859b4ce9e6,N,,2025-11-26 09:59:01.937156

Generation, a sustainable investment management firm, has published its 2025 Sustainability Trends Report examining the year's key developments in climate technology and policy.

The analysis highlights a divergence between political direction in some major economies and the continued expansion of renewable energy infrastructure and electric vehicle production.

Trade implications of policy shifts

The report documents changes in US federal climate policy under the Trump administration, including withdrawal from the Paris Agreement and steps to limit regulatory authority over greenhouse gas emissions.

According to Generation, these policy reversals have been linked to cancellations of nearly US$30bn in planned clean-industry investment in the US, with modelling suggesting potential investment losses could reach US$500bn over a decade.

This change appears to be creating opportunities for other manufacturing centres. China's industrial policy has positioned the country as a major exporter of renewable energy technology and electric vehicles, with the report noting that EVs already represent close to 60% of new car sales in China, compared to about 10% in the US in 2024.

The report describes China as a future ""electrostate"", with emissions potentially peaking well before the country's official 2030 target.

Supply chain developments in energy infrastructure

Global electricity generation from solar rose 28.3% last year, according to the report's analysis.

China added more solar capacity to its grid in a single month than any other country has built in an entire year, indicating the scale of manufacturing and installation supply chains now operational in that market.

Battery deployment is also affecting grid operations in some regions. In California, batteries meet about 20% of peak evening demand on some days, rising to about 30% in parts of Australia, displacing gas-fired generation during certain hours.

However, demand growth is complicating the picture.

EVs, heat pumps, data centres and air conditioning systems are pushing power demand growth towards 4% annually, almost double the long-term average. This has allowed fossil-fuel generation to rise, with coal's absolute usage remaining close to record highs, sustained by consumption in China and India even as these countries deploy new renewable capacity.

Transport sector and manufacturing competition

The International Energy Agency data cited in the report suggests electric cars are expected to account for 25% of global auto sales this year. Vehicles with plugs already constitute over half of new sales in China and about a quarter across Europe, indicating different rates of market penetration across major economies.

The US market shows a different pattern, with EVs making up only about 10% of sales in 2024. A modest increase is expected in 2025 as buyers move to access expiring subsidies before federal support programmes are potentially altered.

Tesla's market position has changed this year, particularly in Europe where the company has experienced double-digit sales declines in several markets. Chinese brands now offer models at lower price points, creating new competitive dynamics.

Electric lorry sales are rising from a small base, though infrastructure for high-power charging necessary for heavy goods vehicles remains at an early stage in most countries. Aviation and shipping remain further from decarbonisation targets, despite Europe's mandates for sustainable aviation fuel, which face financing challenges.

Negotiations for sustainable shipping legislation at the International Maritime Organization were adjourned this autumn, with the report noting that lobbyists from the US and Saudi Arabia played a role in the outcome.

Industrial supply chains and hydrogen projects

The report's analysis of hydrogen projects suggests a significant reassessment is underway.

A substantial portion of European projects have been cancelled and many more shelved as the cost gap with grey hydrogen remains wide.

The authors note that ""enthusiasm for hydrogen may have cost us years in which industrial decarbonisation could have been pursued by more practical means"", observing that early promotion came partly from oil majors.

Benchmark data indicates clean energy is attracting about twice as much investment globally as fossil fuels, with solar costs declining year-on-year since 2009, while gas-fired power costs have remained relatively stable.

They urge states to entice data centers to supply their own power in exchange for priority in permitting and siting—the main bottlenecks for these projects.
When their power is cut, data centers usually fire up diesel backup generators that pollute the air in nearby neighborhoods.
In all these proposals, powering data centers would need rapid development of energy generators, most likely natural gas plants, according to energy experts.
The PJM board is expected to spell out the details of its own solution in December.","After months of wrangling over how to handle surging power demand from AI-driven data centers and the resulting spike in electricity prices for millions, members of PJM Interconnection, the nation’s largest grid operator, could not agree on a solution.

Their disagreement played out last week in an “advisory vote,” part of the final phase of PJM’s expedited rulemaking track known as the Critical Issue Fast Path, or CIFP.

CIFP is aimed at figuring out how PJM can reliably serve the region as data center demand climbs toward a staggering 30 gigawatts by 2030—roughly the power use of 20 million homes. Early stages of that growth have already driven double-digit percentage increases in electricity prices across states, notably in New Jersey, where the state saw a 20 percent bill increase in the summer that became a hot-button issue in its recent gubernatorial race.

The Garden State saw that frustration show up in polling, with a recent statewide survey finding large majorities of voters in both parties saying data centers should shoulder more of the grid costs instead of ordinary households.

Meanwhile, energy projects that could add the needed gigawatts of energy onto the grid wait for years in the PJM interconnection queue.

During the meeting, PJM members—hundreds of representatives, most from the energy industry—reviewed a final slate of a dozen proposals and cast advisory votes on each of them. The options ranged from requiring or nudging data centers to bring their own generation, to creating a new fast track for connecting energy projects to the grid, to temporarily halting new data-center hookups altogether until PJM can reliably serve them.

Any plan that won at least two-thirds approval was deemed endorsed, a non-binding label the PJM Board can point to in making the final decision on a package of rule changes it will file with the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC).

“PJM’s board are directors of a private company at the end of the day, and they make the decisions by themselves. So an advisory vote is just what it says: It’s providing advice to the board,” said Tom Rutigliano, a senior advocate at the Natural Resources Defense Council (NRDC).

None of the proposals reached the two-thirds threshold.

Rutigliano said the vote “reflected a very divided industry” in a region considered a center of data center development. It also handed PJM’s 10-member board of managers virtually a blank slate to craft a policy of their own or pick among the proposals. PJM Interconnection operates a competitive market for wholesale electricity in all or parts of Delaware, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, North Carolina, Ohio, Pennsylvania, Tennessee, Virginia, West Virginia and the District of Columbia.

“The options open to them (the Board) are they can pick one of these or they could cobble together some sort of Frankenstein version and pick and choose different parts of the proposals. Or come up with their own,” said Nick Guidi, a senior attorney at the Virginia-based Southern Environmental Law Center (SELC), a nonprofit, nonpartisan environmental legal advocacy group.

Mark C. Christie, a recent chairman at FERC, characterized PJM members as representative mostly of the interests of an energy industry that gets to “decide which rules they want to live under” rather than average bill-paying consumers.

“[I]t is really just an insiders’ game and always has been. Consumers, especially residential, have no serious representation or influence in this ‘inclusive’ process,” Christie wrote on LinkedIn.

Tougher proposals could cap the revenue of many energy companies and could push more risk onto them instead of ratepayers.

Independent energy market monitor Joseph Bowring has put forward a notably strict but straightforward idea: Data centers shouldn’t be allowed to build until PJM can guarantee reliable power for them.

“I’m quite sure the data centers do not want to be added quickly and unreliably,” said Bowring, the president of Monitoring Analytics, an independent monitoring unit that reports on PJM’s electric power market.

Another notable proposal came from a coalition of governors from Pennsylvania, Maryland, New Jersey and Virginia, joined by the Data Center Coalition (DCC), whose members include tech giants such as Google, Microsoft and Amazon. They urge states to entice data centers to supply their own power in exchange for priority in permitting and siting—the main bottlenecks for these projects.

A recent proposal from bipartisan lawmakers across the PJM region nodded to the DCC governors proposal but included a policy that in times when power would be spread thin, like during a heatwave or a hurricane, data centers would have to forego power unless they brought their own generators into the system to increase reliability for everyone. When their power is cut, data centers usually fire up diesel backup generators that pollute the air in nearby neighborhoods.

In all these proposals, powering data centers would need rapid development of energy generators, most likely natural gas plants, according to energy experts. But Julia Kortrey, a deputy director of state policy at Evergreen Action, a climate advocacy group, urged PJM members to look at Texas as a model for swift deployment of renewables.

“We should be getting as much energy as we possibly can right now, and that would still include renewables,” said Kortrey.

The PJM board is expected to spell out the details of its own solution in December. It seeks to sign off a package of rule changes to file with FERC before the end of the year. FERC will then decide whether the proposal is just, reasonable and not unduly discriminatory under federal law.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2247205213-1024x683.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 11:07:02.754026

New England winters can get wicked cold. This week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead by burning fossil fuels.

“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”

The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.

The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.

New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.

At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.

“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.

The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.

The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.

The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.

These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.

“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”

Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.

Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.

The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5 million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.

The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.

The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.

The third major area of the accelerator is a resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.

Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.

“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”",https://franklinobserver.town.news/sites/default/files/styles/extra_large/public/9677/2025-11/heat_pump_2_wikipedia.jpg?itok=kFlbuJw0,N,,2025-11-26 05:57:49.021089

Beyond the ongoing revenue that will help build Hobart into its true potential, this project will create thousands of construction jobs for our local skilled tradespeople while producing close to a thousand long-term jobs. This economic boost will help make our community viable today and into the future.”

Amazon said in Monday's announcement that the investment will add 1,100 new jobs and 2.4 gigawatts of data center capacity.

WSBT 22 spoke with South Bend Regional Chamber President Jeff Rea about why there are so many data centers being built in the Northern Region.

""One, there's just tremendous need. So we don't do anything in our lives almost that we don't need a data center. So if we're doing online banking, if we're streaming NFL football on Thursday night, we're using services that are stored in a data center. So there's just intense need for data centers right now. So all the major providers are building those,"" said Rea.

Rea says to expect this AWS facility to look messy in the construction process but not bother neighbors long-term.

At the end of the day, when they're done, these are pretty quiet. They don't have a lot of employees at them. There's not big trucks delivering to them every day. We think they're going to be great neighbors. And Amazon in particular has demonstrated that from the beginning that they are good neighbors. And so we're excited about that. And I think Northwest Indiana should be excited about this,"" said Rea.

WSBT 22 did speak with Northwest Indiana Forum President Heather Ennis about the project.

She said there is no current timeline for the project, but she said there could be more opportunity for data centers in Northern Indiana.",https://wsbt.com/resources/media2/16x9/1920/1320/center/90/8c503bce-5d2c-4cbf-b41f-2378bbaed844-PAmazonBreakout.transfer_frame_636.jpeg,N,,2025-11-26 06:59:03.941131

Impacts on Basic Science The DOE reorganization introduces major shifts with significant implications for the agency’s basic science mission, particularly in fusion and quantum research.
This large-scale agency reorganization threatens DOE’s ability to sustain scientific leadership, advance clean energy deployment, and address the nation’s energy affordability crisis.","Last week, the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) unveiled a sweeping reorganization aimed at “strengthening efficiency and unleashing American energy dominance.” While these ambitions sound bold — accelerating technology, expanding energy production, and cutting bureaucracy — the structural changes inspire more questions than confidence. The new alignment signals a clear shift in priorities: offices dedicated to clean energy and energy efficiency have been renamed, consolidated, or eliminated, while new divisions elevate hydrocarbons, fusion, and a combined Office of AI & Quantum. In total, eight offices with mission-critical responsibilities have been dismantled as part of the restructuring, implementing much of the restructuring proposal outlined in Project 2025 and fundamentally reshaping the agency’s role in advancing clean energy and innovation.

This realignment comes on the heels of nearly a year of capacity cuts that have already strained the agency. Several thousand members of the DOE workforce have departed amid this administration’s DOGE-driven efforts, leaving critical functions understaffed, institutional knowledge depleted, and staff morale undermined. The erosion of large-scale demonstration and deployment capacity, and the structures that supported it, raises serious concerns about DOE’s ability to drive energy innovation at scale and implement real-world infrastructure upgrades. At the same time, sectors that rely on DOE’s support are witnessing a general loss of capacity at the agency, eroding trust in government and its ability to deliver on its stated mission.

The financial and operational costs of restructuring a large federal agency can be staggering. Lost productivity alone often runs into the millions, as staff and leadership divert time and focus from mission-critical work toward the reorganization. In this context, DOE’s restructuring risks weakening — rather than strengthening — the American innovation engine responsible for advancing both basic science and demonstration and deployment at scale. Gutting DOE’s deployment, infrastructure, and clean energy programs also undermines the agency’s ability to carry out the critical functions needed to address today’s most pressing energy challenges, as electricity demand continues to outpace supply and utility bills rise rapidly.

Looking ahead, this reorganization poses important long-term questions: how would one rebuild the structures necessary for large-scale demonstration and deployment? How can DOE rapidly respond to growing domestic energy challenges amid reduced capacity? And how can the agency restore staff morale, retain institutional knowledge, and rebuild trust with the sectors that rely on its leadership? Far from delivering efficiency or strength, this reorganization risks institutionalizing the losses and instability at DOE that have already been set in motion.

Exacerbating Staff Losses and Project Cancellations

The reorganization has been marked by limited communication with DOE staff, leaving many employees uncertain about how their roles and teams will be affected. Concerns about potential reductions in force have heightened anxiety among DOE staff, and a poor transition to the new organizational structure could drive additional staff to depart of their own accord. Either or both would compound the effects of previous layoffs, the Deferred Resignation Program, and other aggressive staffing actions already undertaken by the administration on DOE’s workforce capacity.

While some turnover in staff is to be expected at the start of a new administration, this administration has pursued an unprecedented and aggressive series of actions to reduce the federal workforce. Early on, DOE leadership laid off probationary employees en masse—sources range between 555 to up to 2,000—and placed 25 staffers from the Office of Energy Justice and Equity on leave.

The biggest impact on career staff has been the Deferred Resignation Program (DRP), which incentivized employees to voluntarily resign with pay and benefits through the end of FY25, or risk losing their jobs in future reductions in force. DOE staff data obtained by FAS show that 3,051 federal employees took the DOGE-sponsored DRP offer. (FAS will soon release a report with more analysis of this data.) Given this significant attrition, it is imperative that DOE leaders determine how to best transition staff into their new roles, to maintain as much certainty as possible as the agency navigates ongoing capacity challenges within a new structure.

Lost capacity will also impact DOE’s awards. Nearly 350 projects across multiple DOE offices have received cancellation notices, issued either in May or October. Awardees — many tied to offices now eliminated under the reorganization — have reported slow or nonexistent communication from DOE even before the restructuring took effect. As DOE’s political leadership moves forward with mass termination actions, recipients are left attempting to navigate informal dispute processes or pursue mutually acceptable resolutions with limited guidance or transparency. Reversing independently vetted, merit-based technical awards at this scale is highly unusual and has already brought about significant dysfunction, raising serious concerns as the reorganization proceeds.

The broader instability created by this upheaval will likely make it harder for the hundreds of businesses and state and local governments that are seeking to contest their grant terminations, as well as the thousands of other organizations that administer DOE-funded projects in service of the American people.

Clean Energy Innovation & Deployment Impacts

The reorganization also dramatically reshapes offices responsible for clean energy innovation and deployment. At a time when electricity prices are rising, demand growth is outpacing new supply, and grid infrastructure is aging, stepping away from applied innovation and deployment programs is a costly mistake that threatens affordability and reliability.

Most notably, the reorganization creates a new Office of Critical Minerals & Energy Innovation, with significant breadth and responsibility and a direct line of report to the Secretary. The Office of Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE), which among other things manages DOE’s work to make it easier to build new renewable energy projects and improve U.S. industry, will now mostly be consolidated under this office. The new office’s name signals a potential deprioritization of energy innovation behind critical minerals priorities. It also raises questions: how will renewable energy, manufacturing, industrial, and built environment programs — all essential to energy affordability — be integrated and staffed? How will existing programs under EERE and other offices be reorganized within this sprawling new structure? Will applied innovation and deployment functions, like supporting states with improved siting and permitting of new power plants, continue to exist?

For critical minerals, consolidating work previously scattered across FE, EERE, and MESC may improve program coordination and definitely elevates this important issue. The office reports directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, reflecting a top-down, highly centralized approach to managing critical minerals programs. However, there is no dedicated funding line for critical minerals, raising questions about how funding will be pieced together for this office and long-term program sustainability.

This new restructure also eliminates the offices of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED), Grid Deployment (GDO), Manufacturing and Energy Supply Chains, the Federal Energy Management Program (FEMP), Fossil Energy (FE), and State and Community Energy Programs (SCEP). While elements of these offices and their programs may wind up in the large new Office of Critical Minerals and Energy Innovation, shuttering these offices emphasizes a de-prioritization of their functions and missions by DOE leadership.

Additionally, to meet our urgent energy infrastructure challenges and ensure that innovations translate into real world impact, the US needs to be building large-scale demonstrations of the newest energy technologies domestically. The Office of Clean Energy Demonstrations (OCED) did just that. It supported first-of-a-kind or next-generation projects to de-risk technologies to enable quicker commercialization. This new organizational structure nearly fully guts any remaining demonstration and deployment apparatuses at DOE.

For critical minerals, consolidating work previously scattered across FE, EERE, and MESC may improve efficiency and elevate this important issue. The office reports directly to the Secretary and Deputy Secretary, reflecting a top-down, highly centralized approach to managing critical minerals programs. However, several details remain unclear: there is no dedicated funding line for critical minerals, raising questions about long-term program sustainability.

On another technology front, consolidation of geothermal and fossil programs could be a good outcome for geothermal innovation. The reorg creates a new Hydrocarbons and Geothermal Office, which merges the Geothermal Technologies Office (GTO) with the Fossil Energy Office (FE). Previously, both GTO and FE were housed under the Office of the Under Secretary for Science and Innovation (S4); the new combined office will now report to the Office of the new Under Secretary for Energy (S3). One way to conceptualize this merger is as an “Office of Underground Resources,” which could be a logical alignment given the technical and operational overlap between geothermal and fossil energy programs. The restructuring may also provide an opportunity for geothermal to access additional funding streams that were previously less available.

Impacts on Basic Science

The DOE reorganization introduces major shifts with significant implications for the agency’s basic science mission, particularly in fusion and quantum research.

One notable change is the creation of a dedicated Fusion office under S4, a move long advocated by industry. Pulling fusion out of the Office of Science (SC) may make sense at this stage: the field is transitioning into applied programs that require outcome-oriented management. Still, critical basic research needs remain — particularly around plasma-facing components like the blanket — which demand the scientific rigor and oversight traditionally provided by a science-focused office. Separating fusion from the broader SC could help reconcile the tension between applied and basic work, but execution will be key, particularly in light of DOE’s ongoing workforce reductions. Industry perspectives have been overwhelmingly positive, and former Fusion Energy Science staff reportedly also view the change favorably. Under the Office of Science, fusion increasingly had to compete with more fundamental research projects that push the boundaries of human knowledge, as opposed to energy technology.

By contrast, the creation of a combined Office of AI & Quantum raises deep concerns about both scientific coherence and organizational capacity. Quantum information science (QIS) is still largely in a foundational research phase, relying on robust support from the Advanced Scientific Computing Research (ASCR), Basic Energy Sciences (BES), High Energy Physics (HEP), and other programs in the Office of Science to build knowledge to eventually transfer technology into industry. If quantum information science and technology programs are pulled out of the Office of Science, it could risk destabilizing established programs that benefit from their close interaction with fundamental research activities while prematurely advancing commercial quantum solutions.

Grouping quantum with AI — a technology already widely deployed and primarily application-driven — conflates fundamentally different stages of development, obscuring programmatic priorities and scientific needs. These structural choices are particularly risky given DOE’s (and particularly the Office of Science’s) massively depleted workforce, not to mention the enormous costs and operational challenges associated with large-scale federal reorganizations. Lost productivity and gaps in institutional knowledge could delay critical research, compromise collaboration across DOE-operated laboratories, and weaken the nation’s basic science enterprise at a moment when long-term investment in emerging technologies is most urgent.

Additional structural alignment concerns extend to offices like the Office of Technology Commercialization (OTC, formerly OTT), which spans both applied and basic domains but is more appropriately aligned with applied energy offices rather than SC. Conversely, the creation of OSTR is an interesting development: previously, functions such as liftoff reports and AI/data center analyses were handled in-house by specific program offices, and centralizing these functions could improve coordination if implemented effectively, but they could also limit the expertise and detail that made these reports valuable in the past. Similar challenges exist as a result of the Department’s reorganization of its scientific advisory committees into a single entity earlier this year.

Questions Remain

The DOE reorganization leaves several critical questions unanswered, raising concerns about the agency’s ability to deliver on its stated mission:

Budgeting and appropriations: How does this new structure align with existing appropriations accounts, and will it make budgeting even more complicated for Congress, DOE leadership, and program offices?

Workforce capacity: With DOE’s workforce already reduced by nearly a third over the past year, can the agency realistically execute such sweeping changes without undermining mission-critical programs, basic research, and demonstration and deployment efforts?

Mission alignment: How does the reorganization of energy innovation and deployment offices advance the administration’s goal of “delivering affordable, reliable, and secure energy for the American people” – or does it risk leaving a critical gap in execution? Also, what are the actual missions of these new offices and where have programs under previous offices been moved?

Product value: Does the consolidation of responsibilities into coordinating functions improve efficiency, or does it water down the products produced and released by the Department? The volume of earlier products produced by the Department may have been difficult to track, but the domain-sensitive expertise built into recommendations generally represented a gold standard of policy analysis and mission-orientation.

These remaining questions highlight the tension between ambitious structural change and the practical limits of an understaffed, under-resourced agency. This large-scale agency reorganization threatens DOE’s ability to sustain scientific leadership, advance clean energy deployment, and address the nation’s energy affordability crisis.",https://fas.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/1124-doe-reorg-2.png,N,,2025-11-26 04:59:12.769649

(NYSE: TRGP) stands as a cornerstone of North America's energy infrastructure, a vital midstream service provider enabling the efficient flow of natural gas and natural gas liquids (NGLs) from production basins to markets. As a Fortune 500 and S&P 500 component, Targa's expansive network of gathering, processing, transportation, storage, and fractionation assets underpins a significant portion of the continent's energy supply chain. Its strategic positioning across key U.S. production regions and connection to major NGL hubs ensures reliable delivery, playing a crucial role in meeting both domestic and international energy demands.

The company's robust infrastructure is not merely a collection of pipes and plants; it's a dynamic system constantly evolving to meet the burgeoning requirements of a global energy market. Targa's continuous investment in expanding its capabilities, particularly within the prolific Permian Basin and along the crucial Gulf Coast, highlights its commitment to facilitating the transition and growth of cleaner energy sources, securing its position as a key enabler of the broader energy economy.

Targa's Expansive Operations: A Wellhead-to-Water Network

Targa Resources' operational prowess is primarily segmented into its Gathering and Processing activities for natural gas and its Logistics and Transportation services for NGLs and related products. These integrated segments form a comprehensive ""wellhead-to-water"" strategy, ensuring seamless movement and value creation across the energy value chain.

In the Gathering and Processing segment, Targa operates an extensive web of approximately 31,200 miles of natural gas pipelines that collect raw gas directly from production wells. This raw gas then funnels into Targa's 53 natural gas processing plants, where impurities are removed, and valuable NGLs are separated from the dry natural gas stream. Notably, the Permian Midland system alone boasts about 7,600 miles of gathering pipelines and 20 processing plants with a substantial aggregate capacity of 4,119 million cubic feet per day (MMcf/d). Similarly, the Permian Delaware system is equipped with approximately 7,400 miles of gathering pipelines and 18 processing plants, collectively processing 3,560 MMcf/d. Beyond the Permian, Targa maintains significant operations in other critical basins, including the Eagle Ford Shale, Barnett Shale, Anadarko, Ardmore, Arkoma, and Williston Basins. Looking ahead, Targa is aggressively expanding its natural gas processing capabilities with five new plants under construction in the Permian Basin, adding a combined inlet capacity of 1.4 billion cubic feet per day (Bcf/d). The Yeti gas processing plant in the Permian Delaware basin, with a capacity of 275 MMcf/d, is anticipated to come online in the third quarter of 2027, further solidifying Targa's footprint in this vital region.

The Logistics and Transportation segment is central to handling the post-processing movement and fractionation of NGLs. A flagship asset in this segment is the Grand Prix NGL Pipeline, a critical artery connecting Targa's Permian, North Texas, and Southern Oklahoma gathering and processing operations to its expansive Mont Belvieu, Texas fractionation and storage complex. This pipeline boasts a robust transportation capacity of up to 1,000 thousand barrels per day (MBbl/d) of NGLs. To accommodate the surging NGL production from the Permian, Targa is currently constructing the Speedway NGL Pipeline, a 500-mile, 30-inch diameter pipeline. Expected to be in service in the third quarter of 2027, the Speedway pipeline will initially transport 500 MBbl/d of NGLs, with potential expansion to 1 million barrels per day (MMBbl/d), significantly enhancing Targa's NGL takeaway capacity to Mont Belvieu.

Upon arrival at centralized facilities, particularly at the Mont Belvieu complex, mixed NGLs undergo fractionation, a process that separates them into individual, marketable products such as ethane, propane, normal butane, iso-butane, and natural gasoline. Targa operates a net aggregate fractionation capacity of 1.2 MMBbl/d, with an additional 0.3 MMBbl/d currently under construction. The Mont Belvieu facility is a global hub, housing nine wholly-owned fractionation trains with a massive aggregate capacity of 963.0 MBbl/d, alongside an 80% equity interest in another 120 MBbl/d train.

Crucially, Targa's Storage and Terminaling capabilities provide essential flexibility and market access. The company owns 35 underground storage wells, boasting a gross NGL storage capacity of approximately 81 MMBbl, predominantly at its Mont Belvieu and Galena Park facilities. These storage assets are vital for balancing supply and demand fluctuations. Furthermore, Targa's Gulf Coast infrastructure includes world-class LPG (liquefied petroleum gas) export facilities at its Galena Park Marine Terminal on the Houston Ship Channel, seamlessly integrated with its Mont Belvieu assets, facilitating international market reach for U.S. produced NGLs. As of the current date, November 25, 2025, the Yeti gas processing plant and the Speedway NGL Pipeline are significant future projects, both expected to commence operations in the third quarter of 2027, underscoring Targa's proactive long-term investment strategy.

Market Dynamics: Winners, Losers, and Strategic Collaborations

Targa Resources' dominant position and aggressive expansion initiatives in the natural gas and NGL midstream sector inevitably create ripple effects across the industry, influencing both competitors and partners. The company's robust operational capabilities, particularly its leading presence in the Permian Basin and at the Mont Belvieu NGL hub, position it as a formidable force.

Among Targa's key competitors are industry giants such as Enterprise Products Partners L.P. (NYSE: EPD), Kinder Morgan, Inc. (NYSE: KMI), The Williams Companies, Inc. (NYSE: WMB), ONEOK, Inc. (NYSE: OKE), and Energy Transfer (NYSE: ET). Targa's substantial new processing and transportation capacity, especially in the Permian, means it can capture a larger share of the growing natural gas and NGL production. This intensifies competition for securing volumes from producers, potentially impacting the throughput and revenue streams of rival midstream operators. Furthermore, Targa's integrated ""wellhead-to-water"" service offering provides a comprehensive solution that less integrated competitors may struggle to match, potentially leading to a competitive disadvantage and pressure on service fees across the sector. This aggressive growth strategy compels competitors to accelerate their own expansion projects, optimize existing assets, or seek strategic partnerships to maintain market relevance.

Despite the competitive landscape, Targa also engages in strategic partnerships and joint ventures to execute large-scale projects. For instance, Targa has partnered with MPLX LP (NYSE: MPLX) and WhiteWater Midstream on the bi-directional Traverse natural gas pipeline system, and even with Enbridge Inc. (NYSE: ENB), demonstrating instances where companies can be both competitors and collaborators. For these partners, Targa's expansion can lead to enhanced joint venture opportunities, allowing for shared investment and risk in developing critical new infrastructure. Improved connectivity and market access to crucial production areas and demand centers, including Mont Belvieu and export terminals, can also benefit partners whose systems interconnect with Targa's expanding network, leading to increased throughput and more efficient logistics.

The interplay between competition and collaboration defines the midstream sector. While Targa's growth strengthens interdependent relationships for specific projects, its increasing dominance in certain areas could still exert indirect competitive pressure on its partners' other business lines.

Wider Significance: Industry Trends and Regulatory Landscape

Targa Resources' strategic maneuvers are unfolding within a dynamic natural gas and NGL midstream sector, shaped by evolving energy demands, technological advancements, and a complex regulatory environment. Broader industry trends point to a continued structural growth in natural gas and NGLs, despite increasing pressures for decarbonization and the energy transition.

The midstream sector is benefiting from rising natural gas production, particularly from shale plays, and a surge in NGL processing. A significant driver for natural gas demand is the unexpected spike in power consumption from artificial intelligence (AI)-driven data centers, alongside the robust growth in U.S. liquefied natural gas (LNG) exports. Global LNG demand is projected to increase by nearly 50% by 2040, driven by Asian markets and geopolitical shifts in Europe, cementing natural gas's role as a crucial transitional fuel. The NGL value chain also presents substantial growth, with increasing demand for petrochemical feedstocks. Companies like Targa, with extensive NGL infrastructure, are well-positioned to capitalize on this, especially with the Mont Belvieu hub's critical role and consistent growth in NGL exports.

Targa's expansion, particularly in the Permian Basin, reinforces these trends. Its new processing plants and pipelines like Speedway and Yeti are designed to meet the growing volumes from this prolific region, enhancing regional gas flow and improving access to residue markets and export terminals. This contributes to a more robust and resilient supply chain, capable of handling increasing production and meeting burgeoning global demand, potentially leading to stronger Waha hub prices for natural gas. Historically, the midstream sector has often struggled to keep pace with production growth, making Targa's proactive investments vital for market stability.

The regulatory landscape remains a critical factor. The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) primarily regulates interstate natural gas and NGL pipelines, including rates and permitting for LNG export terminals. The Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration (PHMSA) oversees pipeline safety, with its jurisdiction expanding to NGL processing facilities, requiring companies to adapt compliance programs. Environmental regulations and public opposition increasingly complicate new pipeline permitting, highlighting the need for companies to navigate these hurdles effectively. While the current policy environment emphasizes the energy transition, it also acknowledges the ongoing necessity of natural gas and NGLs, creating a dual challenge for midstream operators to invest in both traditional and cleaner energy infrastructure, such as carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS).

The Road Ahead: Opportunities and Challenges

Looking ahead, Targa Resources and the broader natural gas/NGL midstream sector are poised for continued, albeit complex, growth. Targa's short-term outlook is robust, with strong volume growth projected for its Permian operations and significant capital expenditures planned through 2025 for new processing plants and NGL infrastructure, including the Train 11 fractionator at Mont Belvieu expected in Q3 2026. The company is also focused on returning capital to shareholders, with a planned 25% increase to its common dividend for Q1 2026.

In the long term, Targa's strategy centers on integrated growth, with major projects like the Speedway NGL Pipeline and the Yeti plant coming online in Q3 2027, and the Buffalo Run and Forza Pipelines extending into 2028. These projects underscore Targa's commitment to expanding its wellhead-to-water system to meet anticipated demand for NGLs and natural gas exports. The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) forecasts record natural gas production and strong NGL growth through 2026, driven by global demand and increasing LNG export capacity. The NGL market, in particular, is projected for significant growth, fueled by demand for petrochemical feedstocks.

Strategic pivots for Targa may include leveraging its Permian dominance and integrated system to optimize value across the entire midstream chain, expanding its NGL/LPG export capabilities to capitalize on global demand, and evaluating complementary business opportunities in the energy transition space, such as carbon capture or renewable natural gas. For the wider midstream sector, opportunities lie in supporting the energy transition by developing CCUS infrastructure, exploring hydrogen blending/transport, and continuing to invest in LNG and NGL export facilities.

However, challenges persist. Targa faces increased competition in the Permian Basin, which could pressure pricing and margins. While largely fee-based, the company is still exposed to commodity price volatility influencing producer activity. For the broader midstream sector, regulatory hurdles and permitting delays for new infrastructure remain significant obstacles. Aging infrastructure requires continuous capital investment for maintenance and upgrades, diverting funds from growth projects. The long-term shift towards lower-carbon energy sources also presents a fundamental challenge, even as natural gas plays a transitional role, requiring strategic adaptation and investment in new technologies.

Comprehensive Wrap-up: A Pivotal Role in the Energy Landscape

Targa Resources (NYSE: TRGP) plays an indisputably pivotal role in the North American energy infrastructure. Its extensive and integrated network for gathering, processing, transporting, storing, and fractionating natural gas and NGLs is fundamental to connecting upstream production with downstream markets and global demand. The company's aggressive expansion, particularly in the Permian Basin and along the Gulf Coast, highlights a clear strategy to capitalize on robust natural gas and NGL production growth and rising international demand for cleaner energy.

Moving forward, Targa's strategic investments in projects like the Speedway NGL Pipeline and new gas processing plants position it for continued strong financial performance and market leadership. These expansions are critical not only for Targa's growth but also for the overall efficiency and resilience of the U.S. energy supply chain. The broader midstream sector will continue to be a linchpin in the energy transition, balancing traditional hydrocarbon services with emerging opportunities in areas like CCUS and hydrogen.

Investors should closely watch Targa's execution of its major capital projects, particularly the in-service dates and ramp-up of the Yeti plant and Speedway pipeline in 2027. Further, monitoring the broader trends in Permian production, global LNG and NGL demand, and the evolving regulatory landscape will be crucial. Targa's ability to navigate competitive pressures, manage capital allocation effectively, and adapt to the accelerating energy transition will determine its long-term success and lasting impact on the market. Its established infrastructure and forward-looking investments suggest it is well-prepared to remain a key player in powering America's energy future.

In Shelly’s stanzas, a traveler in Egypt comes across the ruins of a once-monumental statue, with “a shattered visage lying half sunk” in desert sands bearing the “sneer of cold command.” Only its “trunkless legs of stone” remain standing. Yet the inscription carved on those stones still proclaims: “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” And in a silent mockery of such imperial hubris, all the trappings of that awesome power, all the palaces and fortresses, have been utterly erased, leaving only a desolation “boundless and bare” as “the lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Taken too literally, those verses might lead us to anticipate some future traveler finding fragments of St. Paul’s Cathedral scattered on the banks of the Thames River in London or stones from the Washington Monument strewn in a kudzu-covered field near the Potomac. Shelley is, however, offering us a more profound lesson that every empire teaches and every imperialist then forgets: Imperial ascent begets an inevitable decline.

Imperial Washington

Indeed, these days Donald Trump’s Washington abounds with monuments to overblown imperial grandeur and plans for more, all of which add up to an unconvincing denial that America’s global imperium is facing an Ozymandias-like fate. With his future Gilded Age ballroom meant to rise from the rubble of the White House’s East Wing, his plans for a massive triumphal arch at the city’s entrance, and a military parade of tanks and troops clanking down Constitution Avenue on his birthday, who could ever imagine such a thing? Not Donald Trump, that’s for sure.

In a celebration of his “works” that are supposedly making the “mighty despair” in foreign capitals around the world, his former national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has recently argued in Foreign Affairs that the president’s “policy of peace through strength” is reversing a Democrat-induced decline of U.S. global power. According to O’Brien, instead of crippling NATO (as his critics claim), President Trump is “leading the biggest European rearmament of the postwar era”; unleashing military innovation “to counter China”; and proving himself the “indispensable global statesman by driving efforts to bring peace to… long-standing disputes” in Gaza, the Congo, and, quite soon, Ukraine as well. Even in North America, according to O’Brien, Trump’s attempt to acquire Greenland has forced Denmark to expand its military presence, putting Russia on notice that the West will compete for control of the Arctic.

As it happens, whatever the truth of any of that may be, the policy elements that O’Brien cites are certain to prove largely irrelevant to the ceaseless struggle for geopolitical power among the globe’s great empires. Or, to borrow a favorite Trumpian epithet from the president’s “cornucopia of crudeness,” in the relentless, often ruthless world of grand strategy, none of those factors amounts to a hill of “shit.”

Indeed, O’Brien’s epic catalogue of Trump’s supposed foreign policy successes cleverly avoids any mention of the central factor in the rise and fall of every dominant world power for the past 500 years: energy. While the United States made genuine strides toward a green energy revolution under President Joe Biden, his successor, the “drill, baby, drill” president, has seemed determined not just to destroy those gains, but to revert to dependence on fossil fuels “bigly,” as Trump would say. In a perplexing paradox, President Trump’s systematic attack on alternative energy at home will almost certainly subvert America’s geopolitical power abroad. How and why? Let me explain by dipping my toes in a bit of history.

For the past five centuries, the rise of every global empire has rested on an underlying transformation (or perhaps revolution would be a more accurate word for it) in the form of energy that drove its version of the world economy. Innovation in the basic force behind its rising global presence gave each successive hegemonic power — Portugal, Spain, England, the United States, and possibly now China — a critical competitive advantage, cutting costs and increasing profits. That energy innovation and the lucrative commerce it created infused each successive imperium with intangible but substantial power, impelling its armed forces relentlessly forward and crushing resistance to its rule, whether by local groups or would-be imperial rivals. Although scholars of imperial history often ignore it, energy should be considered, as I argued in my book To Govern the Globe, the determinative factor in the rise and fall of every global hegemon for the past five centuries.

Iberia’s Mastery of Muscle

In the fifteenth century, the Iberian powers — Portugal and Spain — manipulated the ocean winds and maximized the energy output of the human body, giving them new forms of energy that allowed their arid lands and limited populations to conquer much of the globe. By replacing the square sail of lumbering Mediterranean ships with a triangular sail, agile Portuguese vessels like the famed caravela de armada doubled their capacity to tack close to the wind, allowing them to master the world’s oceans.

By 1500, Portuguese warships had navigation instruments that allowed them to cross the widest bodies of water, sails to beat into the strongest headwinds, a sturdy hull for guns and cargo, and lethal cannons that could destroy enemy fleets or breach the walls of port cities. As a result, a small flotilla of Portuguese caravels soon conquered colonies on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean and seized control of Asian sea lanes from the Red Sea to the Java Sea.

For the next three centuries, such sailing ships would transport 11 million African captives across the Atlantic to work as slaves in a new form of agriculture that was both exceptionally cruel and extraordinarily profitable: the sugar plantation. The output of Europe’s free yeoman farmers was then constrained by the limits of the individual body and the temperate climate’s short six-month growing season. By contrast, enslaved laborers, massed into efficient teams in tropical latitudes, were driven year-round to the brink of death and beyond to extract unprecedented productivity and profits from those plantations. Indeed, even as late as the nineteenth century, the U.S. southern slave plantation was, according to an econometric analysis, 35% more efficient than a northern family farm.

After developing the sugar plantation, or fazenda, as a new form of agribusiness on small islands off the coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese brought that system to Brazil in the sixteenth century. From there, it migrated to European colonies in the Caribbean, making that cruel commerce synonymous with the slave trade for nearly four centuries. So profitable was the slave plantation for its owners that, unlike almost every other form of production, it did not die from natural economic causes but would instead require the full force of the British navy to do it in.

The Dutch Harness the Winds

But the true masters of wind power would prove to be the Dutch, whose technological prowess would allow their small land, devoid of natural resources, to conquer a colonial empire that spanned three continents. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch drive for scientific innovation led them to harness the winds as never before, building sailing ships 10 times the size of a Portuguese caravel and windmills that, among other things, replaced the tedious hand sawing of logs to produce lumber for shipbuilding. With giant sails spanning over 90 feet, a five-ton shaft generating up to 50 horsepower, and several sawing frames with six steel blades each, a windmill’s four-man crew could turn 60 tree trunks a day into uniform planks to maintain the massive Dutch merchant fleet of 4,000 ocean-going ships.

By 1650, the Zaan district near Amsterdam, arguably Europe’s first major industrial area, had more than 50 wind-driven sawmills and was the world’s largest shipyard, launching 150 hulls annually (at half the cost of English-built vessels). Many of these were the Dutch-designed fluitschip, an agile three-masted cargo vessel that cut crew size, doubled sailing speed, and could carry 500 tons of cargo with exceptional efficiency.

Through its commercial acumen and mastery of wind power, tiny Holland defeated the mighty Spanish empire in the Thirty Years War (1618-48), then fought the British to a standstill in three massive naval wars, while building an empire that reached around the world — from the Spice Islands of Indonesia to the city of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan.

When Coal Was King

As Holland’s commercial empire began to fade, however, Great Britain was already launching an energy transition to coal-fired steam energy that would leave the wind and muscle power of the Iberian age in the dust of history. And the industrial revolution that went with it would build the world’s first truly global empire.

The Scottish inventor James Watt perfected the steam engine by 1784. Such machines began driving railways in 1825 and the Royal Navy’s warships in the 1840s. By then, an armada of steam engines was transforming the nature of work worldwide — driving sawmills, pulling gang plows, and sculpting the earth’s surface with steam shovels, steam dredges, and steam rollers. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of steam engines in the United States would triple from 56,000 units to 156,000, accounting for 77% of all American industrial power. To fuel that age of steam and steel, Britain’s coal production climbed to a peak of 290 million tons in 1913, while worldwide production reached 1.3 billion tons.

Coal was the catalyst for an industrial revolution that fused steam technology with steel production to make Britain the master of the world’s oceans. From the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, tiny Britain with just 40 million people would preside over a global empire that controlled a quarter of all humanity directly through colonies and another quarter indirectly through client states. In addition to its vast territorial empire, Britannia ruled the world’s waves, while its pound sterling became the global reserve currency, and London the financial center of the planet.

America’s Petrol-Powered Hegemony

Just as Britain’s imperial age had coincided with its coal-driven industrial revolution, so Washington’s brand-new world order focused on crude oil to feed the voracious energy needs of its global economy. By 1950, in the wake of World War II, the U.S. petrol-powered economy was producing half the world’s economic output and using that raw economic power for commercial and military dominion over most of the planet (outside the Sino-Soviet communist bloc).

By 1960, the Pentagon had built a nuclear triad that gave it a formidable strategic deterrent, as five nuclear-powered submarines armed with atomic warheads trolled the ocean depths, while 14 nuclear-armed aircraft carriers patrolled the world’s oceans. Flying from 500 U.S. overseas military bases, the Strategic Air Command had 1,700 bombers ready for nuclear strikes.

As American automobile ownership climbed from 40 million units in 1950 to 200 million in 2000, the country’s oil consumption surged from 6.5 million barrels daily to a peak of 20 million. During those same decades, the federal government spent $370 billion to cover the country with 46,000 miles of interstate highways, allowing cars and trucks to replace railroads as the ribs of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.

To drive the carbon-fueled economy of Washington’s world order, there would be a dramatic, five-fold increase in the global consumption of liquid fossil fuels during the last half of the twentieth century. As the number of motor vehicles worldwide kept climbing, crude oil rose from 27% of global fossil-fuel consumption in 1950 to 44% by 2003, surpassing coal to become the world’s main source of energy.

To meet this relentlessly rising demand, the Middle East’s share of global oil production climbed from just 7% in 1945 to 35% in 2003. As the self-appointed guardian of the Persian Gulf whose vast oil reserves represented some 60% of the world’s total, Washington would become embroiled in endless wars in that tumultuous region, from the Gulf War of 1990-91 to its present-day interventions in Israel and Iran.

Whether thanks to Britain’s coal-fired factories or America’s auto traffic, all those carbon emissions were already producing signs of global warming that, by the 1990s, would set alarm bells ringing among scientists worldwide. From the “pre-industrial” baseline of 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1880, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere kept climbing to 410 ppm by 2018, resulting in the rising seas, devastating fires, raging storms, and protracted droughts that came to be known as global warming.

As evidence of the climate crisis became undeniable, the world’s nations responded with striking unanimity by signing the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to cut carbon emissions and surge investments into alternative energy that soon yielded significant breakthroughs in both cost and efficiency. Within four years, the International Energy Agency predicted that dramatic drops in the cost of solar panels meant that solar energy would soon be “the new king of the world’s electricity markets.” Indeed, as technology slashed the cost of battery storage and solar panels, the International Renewable Energy Agency reported in 2024 that the solar generation of electricity had become 41% cheaper than fossil fuels, while offshore wind was 53% cheaper — a truly significant disparity that will, as technology continues to slash the cost of solar energy, render the use of coal and natural gas for electricity an economic irrationality, if not an utter absurdity.

In the game of empires, seemingly small margins can have large consequences, often marking the difference between dominance and subordination, success and failure — whether the 35% advantage of enslaved over free labor, the 50% cost advantage for Dutch sailing craft over British ones, and now a 41% savings for solar over fossil fuels. Moreover, the day is fast coming when fossil-fuel electricity will cost more than twice as much as alternative energy from solar and wind power.

To assure America’s economic future, the administration of President Joe Biden began investing trillions of dollars in alternative energy by building battery plants, encouraging massive wind and solar projects, and continuing a consumer subsidy to sustain Detroit’s transition to electric vehicles. In January 2025, however, Donald Trump entered the White House (again) determined to roll back the global green revolution. After quitting the Paris climate accord and labeling climate change a “hoax” or “the green new scam,” President Trump has halted construction of major offshore wind projects, ended the subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, and opened yet more federal lands for coal and oil leases. Armed with extraordinary executive powers and a single-minded determination, he will predictably delay, if not derail, America’s transition to alternative energy, missing market opportunities and undercutting the country’s economic competitiveness by chaining it to overpriced fossil fuels.

China’s Green-Energy Ride to Global Power

While Washington was demolishing America’s green energy infrastructure, Beijing has been working to make China a global powerhouse for alternative energy. Ten years ago, its leaders launched a “Made in China 2025” program to storm the heights of the global economy by becoming the world leader in 10 strategic industries, eight of which involved some aspect of the green-energy transformation, including “new materials,” “high-tech ships,” “advanced railways,” “energy-saving and new energy vehicles,” and “energy equipment.” Those “new materials” include China’s virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals, which are absolutely critical to the manufacturing of the key components for renewable energy — specifically, wind turbines, solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and hydrogen extraction. In sum, Beijing is already riding the green energy revolution in a serious bid to become the world’s “leading manufacturing superpower” by 2049, while erasing America’s economic edge and its global hegemony in the bargain.

So, you might ask, have any of those seemingly pie-in-the-sky plans already become an economic reality? Given China’s recent progress in key energy sectors, the answer is a resounding yes.

Under its economic plan, China has already come to dominate the world’s solar power industry. In 2024, it cut the wholesale price of its solar panel exports in half and nearly doubled its exports of panel components. To replace its old export “trio” of clothing, furniture, and appliances, Beijing has mandated a “new trio” of solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric cars. And to put what’s happening in perspective, imagine that, in just the month of May, China installed enough wind and solar energy to power a country as big as Poland, reaching an impressive figure that represents half the world’s “total installed solar capacity.” By 2024, China was already producing at least 80% of the world’s solar panel components, dominating the global market, and undercutting would-be competitors in Europe and the U.S. Driving all that explosive growth, China’s investment in clean energy has reached nearly $2 trillion, representing 10% of its gross domestic product, and has been growing at three times the rate of its overall economy, meaning it would soon account for a full 20% of its entire economy.

With similar determination, its electric vehicles (EVs) are now beginning to capture the global car market. By 2024, 17.3 million electric cars were made worldwide, and China produced 70% of them. Not only are Chinese companies opening massive robotic assembly plants worldwide to crank out such cars by the millions, but they are also making the world’s cheapest and best cars — with the YangWang U9-X hitting a world speed record of 308 miles per hour; BYD’s latest plug-in hybrid models, priced at only $13,700 and capable of traveling a record 1,200 miles on a single charge and single tank of gas; the YangWang U8 with a capacity to literally drive across water; and the Xiaomi SU-7 displaying a high-tech driver interface that makes a Tesla look like a Ford Pinto.

Since an EV is just a steel box with a battery, technology will soon allow low-cost electric vehicles to completely eradicate gas guzzlers, enabling China to conquer the global car market — with full electric cars like the self-driving BYD Seagull sedan already priced at $8,000, models like BYD’s Han with a 5-minute charge time that’s faster than pumping a tank of gas, and sedans like the Nio ET7 with a standard range on a single charge of 620 miles. And most of that extraordinary technological progress has happened in less than four years, essentially the time remaining in Donald Trump’s second term in office.

An Agenda for America’s Economic Future

By discouraging alternative energy and encouraging fossil fuels, President Trump is undercutting America’s economic competitiveness in the most fundamental way imaginable. Amid an historic transformation in the world’s energy infrastructure (comparable in scope and scale to the coal-fired industrial revolution), the United States will spend the next three years under his watch digging coal and burning oil and natural gas, while the rest of the industrial world follows China as it pursues technological innovation to the furthest frontiers of the human imagination. Indeed, the latest annual report from the world’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, states bluntly that the transition away from fossil fuels is “inevitable” as the world, “led by a surge in cheap solar power in… the Middle East and Asia,” installs more green energy capacity in the next five years than it has in the last 40 combined.

By the time Donald Trump leaves office in 2029, this country will be distinctly on the imperial decline amid fast-paced changes that will make electric vehicles universal and solar-powered electricity an economic imperative. And just as the Dutch used energy technology to capture their imperial moment in the seventeenth century, so the Chinese will undoubtedly do the same in this century.

After all, how can the United States produce competitive products, even for domestic consumption (much less export), if our costs for energy, the basic component of every economic activity, become double those of our competitors? Simply put, it won’t be possible.

If, however, when Donald Trump’s term in office is done, this country moves quickly to recover its capacity for economic rationality, it should be able to regain some version of its place in the world economy. For once, the United States rejoins the green energy revolution, it can use its formidable engineering ingenuity to accelerate the development of this transformative technology — simultaneously reducing the CO2 emissions that are choking the planet and securing the livelihoods of average American workers in the bargain.",https://www.counterpunch.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/matthew-henry-yETqkLnhsUI-unsplash-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 02:58:11.660473

The outcomes will directly affect where Virginians get their power from — and how much they pay for it.

Base rate case

Dominion Energy Virginia made headlines earlier this year when it asked for its first base rate increase since the early 1990s, amounting to a 15% bill increase over two years.

The commission said it was ""understandable"" that many opposed Dominion's request, given the effects of inflation on residential and commercial ratepayers — but noted that those same pressures impact Dominion, too.

The SCC also found that Dominion had earned less than its approved profit margin in the last rate cycle, meaning the company is entitled to make up for that over the next two years by increasing base rates.

Ultimately, regulators did approve a rate increase, but not as much as the utility asked for: roughly 9% over the next two years, instead of 15%.

For a customer using 1,000 kilowatt-hours in a month (you can check your usage on your Dominion bill), that looks like a monthly increase of $11.24 in 2026 and an additional $2.36 ($13.60 total) in 2027.

Eagle-eyed readers may notice that's more than Dominion's requested base rate increases of $8.51 in 2026 and $2.00 in 2027, as originally reported by VPM News and other outlets.

The company initially requested to move certain costs associated with operating the grid — such as costs to participate in PJM Interconnection's capacity market — into a different part of customers' bills, but the SCC rejected that request. (Consumers would have to bear those cost increases no matter where they ultimately appeared on the bill.)

Although that change means the approved numbers make for a higher base rate increase, customers' overall bill increases (as in, what they pay for electricity usage monthly) are still below what Dominion originally proposed.

SCC regulators also granted the utility giant's request for a new class of electricity-hungry customers, namely data centers and advanced manufacturing facilities.

In an effort to protect other ratepayers from bearing the cost for big data center–serving projects should they fail or shut down early, those big users will have to enter into a 14-year contract with the utility. Those include costly penalties for early exits.

Commissioners also ordered Dominion to further study its rate allocation across these high-demand customers, given that they are driving the majority of energy demand growth in the commonwealth. The company will have to present its results at its next rate case in two years.

Josephus Allmond, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, said he was pleased to see the SCC not give Dominion all the increases it asked for and the order to further consider data center cost responsibilities. SELC represented nonprofit Appalachian Voices in the case, which opposed Dominion's requested bill increases.

""I think the commission has done a lot of things in this order to put in place some process that, if implemented well, can really provide relief to residential ratepayers,"" Allmond said.

Jeremy Slayton, a Dominion spokesperson, said in a press release the new rates remain below the national average, despite the approved increases.

""Today the Virginia State Corporation Commission approved important consumer protections to ensure that large electricity users, like data centers, continue paying their fair share of power costs,"" Slayton wrote.

Slayton also pointed to bill assistance programs Dominion offers, and added the company would be rolling out an online hub in early December with all cost-saving programs in one place.

Chesterfield's natural gas plant

The commission also approved a controversial natural gas peaker plant known as the Chesterfield Energy Reliability Center. That case drew nearly 2,000 written comments and 83 commenters at the SCC hearing, the majority of which were opposed to the plant.

Dominion says the proposed 944-megawatt facility, planned to replace the coal-fired Chesterfield Power Station, is essential to meet rising demand peaks on the hottest and coldest days of the year.

The company cited modeling done by the Brattle Group that suggested Dominion's supply of electricity could get dangerously close to its demand, potentially resulting in forced load-shedding — which could mean rolling blackouts or data centers using air-polluting backup diesel generators — without CERC online.

The SCC rejected assertions by environmentalists that approving the gas plant would defy compliance with the Virginia Clean Economy Act or show a preference against renewable energy, demand-side management or battery storage — instead focusing on the reliability threat.

Regulators found that the evidence ""clearly establishes that there is an imminent reliability threat for Dominion and its customers and that the CERC Project addresses that threat in a manner that is in accordance with the public interest and the VCEA.""

They also argued that, given challenges to building and interconnecting new resources, Dominion would likely not be able to deploy enough renewables and battery storage quickly enough to meet the need for new generation.

Since the VCEA passed in 2020, the SCC has approved Dominion requests to build or purchase 6,000 MW of solar and offshore wind combined.

Dominion estimates the facility will cost $1.47 billion to build. According to filings, that translates to $0.60 a month for a customer using 1,000 kWh. If it ends up costing more than the approved $1.47 billion, the utility can petition the SCC for additional cost recovery.

""We look forward to concluding the Virginia Department of Environmental Quality's permitting process next month and getting to work on this important project next year,"" said Dominion's Slayton.

Glen Besa of Friends of Chesterfield, a community group opposed to the plant, said in a press release that the SCC gave Dominion a ""blank check"" to build more carbon-emitting natural gas plants.

""It is critical that the General Assembly keep its promise to the people of Virginia ensuring affordable electricity, clean air and a healthy climate even if the SCC proved today it is not up to the job,"" Besa wrote.

By establishing channels for coordination and collaboration, the Action Agenda can reinforce connections between government and non-state actors to drive greater climate action.","The 2025 UN climate talks wrapped on Saturday, Nov. 22 after negotiations pushed into overtime. The resulting decision secured some important wins, both inside and outside the negotiations. But it omitted some of the big-ticket items many hoped to see.

With efforts to halt temperature rise severely off track and climate disasters becoming ever-more destructive, the summit (COP30) aimed to establish clear pathways to deliver past pledges and put the world on a safer track. A key question was how countries would address lagging ambition in their new climate commitments (NDCs). Hopes that countries would commit to roadmaps to end fossil fuel use and halt deforestation were ultimately dashed after opposition from petrostates. The final decision only included new voluntary initiatives to accelerate national climate action, though the Brazilian Presidency intends to move forward with fossil fuel and deforestation roadmaps outside of the formal COP talks.

Other areas were brighter.

Building resilience to climate impacts took center stage, with COP30 securing a new target to triple finance for climate adaptation. The COP also laid out practical solutions to increase finance for the low-carbon transition. In an era of trade wars and tariffs, negotiators also agreed for the first time to hold discussions on how trade policies can help — or hinder — climate action.

Against the backdrop of the Amazon, nature also saw advances, including a new fund for tropical forest conservation. Indigenous Peoples and other local communities were recognized like never before. And outside the formal negotiations, the summit saw a raft of new pledges and action plans from cities, states, countries and the private sector. It is clear that we are moving from negotiations to implementation, and from wrangling over what to do to how to do it.

These victories matter. It shows that international cooperation can still deliver, despite deepening divides on climate action and a difficult geopolitical context.

Here, we take a closer look at the outcomes from COP30 and what’s needed next:

National Climate Plans

Adaptation

Finance

Nature

People-Centered Action

Trade

Sectoral Action

Responding to the NDC Shortfall

By the end of COP30, 119 countries representing 74% of global emissions had submitted new national commitments in NDCs. These commitments showed some progress on reducing emissions and mobilizing sectoral action, but they collectively deliver less than 15% of the emissions reductions required by 2035 to hold global temperature rise to 1.5 degrees C. UN analysis finds that even with the latest NDCs and current policies, the world remains on course for 2.3-2.8 degrees C of warming, a dangerous prospect that’s well above the Paris Agreement’s temperature benchmarks.

This emissions gap shaped expectations heading into COP30, with countries seeking a credible response to the NDC shortfall. A central and politically charged issue was how the world would address the continued use of fossil fuels, the root cause of the climate crisis. More than 80 countries advocated for a global roadmap to guide this transition, but negotiators ultimately failed to include it in the final decision, stymied by opposition from several countries — in particular, major petrostates.

Instead, COP30 launched two new initiatives, under the guidance of the COP Presidencies: a Global Implementation Accelerator and the “Belem Mission to 1.5” to enhance and speed the implementation of countries’ NDCs and national adaptation plans (NAPs) and keep 1.5 degrees C within reach. Neither of these voluntary initiatives directly mention fossil fuels, disappointing countries seeking clearer direction. However, the language for the Accelerator does include a thin thread linking it to the Global Stocktake commitments made at COP28 in Dubai, thus implicitly referring to the language adopted there on a just, orderly transition away from fossil fuels.

The Brazilian COP30 president also announced that it will develop roadmaps to transition away from fossil fuels and tackle deforestation in its own capacity. It’s ultimately up to Brazil President Lula da Silva and the COP presidency to advance these global plans in a robust and inclusive way.

For the first time in a COP decision, negotiators also acknowledged the likelihood of overshooting 1.5 degrees C and the need to limit both its magnitude and duration. Finally, although many countries now have 2030, 2035 and net-zero emissions targets, COP30 gave little attention to updating long-term emissions strategies — essential complements to near-term emissions targets.

Looking ahead to next year, the Global Implementation Accelerator will hold open information sessions in June and November before delivering a report and high-level meeting at COP31 in November 2026. The Belém Mission to 1.5 will follow a similar timeline and likewise report its conclusions at COP31. In parallel, the COP30 Presidency’s roadmap development will be informed by external consultations, including an April meeting on transitioning away from fossil fuels, co-hosted by the Colombian and Dutch governments.

Adapting to Climate Impacts

A key task for negotiators was finalizing how the Paris Agreement’s Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) will be put into action, including establishing indicators to track progress.

In the end, negotiators adopted a set of 59 indicators across seven sectors, such as water, agriculture and health, and the adaptation policy planning process, including on finance, capacity building and technology transfer. The list also takes into account cross-cutting considerations such as gender and human rights. But it was a bumpy process and an ultimately mixed outcome.

In the final days of COP, many negotiators were surprised to see most of the indicators — developed by 78 independent experts over the course of the last two years — were altered. The final set includes some indicators that are unmeasurable and thematically incomplete, creating technical issues to work through. In the final plenary, some countries raised objections to the GGA outcome, which, after some controversy over process, the COP Presidency promised to address at the Bonn climate talks in June 2026.

The GGA indicators will need further refinement, part of which will be addressed through a two-year “Belém-Addis vision” process. However, it’s unclear if countries will be willing to start using the indicators agreed at COP30 if they may change in the next two years.

Meanwhile, loss and damage, which addresses the most severe impacts of climate change, received relatively little attention compared to previous COPs. Negotiators did review the Warsaw International Mechanism and made some progress, including kickstarting a new State of Loss and Damage Report, developing guidance to integrate Loss and Damage into national plans, and enhancing coherence within the Paris Agreement’s loss and damage architecture. Parties also agreed on new guidance for the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), linking it to the new climate-finance goal agreed at COP29. The FRLD launched the call for funding requests for its start-up phase, the Barbados Implementation Modalities (BIM).

Finance for Developing Countries

Expectations were high for countries to determine what’s next for adaptation finance, given that the 2021 Glasgow COP pledge to double adaptation finance from 2019 levels expires this year. Parties were divided on whether to establish a new adaptation finance target, how big it should be and over what timeframe, with many developing countries calling for a tripling by 2030. The COP concluded with a call to at least triple finance for adaptation by 2035, a welcome development, albeit on a longer timeline than many had hoped. This means that of the $300 billion+ in climate finance that should flow to developing countries by 2035, $120 billion or so should go toward adapting and building resilience to climate change impacts.

COP30 also brought further dialogue on how to scale up finance from all sources to reach the broader target of $1.3 trillion for developing countries by 2035. The COP29 and COP30 presidencies presented the Baku to Belem Roadmap to 1.3T, laying out key actions governments, financial institutions and others can take to finance climate mitigation and adaptation in developing countries. This is an important step-change in the approach to finance. It recognizes the importance of all sources playing their part and the value of finance working better together as a system, including through ‘country platforms.’ Negotiators took note of the roadmap and decided to urgently advance actions listed within it. However, they did not discuss its recommendations in detail, which, for example, include actions to reduce debt and improve incentives for private sector investments in developing nations.

Some negotiators threatened to hold up the negotiations unless Article 9.1 of the Paris Agreement was discussed. This article spells out the responsibility of developed countries to provide finance for developing nations. Countries eventually agreed to a two-year work programme to continue discussions. They also created a dialogue for continued conversation on Article 2.1(c), which calls for alignment of all global financial flows with mitigation and adaptation goals.

Ultimately, financial decisions are made in many venues and institutions across the globe, from multilateral development banks to the G20, which met last weekend. Decision-makers must work together to direct finance toward solutions for global people, nature and climate goals, and away from activities that undermine them. The Baku to Belem Roadmap and the Circle of Ministers Reports provide a useful guide for this.

Protecting and Restoring Nature

Despite COP30’s location in Belem, the gateway to the Amazon rainforest, negotiators ultimately failed to launch a global roadmap for ending deforestation. Still, COP30 brought other important wins for nature conservation.

Brazil officially launched its Tropical Forests Forever Facility to provide long-term, predictable finance to countries that protect their tropical forests. The innovative approach aims to shift the economics of deforestation so that maintaining standing forests is more profitable than clearing them. A handful of countries — including Brazil, Indonesia, France, Germany and Norway — pledged a total of $6.7 billion for the fund. That’s a start toward Brazil’s initial target of $25 billion, but more momentum is needed. For example, China and the U.K. signaled that they may come through with funding pledges next year.

Countries also renewed the Forest and Land Tenure pledge, committing $1.8 billion in funding through 2030 and expanding coverage beyond forests to savannas, mangroves and other ecosystems. Fifteen governments launched the Intergovernmental Land Tenure Commitment, which aims to secure and formally recognize 160 million hectares of land held and used by Indigenous Peoples and local communities. Brazil announced new protections for Indigenous territories, and Indonesia pledged to do so. These outcomes demonstrate a major shift in recognizing the role that Indigenous Peoples, Afro-descendants, and local communities play in protecting the ecosystems that sustain us all.

Countries also announced new efforts to tackle the major challenges facing nature. Over 40 countries endorsed a call to action to fight wildfires, the leading cause of forest loss last year. Brazil launched the Bioeconomy Challenge, a global platform to increase investment in sustainable forest economy markets. And 10 countries announced their support for a Brazil-led accelerator to restore the world’s degraded and underproductive farmland.

Ocean conservation also advanced. Brazil joined the Ocean Panel, committing to sustainably manage all of its national waters by 2030 — the world’s 10th largest ocean area. And six more countries joined the Blue NDC Challenge to deliver ocean-climate actions: Belgium, Cambodia, Canada, Indonesia, Portugal and Singapore.

Putting People at the Heart of Climate Action

COP30 brought a refreshingly new focus “to connect the climate regime to people’s real lives.” This theme ran through the People’s March, where over 70,000 people took to the streets calling for climate justice and action. The first Global Ethical Stocktake, launched by President Lula and Minister Marina Silva along with UN Secretary-General António Guterres, with participation from WRI's Wanjira Mathai, reinforced that fairness, inclusion and shared responsibility must guide climate decisions and prioritize those most affected by climate change’s impacts.

The adoption of a process to develop a “just transition mechanism” marked the furthest a COP has gone to address workers’ and communities’ rights. It aims to strengthen international cooperation, provide technical assistance and capacity-building, share knowledge, and support equitable, inclusive transitions to low-carbon economies. While some noted disappointment that it does not include specific references to critical minerals or fossil fuels, the decision to develop the mechanism remains a significant step forward. Negotiators and other stakeholders will share their views on the process for developing the mechanism by March 2026, with a recommended process for its operationalization to be considered in November 2026.

The summit also marked an unprecedented effort to include Indigenous voices. Over 2,500 Indigenous Peoples participated in COP30, supported by initiatives like the Peoples’ Circle, an advisory body highlighting their perspectives to the COP Presidency. At least three COP documents explicitly recognize Indigenous rights: the Global Mutirão affirms their land rights and traditional knowledge; the mitigation work program highlights their vital role in sustainable forest management and calls for long-term recognition of their land rights; and the just transition mechanism refers to rights and protections for Indigenous Peoples in voluntary isolation and initial contact.

Countries also developed a new Gender Action Plan, setting the stage for gender-responsive climate policy. The initiative supports gender-responsive finance and promotes the leadership of Indigenous, Afro-descendant and rural women.

Jobs and economic opportunity were also prominent themes, with a clear takeaway that embracing the low-carbon transition can deliver growth, investment, security, competitiveness and good-paying jobs. Developed in collaboration with the COP30 Presidency and a broad coalition of international partners, the Global Initiative on Jobs & Skills for the New Economy was launched to prepare workforces for a rapidly evolving economy and build a movement for green, inclusive jobs. Countries also launched the Belém Declaration on Global Green Industrialization, providing a framework for scaling new industrial systems and creating employment opportunities in emerging green sectors.

Health also featured prominently. The World Health Organization launched the Belém Health Action Plan, citing 60 actions necessary to both adapt to climate change and address climate-related health risks affecting 3.3 billion people. Over 30 countries endorsed the plan and agreed to report their progress during the next Global Stocktake at COP33 in 2028.

Trade Policies Linked to Climate Action

COP30 marked an important shift in the recognition of trade policies as being closely interlinked with climate action. This reflects the degree to which climate action is increasingly seen as integral to broader economic transformation, and how economic systems can either act as barriers or catalysts to the pace, scale and distributional impacts of the transition. At the beginning of the COP, some developing countries pressed for the formal agenda to include discussion of “unilateral trade measures” related to climate policies. While the adopted agenda never reflected that call, the outcome in the Global Mutirão decision, the centerpiece of COP30 outcomes, included dialogues on trade and climate.

The outcome reaffirmed that countries should cooperate to promote a supportive and open international economic system that enhances efforts to combat climate change. To enable better communication and discussion among countries on those issues, dialogues will be held over the next three years during the UNFCCC intersessional meetings in June each year. Those dialogues will include participation from the WTO and other international economic organizations and will look at opportunities and challenges at the nexus of trade and climate, culminating in a report in 2028.

Trade also featured in the new Integrated Forum on Climate Change and Trade, introduced by President Lula during the World Leaders’ Summit held just before COP30. By positioning itself outside the international climate and trade regimes, the Forum will help develop mutually reinforcing solutions at the intersection of climate and trade policies, in areas such as the energy transition, deforestation and carbon accounting.

Advancing Action Across Sectors

The COP30 Presidency and High-Level Climate Champions released the COP30 Action Agenda, which unites hundreds of climate initiatives across sectors and actors into a common framework tied to negotiated outcomes, including the Global Stocktake. By establishing channels for coordination and collaboration, the Action Agenda can reinforce connections between government and non-state actors to drive greater climate action.

In addition to those mentioned above, a few highlights are particularly significant:

Cities, states and regions: COP30 saw tremendous momentum for the urban agenda. Over 14,000 cities, states and regions committed to advance climate solutions at the Local Leaders Forum in Rio ahead of COP30. 77 countries and the European Union have now committed to local-national climate collaboration through the CHAMP initiative. And185 cities joined the Beat the Heat initiative to tackle extreme heat.

Carbon accounting: Underpinning all sectors’ and companies’ climate progress is rigorous and transparent carbon accounting. The Action Agenda reaffirms that the partnership between Greenhouse Gas Protocol (GHGP) and the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is the foundation of the global carbon-accounting system.

Bioeconomy challenge: Launched by Brazil and several partners, the initiative aims to scale sustainable nature-based investment by 2028 through a focus on five priority areas: forests, regenerative agriculture and restoration, sociobioeconomy, financing innovation, and bio-industrialization.

Energy: South Korea, the seventh-largest coal producer, committed to phase out coal by 2040. Alongside Bahrain, it also joined the Powering Past Coal Alliance. Utilities stepped up, too: members of the Utilities for Net Zero Alliance (UNEZA) announced they will increase annual investments in the energy transition to nearly $150 billion, with a major focus on grids and storage. And the global coalition Mission Efficiency launched a ""Plan to Accelerate Doubling Energy Efficiency (PAS),"" a much-needed roadmap aimed at achieving the COP28 goal to double energy efficiency by 2030.

By unifying more than 480 initiatives into 117 concrete “Plans to Accelerate Solutions,” the Action Agenda can help turn pledges into reality. It can also serve as critical support for the new Global Implementation Accelerator.

Picking Up the Pace of Change

It’s easy to be discouraged by the negative news coming out of COP30 and the climate space writ large. But beneath the headlines, progress is happening. Clean energy and electrified transport are growing at rates that were unimaginable a decade ago. Countries investing in a green transition are reaping the benefits, from new jobs and growing economies to better energy access and cleaner air.

A big question remains whether the Brazilian Presidency’s promise to deliver fossil fuel and deforestation roadmaps in the next year can bear fruit and have real impact. It is in the interest of those who want to see a just transition for it to do so. Meanwhile, countries must prove they can deliver their new climate plans, leveraging economy-wide policy shifts and finance mobilization to turn ambition into real action.

Whatever the twists and turns of climate negotiations, the economic transition is underway. The question is, how fast it will be and who will benefit? Now is the time for all actors to pick up the pace and drive towards a just transition.",https://files.wri.org/d8/s3fs-public/styles/1222x722/s3/2025-11/cop30-entrance_0.jpg?VersionId=b28gKb0.UWASNHxO24xErewA8QQaxOmC&h=4f71ec2a&itok=2dUldQ1g,N,,2025-11-26 01:58:57.472814

Contact: Jennifer Rennicks, Director of Policy & Communications, 865.235.1448, Jennifer@cleanenergy.org

Tallahassee, Fla. – Florida’s solar energy industry and clean energy advocates are calling on state Representative Ritch Workman to stop blocking consideration of a resolution that would allow voters to decide whether or not to remove punitive taxes on solar energy systems. The solar industry supports letting the voters decide on the exemption of solar energy systems from the punitive tangible personal property tax. Removing this burdensome tax will unlock Florida’s rooftop solar potential by enabling consumers to leverage third party leasing of solar systems. Third party ownership financing has been key to the U.S. solar boom, yet remains an untapped opportunity in Florida due to this unique tax.

“Removing taxes on solar, especially the onerous tangible personal property tax, will unlock Florida’s solar energy market, providing much needed economic development and jobs to the state,” stated Mike Antheil, Executive Director of the Florida Alliance for Renewable Energy.

Florida Commissioner of Agriculture, Adam Putnam, has introduced a resolution that would offer similar tax relief – but the resolution is now being blocked by Rep. Workman. Putnam has indicated that he is open for his bill to be amended to address the tangible personal property tax. Solar supporters are hoping to see the bill amended in the State Senate next Tuesday, April 1st. However, the House leadership appears to be stalling on taking up the measure.

“The Legislature has done virtually nothing to encourage private investment in solar development in the state. It certainly should not be blocking measures that will allow voters to decide on removing onerous taxes that are holding back development and jobs in the solar industry,” said Wayne Wallace, President of Solar Source, and President of the Florida Solar Energy Industries Association.

Florida continues to fall behind neighboring states in solar development, including Georgia and North Carolina, despite having the third largest electricity market in the U.S. and best solar resource east of the Mississippi River.

”The solar energy boom sweeping this country is a reflection of the freedom to use solar power that grows from the roots of our democracy,” said Dr. Stephen A. Smith, Executive Director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “Florida citizens should have the right to vote on taxes that are punitive and obstruct this booming market from bringing economic prosperity to the Sunshine State.”

Last month, Recology completed a fleet transition plan with the nonprofit Center for Transportation and the Environment after winning a competitive grant process backed by the C.H.
The plan is vehicle manufacturer agnostic and anticipates the incorporation of both battery electric and fuel cell vehicles.
The partners modeled what it would take to fully transition the fleet to zero-emission vehicles by 2042, a deadline initially set by the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation.
The rollback of Advanced Clean Fleets and less stringent but still ambitious federal programs have made the development of suitable zero-emission vehicles murkier, she said.","Recology is seeing increased uncertainty in the zero-emission vehicle market in the wake of regulatory rollbacks affecting heavy-duty fleets. But the hauler, among California’s largest, is still plotting a full transition.

Last month, Recology completed a fleet transition plan with the nonprofit Center for Transportation and the Environment after winning a competitive grant process backed by the C.H. Robinson Foundation, a philanthropic fund tied to the logistics and supply chain company of the same name.

The partners took a close look at Recology’s San Francisco fleet, which includes a mix of nearly 600 light, medium and heavy-duty vehicles. It’s the largest fleet out of Recology’s total operations, which constitutes about 2,600 vehicles.

The plan is vehicle manufacturer agnostic and anticipates the incorporation of both battery electric and fuel cell vehicles. Julia Mangin, Recology’s director of sustainability and government affairs, said it helped clarify what opportunities and challenges the company should expect as it embarks on its transition.

“It demonstrated it’s certainly possible, but it’s going to take a lot of coordination and it’s not going to be inexpensive to do it,” Mangin said. “We’re hoping that further innovation helps with a lot of those challenges.”

Recology has historically been on the front line of companies looking to move away from more carbon-intensive fleets. The company achieved its goal to power 90% of its entire fleet with renewable or alternative fuels in 2022, and now has a goal to up that percentage to 95% by 2028.

That progress largely came through the use of renewable diesel and renewable natural gas. While Recology has piloted multiple battery-electric vehicles and today operates a few models, their deployment has been limited to date.

That’s in part due to pared back regulatory efforts to require a transition. California’s Advanced Clean Fleets regulation, which initially set hard deadlines by which many fleet operators in the state would have needed to transition to zero-emission vehicles, was curtailed by California’s Air Resources Board after the election of President Donald Trump in 2024. Trump’s administration has also worked to roll back requirements for vehicle manufacturers to produce zero-emission trucks this year.

Against the backdrop of those changes, CTE helped Recology better understand the availability of battery-electric and fuel cell vehicles to replace the range of models in its existing fleet, Mangin said. The center also provided a look at fueling infrastructure and other market developments.

The partners modeled what it would take to fully transition the fleet to zero-emission vehicles by 2042, a deadline initially set by the Advanced Clean Fleets regulation. The transition plan calls for Recology to replace its smaller, lighter duty vehicles with battery electric models first before mixing in battery electric and fuel cell models for the hauler’s heavier vehicles over time.

Mangin said Recology would replace vehicles on a rolling basis as they reached the end of their useful life, which is usually about 10 years.

The plan estimates Recology would need three megawatts of charging power alone for its San Francisco fleet, a significant amount of power at a time when other electrification needs are also on the rise. Mangin said the company has begun engaging with utilities about adding capacity, but noted they can sometimes adopt a “get in line” mentality.

“A lot of it is dependent on how tapped the grid already is in that area,” Mangin said. “We’re trying to get ahead of it.”

Waste haulers and vehicle manufacturers alike have been reluctant to support strict regulations requiring zero emission vehicle adoption. But Mangin said those parties will have to work together alongside utilities in order to facilitate a complete transition.

The rollback of Advanced Clean Fleets and less stringent but still ambitious federal programs have made the development of suitable zero-emission vehicles murkier, she said.

“If manufacturers aren’t pushing to meet those requirements, there is concern that market availability isn’t going to progress as quickly as we’d like and as we’d hope,” Mangin said.

She said Recology wanted to remain aligned with “the spirit of and intent of those regulations,” even if they are no longer in effect. Removing their mandate may also give Recology more flexibility to align with manufacturers. Instead of scrambling to meet a deadline, the hauler could be driven more by market development, vehicle replacement schedules and utility and infrastructure deployment, Mangin said.

Prospects for fuel cell vehicles also remain uncertain. Recology was the first waste company to pilot a hydrogen fuel cell refuse vehicle developed by Hyzon in partnership with New Way Trucks. But Hyzon announced it would shutter months after the pilot, and received shareholder approval to liquidate earlier this year.

Mangin said she remains hopeful that another company can step into the void left by Hyzon’s collapse. But the manufacturer’s troubles are emblematic of the central issue with a transition — the heavy-duty vehicles that can offer a 1-to-1 replacement for Recology’s existing fleet have not arrived, and may not for another five years or more, Recology and CTE found.

“At the end of the day, we can only make a transition happen if there are vehicles out there that meet our needs,” Mangin said. “It just shows that a lot of things have to fall into place for a transition of this size to be successful.”",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/nqKQ6x7D-ZXBVuuz_lfZZqGASnDXUR7VlRxXhwZsnUg/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9SRUNfSENfODUzNV9GX3Jzel8xNi05LmpwZw==.webp,N,,2025-11-26 03:58:32.582656

View the ad here.

Starting today, North Carolina citizens in three media markets will begin to see a new slate of television advertisements touting the work of Senator Kay Hagan and her support of clean energy, jobs and clean air policies that protect public health. The North Carolina ad is part of a multi-million dollar clean energy and public health campaign to thank Congressional leaders for taking leadership roles on these important issues.

The Southern Alliance for Clean Energy (SACE) is joining forces with leading local and national organizations to show their support, and the support of their millions of members, for these courageous Congressional leaders, including Senator Hagan. SACE will sponsor the North Carolina series of ads, thanking Senator Hagan for protecting North Carolinians from dangerous air pollution. The ads take on the big polluters who have spent millions criticizing the Senator for standing up for clean air and children’s health. They hope it will encourage other clean energy and clean air champions in Congress to step up. The ads are among the first this year to highlight the need for clean energy and clean air solutions and leaders who support them.

“Big polluters are spending big to convince people that clean energy investments, and those that support them, are bad. They are doing on North Carolina’s airwaves what they do to our land, air and water every day: spreading poisonous attacks against Senator Hagan and we are here to fight back,” said Stephen Smith, Executive Director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy. “Kay Hagan knows we can support our businesses and protect public health from dangerous air pollution; we don’t have to choose. We can do both and live in safer communities while growing our economy.”

Another component of the overall national campaign is six-figure digital ad campaign as well as a robust organizing plan for North Carolina and 10 other states including Maine, New Hampshire, Pennsylvania, Virginia, North Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Colorado, Minnesota, Montana and Iowa. Organizers on the ground will work with local leaders, businesses, activists and elected officials to highlight the need for taking action to support clean energy and cut carbon pollution. Most of the major leading environmental groups are participants along with local partners like SACE. The activity in these states will occur throughout the remainder of the year and will be supported by groups including Environment America, Natural Resources Defense Council, Sierra Club, National Wildlife Federation, Earthjustice, Environmental Defense Fund and others.

(December 21, 2011) – Today the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced a life-saving rule to limit mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from coal-fired power plants. EPA estimates that these new standards will prevent 90 percent of the mercury emitted by coal plants from being released to the air. The Southeast is home to almost 300 coal-burning units that can collectively emit more than 20,000 pounds of mercury into the air in a single year. In terms of positive impact on human health and the environment, this rule represents perhaps the most important clean air announcement since the Clean Air Act Amendments in 1990 because it is estimated to prevent more than 100,000 asthma attacks, over 4,000 heart attacks and up to 11,000 premature deaths each year. The rule will also provide $3-$9 in benefits for every $1 spent on compliance and will create 46,000 short-term and 8,000 long-term American jobs. In the Southeast alone it will provide up to $22 billion in benefits. Dr. Stephen A. Smith, executive director of the Southern Alliance for Clean Energy had the following statement in regards to this new rule: “Coal-fired power is one of our dirtiest and highest risk choices for electricity. We are pleased that EPA has taken the necessary steps, although long overdue, to finalize a strong rule limiting mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from coal plants. The oldest and dirtiest coal plants continue to operate because they have been ‘cheap’ for utilities. However, when you fully account for the health and environmental costs as well as the barrier that these plants create for innovative new technologies like energy efficiency and renewable energy, coal plants are actually extraordinarily expensive for citizens. “This rule gives Southeastern utilities, who have made the choice to heavily rely on coal, an important opportunity to evaluate the economics of their coal fleets. The evidence shows that multiple economic factors, independent of this new EPA rule, are already calling into question running old, inefficient coal plants. The cost of coal is poised to increase even as the cost of alternative fuel decreases. Aging plants are more expensive to maintain and they generate electricity less efficiently. The new mercury rule will drive operators of old coal plants to fully consider all of these economic factors and either clean up or shut the units down.

Citizens Energy outlines plan to supply Lebanon from Indianapolis water sources

Eagle Creek Reservoir, known for its beauty and natural resources, contains about 8 billion gallons of water, Citizens said. The utility currently withdraws about 10 million gallons a day; the program could raise that to 11 to 13 million gallons per day.

""The program as a whole includes a couple of different expansions to different intakes on sources, but it's also about being able to move the water around,” Ben Easley, a spokesperson for Citizens Energy Group, said.

Members of the Eagle Creek Park Advisory Committee said they first learned about a proposed pipe and plant expansion from people who live near Eagle Creek. It came after they got letters in the mail letting them know that their land would have pipelines going through it. While the additional volume Citizens says it will take is not a huge increase, council members worry it could still have major impacts on the ecosystem and the overall water supply.

""One of the biggest concerns that we have is clearly there is a plan that they are acting on, and decisions have been made, we don't know what that plan is,” Lou Ann Baker with the Eagle Creek Park Advisory Committee said.

""We fear that dramatic changes to the withdraw or influx of water here will have an impact on the ecosystem,” Martin Risch, a member of the Eagle Creek Park Advisory Committee and a retired hydrologist, said.

One unanswered question is where the 25 million gallons of water will go each day. State Sen. J.D. Ford, who represents the area at the Statehouse, said he hopes Citizens Energy or Lebanon Utilities will be more transparent.

""We can generate electricity, but we can't really generate water, right?” Sen. Ford said. “This is a precious commodity. It's a valuable resource, and we need to be strategic about that. ""

Residents said they hope Citizens Energy Group will hold a town hall to discuss how the expansion will affect the community and the regional water supply. Sen.

By SBE Council at 25 November, 2025, 1:25 pm

by Raymond J. Keating –

Even while facing challenges and uncertainties, the resiliency of U.S. entrepreneurs, businesses and workers is something that all Americans should be grateful for this Thanksgiving, and throughout the rest of the year.

Consider energy production. During the first 25 years of this century, few industries have experienced such wild risks and uncertainties when it comes to public policies – such as swinging between formidable regulatory hostility to more friendly regulatory measures; between tax increases and tax relief; and between free trade and increased costs from protectionism. Nonetheless, the industry has been resilient and pushed forward with innovation, investment and production.

The U.S. Energy Information Administration (EIA) recently served up data making clear the ongoing strength of U.S. energy production.

For example, it recently reported that Alaska crude oil production is expected to increase notably: “After decades of decline, we expect a 13% (55,000 b/d) increase in Alaska oil production, the largest annual increase since the 1980s.” Investments in two major projects on Alaska’s North Slope – the Nuna project and the Pikka Phase 1 project – were identified as the sources for this turnaround.

In addition, the U.S. lead in natural gas production was highlighted, with the EIA pointing out that the U.S. “has been the world’s largest producer of natural gas since 2009.” In fact, the U.S. produced “75% more than the world’s second-largest natural gas producer, Russia, in 2023.” And three U.S. regions rank “among the top 10 natural gas-producing areas in the world when ranked independently against other natural gas-producing countries” – the Appalachia region, in the northeastern United States; the Permian region, in Texas and New Mexico; and the Haynesville region, in Texas, Louisiana, and Arkansas. (See the following chart from the EIA.)

As SBE Council has noted before, it’s critical to keep in mind that the U.S. energy sector is all about small business. America’s energy sectors are overwhelmingly populated by small businesses – often the drivers of innovation – as noted in the following breakdowns of employer firms by firm size in various sectors:

It’s essential for all Americans, including our elected officials, to understand the importance of U.S. energy production. After all, energy production is foundational to all other industries, from heating and cooling homes to personal and commercial transportation to investments and expansion of our high-tech economy, including AI, and beyond.

Thankfully, policies have moved in a direction that is supportive of America’s energy sector, which will help make our energy supply more abundant and affordable.

It would make sense for elected officials to come together in a bipartisan manner in support of an agenda that’s foundational to energy investment and innovation, especially low taxes; light, consistent regulation; and free trade.",https://sbecouncil.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/American-energy-e1564575158953.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 22:58:49.886925

The resulting company will keep the name Duke Energy, and will become the largest utility in the United States, serving approximately 7.1 million electric customers in the Carolinas, Florida, Indiana, Kentucky and Ohio.

Southern Alliance for Clean Energy Executive Director Dr. Stephen Smith has the following remarks about the merger:

While it is too early to fully understand the implications the Duke -Progress merger will have on the environment and energy policy, SACE is generally positive about the merger. We have a long history of interacting with both companies in the Carolinas, and with Progress in Florida as well.

SACE is generally supportive of both companies’ commitments to retiring old, dirty, inefficient coal-fired power plants, though we believe that there is more work to be done. We are hopeful in this merger that Duke and Progress can work to solidify their coal-fired power plant retirement commitments and look for even more opportunities to decrease their reliance on coal.

Over the past year, SACE has developed a good relationship working with Duke on their energy efficiency programs in the Carolinas. We have, however, been disappointed in Progress Energy’s efficiency policies in Florida.

We would like to see Duke’s more favorable position on energy efficiency and renewable energy become the direction that the new company takes, but this is yet to be determined. We remain hopeful that the new Duke Energy will take a proactive position on reducing environmental impacts, particularly carbon dioxide emissions.

We also look forward to regulatory review of this merger proposal, as it will offer a renewed focus on the degree to which positive programs such as energy efficiency benefit customers. That review will also provide a reminder of the financial and environmental risks associated with Duke’s insistence on new coal generation and both utilities’ excessive pushes for nuclear energy over more cost effective and safer alternatives.",https://cleanenergy.org/wp-content/uploads/cropped-sace-favicon-32x32.png,N,,2025-11-26 11:07:13.545510

Saline Township residents speak out over proposed data center

He and his wife, Tammi, said they moved to the countryside for peace and quiet. But they say that way of life is under threat by the proposed data center.

A developer wants to build the structure on nearby farmland. In a perfect world, the Bruneaus said the idea would just go away.

Their concerns range from a drop in property values, to noise and ground pollution. Another concern is the potential impact on their energy bill.

“At the very least, we need to have guarantees from DTE that this is not going to affect our bills five, 10 years down the line,” Tammi Bruneau said.

DTE is asking the Michigan Public Service Commission to fast track the approval process to provide power to the proposed data center.

But Tuesday morning, environmental experts and state officials including Michigan's attorney general came together to demand more transparency.

“We can regulate these entities responsibly and therefore, we have an obligation to do so, but we can’t claim responsibility and fair regulation if we’re starting out with all these shortcuts,” Dana Nessel, Michigan’s attorney general, said.

As Nessel explained, DTE filed what’s known as an ex parte application with the MPSC. Basically, an ex parte application means no one can challenge what DTE is seeking to do.

Nessel said DTE claims the application should be granted because no one will be impacted by rate hikes. It’s a notion some residents 7 News Detroit talked to don’t believe.

“My concern is that it appears as though the commission is under extraordinary political and industry pressure to ram through these special contracts for DTE without any public discovery, despite the fact that all our other organizations have been sounding the alarm for nearly a month that these massive contracts have the potential to shape energy policy for decades to come,” Nessel said.

7 News Detroit reached out to the MPSC. The commission, which is now going to host a virtual public hearing next Wednesday, Dec. 3, declined to comment.

It’s a daily reminder that the highway network is saturated, and clever policies such as limiting truck traffic during peak hours, while helpful on the margins, cannot resolve a structural capacity problem.
Those delays flow directly into freight transportation costs, which ultimately show up in household budgets.
Today, long-distance rail shipments must often pass across multiple carriers, adding interchange delays, extra handling and fragmented visibility.
A unified rail network, if properly regulated and responsibly executed, can help get us there.","The U.S. transportation system is being pushed beyond the limits of what it was built to handle. Freight volumes continue climbing, supply chains are more time-sensitive, and our roads — long the backbone of domestic commerce—are increasingly defined by congestion and delay.

Anyone who driving the New Jersey Turnpike, the D.C. Beltway, I-40 across Tennessee, or California’s I-405 has experienced it: Occupying every lane are heavy 18-wheelers and delivery trucks, slow-motion rolling blockades as two tractor-trailers crawl side-by-side for miles. It’s a daily reminder that the highway network is saturated, and clever policies such as limiting truck traffic during peak hours, while helpful on the margins, cannot resolve a structural capacity problem.

The economic consequences are real. According to the 2025 Urban Mobility Report from the Texas A&M Transportation Institute, Americans lost an average of 63 hours to traffic delays in 2024, with a national cost exceeding $269 billion. Those delays flow directly into freight transportation costs, which ultimately show up in household budgets. Whether it appears in the prices of groceries, medicine, building materials or manufactured goods, congestion is a hidden tax on consumers.

The core funding mechanism for our highways has also eroded. The Congressional Research Service reports that federal gasoline and diesel taxes have lost roughly 73% of their purchasing power since 1993. That loss has compounded deferred maintenance and contributed to growing pressure on the Highway Trust Fund. Public dollars are stretched thin at the same moment that system demands are rising.

I have seen these pressures from multiple vantage points: as a federal regulator, as someone who has run a motor carrier, and as an adviser on infrastructure strategy. Fragmented freight networks, unpredictable travel times and siloed infrastructure investment all translate into higher costs and reduced national competitiveness. Meeting today’s challenges requires more than simply widening roads. It demands smarter traffic management, targeted new capacity, expanded P3 delivery models, improved freight logistic, and more efficient ways to move long-haul freight.

One option now before regulators could help address part of this equation: the proposed combination of Union Pacific and Norfolk Southern. If approved, the deal would create the nation’s first single-system, truly coast-to-coast freight railroad, spanning more than 50,000 route-miles across 43 states and reaching roughly 100 ports, according to independent reporting from Reuters.

Today, long-distance rail shipments must often pass across multiple carriers, adding interchange delays, extra handling and fragmented visibility. A unified network could eliminate many of those friction points, cutting days off cross-country runs, improving reliability and offering shippers a seamless experience more comparable to trucking—without drawing on taxpayer funds. Shifting even a portion of the heaviest freight back to rail would also reduce highway wear, ease the driver-shortage burden and lower emissions and crash exposure per ton-mile.

Nevertheless, this is not an argument for rail at the expense of trucking. Trucks remain indispensable for first- and last-mile delivery and for much of America’s freight. A healthier, more balanced system benefits both modes. And I understand the concerns of those who lived through past mergers that produced service slowdowns, job losse, or consolidation of local rail facilities. Those concerns are not hypothetical.

Critics also raise real competitive issues: the risk of reduced choice for captive shippers, potential rate pressure and the possibility that a single mega-network could amplify service disruptions. Short line railroads worry about fair access. Communities worry about job impacts. Labor wants assurance that service improvements are not achieved through workforce cuts that compromise safety.

These issues deserve a direct response. The Surface Transportation Board should condition any approval on enforceable service quality metrics, strong gateway protections, guaranteed short line interchange access, transparent pricing and clear penalties for service failures. These guardrails are essential, not optional, to ensure competition is preserved and shippers benefit from the efficiencies promised.

If those protections are in place, the merger represents a rare opportunity: a substantial infusion of private capital into the backbone of the U.S. freight system at a moment when public resources cannot fully keep pace. Railroads have privately owned infrastructure, and strategic private investment relieves pressure on taxpayer-funded roads while strengthening national supply chain resilience.

Ultimately, the goal is not to pick winners. It is to let the market move freight on the mode best suited to the job, freeing highways for the trips that truly require them, improving safety and ensuring U.S. goods can move at the speed demanded by a competitive global economy. A unified rail network, if properly regulated and responsibly executed, can help get us there.",https://www.hudson.org/sites/default/files/styles/open_graph/public/2025-11/GettyImages-2227594838.jpg?h=de1f980b&itok=4mzLPC4T,N,,2025-11-26 04:59:27.441860

“Even if the EPA wants to allow coal power plants to further delay cleaning up their coal ash ponds, that is a clear violation of the law,” said Mychal Ozaeta, Earthjustice senior attorney.
“The courts have ruled that they cannot continue to put toxic coal ash into holding ponds that are leaking toxic contaminants into groundwater.
The longer industry fails to take action to control its toxic coal ash, the more toxic waste enters our water, and the more difficult cleanup becomes.
“Coal power companies have been letting unlined coal ash ponds leak toxic pollutants into nearby water in violation of the law for more than a decade,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel at Earthjustice.","—

Today the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a proposal to further delay closure deadlines for coal ash ponds at 11coal power plants for three years and allow these power plants to apply to continue operating past their planned retirement dates. All of these unlined coal ash ponds are known to be leaking toxic pollutants such as arsenic, lead, mercury, and radium into surrounding groundwater.

The EPA’s proposed revisions would allow these 11 coal power plants to burn coal until October 2031 and continue to dump toxic coal ash into unlined ponds, most of which contain more than a million cubic yards of toxic waste held back by decades-old earthen or ash berms.

“Even if the EPA wants to allow coal power plants to further delay cleaning up their coal ash ponds, that is a clear violation of the law,” said Mychal Ozaeta, Earthjustice senior attorney. “The courts have ruled that they cannot continue to put toxic coal ash into holding ponds that are leaking toxic contaminants into groundwater. None of these power plants are able to qualify for these extensions, regardless of what the EPA says.”

Federal safeguards in place since 2015 (the Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Rule) required all unlined coal ash ponds to cease receiving waste by April 11, 2021 and begin closure and cleanup of the toxic pollution. Five years ago, these 11 power plants applied for exemptions to closure requirements under a rule established during the first Trump Administration for coal power plants that were set to retire by October 2028 (Part A extensions 40 CFR 257.103(f)(1) and (2)). To qualify, they had to demonstrate, among other things, that no alternative ash disposal capacity was available; potential risks to human health and the environment from the coal ash pond are mitigated; and the facility is in compliance with all other CCR Rule safeguards, including the requirement to clean up contaminated groundwater.

The EPA has never approved any power plant’s application for this extension, but the filing of these applications allows the plants to continue dumping until the extension date is reached or an EPA determination is issued. If approved, the proposal issued today by the EPA would allow the continued operation of unlined coal ash ponds for at least an additional 13 years after a D.C. Circuit decision in 2018 requiring their closure.

The longer industry fails to take action to control its toxic coal ash, the more toxic waste enters our water, and the more difficult cleanup becomes.

“Coal power companies have been letting unlined coal ash ponds leak toxic pollutants into nearby water in violation of the law for more than a decade,” said Lisa Evans, senior counsel at Earthjustice. “In 2023, the EPA designated coal ash a national enforcement priority, but now this EPA is asking coal power companies how long they would like to continue dumping toxic coal ash into dangerous unlined ponds.”

Background

Earthjustice represents communities across the U.S. that have fought for years to hold coal-fired power plant operators responsible for their reckless disposal and storage of coal ash.

An Earthjustice lawsuit compelled the EPA to adopt its first-ever safeguards to protect people from toxic coal ash in 2015, but the rule excluded landfills and waste piles that stopped receiving coal ash before the rule went into effect. As a result of our litigation, the Legacy Coal Combustion Residuals (CCR) Surface Impoundment Rule extended federal monitoring and cleanup requirements to hundreds of older coal ash landfills and ponds across the country. In July of 2025, Trump’s EPA announced that it intends to extend compliance deadlines for monitoring and cleaning up coal ash, effectively allowing coal plant owners to stall clean up beyond 2030, and will issue a new Legacy Coal Ash Rule in January of 2026.

Coal ash is a toxic mix of hazardous pollutants, metals, carcinogens, and neurotoxins, including arsenic, boron, cobalt, chromium, lead, lithium, mercury, molybdenum, radium, selenium, and other heavy metals. These have been linked to cancer, heart and thyroid disease, reproductive failure, and neurological harm. Coal ash is disproportionately located in low-income communities and communities of color.",https://earthjustice.org/wp-content/uploads/earthjustice-logo-1200-1.png,N,,2025-11-25 21:00:12.817118

This Clean Economy Works (CEW) analysis is part of E2’s ongoing monthly tracking of large-scale clean energy project announcements, cancellations, closures, and downsizes across the United States. This analysis monitors private-sector investment in clean energy manufacturing, generation, and grid infrastructure projects since federal energy tax credits were passed in August 2022. The tracking excludes projects that began, were proposed, sited, or in anyway began development prior to the IRA, as well as those funded entirely by federal sources or lacking specific geographic data. CEW measures key indicators including investment value, job creation or losses, project types (manufacturing, generation, research and development), and distribution by sector, state, and congressional district.

Since 2025, this analysis began to include all project cancellations, closures, and downsizings going back to August 2022 due to rising business uncertainty about the future of U.S. clean energy policy, culiminating in the rollback and restriction of energy tax credits included in the federal tax and spending bill passed in July 2025. E2’s methodology excludes temporary delays or ownership transfers that do not impact production capacity. E2’s tracking of cancelled and closed projects includes developments that may not have been counted as an announcement because they had been proposed, announced, broken ground, or opened prior to August 2022.

This dataset provides a comprehensive look at the evolving U.S. clean energy economy—highlighting the impact of federal policy changes, supply chain dynamics, and market shifts on America’s clean energy workforce and investment pipeline.

Overview

E2’s latest analysis finds that that companies canceled, closed or downsized nine major clean energy projects in October (including one disclosed on Sept. 30) that would have otherwise resulted in more than $4.4 billion in economic investments and an estimated 8,700 new jobs. During the same month, only one new project was announced, a battery storage operation in Pennsylvania.

Year-to-date through October 2025, companies have canceled, closed, or scaled back 51 large-scale clean energy projects, according to analysis by E2 of projects tracked by E2 and the Clean Economy Tracker. The cancelation of these projects represent the loss of nearly $28.8 billion in private investment in new factories and projects nationwide, nearly 30,000 new jobsthat were previously announced.

The findings emphasize the rising risk and uncertainty to the U.S. economy – and future energy supplies – as the overall trajectory of clean energy projects continues to slow sharply amid policy challenges and new federal roadblocks to clean energy development.

Cancellation Findings

Project cancellations and downsizing accelerated significantly through October, reflecting growing uncertainty in the clean energy sector and a sharp pullback from manufacturers that had previously committed major capital investments. The abandoned projects—including high-impact electric vehicle, battery, and solar factories and other projects—represent substantial economic losses to states, workers, and communities that had been preparing for long-term industrial growth.

Nine recent project abandonments and downsizes in October include the loss of more than $4.4 billionin investments and at least 8,700 previously announced jobs at major EV, battery and other clean energy related facotires in Mississippi, Tennessee, Michigan, and Ohio and elsewhere.

Nissan (MS)– 2,000 jobs lost; $500M abandoned (9/30)

Enchem (TN)– 190 jobs lost; $152.5M abandoned (10/1)

General Motors (OH)– 1,520 jobs lost; $760M abandoned (10/2)

GAF Energy (CA)– 138 jobs lost; R&D facility closed (10/15)

Gotion (MI)– 2,350 jobs lost; $2.36B abandoned (10/24)

GM (MI)downsizing – 1,200 jobs impacted; investment reduction not disclosed (10/29)

GM/LG Energy Solution (OH)downsizing – 550 jobs impacted; investment reduction not disclosed (10/29)

Xalt Energy (MI)– 550 jobs lost; $600M abandoned (10/31)

Dana (MI)– 200 jobs lost; $54.2M abandoned (10/21)

Fifty-one large-scale clean energy projectshave been canceled, closed, or downsized in 2025—more than any previous year since the IRA passed. These projects were expected to create 29,944 new jobs and included $28.77 billion in planned investments that are now lost.

Manufacturing facilitiesaccount for nearly all losses—accounting for 45 of the 51 projects abandoned in 2025 and over 29,000 jobs and $24.2 billion in investment lost.

EV and battery/storage projects continue to drive the majority of cancellations:24 EV projects and 25 battery/storage projects have been abandoned since 2025

Republican congressional districtshave experienced the greatest economic fallout: 37 canceled projects, 21,916 lost jobs, and $16.9 billion in abandoned investments compared with 24 projects, 13,248 jobs, and $9.9 billion in lost investment in Democratic-held districts, and 13 projects, 4,378 jobs, and $4.6 billion in lost investment where the specific district is yet to be the determined.

Announcement Findings

Just a single new clean energy project announcement was made in October, the lowest number since E2 began tracking announcements in August 2022:

Eos Energy Storage (PA)– Battery/storage manufacturing plant expected to create 1,000 jobs and result in $352.9 million in investments.

Since E2 began tracking projects in August 2022, companies have announced a total of 417 major clean energy manufacturing, generation, and grid projectsacross 42 states and Puerto Rico. These announced projects represent 124,241 planned jobs and about $132.33 billion in total investment.

Context and Implications

The latest CEW data shows that the U.S. clean energy economy is entering a period of instability driven largely by shifting federal policies, new federal roadblocks to clean energy development and the rollback of clean energy tax incentives. The acceleration of cancellations in October and throughout 2025 signals that this momentum is increasingly fragile.

The implications extend beyond the clean energy sector: these projects represent some of the largest new manufacturing investments in decades, often located in rural or historically industrial communities. As policy instability increases, so does the risk that these regions will not only lose out on once-in-a-generation opportunities, but be able ever to regain the ground lost.

The stakes are high. The trajectory of cancellations this year is an early warning indicator: Without durable policy commitment, the U.S. could forfeit both the economic and strategic benefits of global leadership in the energy sector.

About this Analysis

Announcements

Projects that began development, were proposed, or applied for local and state approval before the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) are not included. This analysis also does not include investments in which the federal government has provided financial resources for the complete project, lease sales, projects in which an announcement was made but lacked specific geographic information, etc. Details on projects came from news reports on new and related projects; press releases from companies announcing new developments; and government announcements.

Cancellations, Closures, Downsizes

This tracking includes all projects, plants, operations, or expansions that were cancelled or closed since passage of the IRA in August 2022. This does not include announced layoffs that are not associated with a project downsizing unless there is a stated decease in production output. This list also does not include the transfer of project ownership, if production will continue under the new ownership, power purchasing agreements, or other similar type of announcements. Project delays or idling of facilities are not included unless there in an announced decrease in production or investment or unless the project will need to be restarted to proceed in the future.

Once published in the Federal Register, the proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days.","Key Points

The U.S. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers released a joint proposal updating the definition of “Waters of the United States,” which will be open for public comment after its official publishing in the Federal Register.

The proposed rule would narrow the definition of Waters of the United States and include exclusions for determining whether waters and wetlands are subject to permitting under the federal Clean Water Act.

While viewed as a significant deregulation that could impact sensitive environments throughout the United States, the proposed rule’s deregulatory impact in California would be more limited, given California’s broader regulation of Waters of the State under the Porter-Cologne Water Quality Control Act.

On November 17, 2025, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers together announced a proposed rule updating the definition of Waters of the United States (WOTUS), in another effort to align with the Supreme Court’s Sackett decision.

As we previously discussed, the WOTUS rule was revised twice under the Biden administration, once in March 2023 to update the definition prior to the Sackett decision, and again in August 2023 to conform to Sackett by eliminating the “significant nexus” test that the decision invalidated.

This most recent revision defines key terms for determining which waters are subject to the Clean Water Act, such as “relatively permanent,” “continuous surface connection,” and “tributary.” It also addresses key exclusions by adding an exclusion for groundwater and clarifying pre-existing exclusions for ditches, prior converted cropland, and waste treatment systems. The EPA published a fact sheet on its website that covers the most notable of these proposed changes.

This proposed rule’s effect, if finalized, will have less of a deregulatory effect in California than in other states, however, given California’s expanded regulation of “Waters of the State” through the Porter-Cologne Act. The Porter-Cologne Act leaves few, if any, California waters unregulated. If anything, this narrowing of the scope of WOTUS may increase regulatory complexity in California by requiring, in some instances, that regulated entities obtain a Waste Discharge Requirements permit under the Porter-Cologne Act rather than a general permit available under the Clean Water Act. Individual permits under the Porter-Cologne Act may lead to a more burdensome review process compared to permitting under sections 404 & 401 of the federal Clean Water Act. Under those provisions of the Clean Water Act, the Regional Water Quality Control Boards’ review and permitting process is more streamlined.

Once published in the Federal Register, the proposed rule will be open for public comment for 45 days. The EPA’s pre-publication notice advises that the rule will appear on the Government Printing Office’s govinfo website and on Regulations.gov in Docket No. EPA-HQ-OW-2025-0322.

The EPA is accepting public comments on its more limited federal water protections through Jan. 5th.","A large portion of wetlands in the Mountain West could lose federal protections under a new proposal from the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). But a couple of states in the region are working to build their own safeguards.

On Nov. 17, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin and the Army Corps of Engineers announced a proposal for a narrowed definition of “Waters of the United States” (WOTUS), the designation that determines which rivers, streams and wetlands qualify for protection under the Clean Water Act.

Under the proposal, wetlands would be excluded unless they are connected to other protected waters and hold surface water for part of the year. The definition also removes protections for interstate waters “to make clear that such waters no longer gain jurisdiction by simply crossing state lines.”

Industry groups praised the proposal for cutting red tape.

“Today's WOTUS announcement finally acknowledges that the federal government should work to protect lakes, rivers and oceans, rather than regulating ditches and ponds on family farms and ranches,” said Mary-Thomas Hart, chief counsel for the National Cattlemen’s Beef Association, in a statement.

The EPA said the changes align with a 2023 U.S. Supreme Court decision. In Sackett v. EPA, an Idaho couple who built a house near a lake prevailed when the Court ruled that the agency had improperly labeled their property a protected wetland.

But Stu Gillespie, a staff attorney for Earthjustice in Denver, said the current proposal would go beyond what the Sackett ruling required.

“It would essentially limit jurisdiction to just the main navigable rivers, their tributaries and a couple wetlands, if that,” he said. “It would be a massive rollback of Clean Water Act protections that no one has even contemplated until now.”

Gillespie said the impacts would be severe for critical wetlands and streams in the arid West, many of which are seasonal or fed by groundwater.

“A lot of our water bodies are intermittent, or even ephemeral, and you don't always have that continuous [surface] connection,” he said.

According to an EPA analysis, only an estimated 3% of wetlands in Colorado have surface water part of the year. The agency has not responded to clarify the impacts of the proposal.

States create their own backstops

Two Mountain West states—New Mexico and Colorado—are developing their own systems to protect waters that have lost federal oversight.

Colorado Gov. Jared Polis signed the “first-in-the-nation” bipartisan law last year to protect the state’s surface waters, saying it would fill the regulatory gap left by the Sackett decision. New Mexico passed a similar bill this year.

Colorado’s law established a new permitting program within the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment. It will regulate the removal of sediment from, or filling in, streams, rivers and wetlands, including waters no longer protected under the Clean Water Act.

A state commission is now hammering out the details through rulemaking. A hearing is scheduled for Dec. 8-10, and a committee has until the end of the year to finalize the rules.

Gillespie, who is representing environmental and community groups in the rulemaking process, said the Water Quality Control Commission’s current proposal is promising but leaves some areas vulnerable.

“There are a lot of interests out there, particularly industry groups, that are trying to weaken the regulation,” he said. “Some of them are trying to take a sledgehammer to it to really undermine the program.”

Environmental groups are particularly concerned that wetlands near ditches or canals won’t be covered. That exclusion, they estimate in prehearing documents, would leave roughly 500,000 acres of the state’s wetlands unprotected.

On the other hand, some industry groups worry the commission may expand the program beyond what they believe the legislature intended.

“We want to see a program that adheres as closely as possible to the statutory framework agreed upon, which really represents the compromise of the vast range of water users,” said Adam Eckman, the President and CEO of the Colorado Mining Association.

He disagrees with environmental groups who want projects to undergo a “public interest” review, weighing the benefits and harms of a project, before receiving permits. Such reviews would be nebulous and beyond the scope of the program, he said.which he said would be nebulous and open-ended.

Amid slower demand and federal policy changes deprioritizing electrification, the industry is shedding jobs and delaying or canceling projects. In fact, 2025 has seen more clean energy manufacturing investments canceled than announced—a stark change from just a few years ago, when the US was on the cusp of an EV and battery manufacturing boom.

But some industry analysts say that despite some very real pain in the short term, the future remains bright for zero-emissions vehicles. In the meantime, buckle up for a bumpy ride.

Loren McDonald, CEO and chief analyst at Chargeonomics, compared today’s EV market to the early days of cellular technology.

“What history has told us now is we were actually in the BlackBerry phase, and still are. The product is good, but it’s not compelling enough for average consumers,” he said. “We haven’t actually reached the phase with the product that’s more like the iPhone, where everybody goes, ‘Oh my God, I need to have an EV, it’s so much better than my gas car.’”

Pump the brakes

In October, General Motors said it planned to indefinitely lay off 1,750 workers and temporarily lay off another 1,670 as it trims EV and battery production at plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. Part of the plan includes temporarily idling GM’s Factory Zero plant in Detroit, which produces multiple EVs, and then resuming production with only one shift, according to InsideEVs. The production pause at two EV battery plants is slated to last until mid-2026.

“In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said. “Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our US manufacturing footprint.”

EV maker Rivian also recently announced 600 job cuts, with CEO RJ Scaringe reportedly telling employees: “With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.”

And as The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, Ford is considering cutting its electric F-150 Lightning amid weak sales and mounting losses in its EV business. The WSJ also noted Stellantis’s canceled plans for an electric version of its full-size Ram pickup truck earlier this year and sluggish sales of Tesla’s Cybertruck.

Freudenberg e-Power Systems recently announced the closure of two EV battery plants in Michigan, resulting in 324 layoffs, The Hill reported; company leaders cited “the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America.”

Rest of World published an analysis in September reporting that more than 30,000 workers had lost their jobs at EV manufacturers “and related industries worldwide over the past year” amid trade policy changes, weaker growth, geopolitical tensions, higher interest rates, and a more competitive market.

Research firm Atlas Public Policy, in partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund, recently tallied total cancellations representing nearly $21 billion in investments in clean energy manufacturing in the first three quarters of 2025. Battery projects have taken the biggest hit: 11% of announced projects were scrapped, mostly this year.

One bright spot: The authors noted that about four-fifths of active investments were under construction or operational, and Q3 had net positive investments. Since 2000, the clean energy manufacturing sector has drawn nearly $250 billion in investments, most announced since mid-2021, during Joe Biden’s presidency.

“Since 2021, the United States has experienced an unprecedented clean energy manufacturing boom, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to communities across the country,” according to the report. “However, the first nine months of 2025 have seen a stark change. Trump administration policies and cuts to clean energy tax credits have slowed growth considerably and threatened progress.”

The pullback comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill, which set Sept. 30 as the expiration date for federal tax credits on certain EV purchases. Atlas analysts pointed to “funding cuts and policy shifts” as the driving forces behind “cancellations of $20.8 billion and nearly 27,300 anticipated manufacturing jobs in 2025 alone.”

“When we think about the cancellations, it’s numbers for sure, but also this has a negative impact on communities that were anticipating preparing for economic opportunities from these clean energy projects, whether it was through the anticipated jobs themselves, maybe workforce development programs that the company and the community had agreed to establish,” Matthew Vining, a policy analyst at Atlas, told us.

Idling

If this all sounds bleak for the prospect of carbon-free transportation, some industry analysts view it as a short-term correction. What’s really happening, McDonald contended, is more complicated than just the fallout of tax credits going away. He sees the recent pullback as a result of how legacy automakers approached the launch of their first-generation EVs.

“[The end of the tax credits is] a real thing, but the automakers are using it as an excuse to pull back,” he said. “It allows them to take a deep breath and go, ‘Phew, now we can focus on selling those $80,000 fully loaded gas Chevy Tahoes and things like that,’ while they actually work on building their generation two, generation three EV models that are truly compelling.”

In some cases, legacy automakers converted existing internal combustion engine vehicles to electric rather than developing new platforms from the ground up. Many are now working on next-gen EVs built on new platforms. Ford, for example, is introducing an entirely new manufacturing process to support production of a smaller, more affordable electric truck.

GM, meantime, is preparing to relaunch the mass market-oriented Chevy Bolt, and Rivian is slated to debut its more-affordable R2 lineup next year, among other upcoming launches.

As McDonald sees it, the US’s first EV phase was defined by products that didn’t match what mainstream consumers were looking for. Automakers found some success, to be sure—Rivian’s R1S in the luxury segment, for example. And half of the Cadillac brand’s sales are now electric.

But the next EV era, McDonald said, must feature mass-market EVs with lower price tags and better software experiences.

“If you get the car right, and it’s a fit with the market, and you price it correctly, there’s solid demand and market for it,” McDonald said. “We just don’t have enough of those vehicles yet. And that’s the problem—not EVs.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-11-26 01:59:22.536362

A partisan battle is shaping up as part of the massive highway-policy bill that is rewritten every few years. The last cycle started in 2021 with the passage of the bipartisan infrastructure law under former President Joe Biden, which dedicated billions of dollars for EVs and their charging networks. That cycle is ending with the Trump administration trying (but not quite succeeding) to prevent those dollars from being spent.

Now, lawmakers are starting to write a new surface transportation reauthorization bill they hope to enact by next October. And congressional Democrats are signaling they won’t play ball if EVs aren’t a priority — even if it’s hard to imagine the Trump White House suddenly embracing battery-powered cars.

In a letter to committee heads, the signers said the bill won’t move without “critical investments in zero-emission vehicles and associated charging and fueling infrastructure.”

They have some leverage. The transportation bill requires 60 votes in the Senate, meaning that it won’t move without some Democratic support.

Leading the effort are Sen. Alex Padilla (D-Calif.) and Rep. Sharice Davids (D-Kan.). Both sit on the committees that produce major portions of the bill — Padilla on the Senate’s Environment and Public Works and Davids on the House’s Transportation and Infrastructure.

The White House did not respond to a request for comment. Trump has spent years railing against Biden-era EV policies, and this year, he stripped away the industry’s consumer tax credits. Then again, he bought a Tesla.

Running out of road?

A lot of the debate comes down to infrastructure: who defines it, and who pays for it.

EV advocates argue that chargers have become basic transportation infrastructure, like concrete and steel. They point out that the last transportation bill was part of the bipartisan infrastructure law and that many EV-related dollars flowed through traditional funding channels.

“It’s clear that this is infrastructure,” said Albert Gore, executive director of the Zero Emission Transportation Association, a trade group for EV-related companies.

Republicans have a counterargument. House Transportation and Infrastructure Chair Sam Graves (R-Mo.)’s proposal is not to fund EVs but to assess fees on people who drive them.

An annual fee of $250 on EVs and $100 on hybrids, he argued earlier this month, is necessary to replenish the perpetually underfunded Highway Trust Fund. That fund pays for highway and transit improvements and is sourced from excise taxes on every gallon of gasoline and diesel sold.

“If you’re using that infrastructure, then you should be paying for it,” Graves said.

EV lobbyists say that fee is too high, citing estimates that the average traditional-car driver pays only $82 per year into the fund. Pegging the EV fee so high would be unfair and discourage EV adoption that is needed to reduce climate-warming emissions, said Bridget Sanderson, the head of the Coalition Helping America Rebuild and Go Electric, an umbrella group for EV advocates.

This infrastructure standoff raises the prospect of a horse trade: a fee on electric vehicle drivers in exchange for federal help to boost the EV ecosystem in its weak spots.

That is not outside of the realm of possibility,” Sanderson said.

Rural Michiganders face big bills after disaster-aid denial

Electric utility customers in rural northern Michigan could be on the hook for tens of millions of dollars after the Trump administration denied disaster aid following an ice storm in March, Thomas Frank writes.

The president so far has twice refused to reimburse two utilities for rebuilding the grid after the storms. They documented over $90 million in damage, nearly five times the threshold for federal aid.

“This is something nobody asked for. Our members did not want this ice storm,” said Allan Berg, the CEO of Presque Isle Electric & Gas, known as PIE&G, in northeastern Michigan. “FEMA is a federal program designed to ensure when large natural disasters occur, they can come and make the playing field level.”

No NEPA for offshore plans, Interior says

The Interior Department won’t conduct an environmental analysis it has used for decades in its five-year plan for offshore drilling, Ian M. Stevenson writes.

Interior’s Bureau of Ocean Energy Management cited two court cases last week when it called review under the National Environmental Policy Act “discretionary” in its leasing proposal released last week. The proposal for drilling from 2026 to 2031 called for including new areas off California, in the High Arctic and in the eastern Gulf of Mexico.

Per BLM, the court rulings mean approval of a five-year plan “does not constitute an irreversible and irretrievable commitment of resources and that, in the context of BOEM’s multiple stage leasing program, the obligation to fully comply with NEPA does not mature until the lease sale stage.”

An analysis by the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality shows that levels of criteria air pollutants from vehicles would also significantly increase in Mecklenburg County.
Even marginal upticks in criteria pollution could harm the county and its residents because it has little leeway in complying with air quality standards.
“These challenges could hinder the state’s ability to maintain compliance with health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards while supporting economic development,” Abraczinskas said.
The EPA asserted in its proposal that repealing greenhouse gas emission regulations would not change existing standards for criteria pollutants.","There was a time when the air pollution in Charlotte, North Carolina, was so bad that the 871-foot Bank of America Corporate Center, the city’s tallest building, topped by an ornate metal crown, wore a veil of smog.

It took years, but after North Carolina enacted more stringent regulations, the air in Charlotte, although far from pristine, has finally improved.

That hard-won accomplishment is now threatened by the Environmental Protection Agency’s proposal to repeal regulations for greenhouse gas emissions, the primary drivers of global climate change.

In July, EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin announced the agency’s intention to rescind the 2009 determination, known as the endangerment finding, that greenhouse gas emissions, like carbon dioxide and methane, harm human health and the environment. Although the EPA’s repeal would be limited to greenhouse gas regulations, it would have the effect of automatically eliminating many other emissions standards for cars and trucks.

An analysis by the N.C. Department of Environmental Quality shows that levels of criteria air pollutants from vehicles would also significantly increase in Mecklenburg County. The EPA defines criteria pollutants as ozone, lead, carbon monoxide, sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and very fine particulate matter, known as PM 2.5, which is smaller than the width of a human hair and can enter not just the lungs but also the bloodstream.

Even marginal upticks in criteria pollution could harm the county and its residents because it has little leeway in complying with air quality standards.

Mike Abraczinskas, director of the N.C. Division of Air Quality, told the Environmental Management Commission earlier this month that a state analysis showed if greenhouse gas standards for cars and trucks are eliminated, on-road emissions of four pollutants—nitrogen oxide, PM 2.5, sulfur dioxide and volatile organic compounds—in Mecklenburg County would increase by a total of 470 tons by 2035.

By 2050, annual emissions would increase by 940 tons.

The division chose Mecklenburg County for its analysis because the area is close to exceeding federal standards on ozone and PM 2.5, the latter of which is scientifically linked to heart and respiratory illness, premature birth and dementia.

“These challenges could hinder the state’s ability to maintain compliance with health-based National Ambient Air Quality Standards while supporting economic development,” Abraczinskas said.

The EPA asserted in its proposal that repealing greenhouse gas emission regulations would not change existing standards for criteria pollutants. However, the EPA acknowledged in its proposal that the repeal “could marginally impact emissions of criteria pollutants and air toxics,” but it would not have a “material adverse impact on the health of individuals with respect to non-GHG air pollutants, including on children.

Asked for further detail on the impacts of repealing the endangerment finding, an EPA spokesperson said: “Clearly you have not looked at our website. We refer you to our website where you can find the proposed rule, the draft regulatory impact analysis, and many more resources on the proposed rule.”

DEQ sent a 28-page letter to the EPA during the public comment period in September on repeal of the endangerment finding, urging the agency to withdraw the repeal. DEQ cited the state’s vulnerability to hurricanes and wildfires, which are becoming more intense because of climate change. The rollbacks would also undermine some of North Carolina’s work to achieve cleaner air.

“We are very concerned that the EPA’s proposed action will have serious impacts on North Carolina’s plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions and maintaining compliance with national ambient air quality standards,” Abraczinskas wrote.

The EPA’s timing is particularly egregious, said Jeffrey Robbins, executive director of the nonprofit group CleanAIRE NC, based in Charlotte.

Mecklenburg County plans to widen Interstate 77, the primary north-south artery through Charlotte. This would “funnel more heavy vehicle traffic directly through historically Black neighborhoods,” Robbins said. “Families in these communities will breathe this exhaust every day—in their homes, in their schools, in their places of work. Removing emissions safeguards precisely when traffic volume is increasing is an unacceptable act of environmental injustice.”

Aided by a rainy June and July, Mecklenburg County recorded zero days of exceeding the federal ozone standard this year, according to a presentation on Monday by the county’s Air Quality Commission.

But with an average of 68 parts per billion, the county remained just under the wire to comply with health-based standards for ozone of 70 parts per billion, as measured over the last three years.

Megan Green, the county’s program manager for mobile sources—cars and trucks—told the Air Quality Commission that if the EPA successfully repeals the standards, local and state governments would have to “look for other emission reduction strategies that would bring us into compliance.”

Individuals, too, could reduce their exposure to pollutants, according to Robbins of CleanAIRE NC, by combining separate errands into a single trip, using public transit, and walking or biking for short trips. Turn off the car, for example, while idling in a drive-thru or in a school pickup line.

“We cannot afford to gamble with the health and well-being of our families and communities by ending standards that have so effectively reduced dangerous pollution,” Robbins said.

The EPA has not set a date for the repeal, and first must review all 27,000 public comments it received on the proposal.",https://insideclimatenews.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Charlotte-1024x663.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:59:30.789831

Duke’s other subsidiary, Duke Energy Progress, covers much of eastern North Carolina and has a separate rate proposal.
How Duke’s profit is regulated Duke Energy does not set its own profit margin.
The company says this rate request helps recover past investments and pay for the next round of grid improvements.","GREENSBORO, N.C. — Duke Energy, the utility serving most of the Triad, has filed a proposal that could raise customer power bills beginning in 2027. The request is the first step in a lengthy regulatory process, and nothing changes for customers right now.

The company’s filing with the North Carolina Utilities Commission outlines a two-year rate increase totaling about 15%. For most households in the Triad, the proposal would increase monthly bills in two phases: roughly 10% to 11% in 2027, followed by another 3% to 4% in 2028.

Why this is only the beginning

When Duke files a rate case, the Utilities Commission reviews the request, holds hearings, takes public comment, and evaluates each project tied to the increase. That process typically takes seven to ten months. In past cases, regulators have often reduced parts of the utility’s original request before approving a final amount.

Who this affects in the Triad

Duke Energy Carolinas serves nearly all of the Piedmont Triad, including Guilford, Forsyth, Alamance, Davidson, Randolph, Rockingham, and Stokes counties. Duke’s other subsidiary, Duke Energy Progress, covers much of eastern North Carolina and has a separate rate proposal.

Why Duke says it needs the increase

According to Duke, the money would go toward replacing aging power lines, strengthening the grid during storms, installing more battery storage, and keeping up with North Carolina’s rapid population growth. The company also emphasized that data centers are not driving the increase. Duke says those large facilities pay the full cost of connecting to the grid and, because they use so much power consistently, they can actually help spread out system costs.

How Duke’s profit is regulated

Duke Energy does not set its own profit margin. As a regulated monopoly, the company’s earnings are capped by the state. The Utilities Commission sets an overall allowed rate of return, usually around 9% to 10%, on the equipment and infrastructure Duke Energy has already built. Duke only earns that return if customer rates cover the cost of those projects.

The company says this rate request helps recover past investments and pay for the next round of grid improvements.

What happens next

Public hearings on the proposal are expected to begin in the spring. Regulators will spend several months reviewing the filing before making a decision.

If the rate increase is approved, the earliest Triad customers would see a change on their bills is January 2027.",https://media.wfmynews2.com/assets/WFMY/images/e3d71521-eb0d-4a39-a79a-689b6e25397e/20251125T222445/e3d71521-eb0d-4a39-a79a-689b6e25397e_1140x641.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:03:00.363797

""Data centers, they require their own distribution networks, and in many cases require upgrades to the transmission networks.""","Energy experts say Michigan's electrical grid can handle current demand, but as more data centers set up shop, the state may need more power and updated transmission to keep the lights on.

""It's an issue that's likely to be debated by our residents and decision makers for many years and even decades to come,"" Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel said.

Data centers are often used to store the servers that hold large amounts of data and information. They can utilize large amounts of electrical power, too.

Saline Township is debating a major data center project, just like Livingston County.

""I can tell you there is tremendous concern from the community. There is tremendous concern about water use, there is tremendous concern about energy use, there's concern about wells going dry,"" Michigan Sen. Jeff Irwin said.

In Livingston County, many of those same concerns exist as well. Earlier this month, CBS News Detroit reported on the Howell Township Board approving a six-month pause on consideration of what could be one of Michigan's largest data centers on about 1,000 acres of land.

A report from the North American Electric Reliability Corporation (NERC) finds that, across the country, areas with a high number of data centers experience an increased risk of outages, especially during extreme weather.

""It's not just about building new power plants' generation. It's also about building enough transmission and distribution as well,"" Matthew Bandyk, an energy consultant with Citizens Utility Board, said.

Right now, the report finds that Michigan is not in one of the regions at an increased risk for outages, but Bandyk said that as more data center projects move forward, the grid will need improvements.

""Our electric reliability is one of the worst in the country, and most of that is due to distribution problems,"" he said.

Copyright © 2022 by Fitch Ratings, Inc., Fitch Ratings Ltd. and its subsidiaries.
However, non-NRSRO personnel may participate in determining credit ratings issued by or on behalf of the NRSRO.","Fitch Ratings-Toronto-25 November 2025:

Fitch Ratings has affirmed Xcel Energy Inc.'s Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at 'BBB+', Fitch has also affirmed the Long-Term IDRs for subsidiaries Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo), Northern States Power Company-Minnesota (NSP-Minnesota), Northern States Power Company-Wisconsin (NSP-Wisconsin) at 'A-', and Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) at 'BBB'.

The Stable Rating Outlook on Xcel and its subsidiaries reflects credit supportive capital allocation for elevated capex plan, robust wildfire risk management, and generally stable regulatory environment within its service territories.

A full list of rating actions follows at the end of this release.

Key Rating Drivers

Xcel Energy Inc.

Credit Supportive Marshall Settlement: Xcel reached a settlement in principle with all claimants related to the 2021 Marshall fire in Colorado ahead of impending trials. Under the settlement terms, Xcel's subsidiary, PSCo will pay settlement claims of $640 million, of which $350 million will be covered by insurance and $290 million absorbed by the company. This is substantially lower than prior estimates.

The Colorado insurance commissioner had estimated property damages could exceed $2 billion, with additional potential for noneconomic and punitive damages. Fitch views the settlement as a prudent risk management measure that significantly reduces uncertainty regarding wildfire liabilities and improves the company's financial risk profile.

Pressured but Improving Financial Metrics: Following the Marshall settlement in 2025, Fitch expects Xcel's financial metrics to improve starting in 2026 and stabilize around 4.8x, at the downgrade threshold, leaving virtually no headroom in its credit metrics. Fitch expects Xcel's credit metrics to improve with the regular rate case cadence, lower deferred fuel balances, credit-supportive capital allocation, and tax credits transferability.

FFO leverage was modestly elevated in the past two years, driven primarily by rate case deferrals and a large, deferred fuel balances from Winter Storm Uri. Fitch's projections reflect recovery of deferred fuel balances, currently under way, and are expected to be mostly recovered by YE 2025. Fitch projects holding company debt to remain at roughly 23% of total consolidated debt and expects equity issuances of roughly $4.5 billion from 2025-2029 to support large capex programs.

Constructive Regulatory Environment: Xcel benefits from stable earnings and operating cash flows across its key regulated utility subsidiaries. Its Minnesota and Wisconsin subsidiaries recover costs timely under multiyear rate plans and earn returns near allowed levels. While PSCo uses cost-recovery riders, its earned return-on-equity lags due to a historical test year and delayed rate case filing. Returns have improved for Southwestern Public Service Company (SPS) from constructive rate case decisions, supportive riders, and strong customer growth. Fitch expects the overall regulatory framework to remain mostly constructive, with pending rate cases assumed to achieve favorable outcomes.

Wildfire Exposure: More frequent and larger, more destructive wildfires, especially in the Western U.S., have exposed utilities in those areas to wildfire risk and increased business risk. Although Xcel has been proactive in managing wildfire risk in its service territory, including through a recently approved Colorado wildfire risk mitigation plan and Texas resiliency filing, future catastrophic wildfire activity cannot be ruled out. Xcel plans to invest about $5 billion for wildfire mitigation including $1.9 billion by PSCo in Colorado and $490 million by SPS for system resiliency plan in Texas. PSCo has reached a settlement with intervenors, and Fitch expects a final decision in 2025.

Large Capex Plan: Fitch expects consolidated capex to remain elevated over the forecast period. Fitch projects the base capex plan to total approximately $60 billion over 2026-2030, significantly higher than $27.8 billion spent in the previous five years (2020-2024). The base capex plan focuses on management's steel-for-fuel renewable energy investment strategy, with significant investments in electric transmission to connect renewable resources to the grid and distribution. Xcel's capex plan supports exiting coal generation by YE 2030. The capex also supports projected 5% demand growth over the next five years.

IRA Supports Investment Plan: The Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) allows Xcel to monetize tax credits from existing and new renewable projections more efficiently. Historically, Xcel generated more tax credits than it could utilize. With the IRA, Xcel can realize full cash flow benefits from the production tax credits in a timely manner, a credit positive. Fitch assumes that any tax code changes affecting the ability to monetize tax credits at projected levels would lead to Xcel adjusting its financial plan to support credit ratings.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: here is a parent and subsidiary linkage for Xcel. Legal ring-fencing is considered porous given the general protections afforded by economic regulation. Access and control are also evaluated as porous. Xcel centrally manages the treasury function for its utilities and is the sole source of equity. There is also a shared RCF for Xcel and its utility subsidiaries; however, each subsidiary issues its own long-term debt. Under Fitch's PSL criteria, the maximum separation between Xcel and its operating utilities' Long-Term IDRs is two notches.

Northern States Power-Minnesota

Constructive Regulation: NSP-Minnesota operates in a relatively constructive and stable regulatory environment across three states, but mainly in Minnesota. Supportive regulatory mechanisms include fuel cost and purchased power adjustments, and capital investment riders for environmental improvements, renewable generation and electric transmission.

Minnesota Electric Rate Case: In early November 2024, NSP-Minnesota filed an electric rate case in Minnesota, seeking a total revenue increase of $491 million (13.2%) over two years, based on a return on equity (ROE) of 10.3%, a 52.5% equity ratio and a rate base of $13.2 billion in 2025 and $14 billion in 2026. NSP-Minnesota also requested interim rates of $224 million, of which $192 million was approved and went into effect in January 2025. A final decision is expected in 2026. Fitch expects a rate case outcome in line with the last rate decision.

The last Minnesota-approved electric rate increase was moderately lower than expected. In June 2023, the Minnesota Public Utilities Commission (MPUC) approved a three-year rate increase of $311 million, based on a 9.25% ROE and 52.5% equity ratio. The approved ROE was below the national average, and below the 9.87% ROE and $386 million rate increase that the administrative law judge supported. NSP-Minnesota filed a request for reconsideration, which was subsequently denied by the MPUC in September 2023.

Capex Plan Supports Load Growth: NSP-Minnesota has a large capex plan that includes significant capex associated with management's steel-for-fuel renewable energy investment strategy and electric transmission, and strong expected demand growth. Fitch projects total capex of $20.1 billion over 2026-2030, compared with actual spending of $10.7 billion in 2020-2024. Total projected rate base growth is 10% CAGR over the forecast, above industry averages. Riders for certain capital investments mitigate credit pressures associated with high capex. NSP-Minnesota projects 4% annual load growth over the next five years, driven by data centers ramping up toward the end of the five-year plan.

Strong Financial Metrics: Fitch expects NSP-Minnesota's financial metrics to remain supportive of existing ratings. Fitch forecasts FFO leverage to average 3.8x through 2029. Credit metrics are supported by an assumed realization of tax benefits resulting from the IRA, as NSP-Minnesota is expected to monetize production tax credits generated by its regulated wind generation.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: There is a parent/subsidiary relationship between Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel) and NSP-Minnesota. Under Fitch's Parent/Subsidiary Linkage criteria, Fitch applies a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach. Fitch views NSP-Minnesota as stronger than Xcel due to its low-risk utility operations and solid credit metrics. Legal ring-fencing, and access and control are considered porous given the general protections afforded by economic regulation. Thus, the maximum separation between NSP-Minnesota's and Xcel's Long-Term IDRs is up to two notches.

Northern States Power-Wisconsin

Constructive Regulatory Environment: NSP-Wisconsin operates within a constructive regulatory environment overseen by the Public Service Commission of Wisconsin (PSCW). Supportive regulatory measures include an above average authorized ROE, a forward-looking test year, a purchased gas adjustment clause, and annual filings for fuel and purchased energy adjustments.

Rate Case Stayout: In June 2024, NSP-Wisconsin filed a 2025 stay-out proposal with the PSCW. The filing proposes to offset 2025 revenue deficiencies by amortizing IRA deferrals, stopping a deferral related to IRA benefits ordered in a previous rate case, and deferring revenue requirement impacts of two natural gas capital projects. PSCW approved the filing in early 2025.

Large Capex Plan: Fitch's main rating concern is the relatively large capex plan over the forecast. NSP-Wisconsin plans to spend $4 billion over 2026-2030, compared with $1.9 billion of capex spent over 2020-2024. A large share of that capex will be on electric transmission projects, which receive timely recovery of capital costs that mitigates high capex concerns. Total projected rate base growth is 13% CAGR over the forecast, which is above the industry average.

Adequate Financial Metrics: Fitch expects NSP-Wisconsin's financial metrics to remain supportive of existing ratings, despite a large capital investment plan over the forecast. Fitch forecasts funds from operations (FFO) leverage to average 4x-4.4x through 2029.

2025 Rate Case: In November 2025, the PSCW approved a ROE of 9.8% and an equity ratio of 52.5%, as well as a rate increase of approximately $68 million in 2026 and $57 million in 2027 for the electric utility, which was in line with Fitch's expectations. The PSCW also approved a $18 million rate increase in 2026 and $4.3 million in 2027 for the natural gas utility. These rate increases are based on commission's staff estimates. The new rates will be implemented on Jan. 1, 2026.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: There is a parent/subsidiary relationship between Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel) and NSP-Wisconsin. Under Fitch's Parent/Subsidiary Linkage criteria, Fitch applies a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach. Fitch views NSP-Wisconsin as stronger than Xcel due to its low-risk utility operations and solid credit metrics. Legal ring-fencing, and access and control are considered porous given the general protections afforded by economic regulation. Thus, the maximum separation between NSP-Wisonsin's and Xcel's Long-Term IDRs is up to two notches.

Public Service Company of Colorado

Credit Supportive Marshall Settlement: PSCo's holding company, Xcel reached a settlement in principle with all claimants related to the 2021 Marshall fire in Colorado ahead of impending trials. Under the settlement terms, PSCo will pay settlement claims of $640 million, of which $350 million will be covered by insurance and $290 million absorbed by the company. This is substantially lower than prior estimates.

The Colorado insurance commissioner had estimated property damages could exceed $2 billion, with additional potential for noneconomic and punitive damages. Fitch views the settlement as a prudent risk management measure that significantly reduces uncertainty regarding wildfire liabilities and improves the company's financial risk profile.

Wildfire Risk Management: Management has implemented strategies to mitigate wildfire risk, including regular filings of a Wildfire Mitigation Plan (WMP), a credit positive. PSCo was the first utility in Colorado to develop and file a WMP. The Colorado Public Utilities Commission (CPUC) approved its initial five-year WMP in 2020. However, more frequent and destructive wildfires in recent years, especially in western U.S., including Colorado, increase wildfire risk for utilities. Fitch's current rating thresholds for PSCo account for these risks, but catastrophic wildfires could lead to negative rating actions.

In June 2024, PSCo filed an updated WMP with the CPUC, requesting cost recovery for 2025-2027. The estimated plan cost is $1.9 billion, covering Public Safety Power Shutoffs, expanded covered conductors, enhanced powerline safety settings, increased drone use, and undergrounding 50 miles of overhead lines. In April 2025, PSCo filed a unanimous settlement, including WMP approval (with modifications), cost recovery through rider mechanisms, and a commitment to seek securitization of $1.2 billion by January 2029. The CPUC approved the settlement in June 2025.

Relatively Constructive Regulatory Environment: PSCo operates within a relatively constructive and stable regulatory environment overseen by the CPUC, featuring supportive regulatory mechanisms like adjustment clauses for fuel costs and purchased power, trackers for pension expenses and property taxes, riders for transmission investments, and a recently passed distribution rider that helps reduce some regulatory lag. CPUC uses historical test years, resulting in lower-than-allowed earned return on equity (ROE). A supportive regulatory environment is critical as PSCo has a large capital spending program.

Recent Electric Rate Case: In November 2025, PSCo filed a request to increase the revenue by $356 million based on a ROE of 9.8% and equity ratio of 55%. The increase in revenue is primarily driven by recovery of previously incurred infrastructure investments, enhance system reliability and replace ageing infrastructure. A decision is expected by Q3 2026.

Recent Gas Rate Case: In January 2024, PSCo requested a natural gas rate increase of around $170 million, with a ROE of 10.10% and an equity ratio of 55%. CPUC's decision authorizes and maintains the company's existing ROE in the 9.2%-9.5% range, with a midpoint of 9.35%, and its equity ratio in the 53%-55% range, with a midpoint of 54%. The total rate increase approved was $125 million. Colorado regulators rejected PSCO's proposal for the revenue stability mechanism and decoupling tariff. PSCo expects to file another gas rate case application by YE 2025.

Large Capex Plan: PSCo has a large capex plan focused on management's ""steel for fuel"" renewable energy investment strategy and supporting strong demand growth. It also includes spending on gas pipeline integrity and distribution system enhancement. Fitch projects approximately $17.5 billion in capex over 2026-2030, significantly higher than $10.9 billion spent in 2020-2024. This increase is expected to modestly strain credit metrics in the near term.

Financial Metrics: Fitch expects PSCo's financial metrics to support the existing ratings. Fitch forecasts FFO leverage to remain in the 4.2x range through 2029, driven by a lower-than-expected Marshall wildfire settlement, which will result in a one-time charge of $290 million to earnings in 2025 compared with our previous expectation of $2 billion of wildfire liability that was anticipated to be financed with debt and equity.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: There is a parent/subsidiary relationship between Xcel Energy Inc. (Xcel) and PSCo. Under Fitch's Parent/Subsidiary Linkage criteria, Fitch applies a weak parent/strong subsidiary approach. Fitch views PSCo as stronger than Xcel due to its low-risk utility operations and solid credit metrics. Legal ring-fencing, and access and control are considered porous given the general protections afforded by economic regulation. Thus, the maximum separation between PSCo's and Xcel's Long-Term IDRs is up to two notches.

Improving Regulatory Environment: Fitch views the regulatory environment overseen by the Public Utility Commission of Texas (PUCT) and the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission (NMPRC) as more challenging compared with other Xcel Energy Inc. (BBB+/Stable) jurisdictions but has improved in recent years. Authorized ROEs for electric utilities in Texas and New Mexico are historically slightly lower than the national average. Riders for renewable investments and strong sales growth have enabled SPS to earn ROEs closer to the allowed level in the past few years, despite the regulatory lag from the use of a historical test year in Texas.

Supportive rate design mechanisms in Texas and New Mexico include fuel and purchased power recovery mechanisms and generation riders for energy-efficiency program costs. SPS also has riders for distribution costs, generation investment and transmission infrastructure improvement costs in Texas and for renewable energy program costs in New Mexico. New Mexico now allows for the forward test year filing, which was reflected in the most recent rate case filing. Earnings and cash flows are supported by strong sales growth primarily driven by the oil and gas industry in the service territory.

Rate Cases Settled: Fitch believes the latest rate case settlements/decisions in both jurisdictions reflect an improving regulatory environment. In December 2023, SPS, PUCT staff and intervenors filed a black box settlement, reflecting a base rate increase of $65 million retroactively effective to July 13, 2023, compared with the original ask of $158 million. SPS expects a PUCT decision in 1Q24.

In October 2023, the NMPRC approved SPS's settlement, reflecting a $33 million rate increase, compared with $75 million initially requested, a forward test year, a 9.5% ROE and a 54.7% equity ratio. The settlement also includes the acceleration of the Tolk generating station retirement to 2028. The rates became effective in October 2023.

Continued Capex Spend: Significant spending is associated with management's steel-for-fuel renewable energy investment strategy, with a focus on wind generation and electric transmission investments in New Mexico. Fitch projects capex of approximately $4 billion over 2024-2028, similar to $3.9 billion spent between 2019 and 2023. SPS plans to fully exit coal by 2030. The plan does not include $750 million in potential projects that would help alleviate congestion and enable future load growth and renewables.

Stable Financial Metrics: Fitch forecasts FFO leverage to average roughly 4.5x from 2025 through 2029, which is supportive for the rating. We expect leverage to remain below the negative sensitivity threshold over the forecast period. This is supported by the company's efficient use of tax benefits from the IRA and more constructive rate outcomes. Fitch current base case does not assume any change in the tax policy. Removal of transferability of tax credits would have negative impact on SPS's financial metrics.

Large Capex Supports Load Growth: Significant spending is driven by oil and gas sector electrification, expanding data centers, and economic growth in Texas and New Mexico. Fitch projects capex of approximately $19 billion over 2026-2030, primarily driven by transmission and generation investments. SPS projects strong load growth over next five years at 8% annually, driven by a combination of electrification of oil and gas industry in New Mexico and data center load growth toward the end of the five-year plan.

Recent Rate Cases: Fitch believes the latest rate case settlements/decisions in both jurisdictions reflect an improving regulatory environment. In November 2025, SPS filed a rate case requesting an increase in revenue by $175 million based on a ROE of 10.5% and equity ratio of 56%. A decision in expected by 4Q26. In December 2023, SPS, PUCT staff and intervenors filed a black box settlement, reflecting a base rate increase of $65 million retroactively effective to July 13, 2023, compared with the original ask of $158 million. In April 2024, PUCT approved the settlement as filed.

Parent/Subsidiary Linkage: There is parent and subsidiary linkage for Xcel and its subsidiaries. For SPS, the linkage follows strong parent/weak subsidiary path. Fitch considers the legal incentive weak because Xcel does not guarantee SPS's debt. Strategic and operational incentives are also considered weak due to SPS's relatively low contribution to Xcel's consolidated business, resulting in a standalone rating for SPS.

Peer Analysis

Xcel

Xcel's credit profile is weaker than that of WEC Energy Group, Inc. (BBB+/Stable) and stronger than DTE Energy Company (BBB/Stable) and CMS Energy Corporation (BBB/Stable). Xcel, CMS, and WEC are utility parent holding companies that mostly comprise regulated integrated electric and natural gas distribution utilities.

Xcel, WEC, DTE, and CMS all own utilities that operate primarily within constructive regulatory jurisdictions, with Xcel and WEC also benefiting from multistate operations that add geographic and regulatory diversification. Xcel's business risk has increased in recent years due to wildfire activity across its utilities. CMS, DTE, and WEC operate in service territories with limited exposure to wildfire risk.

Fitch forecasts Xcel's FFO leverage to be around 4.9x through 2028. This is stronger than CMS's 5.6x and DTE's 5.4x, and comparable to WEC, where Fitch expects FFO leverage to average 5.1x over the forecast period.

NSP-M

The credit profiles of NSP-Minnesota, PSCo and NSP-Wisconsin are similar and well-positioned at an 'A-' Long-Term IDR. PSCo, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin all operate within relatively constructive regulatory environments with reasonably good rates of return. However, PSCo's earned returns have lagged allowed due to historical test year filings. In addition, PSCo's business risk is higher as it operates in a state with elevated wildfire risk exposure and faces potential wildfire liabilities, unlike its sister utilities.

All three entities have large capex plans, but timely cost recovery in their respective regulatory jurisdictions mitigates high capex issues. PSCo and NSP-Minnesota benefit from a larger scale and scope of operations than NSP-Wisconsin.

The three entities' financial metrics are well-positioned within their rating category. Fitch forecasts FFO leverage in the 4.1x-4.4x range through 2029 for PSCo, 4.0x-4.4x for NSP-Wisconsin and 3.5x-4.0x for NSP-Minnesota.

NSP-W

Northern States Power Company - Minnesota (NSP-Minnesota; A-/Stable) and NSP-Wisconsin have similar credit profiles, both well positioned at an 'A-' Long-Term IDR. In contrast, the credit profile of Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo; A-/Stable) is modestly weaker positioned compared to its sister utilities. PSCo, NSP-Minnesota and NSP-Wisconsin all operate within relatively constructive regulatory environments with reasonably good rates of return. However, PSCo's earned returns lagged allowed due to historical test year filings. PSCo's business risk is higher, as it operates in a state with elevated wildfire risk exposure and faces potential wildfire liabilities, unlike its sister utilities.

PSCo

PSCo's credit profile is modestly weaker than those of Northern States Power Company-Minnesota (NSP Minnesota; A-/Stable) and Northern States Power Company-Wisconsin (NSP-Wisconsin; A-/Stable). All three utilities operate within relatively constructive regulatory environments with reasonably good rates of return. However, PSCo's earned returns have lagged allowed returns due to historical test year filings. In addition, PSCo's higher business risk than its sister utilities as it operates in a state with elevated wildfire risk and potential wildfire liabilities.

All three entities have large capex plans, but timely cost recovery in their respective regulatory jurisdictions mitigates high capex issues. PSCo and NSP-Minnesota benefit from a larger scale and scope of operations than NSP Wisconsin. The three entity's financial metrics are well positioned within their rating category, although PSCo's leverage is expected to remain modestly higher than the other two utilities, due to the large capex program and assumed $2 billion wildfire liability.

The three entities' financial metrics are well-positioned within their rating category. Fitch forecasts FFO leverage in the 4.1x-4.4x range through 2029 for PSCo, 4.0x-4.4x for NSP-Wisconsin and 3.5x-4.0x for NSP-Minnesota.

SPS

The relatively challenging regulatory environment in New Mexico and Texas results in a weaker credit profile for SPS relative to its sister utilities, Public Service Company of Colorado (PSCo; A-/Stable), Northern States Power Company-Minnesota (NSP-Minnesota; A-/Stable) and Northern States Power Company-Wisconsin (NSP-Wisconsin; A-/Stable).

SPS's credit profile is comparable to its peers Southwestern Electric Power Company (SWEPCO; BBB/Stable) and Public Service Company of Oklahoma (PSO; BBB+/Stable). All have large capex plans but benefit from supportive parent companies. PSO operates in a relatively more constructive regulatory environment than SPS and SWEPCO, both of which operate in Texas and other more challenging jurisdictions. However, SPS's regulatory outcomes and earned ROEs improved in recent years. At the same time, SPS's business risk has increased due to elevated wildfire risk exposure and potential wildfire liabilities.

Fitch forecasts SPS's FFO leverage to average roughly 4.5x through 2029, which compares favorably to both SWEPCO and PSO. PSO's elevated leverage is projected to fall below the downgrade threshold of 4.8x over the forecast period. Fitch expects SWEPCO FFO leverage will stay around 5.0x over the forecast.

ESG Considerations

Xcel Energy Inc. has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Customer Welfare - Fair Messaging, Privacy & Data Security due to the uncertainty on involvement of utility's equipment in sparking the wildfires and the devastation caused to its customers, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Xcel Energy Inc. has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Exposure to Environmental Impacts due to heightened risk from wildfires and the uncertainty about utility-sparked wildfires, which has a negative impact on the credit profile, and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Xcel Energy Inc. has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Exposure to Social Impacts due to adverse customer and other constituent impacts associated with unusual wildfire activity, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Southwestern Public Service Company has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Customer Welfare - Fair Messaging, Privacy & Data Security due to the involvement of SPS's equipment in sparking the largest wildfire in Texas history and the devastation caused to its customers, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Southwestern Public Service Company has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Exposure to Environmental Impacts due to heightened risk from wildfires and the uncertainty about utility-sparked wildfires, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

Southwestern Public Service Company has an ESG Relevance Score of '4' for Exposure to Social Impacts due to unusual wildfire activity in SPS service territory that is causing material adverse customer impacts, which has a negative impact on the credit profile and is relevant to the rating, in conjunction with other factors.

ESG Relevance Scores for Exposure to Environmental Impacts, Social Impacts and Customer Welfare of '4' has been revised from '5' for both Xcel and SPS. The score was set at '5' following the wildfires in SPS service territory in 2024, which resulted in tightening of FFO leverage sensitivities due to the increases wildfire risk and change in the Outlook to Negative from Stable. Subsequently, Xcel has been taking measures to improve grid reliability, including wildfire risk, in the face of the extreme weather, but exposure to wildfire risk at its two subsidiaries remains.

The highest level of ESG credit relevance is a score of '3', unless otherwise disclosed in this section. A score of '3' means ESG issues are credit-neutral or have only a minimal credit impact on the entity, either due to their nature or the way in which they are being managed by the entity. Fitch's ESG Relevance Scores are not inputs in the rating process; they are an observation on the relevance and materiality of ESG factors in the rating decision.

NRG Energy Investment Narrative Recap

NRG Energy shareholders are typically betting on sustained grid demand growth and the company’s ability to capture higher-margin opportunities as electrification accelerates, especially in major Texas markets. The newly announced US$370 million Texas Energy Fund loan increases NRG’s capacity for reliable power delivery but does not materially shift the key short-term catalyst: strong load growth and premium contract wins; nor does it resolve the business’s largest risk, which remains long-term exposure to fossil fuel regulation and debt-related financial pressure.

Among recent company developments, NRG’s expanded buyback authorization, up to US$3,000 million through 2028, is especially relevant, underscoring confidence in future cash flows supported by growth investments like the Greens Bayou plant, yet it also heightens leverage at a time of increased capital demands and sector uncertainty.

CHENNAI: This calendar year has turned out to be an impressive one for battery-powered electric vehicles in the country. For the first time, total EV registrations across all segments have crossed the milestone of 2 million units - and the year is still not over, with more than a month to go. The surge highlights rising consumer interest, better product availability and continued policy support for EV adoption. As of Tuesday, for this calendar year, EV registrations (excluding hybrids) stood at 2.02 million units as against 1.95 million units in 2024. Despite EV policy changes, demand has remained strong, driven by falling battery costs, a gradually expanding charging network, and new longer-range models. As sales of electric vehicles (EV) gain momentum, the growth is mainly powered by electric two-wheelers. According to Vahan data, electric two-wheeler segment continues to be the major driver of total EV registrations, accounting for 57% of the total volumes during this calendar year. ""We expect mid-teen growth in 2025, softer than last year's 27% surge but still healthy, supported by firm two-wheeler demand, steady three-wheeler fleet electrification and a competitive four-wheeler launch pipeline, indicating a sustainable growth cycle,"" said Poonam Upadhyay, director, Crisil Ratings. It is gathered that magnet shortages are manageable for now, with softer battery costs and rising localisation helping cushion the impact. The launch of higher-range, faster-charging models is also supporting demand. Total electric two-wheeler sales have grown to 1.2 million units year-to-date, slightly higher than the full-year number of 1.15 million achieved in 2024. ""Established OEMs have driven electric two-wheeler growth this year, leveraging extensive dealer networks, competitive pricing, and higher-range models to expand customer base and boost retail confidence despite policy changes,"" Upadhyay added. Among all categories, the electric passenger vehicle segment which include electric cars and SUVs) recorded a growth of 57% at 156,455 units year-to-date, compared with 99,429 units in 2024. Electric cars and SUVs are gaining traction, driven by a wider range of mid-range models and improved total cost of ownership. ""While charging infrastructure remains a consideration for long-distance travel, it's no longer a major concern for urban buyers who can rely on home and workplace charging. Expanding networks and increasing ranges are easing earlier infrastructure concerns,"" she said. Electric three-wheeler sales stood at 6.9 lakh units year-to-date as against 6.91 lakh units in 2024.

The two-day summit, held Nov. 19-20 at the Old Eucalyptus Schoolhouse in El Centro, brought hundreds together to confront the region’s most pressing environmental and public health challenges that ranged from air-quality inequities to workforce training gaps tied to Imperial Valley’s rapidly expanding clean-energy sector. Through plenaries, workshops and collaborative discussions, speakers emphasized that meaningful progress begins with transparent decision-making and solutions informed by those who live with the consequences of environmental burdens daily.

CCV Executive Director Luis Olmedo underscored that point from the very start, describing the summit as a space designed to counter misinformation and fear with data, dignity and collective problem-solving.

“Each year, this summit reminds us that the people most affected by environmental and health burdens are also the people who lead the solutions,” he said, noting that community voices must remain at the center of decisions around air quality, public health protections and local economic opportunity.

This year’s event also placed a heightened focus on youth leadership and workforce development, bringing students and young advocates into discussions on air pollution, climate resilience, sustainable agriculture, and the emerging opportunities tied to Lithium Valley and zero-emission transportation.

A Region Rallying for Environmental Justice

Over the past 14 years, CCV has built a model recognized statewide: pairing community knowledge with scientific research and regulatory partnerships to address long-standing inequities. This year’s summit reflected that legacy in sessions that spanned energy transition, Salton Sea health impacts, community benefits agreements, and climate-adaptation planning.

Speakers like Luz Gallegos, executive director of Training Occupational Development Educating Communities (TODEC), reminded attendees that the fight for environmental justice is inseparable from the fight for representation. “People in power are accountable for the residents,” she said. “They represent all residents — regardless of background or immigrant status.”

The call to hold institutions accountable was echoed by participants who highlighted the pressure on farmworker communities, the need for expanded bilingual outreach, and the importance of long-term investments in public health infrastructure.

Workshops Spotlight Data, Clean Energy, and Local Impacts

One of the most attended workshops — “The Devil Is in the Details” — centered on CCV and Earthworks’ environmental review of the Hell’s Kitchen Lithium and Power Project.

Presenters walked attendees through the project’s potential health and ecological impacts, noting threats to already overburdened communities, fragile ecosystems, and culturally significant tribal lands if strong safeguards are not implemented. The workshop drew widespread conversation as policymakers, nonprofit leaders, and residents questioned how to protect local communities while participating in the clean-energy boom.

Another session, led by GoFundMe.org Weather Resilience Program representative Rich Kotchmar, detailed how philanthropic partnerships are helping communities build air purifiers and heat-resilience programs from the ground up. “Very quickly we found that the solutions were there,” Kotchmar said. “They just needed to be resourced and have a full program behind them.”

Youth Leadership Takes Center Stage

A standout feature of the summit was the visible presence of youth, many of whom attended as part of environmental clubs, school programs, or CCV’s own youth engagement initiatives. Students participated in discussions on air pollution, climate science, worker protection, and renewable-energy careers.

Their participation aligns with CCV’s long-term goal of preparing the next-generation clean-energy workforce — especially as projects like Lithium Valley reshape the region’s economic landscape. Adriana Buelna, a participant in The Becoming Project, emphasized how agricultural modernization and green-technology innovation directly tie into job growth and worker health.

“Forever Green Farms is a project that not only will add jobs in the Imperial Valley,” she said, “its goal is to make us more efficient and sustainable.”

Advancing Workforce, Health, and Community Resilience

Community health workers and advocates from across the Valley also highlighted the urgency of investing in specialized field training and safety protections for agricultural and service workers.

Ma Oliva Gonzalez, of the Sure Helpline Center, said she is hopeful about new projects emerging across the region. “It is very enthusiastic to see that farm workers are becoming more specialized in their profession,” she said, noting that many more projects are needed to build a safer and more sustainable workforce.

Across panels, community members reiterated the importance of pairing economic growth with meaningful protections, especially as drought, extreme heat, and air-quality challenges increase.

A Summit Rooted in Collaboration and Shared Purpose

With support from major statewide foundations, including The California Endowment, Waverley Street Foundation, Latino Community Foundation, and The California Wellness Foundation, this year’s summit amplified CCV’s vision: that environmental justice is built through partnership, transparency, and sustained community power.

Throughout the sessions, Olmedo urged attendees to remain united, especially in polarized times. “In times of uncertainty, when we are experiencing community challenges, there is also room for opportunity,” he said. “The opportunity of resilience, the opportunity of coming together and working together.” And in closing, he offered a final reminder of the summit’s purpose:

“Each one of you individually are making a difference in our community.”",https://calexicochronicle.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/CCV.SUMMIT-2025.DIRECTOR-JOSE-LUIS-OLMEDO-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-26 01:59:08.598964

WRDA Resources: WRDA 2026 Dear Colleague Chief's Reports:","The Committee is gathering information and input from Members of Congress to develop and pass a Water Resources Development Act (WRDA) later this Congress.

The most recent WRDA, the Water Resources Development Act of 2024, was signed into law by President Biden on January 4, 2025. Congress has enacted a bipartisan WRDA every two years since 2014, making the upcoming bill the seventh consecutive bipartisan WRDA.

WRDAs provide Members of Congress the opportunity to authorize U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Civil Works projects to improve the nation’s ports and harbors, the inland waterway navigation network, flood and storm protection, and other water resources infrastructure. WRDA projects have national, regional, and local significance and help strengthen the nation’s global competitiveness, grow the economy, move goods throughout the country and abroad, protect communities, and create jobs.

These projects originate at the local level and go through a rigorous vetting process before they may be considered for inclusion in a WRDA. WRDAs allow Congress to have direct involvement in what projects the Corps studies and, ultimately, constructs. This legislation also provides Congress the opportunity to address program and policy reforms within the civil works program to help projects get built safely and efficiently, and in a more cost-effective way.

WRDA projects typically require two separate authorizations from Congress: (1) the authority to study the feasibility of a project, followed by (2) the authority to construct, operate, and/or maintain the project. Completed feasibility studies are submitted to Congress in the form of a Chief’s Report from the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Chief of Engineers. If the results and recommendations contained in the Chief’s Report are favorable, a construction authorization for the project can be included in a future WRDA. The costs for feasibility studies and construction are generally split between a non-federal sponsor and the Corps.

After nearly a decade of flat growth, the US Energy Information Administration projects that annual demand across the United States will grow 2.4 percent in 2025 and 2.6 percent in 2026. Meeting that demand affordably poses a formidable challenge. Oil and gas markets are volatile, while renewables have intermittency challenges and vulnerable supply chains. In this environment, accelerating the development of geothermal energy could help reduce exposure to these risks.

Compared to solar, wind, or battery storage, geothermal power relies relatively less on critical minerals like cobalt and lithium. And, unlike oil and gas generation, geothermal requires no fuel. As a result, geothermal can provide round-the-clock baseload power with lower exposure to disruptions in global supply chains.

As the cost of enhanced geothermal technologies continues to decrease and their geographic reach expands, now is the time for policymakers, especially in the United States, to take a serious look at geothermal as a key part of their energy security strategy.

The value of geothermal

Geothermal energy taps the earth’s internal heat for electricity and heating. A traditional geothermal well accesses natural steam and hot water, while an enhanced geothermal system (EGS) fractures hot rock and circulates fluid to absorb subsurface heat. This heat produces steam, which returns to the surface to spin turbines that generate electricity. Traditionally, geothermal energy production was limited to tectonic boundaries or hotspots where the earth’s crust is thin and subterranean heat is at its highest. However, technological advances, including drilling techniques borrowed from the oil and gas sector, have now made geothermal commercially viable in a broader range of locations.

In terms of energy security, geothermal offers two major advantages compared to other sources.

First, it can provide 24/7 baseload power without the need for fuel. Insulated from volatile global commodity markets, geothermal can offer the energy resilience necessary to achieve US energy policy priorities, like independently powering domestic and overseas US military bases and the fast-growing US data center industry. In fact, a growing number of tech giants are signing offtake agreements with geothermal companies to power artificial intelligence (AI) operations, including Meta’s agreements for 150 megawatts (MW) each from Sage Geosystems and XGS Energy, and Google’s agreements with Fervo Energy and NV Energy for 115 MW.

Second, geothermal is not as reliant on vulnerable supply chains as wind and solar are. China controls a high percentage of the global supplies of many minerals that are essential to the manufacture of wind and solar components and systems, especially in midstream refining. According to the International Energy Agency (IEA), for 19 out of 20 strategic minerals, China is the leading refiner, with an average market share of 70 percent. China refines 91 percent of rare earths, 77 percent of cobalt, 70 percent of lithium, 44 percent of copper, and 42 percent of chromium. According to International Aluminum data, it also consistently accounts for around 60 percent of aluminum production.

While geothermal technology uses more chromium than wind and solar, it uses less of other critical minerals, especially when battery storage is added to a system. Geothermal requires less copper and aluminum than solar photovoltaics, and less copper, rare earth minerals, and zinc compared to wind. Adding battery storage to intermittent wind and solar dramatically increases the need for chromium, cobalt, lithium, and rare earths even further for these technologies.

Downstream, the IEA estimates that China’s share in key solar panel manufacturing stages exceeds 80 percent. In terms of wind development, the IEA in its Energy Technology Perspectives 2023 also estimated China accounts for 70 to 80 percent of global blade manufacturing, 45 to 50 percent of tower production, and around 70 percent [SJ8] [PS9] of nacelle (turbine covers) assembly capacity. While geothermal still relies on global markets for standard components like turbines, steel, and piping, its ability to leverage the existing assets and technologies of the US oil and gas sector—primarily for drilling—significantly reduces its exposure to risks in the supply chain.

Geothermal also offers another major advantage: Multiple projects for lithium extraction from geothermal brine in California’s Salton Sea, as well in the Smackover Formation in Arkansas and the Upper Rhine Graben in Europe, show how geothermal could even become a net producer of critical minerals.

Renewed US interest in geothermal

Recent support from President Trump and Energy Secretary Chris Wright places geothermal firmly among the administration’s pillars for securing US energy dominance. In a speech in March 2025, Wright suggested that although geothermal “hasn’t achieved liftoff yet, it should and it can,” adding it “could help enable AI, manufacturing, reshoring, and stop the rise of our electricity prices.” Meanwhile, Trump’s executive orders, as recently as July, have consistently identified geothermal as a key resource to be developed and allowed expedited permitting.

This renewed enthusiasm has highlighted key areas for White House and Congressional cooperation:

Permitting reform: Establishing more streamlined permitting processes, including ensuring better interagency coordination and adequate resources would reduce uncertainty and project timelines, directly increasing their bankability.

Categorical exclusions (CXs): The Bureau of Land Management’s (BLM) could expand on its April 2024 and January 2025 adoption of CXs that exempt certain low-impact, early-stage activities from separate environmental reviews. The US Department of Energy (DOE) estimates that the January 2025 CX alone could shorten the geothermal permitting process by up to a year. Expanding CXs for other early-stage, low-impact activities and allowing concurrent environmental reviews for different phases of the same project would further shorten project timelines, boosting investor appeal.

Interagency cooperation: Designating one agency to conduct a single, unified review could further accelerate project timelines. Currently, developers must often complete a full environmental review with the BLM and then a second, separate review with the US Forest Service.

Sufficient staffing: Expeditious permitting also requires adequate staff to process requests, a factor for policymakers to consider amid proposed reductions to the workforce, including in key state offices responsible for federal licensing.

Continued tax credits and research and development (R&D) support:

Tax credits: The Trump administration’s maintenance of the Inflation Reduction Act’s (IRA) tax credits for geothermal is a win for the sector. Based on National Renewable Energy Laboratory data, the Center for Strategic and International Studies reported that the IRA’s tax credits could lead to the levelized cost of electricity from EGS to drop by nearly 85 percent, to $60 to $70 per megawatt-hour, making it competitive with other firm and intermittent energy sources.

Federal R&D support: The DOE’s Geothermal Technologies Office has helped advance drilling and reservoir techniques at the Frontier Observatory for Research in Geothermal Energy (FORGE) demonstration laboratory in Utah, but more research is needed. Challenges for EGS include drilling into hot rock, which represents over half the project’s budget and destroys standard equipment. This is compounded by the uncertainty of whether a viable underground fracture network can be successfully engineered to circulate water and extract heat without causing issues like induced seismic disturbances. Sustained federal support for testbeds like FORGE will help overcome these challenges, catalyze advances, reduce costs, and enable the scaling of traditional geothermal and EGS across the United States.

By prioritizing the rapid development of geothermal, policymakers could help the United States build a unique path to energy security—one that delivers reliable power 24/7, insulated from global hydrocarbon markets and vulnerable supply chains.

The state’s second wind farm opened last year, which was the newest addition providing power to 28,000 homes while providing an economic boost to Chowan County.

On Tuesday, Timbermill Wind’s developers, Apex Clean Energy, presented local leaders with its first property tax payment, nearly $750,000.

“We’re paying as much in property taxes this year as the top nine taxpayers combined in 2024,” said spokesman Brian O’Shea.

The project includes 45 wind turbines operating on land shared with a soybean, corn and cotton farm as well as forested property for timber harvest. O’Shea explains the turbines are tall enough most of the land can still be used for agricultural purposes while it’s leased out to Apex.

“You know, with commodity prices and trade policy has really, you know, made life difficult for for American farmers, and wind energy is just one other lifeline for those farmers to be able to have some income they can depend on regardless of what’s going on in the global economy.”

Last year, Channel 9 was at the event as a bipartisan group of state leaders celebrated the construction of North Carolina’s second wind farm, Timbermill Wind.

It took nearly 11 years to permit and build Timbermill Wind. The only previous wind development, Amazon Wind in Edenton, was built nearly 10 years earlier.

O’Shea said new permitting rules allowed Timbermill to get off the ground and set the stage for further projects, hopefully with a quicker timeline.

“We were the first project ever to go through that new state process and navigate it,” he said then. “So, now there’s at least a roadmap for a future developer.”

However, the winds shifted a year later.

Federal policy has made it harder to get the permits necessary to build new wind power and expiring tax credits mean new projects would be more expensive.

In its 2024 iteration of its long term plan, Duke Energy planned to have wind generation on its grid by 2033. In the edition of the plan released this year, the utility is not expecting to add any wind projects to the grid for the next 15 years.

“It’s not economically viable to at least the 2040s,” said Bill Norton, a Duke Energy spokesman.

Karly Brownfield with the Southeastern Wind Coalition said this plan misses out on the potential the state has on and offshore to develop clean power while relying too heavily on coal and gas power.

“We see natural gas prices go up and down. We see utilities become more dependent on natural gas,” she said. “There’s a really great opportunity for wind to provide kind of a natural hedge against those prices.”

As evidence, Brownfield points to other southeastern utilities still moving forward on wind development, including neighboring Dominion Energy, which recently released a request for proposals for wind in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.

“It’s kind of a very sharp contrast between how different utilities are are kind of digesting all this uncertainty,” she said.

As the Carolinas face steep increases in energy demand over the next decade, Brownfield believes it’s not time to rule out a home-grown source of power.

“Whether you’re approaching that from an energy security perspective, if you’re thinking about the economic benefit for rural landowners or communities just meeting energy demand and load growth,” Brownfield said. “there are a lot of ways that wind is still applicable.”

The House Natural Resources Committee just greenlit the SPEED Act, a bill that can help make life more affordable by cutting red tape and making sure America is once again able to build energy projects quickly and efficiently.

As the AI revolution picks up pace, America’s energy demand is soaring. However, our supply simply hasn’t kept up; as a result, our utility bills are higher than ever before.

To get prices down, we need to rapidly expand our energy infrastructure.

We have the resources and the people ready to get to work. But our slow and convoluted permitting system is keeping hundreds of energy projects stuck in limbo as they try (and many times fail) to navigate our bureaucratic maze.

But there’s a solution.

The SPEED Act, a bipartisan bill that recently advanced out of committee, will get rid of many of the hurdles that are holding our energy industry back and are working together to keep your utility bill high.

Watch AFP Managing Director Kent Strang break down what this would mean for you:

No more delays: Let’s get up to SPEED

Building in America can be a slow, bureaucratic, and sometimes impossible task.

Many energy and construction projects are stalled before the first shovel touches the ground, tangled up in layers of complex regulations.

One of the chief culprits behind this “death by delay” is the expansion of the National Environmental Policy Act from a relatively straightforward analysis of proposed projects into an intractable regulatory nightmare that takes years to complete.

Signed into law on January 1, 1970, NEPA requires federal agencies to evaluate the environmental impact of any major federal action that might have an effect on the environment.

This review has turned into a lengthy process that takes around 3.5 years to finish and produces 450-page-long reports, on average.

The SPEED Act will bring American construction forward by:

Setting clear NEPA review timelines

Defining which major federal actions need a NEPA review

Limiting judicial reviews

Streamlining bureaucracy

The SPEED Act will help cut through red tape, making it faster and cheaper to build. That means builders will see lower costs that can contribute to more affordable living for all of us.

AFP is on the ground

Permitting reform might sound like a wonky debate, but everyday Americans are feeling the real-life consequences of years of bureaucracy and red tape when they see their utility bills rise and good construction jobs dry up.

That’s why we kicked off the “Road to Prosperity” tour. We’ve been on the move across more than six states, engaging with communities about energy reform and visiting sites ranging from oil rigs and coal mines to facilities in places such as Louisiana and Wyoming.

We’ve talked to workers whose jobs depend on new projects, families who can’t afford higher energy prices, and business leaders who are tired of seeing new opportunities blocked by Washington red tape.

Everywhere we go, we hear the same thing: America wants to build. Washington just won’t let us.

Policies like the SPEED Act can change the game and get America ready for a future where we can build fast and get our economy back on track.

Each year, American households throw away about 26 million tons of food, while food processors, grocers, and restaurants produce an additional 30 million tons of food waste.
While prevention remains the best strategy to reduce wasted food, biogas systems help ensure the food that still gets discarded is used productively.
As of this month, 304 biogas systems in the U.S. convert food waste into renewable energy, a 19% increase over the past five years.
In addition, 62 farms anaerobically digest food waste in combination with animal manure, putting another 1.7 million tons of food scraps to good use.","As Americans prepare to enjoy their Thanksgiving feasts, the American Biogas Council released new data today highlighting the growth of biogas systems that convert food waste into energy. On Thanksgiving Day alone, Americans will throw away about 160,000 tons of food scraps, representing $550 million worth of food tossed in a single day, according to the non-profit ReFED. Each year, American households throw away about 26 million tons of food, while food processors, grocers, and restaurants produce an additional 30 million tons of food waste.

While prevention remains the best strategy to reduce wasted food, biogas systems help ensure the food that still gets discarded is used productively. These systems capture the energy from surplus food and other organic material (like manure and wastewater solids) as they break down. Biogas facilities use anaerobic digestion to recycle waste into energy that can be used to power and heat homes, fuel vehicles, or generate electricity through engines and fuel cells.

As of this month, 304 biogas systems in the U.S. convert food waste into renewable energy, a 19% increase over the past five years. The ABC reports that 118 of these facilities recycle food waste only, handling over 10 million tons of pre- and post-consumer inedible scraps each year.

Wastewater treatment plants and farm-based biogas systems also recycle some discarded food. The ABC counts 124 wastewater plants in the U.S. that combine food waste with wastewater solids to generate energy, recycling an additional 1.1 million tons of wasted food each year. In addition, 62 farms anaerobically digest food waste in combination with animal manure, putting another 1.7 million tons of food scraps to good use.

In total, every year, these facilities recycle 12.8 million tons of food scraps and other organic waste into over 35 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of biogas a year, enough to cover the year-long energy use of 283,000 U.S. households.

“The U.S. still overlooks the enormous value in food processing scraps and inedible food,” said ABC Executive Director Patrick Serfass. “Biogas facilities can convert this waste into enough home-grown energy to supply the needs of millions of Americans, while creating jobs and catalyzing new, local investments. We hope more municipalities and industrial food processors will choose to invest in biogas systems to recycle their resources locally.”

Looking into the future, if three-quarters of the discarded food from homes, grocers, restaurants, and food processors were recycled in biogas systems, we could turn that wasted material into 115 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of biogas per year, equivalent to the energy needs of nearly one million U.S households.

While considerable potential remains, the biogas sector is expected to continue to expand to transform discarded food into valuable energy, showing a practical way to reduce waste and support home-grown renewable power.

Divert will accept unsold, non-donatable food from General Produce’s distribution center to Divert’s Integrated Diversion & Energy Facility in Turlock, California. There, it will undergo Divert’s depackaging and anaerobic digestion processes, which destroy branded packaging and transform organics into carbon-negative renewable energy and nutrient-rich soil amendment. The energy and soil amendment are returned to the community to power homes and enrich local soils.

Divert will also conduct data collection and analysis to support waste mandate compliance, produce sustainability reporting, and identify additional opportunities to reduce waste. Divert services over 1,900 locations across California for customers, including Blue Diamond Growers, Raley’s, United States Cold Storage, and more.

“Together with Divert, we’re keeping organic waste out of landfills, transforming what can’t be donated into renewable energy, and continuing to drive meaningful change across our industry,” said Brian Hamilton, General Produce’s Director of Operations. “As a leading produce distributor, we know firsthand how important it is to make the most of every food item that comes through our warehouse, and this partnership allows us to do just that. Combining Divert’s innovative technology with our long-standing commitment to sustainability and core values of continuous improvement and concern for people creates a smarter, cleaner, and more responsible supply chain.”

This program will help General Produce meet the compliance requirements of California’s Senate Bill 1383 (SB 1383), a statewide organic waste policy that mandates diversion of organic waste from landfills. California produces nearly half of the country’s vegetables and over three-quarters of its fruits and nuts, so it’s critical that the nutrients and value in any unsold produce are repurposed into beneficial products, like renewable energy and soil amendment.

“Our partnership with General Produce builds on the work we are doing across California to eliminate wasted food in the state and reduce greenhouse gas emissions across the food value chain,” said Andrew Johnston, VP and GM, Industrials at Divert. “Divert’s work with food and beverage manufacturers, distributors, and other commercial operators across the country helps these businesses simplify their operations and drive supply chain efficiencies, all while reducing their carbon footprints in an immediately tangible way. This collaboration not only exemplifies General Produce’s commitment to sustainability but also their inspiring stewardship of their customers’ products in ensuring no food – including packaged and recalled material – goes to waste.”

,Indiana American Energy ,2025-11-25 21:19:44+00:00,www.cbsnews.com,Americans are facing power shutoffs and mounting debt as energy costs surge - CBS News,Mary  Cunningham,,,,,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/power-shutoffs-energy-bill-debt-us-households/,"Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.
In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.
NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.
Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all.
""When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,"" Wolfe told CBS News.","Americans' energy bills are piling up, forcing them deeper into debt and even triggering power shutoffs.

As of June, nearly one in 20 households went into collections or fell in arrears on their utility bills, according to a new joint report from The Century Foundation, a progressive think tank, and advocacy group Protect Borrowers. The problem was even more pronounced in parts of the South and Appalachia, where one in 12 households was already in collections or on the verge of it.

In the last three years, the average overdue balance on utility bills climbed from $597 to $789, a 32% jump, the report found.

More Americans are falling behind on their utility payments due to rising energy prices, alongside a jump in costs for other essentials, ranging from child care to housing.

""When we see families unable to pay their utility bills, it raises alarm bells about a crisis of home heating and electricity, but it also raises alarm bells about people's ability to deal with their cost of living across the board,"" said Julie Margetta Morgan, president of The Century Foundation.

Residential electricity prices rose by 10.5% between January and August 2025, one of the fastest increases in a decade, government data analyzed by the National Energy Assistance Directors Association (NEADA), an educational and policy organization, shows. Natural gas is still the most popular way Americans heat their homes, although a growing share are using electricity.

A combination of high interest rates, rising natural gas costs and an increase in demand from data centers has pushed up prices, according to NEADA.

The issue will likely come into sharper focus this winter when millions of consumers face heating bills. NEADA predicts that Americans will see their energy bills rise nearly 8% this winter to an average of roughly $976 per month.

More Americans at risk of shutoffs

When people fail to pay their energy bills on time, it can lead to electricity shutoffs, or when a utility turns off a household's power until people pay the balance, along with a so-called reconnection fee.

Most states have some sort of safeguard against utility shutoffs when the temperature dips below a certain level, but not all. States without cold-weather protection include Alaska, Florida, Hawaii, Kentucky, Nebraska, North Dakota, South Carolina, Tennessee and Utah, according to the Energy Justice Lab, a joint project of Indiana University and the University of Pennsylvania.

Despite these protections, Americans are becoming increasingly vulnerable to shutoffs, experts told CBS News.

While no official national count of utility cutoffs exists, NEADA estimates that 3.5 million American households had their power cut off at some point in 2024 based on public data reported by utility companies. That number is expected to swell to 4 million this year, NEADA estimates.

""Past due balances climbing, particularly for lower-income families, suggest that shutoffs are going to become much more prevalent,"" the Century Foundation's Margetta Morgan said.

Con Edison, a utility serving New York City and Westchester County in New York, has cut off almost 168,000 customers at some point this year, according to data NEADA shared with CBS News. That's more than five times the number of shutoffs the utility reported last year.

Most Americans whose power is cut off have services restored within a few days, according to Mark Wolfe, NEADA's executive director. Still, the shutoffs can create major disruptions to Americans' day-to-day lives as they lose refrigeration, internet and lighting. Pipes can also freeze, and residents could get sick if their apartments get too cold, Wolfe added.

Shutoffs tend to have a bigger impact on low-income households, given they are already stretched thin by everyday expenses, Wolfe said. Many turn to payday lenders, friends and family or state forgiveness plans to cover reconnection costs or overdue bills, he added.

""When money is limited, people have to prioritize essentials like food and medicine, and utility bills become one of the few expenses they can postpone,"" Wolfe told CBS News. ""That flexibility gives them a small sense of control, but it also increases the risk of falling behind and facing shutoffs.""",https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2025/11/25/ed49d359-0131-4870-8b9e-04feaa5717b9/thumbnail/1200x630/32e465d2856bcddfe04fb46d113cd641/gettyimages-2157928317.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 17:04:17.282199

Autonomous, connected and intelligent systems

Mobility drives the pace of everyday life, and today, the transportation landscape is undergoing a profound transformation driven by rapid advances in autonomous systems — from connected vehicles to commercial drones. These technologies promise greater operational efficiency and the emergence of entirely new modes of travel. WSU researchers are at the forefront of this transition, working to make intelligent machines safer, more effective and more responsive. In the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, Associate Professor of Computer Science Dr. Zheng Dong leads efforts to enhance the safety and reliability of autonomous systems, ensuring they can interact seamlessly with human drivers and navigate the complexities of modern urban environments.

“We are in a new era of artificial intelligence, where deep neural networks are transforming the perception pipeline, path-planning and control algorithms of autonomous vehicles. These advances are opening new frontiers in real-time embedded systems research and demanding novel solutions to ensure that such systems remain safe and effective,” said Dong. “By leveraging these powerful AI technologies, human innovation and creativity can be further amplified in this field. We hope our research lays a solid foundation for the development of safe and effective autonomous vehicle and machine systems.”

Work in this area is taking Wayne State to new heights in other ways, as well. Dr. Yanchao Liu, assistant professor of industrial and systems engineering, is advancing next-generation commercial drone technologies with applications in logistics, agriculture, public safety, and national defense. Building on his high-density aerial traffic management framework, Liu’s research has helped position Wayne State University as a leader in autonomous mobility systems. This expertise recently contributed to a major achievement: Airspace Experience Technologies (ASX), a long-standing industry partner of Liu’s lab, secured a contract from the U.S. Department of the Air Force to demonstrate a joint command system that could manage automated air and ground vehicles at multiple Air National Guard installations.

“This partnership represents an exciting opportunity to translate years of theoretical research into real-world impact,” said Liu. “Our work in high-density aerial traffic management has always been driven by a vision of safer, more efficient, and more equitable mobility.”

Almost all modern technologies are dependent on the semiconductor industry, and Dr. Charles Winter, professor of chemistry in the College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, has led research that dramatically improved the speed, power and efficiency of next-generation computer chips that power the artificial intelligence behind self-driving cars and other advanced machines.

Sustainable energy, next-generation batteries and electric mobility

Wayne State is also at the forefront of the clean transportation transition — the shift away from fossil fuels. The Center for Electric, Connected and Autonomous Technologies (eCAT), led by Dr. Caishang Wang, professor of electrical and computer engineering in the James and Patricia Anderson College of Engineering, is advancing research in sustainable energy systems, electric vehicle infrastructure and smart grid integration. ECAT is a National Science Foundation Industry-University Cooperative Research Center, tasked with developing sustainable mobility technologies such as V2X (vehicle-to-everything) communications and real-time edge computing.

WSU is also at the forefront of research on cleaner, more efficient energy storage for electric vehicles. Dr. Leela Arava, professor of mechanical engineering and associate dean for research and graduate studies, leads research focused on high-energy, rechargeable lithium-sulfur (Li/S) batteries, which can store five times more energy than their lithium-ion counterparts and are set to be the next generation of batteries. Assistant Professor of Mechanical Engineering Dr. Mahbub Islam’s research focuses on magnesium-carbon dioxide batteries, which use abundant, low-cost magnesium and convert carbon dioxide into electricity.

He stresses how crucial this research is for advancing efficient battery technologies and promoting environmental sustainability — efforts that stand to impact millions, if not billions, of people worldwide.

“Electrochemical energy storage is vital for harnessing energy from intermittent renewables like solar and wind and electrifying the transportation sector to achieve a carbon-neutral future. Current lithium batteries, while offering high energy densities, encounter challenges related to scarcity, geopolitical issues and the high cost of lithium. Therefore, alternative energy storage technologies that utilize low-cost, environmentally friendly materials are necessary to facilitate the transition to a sustainable energy future.”

Safer, smarter and more equitable transportation

Beyond technology, Wayne State’s research is improving the ways people travel and connect. For example, WSU’s Transportation Research Group. conducts research on a broad spectrum of mobility areas, including pedestrian safety, safety belt and child car seat use, transit wheelchair lifts, traffic signals, speed limits, heavy-duty trucks, bicycle safety, and more.

Meanwhile, researchers are also using artificial intelligence to enhance public transportation — from optimizing public transit routes for hourly workers to developing data-driven solutions that improve accessibility for people with disabilities. Dr. Xiaodong Qian, assistant professor of civil and environmental engineering, is leading research to develop a real-time crowdsourcing tool to collect, analyze and respond to public feedback about everything from routes and safety to cleanliness and reliability on transit services using AI.

The decision was heavily influenced by recommendations from the 501(c)(3) nonprofit Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC). IREC says it exemplifies how the PUC leverages its regulatory authority to prevent monopoly utilities from obstructing clean energy deployment.

Xcel’s ‘totally useless’ hosting capacity analysis

The grid transparency sections of the decision focused on Xcel’s hosting capacity analysis (HCA). This map-based tool offers a snapshot of the electric grid’s conditions, showing where new generation or load can be added safely without expensive and lengthy upgrades to infrastructure.

This data aids in project siting by highlighting less constrained areas of the grid, helping developers choose locations with higher chances of economic success.

Xcel was initially instructed in 2021 to allocate ratepayer funds for developing an HCA. However, the data it released was “plagued with issues”, making it difficult to use.

Issues included incomplete information necessary for effective siting decisions, excessive redaction of data, and requiring users to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA) described by the PUC as “commercially unreasonable” to access clear HCA maps or tabular data, along with multiple other problems.

As Stanfield explains, “The problem is that the NDA was written by Xcel without any input from customers and was completely commercially unreasonable. Realistically, nobody can sign it. IREC couldn’t sign it. We were literally saying, ‘We can’t sign this. We can’t even look at the maps to see if they’re good or not,’ because the NDA was so onerous.”

Despite recent legislative mandates for Xcel to publish a detailed hosting capacity map for both load and generation, Xcel declined to make the load map publicly accessible. The PUC dismissed the utility’s claims that these measures were needed for grid security and decided that the company must release unredacted data without requiring NDAs from users. Additionally, it called for improved data granularity.

Describing the importance of the enhancements in the level of HCA detail that Xcel will now need to provide, IREC Regulatory Engineer Midhat Mafazy explained:

“(The current level of detail) is like being told there’s traffic on Interstate 55 somewhere between Chicago and St. Louis. It’s vague and not very useful. Developers need more granular data that pinpoints where constraints are and why congestion is happening. These improvements will make the data massively more useful for deploying clean energy and EV charging infrastructure, and smarter grid planning overall.”

Stanfield further explains, “Xcel takes pretty much the most extreme position of any utility that’s been required to or has voluntarily published a hosting capacity map. All other – there’s something like 40 or more hosting capacity maps that are published in the United States, and none of them require an NDA.”

Additionally, Xcel previously conducted a load hosting capacity analysis but only published it in a table or spreadsheet format, rather than as a map, which IREC says posed several problems. The utility also did not provide the nodal results.

Reviewing the spreadsheet made it hard to identify the actual location, rendering it “totally useless” since knowing capacity on a random segment doesn’t assist someone trying to locate a site.

Xcel claimed that withholding the data was necessary to ensure the security of the electricity grid. However, the PUC dismissed this argument and decided that the utility must publish “unredacted data” without requiring users to sign an NDA.

Stanfield adds, “The linkage between publication of a hosting capacity map and an increased risk of attacks on the distribution system is very weak or non-existent. It’s basically speculative, and that’s what the commission found.”

The PUC’s decision

The PUC also decided that Xcel must create a policy for flexible interconnection and energisation.

Stanfield notes, “The other thing that IREC was involved in for this proceeding was getting the commission to require Xcel to publish a flexible interconnection and a flexible load tariff. They had been dragging their feet and not really doing it and not committing to doing either, and the Commission required them to publish both flexible interconnection and flexible energisation, or flexible interconnection, for load, which is really significant.”

Flexible interconnection allows generation or load projects to connect to the grid with the ability to adjust the power they send or draw as system capacity varies.

Xcel initially suggested a very narrow use of flexible interconnection, applying only to certain parts of its grid for specific projects, and had no firm plans for flexible load. IREC argued that these eligibility criteria were too restrictive and advised establishing a formal tariff outlining eligibility, review processes, and implementation steps. The PUC’s ruling aligns with IREC’s recommendation.

PUC Commissioner Megan Gilman noted of flexible interconnection, “One of (our) state goals is getting DERs, getting new customers and loads, connected in a cost-effective and timely manner. Flexible interconnection clearly is one tool that could be available. Limiting that option, dragging (their) feet, acting like a more narrow option is all that’s necessary gets to the bigger question, of ‘Does it appear the company is actually strategically trying to meet those state goals?’”

From IREC’s viewpoint, this decision is a positive move toward holding Xcel Energy accountable for customer needs and advancing the broader clean energy and transportation goals of the State of Colorado.

A formal written order recording the verbal decisions from the public proceeding is anticipated in December.

It is unclear, however, based on the company’s activity, whether it will comply with those orders. The uncertainty is being caused by the strong positions Xcel took in this hearing.

Stanfield says, “During the deliberations where the commissioners were talking about what they were going to require, they all expressed a sort of deep distrust with whether Xcel will actually do what’s required, which I haven’t heard very often in my practice all over the United States, and you don’t often hear commissioners just outright question whether the utility will even comply with their order.”

Stanfield also highlights additional comments from Commissioner Gilman:

“Commissioner Gilman expressed a particular concern about whether Xcel is going to comply with the order this time and set forth a process that would allow staff to do an investigation and pursue penalties if they don’t, but she questioned openly whether that would even be effective, which is a really troubling place to be.”

Xcel’s motivations for non-complicance are certainly called into question when the utility faces further delays in building out energy infrastructure.

Stanfield notes, “If Xcel does not take into account managed charging and the ability of DERs to respond to grid conditions and be ‘flexible,’ that results in a need for more distribution upgrades, which means the ratepayers have to pay for more distribution upgrades, and the shareholders get a greater profit every time they build what’s called a capital investment.”

Adding, “So were they motivated? Are they not motivated to enable the flexibility of the DERs because their shareholders don’t get as much of a profit? That’s the question that I think the commission was grappling with in this proceeding, overall.”

Our colleagues at PV-Tech first reported on this story, noting that financial mechanisms, like flexible tariffs for grids where renewable energy is an increasingly integral part of meeting energy demand, can also minimise the cost of a mismatch between electricity supply and demand.

This may be especially important for Xcel in Colorado, where the utility has actively worked to boost renewable energy’s share in its overall mix in recent years. From 2005 to 2024, wind power’s contribution to the energy supplied to customers grew from 2% to 35%. Xcel anticipates this will rise to 62% by the end of the decade.

Colorado ranks eighth in the nation for energy storage capacity, sixth for wind energy and tenth for solar energy, making the integration of these sources into the grid a crucial aspect of energy management.

In a 2022 guest blog for ESN Premum, Gwen Brown, Vice President of Communications for IREC, wrote:

“Energy storage is a critical piece of the puzzle in the transition to an electric grid powered by high levels of renewable energy. Storage makes it possible to capture the intermittent power produced by DERs like solar and wind and use it when it is most needed.”

Brown continued, “However, many of the most valuable characteristics of storage can’t easily be utilised on the distribution grid today. That’s because most state-level interconnection rules—the rules that govern whether and how DERs are permitted to connect to the grid—have not been updated to deal with energy storage systems in a way that maximises customer flexibility and ensures the continued safe and reliable operation of the grid.”",https://www.energy-storage.news/wp-content/uploads/2025/10/Screenshot-2025-10-02-135248.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:59:06.786124

From 2025 to 2030, peak needs may grow by as little as 103 GW or as much as 197 GW.","Energy policy debates often sound like a choice among competing visions of which type of energy would best power America’s future: “dispatchable,” on-demand power produced from fossil fuels and nuclear energy, or quick-build, cheap energy from renewables such as wind and solar?

If only our choice was that simplistic. The reality, however, is that between now and 2030, surging demand for energy will collide with longstanding bottlenecks on new capacity. This mismatch between supply and demand stands to limit how much energy the grid can deliver to build homes, create jobs, support national security, drive the economy — everything we count on energy to do. Meanwhile, competitors such as China are able to rapidly bring new capacity online for data centers and other economic and security imperatives.

The math is unforgiving: Neither dispatchables nor renewables will come close to meeting our needs on their own. We’ll need them all. We already do need them all. A look at the data behind electricity supply and demand shows just how clear-eyed and nimble we’ll need to be to achieve “grid dominance” — that is, ensuring that our power grid is equipped to meet our constantly expanding needs.

Destination: Grid dominance

Abundant electricity hinges on two elements: energy and power. The terms are often used interchangeably, but they represent different things. It’s important to understand the difference in order to understand what energy grid dominance entails.

“Power” refers to the electricity that we use from moment to moment — to turn on the lights, ramp up the factory floor, bring military-base control systems online, and so on.

“Energy,” on the other hand, is what keeps the power going for the period of time that it’s needed — to keep the lights on, the factory output humming, the military base running.

One way to think of it is to visualize a delivery truck hauling goods from a factory to a warehouse 100 miles away, along a route with rises and dips, some high hills and steep grades, and long, flat stretches of roadway, as in the illustration:

The truck will need a strong motor — the power — to make it up the hills and grades, and enough fuel — energy — to make the 100-mile trip from factory to warehouse and back. The delivery truck represents the power grid, fueled by the power plants connected today and those in development to be connected within the next five years.

“The grid,” it should be noted, is not a single entity, but a nationwide network of power plants, substations, power lines, and other components that convert raw energy into electricity, and then transmit it to homes, businesses, and other end users.

As for the rest of the illustration:

the road is the demand curve over the next five years

the hills are estimates of peak demand

the distance is the total energy needed to reach the destination

And the destination is grid dominance by 2030: an electrical grid that can keep up with a growing economy, including the escalating demand for power from data centers and industrial loads.

Delivering grid dominance requires delivering both power and energy, and we’re right on track … to fall short on both: The truck can’t get up the highest hill, and it won’t make it to the warehouse.

Part 1: Power up the peaks

On July 29, 2025, America’s electrical grid delivered 760 gigawatts of power throughout the lower 48 states. It was a record for peak demand, or the maximum amount of power needed at once to keep the lights on. And yet, experts project that over the next five years, we’ll keep setting records for peak demand.

How much bigger will the peaks be in 2030? Because demand is expanding every year, the delivery truck needs to climb higher hills every year. Here we focus on the additional power that we’ll need on top of the 760 GW the grid is already providing. From 2025 to 2030, peak needs may grow by as little as 103 GW or as much as 197 GW. But we estimate that only about 118 GW of extra power plant capacity will be connected to the grid and available at peak moments over this period, based on power facilities that are already far enough along the intensive and overly time-consuming permitting process.

So if demand growth is on the low end of the estimates, then the grid would be able to deliver power dominance — enough supply to meet peak demands.

At least theoretically. If we’re counting on one source of energy to get the job done, the illustration below shows the literally darker reality:

The combination of natural gas and nuclear capacity (“dispatchable” energy shown in the chart) would account for only 37 GW, a fraction of the total amount needed and far short of even the low end of the demand range. Wind and solar projects would contribute another 26 GW during demand peaks. The remaining 55 GW would come from electricity-storage projects and various hybrid power plants, such as solar paired with lithium-ion batteries.

Part 2: On the energy side, (not) going the distance

That’s the picture on the power side during peak demand. On the energy side, when we look at projections for cumulative electricity consumption throughout an entire year rather than only at peak moments, we also see additional demand growth ranging widely, from 449 terawatt-hours (i.e., 449,000 gigawatt-hours) to 855 terawatt-hours through 2030. That’s all new demand on top of current demand.

The chart below makes clear how far off we may be from meeting our growing energy needs over the next five years, even when all sources are combined.

The contributions to annual electricity supply from various production technologies are different from those for meeting the limited hours of peak demand. For example, battery storage on its own produces nothing and therefore doesn’t contribute to annual production, but it can help provide power during peak demand. On the flip side, wind availability is higher on average over the year than it is at peak, so it’s an essential tool for meeting our energy needs throughout the year. As another example, dispatchable sources make up almost half of expected annual production additions, more than their share of peak supply additions.

In other words, a given technology can have high value on the power side but low value on the energy side and vice versa, or medium value on both, for instance. This underscores why a diversity of technologies makes for the strongest grid.

Most importantly, the fundamental takeaway from the power side holds true here on the energy side as well: Excluding any given technology in the existing project-development queue would prevent us from keeping pace with additional electricity demand, even in the low-growth scenarios.

The inescapable point is that energy strategies that reject a balanced mix of sources won’t be enough to keep up with growth. We need to stop choosing among energy types and start embracing America’s energy-dominance potential.

In the next installment of our series on driving America’s energy future, we will examine practical strategies for leveraging readily available supplies to address accelerating demand.

The new jobs will pay an average wage of $55,133, slightly higher than the current average wage of $49,335 in Randolph County.

The state will incentivize EAS about $5 million total, including almost $3.3 million in a Job Development Investment Grant, $1.2 million in workforce training and a $500,000 building re-use grant. EAS will locate in a 300,000-square-foot manufacturing space to serve regional and national markets. There are three total buildings on the site, totaling about 450,000 square feet and EAS is expected to use all three, says Kevin Franklin, president of Randolph County Economic Development.

The building has been used for warehousing for the past several years. Klaussner Home Furnishings last used the building for manufacturing in 2023. Klaussner shut down in 2023, eliminating more than 800 jobs across several sites in Asheboro.

“We’re very excited to see it get back into productive use,” says Franklin.

EAS has operated in the Triad region since 1953, and was acquired by Comfort Systems in 2016. Comfort Systems became a public company in 1997 with 12 operating companies. It now has 45 companies and 18,000 employees in more than 170 U.S. locations/

EAS has 831 employees in North Carolina across seven locations. Asheboro beat out sites in Danville, Virginia, and Rock Hill, South Carolina. Franklin says it helped that Asheboro is only 25 miles south of EAS headquarters in High Point, as well as an available labor pool. Having an available site was also a major factor, he adds.

At a time when Attorney General Sunday and some Pennsylvania legislative leaders are taking action to combat the safety risks associated with modern technology, U.S. Congress appears poised to pass a provision that would strip states of the ability to regulate A.I. and take enforcement action against those who use it to cause harm.

This week, Attorney General Sunday joined 36 Attorneys General in a letter to Congress opposing federal preemption of state laws. AG Sunday joined a coalition with a similar message earlier this year.

“I am again joining many colleagues in urging Congress to allow states to continue on with the great progress we are making to protect children, families, and communities from the dangers of artificial intelligence,” Attorney General Sunday said. “We continue to charge offenders who use A.I. to exploit and abuse children and unsuspecting adults by manipulating images and sharing them online — an enforcement tool made possible by our state Legislature.

Among those bills are:

SB1050: Requiring mandated reporting of child sexual abuse material, including artificially-generated CSAM.

HB1925: Regarding regulation of A.I. in healthcare.

The Pennsylvania Office of Attorney General has charged at least six individuals with felony counts under Act 125, which was passed into law by the state Legislature in December 2024. That law prohibits the use of artificial intelligence technology to create materials that appear to “authentically depict a child under 18” engaging in sexually abusive acts that did not occur in reality.

“But they are also very excited about the rapid progress of clean energy.
At the same time, something else can be true, which is that we’re seeing incredible opportunity and momentum in the clean energy space and in the social sector.
Isham said he hoped to see the cost of clean energy continue to decline or a new technology emerge that would make these advancements accessible to those who cannot afford them.","Students, faculty, and alumni gathered at the What Works Now? conference, held November 15–17 at Middlebury College, to reflect on the positive environmental outcomes sparked by the inaugural gathering 20 years ago, and to consider strategies for addressing today’s climate challenges.

The event drew alumni from across the nation—some of whom organized the original conference as part of a winter term course taught by Jon Isham, professor of economics and environmental studies, titled What Works: Building a New Climate Movement. They spoke about the course’s transformative impact, crediting it with the creation of the Sunday Night Environmental Group (SNEG) and eventual founding of nonprofit 350.org as well as the Keystone Pipeline protests, the College’s decision to divest from fossil fuels, and other environmental milestones. These significant accomplishments were captured in a historical timeline created by Ella Powers ’27 and shared at the conference.

Keynote speaker Jamie Henn ‘07, cofounder of 350.org and executive director of Fossil Free Media, said the class and the community formed through it defined his life and career for the next 20 years “through Sunday Night Group, 350.org, my work with Bill McKibben (Schumann Distinguished Scholar), and many here in the room.”

“In many ways this feels like a homecoming, but also a continuation of being back in the same J-term class that Jon has continued on and on for the last 20 years. We’re still figuring out ‘what works.’”

Henn and other alumni who participated on panels, breakout sessions, and climate conversations emphasized the importance of empowering current students like Powers—co-organizer of the conference and treasurer of SNEG—to lead the next generation of climate action efforts at the College. “I’m so glad that Ella is looking back at history because all the work began long before 2005,” said Henn. “Coming out of that first class we really took inspiration from the generation before us. We walked out of 2005 with a real sense that there was a movement out there that we could activate.”

Powers was equally optimistic.

“We’ve done this for 20 years and looked at what’s worked and what hasn’t, and now we’re reassessing,” said Powers, who interviewed dozens of alumni for her history project. “There are really awesome, cool alums who have done things that I can’t really imagine, but it’s also really cool to be in the footsteps of that, and know that there is the potential to do something great like they did. We need to take the lessons and trials of the past, learn from them, and apply them to the fight today.”

New Era, Similar Issues

Some speakers expressed frustration at confronting many of the same climate issues that defined the original conference—issues highlighted in The New York Times front-page story “Paper Sets Off a Debate on Environmentalism’s Future,” based on a presentation at the 2005 conference by emerging environmentalists Michael Shellenberger and Ted Nordhaus titled “The Death of Environmentalism.” They also drew comparisons between the fossil-fuel–driven policies of the George W. Bush administration and current efforts to roll back clean-energy incentives and weaken foundational environmental laws such as the Clean Water Act and the Endangered Species Act.

Isham called the comparison a “fair assessment” with one major exception: the cost of clean energy. “There’s a sense that environmentalists are back on their heels like 20 years ago,” he said, “but we actually have the ace of spades in our hands, which is that clean energy is much cheaper and accounted for 90 percent of new energy sources in 2024.”

In 2005, Isham said climate activists spent their time pushing back against the exorbitant cost of clean energy by proposing things like carbon taxes to incentivize businesses and consumers to use less carbon-intensive energy products. “Today, as Bill McKibben explains in his new book, Here Comes the Sun, the opposite is true—the things that environmentalists support and know to be better for the planet, like wind, solar, and storage, are far less expensive,” he said. “Now we can say ‘yes’ to clean energy because it’s actually affordable for many people.”

McKibben expressed optimism about the clean energy revolution despite the pace not moving fast enough to offset the damaging impacts of climate change.

“Around the world, people are very worried about climate, as they should be,” he said. “But they are also very excited about the rapid progress of clean energy. The planet is getting a third more power from the sun this fall than it did last fall, so things are starting to shift. Fast enough to catch up with the physics of climate change? No—and that’s the scary part.”

The Role of the College

The timing of What Works Now? coincided with the 60th anniversary of the College’s first-in-the-nation environmental studies program, along with the completion of Energy2028 drawing near, the temporary suspension of operations by 350.org, and a Strategic Planning Initiative to guide the College over the next decade and beyond.

During the keynote conversation on November 14, President Ian Baucom asked Henn about some of these issues and whether he struggled to remain optimistic with the sometimes stark realities around climate change.

“Climate is an interesting thing because you tend to toggle between the most apocalyptic, darkest feelings of ‘nothing is going to work out,’ and then these incredible hopeful horizons of possibility of thinking that this is an issue and a lens to look at the world and rethink everything around you,” said Henn to an audience of alumni, faculty, and students in Wilson Hall. “It’s a combination of those two that makes it so emotionally powerful.”

Henn said Isham’s class provided what he called a “sense of the radical stakes that we were facing, but then the freedom that gives you to kind of rethink everything was really exciting and electrifying.”

Baucom asked Henn if the phrase “pessimism of the intellect, optimism of the will,” attributed to the Italian Marxist philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci, resonates in the context of climate change. “There’s a certain necessary pessimism—you’ve got to face the hard facts—and yet find grounds for optimism,” said Baucom. “Where can we find optimism of the intellect and optimism of the will when it comes to climate?”

On the optimistic side, Henn pointed to the current clean-energy revolution.

“We’ve really done the job of unlocking the incredible possibility of repowering this planet without fossil fuels,” he said. Regarding the pessimism of the will, he added, “I don’t think we have to sugarcoat the threat to our democracy and especially marginalized communities in this country. At the same time, something else can be true, which is that we’re seeing incredible opportunity and momentum in the clean energy space and in the social sector. The job of the activist is to look where there might be momentum.”

What Will Work in 2045?

Toward the end of the event, participants were asked which issues they anticipated would dominate the 2045 What Works Now? conference. Isham said he hoped to see the cost of clean energy continue to decline or a new technology emerge that would make these advancements accessible to those who cannot afford them.

“I’d like to see new technologies to liberate the unliberated, the poor, and the people who are struggling now in this country and beyond to pay rent, to buy a car, to hold on to their jobs,” he said. “That would be something to celebrate—if the climate movement has further uplifted everybody.”",https://www.middlebury.edu/announcements/themes/custom/middlebury_theme/favicon.ico?fv=8mh0Lypp,N,,2025-11-25 17:01:31.905465

READ MORE: Wind power plays tiny role in North Carolina’s grid, could that be changing?

The state’s second wind farm opened last year, which was the newest addition providing power to 28,000 homes while providing an economic boost to Chowan County.

On Tuesday, Timbermill Wind’s developers, Apex Clean Energy, presented local leaders with its first property tax payment, nearly $750,000.

“We’re paying as much in property taxes this year as the top nine taxpayers combined in 2024,” said spokesman Brian O’Shea.

The project includes 45 wind turbines operating on land shared with a soybean, corn and cotton farm as well as forested property for timber harvest. O’Shea explains the turbines are tall enough most of the land can still be used for agricultural purposes while it’s leased out to Apex.

“You know, with commodity prices and trade policy has really, you know, made life difficult for for American farmers, and wind energy is just one other lifeline for those farmers to be able to have some income they can depend on regardless of what’s going on in the global economy.”

Last year, Channel 9 was at the event as a bipartisan group of state leaders celebrated the construction of North Carolina’s second wind farm, Timbermill Wind.

It took nearly 11 years to permit and build Timbermill Wind. The only previous wind development, Amazon Wind in Edenton, was built nearly 10 years earlier.

O’Shea said new permitting rules allowed Timbermill to get off the ground and set the stage for further projects, hopefully with a quicker timeline.

“We were the first project ever to go through that new state process and navigate it,” he said then. “So, now there’s at least a roadmap for a future developer.”

However, the winds shifted a year later.

Federal policy has made it harder to get the permits necessary to build new wind power and expiring tax credits mean new projects would be more expensive.

In its 2024 iteration of its long term plan, Duke Energy planned to have wind generation on its grid by 2033. In the edition of the plan released this year, the utility is not expecting to add any wind projects to the grid for the next 15 years.

“It’s not economically viable to at least the 2040s,” said Bill Norton, a Duke Energy spokesman.

Karly Brownfield with the Southeastern Wind Coalition said this plan misses out on the potential the state has on and offshore to develop clean power while relying too heavily on coal and gas power.

“We see natural gas prices go up and down. We see utilities become more dependent on natural gas,” she said. “There’s a really great opportunity for wind to provide kind of a natural hedge against those prices.”

As evidence, Brownfield points to other southeastern utilities still moving forward on wind development, including neighboring Dominion Energy, which recently released a request for proposals for wind in southeastern Virginia and northeastern North Carolina.

“It’s kind of a very sharp contrast between how different utilities are are kind of digesting all this uncertainty,” she said.

As the Carolinas face steep increases in energy demand over the next decade, Brownfield believes it’s not time to rule out a home-grown source of power.

“Whether you’re approaching that from an energy security perspective, if you’re thinking about the economic benefit for rural landowners or communities just meeting energy demand and load growth,” Brownfield said. “there are a lot of ways that wind is still applicable.”",https://media.zenfs.com/en/wsoc_cox_articles_386/7e749086a8b2ea924d58c985dbcceaaa,N,,2025-11-25 17:04:08.156283

This has ramped up as the federal credits are set to expire.","Oregonians have just more than a month to take advantage of federal tax credits meant to reduce by thousands of dollars the costs of buying and installing new energy efficient heating and cooling pumps, insulation, windows and solar panels.

Paired with incentives from the nonprofit, state-partnered Energy Trust of Oregon, the savings can cover half to nearly all costs, depending on the purchase. People who have made home energy efficiency upgrades this year, or who can complete upgrades by Dec. 31, can claim the federal tax credits.

Most of the federal credits passed in 2022 as part of the Inflation Reduction Act enacted under former President Joe Biden and were meant to expire in 2032, giving Americans a decade to take advantage of subsidies meant to spur investments in home weatherizing and clean energy upgrades. But congressional Republicans phased the credits out early in the tax and spending law they passed this summer.

Julianne Thacher, a spokesperson for the Energy Trust, said the organization wants to encourage Oregonians to take advantage of those credits now and to remind them that when they go away, there will still be state-level incentives they should not overlook.

“Energy Trust incentives will be here after the tax credits. We won’t be affected. We were here before the tax credits, and had very successful programs with folks installing energy-efficient equipment, so we expect that will continue,” Thacher said.

The Oregon Department of Energy also offers solar and heat pump cash incentives and grants that can be used towards the costs of equipment and installation after federal, Energy Trust and any other incentives are applied.

The Oregon Energy Trust was established by the state Public Utilities Commission in 2002. Although it’s an independent nonprofit, the commission oversees the trust’s performance measures, budget and planning.

Ratepayers of five of Oregon’s six investor-owned gas and electric utilities — all except Idaho Power — fund the trust. As part of utilities’ energy load planning, they send a percentage of ratepayer dollars to the trust, which is tasked with ensuring investment in activities that lower overall load demand and help meet state climate targets.

Part of that is standing up cash incentive programs to help businesses and everyday Oregonians afford equipment and infrastructure to lower their own energy consumption. The trust offers higher incentives for families with lower incomes and collaborates with 60 community organizations statewide.

Energy Trust incentives are available to all customers of Portland General Electric, or PGE, Pacific Power, NW Natural, Cascade Natural Gas and Avista. Customers can go to a store and choose equipment prequalified for Energy Trust incentives, and that will deduct the credit from receipt at the point of purchase.

Customers can also work with contractors who have agreements with Energy Trust, and who will purchase and install the equipment and deduct the tax credits from the bill. Customers can also apply online at the Energy Trust’s website for specific credits after purchase, and receive a refund for the credit amount in the mail.

The mix of state, federal and private and nonprofit subsidies for solar panels have led to major growth in residential solar in the last decade, and today about 25,000 homeowners in Oregon are generating solar energy, according to Energy Trust. This has ramped up as the federal credits are set to expire.

“The solar contractors we work with are very busy right now, and we’ve actually gone ahead and launched our new incentives for 2026 early, because folks who are looking to do a solar project starting now, they’re highly unlikely to complete that by year’s end. That’ll be a 2026 project.”

Focusing on efficiency in businesses and homes in Oregon, and setting climate targets that incorporate more solar, heat and cooling pumps and building upgrades, has made a big dent in Oregon’s gas and electricity use. Demand for gas would today be 9% higher and demand for electricity 16% higher if policies had not been enacted over the last two decades, the Trust found.

“Energy efficiency is the most effective, affordable way to meet climate goals, while also offering a ton of other benefits for customers and communities,” Thacher said.

At the dawning of the British Empire in 1818, the romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley penned a memorable sonnet freighted with foreboding about the inevitable decline of all empires, whether in ancient Egypt or then-modern Britain.

In Shelly’s stanzas, a traveler in Egypt comes across the ruins of a once-monumental statue, with “a shattered visage lying half sunk” in desert sands bearing the “sneer of cold command.” Only its “trunkless legs of stone” remain standing. Yet the inscription carved on those stones still proclaims: “My name is Ozymandias, King of Kings: Look on my works, ye Mighty, and despair!” And in a silent mockery of such imperial hubris, all the trappings of that awesome power, all the palaces and fortresses, have been utterly erased, leaving only a desolation “boundless and bare” as “the lone and level sands stretch far away.”

Taken too literally, those verses might lead us to anticipate some future traveler finding fragments of St. Paul’s Cathedral scattered on the banks of the Thames River in London or stones from the Washington Monument strewn in a kudzu-covered field near the Potomac. Shelley is, however, offering us a more profound lesson that every empire teaches and every imperialist then forgets: Imperial ascent begets an inevitable decline.

Imperial Washington

Indeed, these days Donald Trump’s Washington abounds with monuments to overblown imperial grandeur and plans for more, all of which add up to an unconvincing denial that America’s global imperium is facing an Ozymandias-like fate. With his future Gilded Age ballroom meant to rise from the rubble of the White House’s East Wing, his plans for a massive triumphal arch at the city’s entrance, and a military parade of tanks and troops clanking down Constitution Avenue on his birthday, who could ever imagine such a thing? Not Donald Trump, that’s for sure.

In a celebration of his “works” that are supposedly making the “mighty despair” in foreign capitals around the world, his former national security adviser, Robert C. O’Brien, has recently argued in Foreign Affairs that the president’s “policy of peace through strength” is reversing a Democrat-induced decline of U.S. global power. According to O’Brien, instead of crippling NATO (as his critics claim), President Trump is “leading the biggest European rearmament of the postwar era”; unleashing military innovation “to counter China”; and proving himself the “indispensable global statesman by driving efforts to bring peace to… long-standing disputes” in Gaza, the Congo, and, quite soon, Ukraine as well. Even in North America, according to O’Brien, Trump’s attempt to acquire Greenland has forced Denmark to expand its military presence, putting Russia on notice that the West will compete for control of the Arctic.

As it happens, whatever the truth of any of that may be, the policy elements that O’Brien cites are certain to prove largely irrelevant to the ceaseless struggle for geopolitical power among the globe’s great empires. Or, to borrow a favorite Trumpian epithet from the president’s “cornucopia of crudeness,” in the relentless, often ruthless world of grand strategy, none of those factors amounts to a hill of “shit.”

Indeed, O’Brien’s epic catalogue of Trump’s supposed foreign policy successes cleverly avoids any mention of the central factor in the rise and fall of every dominant world power for the past 500 years: energy. While the United States made genuine strides toward a green energy revolution under President Joe Biden, his successor, the “drill, baby, drill” president, has seemed determined not just to destroy those gains, but to revert to dependence on fossil fuels “bigly,” as Trump would say. In a perplexing paradox, President Trump’s systematic attack on alternative energy at home will almost certainly subvert America’s geopolitical power abroad. How and why? Let me explain by dipping my toes in a bit of history.

For the past five centuries, the rise of every global empire has rested on an underlying transformation (or perhaps revolution would be a more accurate word for it) in the form of energy that drove its version of the world economy. Innovation in the basic force behind its rising global presence gave each successive hegemonic power — Portugal, Spain, England, the United States, and possibly now China — a critical competitive advantage, cutting costs and increasing profits. That energy innovation and the lucrative commerce it created infused each successive imperium with intangible but substantial power, impelling its armed forces relentlessly forward and crushing resistance to its rule, whether by local groups or would-be imperial rivals. Although scholars of imperial history often ignore it, energy should be considered, as I argued in my book To Govern the Globe, the determinative factor in the rise and fall of every global hegemon for the past five centuries.

Iberia’s Mastery of Muscle

In the fifteenth century, the Iberian powers — Portugal and Spain — manipulated the ocean winds and maximized the energy output of the human body, giving them new forms of energy that allowed their arid lands and limited populations to conquer much of the globe. By replacing the square sail of lumbering Mediterranean ships with a triangular sail, agile Portuguese vessels like the famed caravela de armada doubled their capacity to tack close to the wind, allowing them to master the world’s oceans.

By 1500, Portuguese warships had navigation instruments that allowed them to cross the widest bodies of water, sails to beat into the strongest headwinds, a sturdy hull for guns and cargo, and lethal cannons that could destroy enemy fleets or breach the walls of port cities. As a result, a small flotilla of Portuguese caravels soon conquered colonies on both sides of the South Atlantic Ocean and seized control of Asian sea lanes from the Red Sea to the Java Sea.

For the next three centuries, such sailing ships would transport 11 million African captives across the Atlantic to work as slaves in a new form of agriculture that was both exceptionally cruel and extraordinarily profitable: the sugar plantation. The output of Europe’s free yeoman farmers was then constrained by the limits of the individual body and the temperate climate’s short six-month growing season. By contrast, enslaved laborers, massed into efficient teams in tropical latitudes, were driven year-round to the brink of death and beyond to extract unprecedented productivity and profits from those plantations. Indeed, even as late as the nineteenth century, the U.S. southern slave plantation was, according to an econometric analysis, 35% more efficient than a northern family farm.

After developing the sugar plantation, or fazenda, as a new form of agribusiness on small islands off the coast of Africa in the fifteenth century, the Portuguese brought that system to Brazil in the sixteenth century. From there, it migrated to European colonies in the Caribbean, making that cruel commerce synonymous with the slave trade for nearly four centuries. So profitable was the slave plantation for its owners that, unlike almost every other form of production, it did not die from natural economic causes but would instead require the full force of the British navy to do it in.

The Dutch Harness the Winds

But the true masters of wind power would prove to be the Dutch, whose technological prowess would allow their small land, devoid of natural resources, to conquer a colonial empire that spanned three continents. In the seventeenth century, the Dutch drive for scientific innovation led them to harness the winds as never before, building sailing ships 10 times the size of a Portuguese caravel and windmills that, among other things, replaced the tedious hand sawing of logs to produce lumber for shipbuilding. With giant sails spanning over 90 feet, a five-ton shaft generating up to 50 horsepower, and several sawing frames with six steel blades each, a windmill’s four-man crew could turn 60 tree trunks a day into uniform planks to maintain the massive Dutch merchant fleet of 4,000 ocean-going ships.

By 1650, the Zaan district near Amsterdam, arguably Europe’s first major industrial area, had more than 50 wind-driven sawmills and was the world’s largest shipyard, launching 150 hulls annually (at half the cost of English-built vessels). Many of these were the Dutch-designed fluitschip, an agile three-masted cargo vessel that cut crew size, doubled sailing speed, and could carry 500 tons of cargo with exceptional efficiency.

Through its commercial acumen and mastery of wind power, tiny Holland defeated the mighty Spanish empire in the Thirty Years War (1618-48), then fought the British to a standstill in three massive naval wars, while building an empire that reached around the world — from the Spice Islands of Indonesia to the city of New Amsterdam on the island of Manhattan.

When Coal Was King

As Holland’s commercial empire began to fade, however, Great Britain was already launching an energy transition to coal-fired steam energy that would leave the wind and muscle power of the Iberian age in the dust of history. And the industrial revolution that went with it would build the world’s first truly global empire.

The Scottish inventor James Watt perfected the steam engine by 1784. Such machines began driving railways in 1825 and the Royal Navy’s warships in the 1840s. By then, an armada of steam engines was transforming the nature of work worldwide — driving sawmills, pulling gang plows, and sculpting the earth’s surface with steam shovels, steam dredges, and steam rollers. Between 1880 and 1900, the number of steam engines in the United States would triple from 56,000 units to 156,000, accounting for 77% of all American industrial power. To fuel that age of steam and steel, Britain’s coal production climbed to a peak of 290 million tons in 1913, while worldwide production reached 1.3 billion tons.

Coal was the catalyst for an industrial revolution that fused steam technology with steel production to make Britain the master of the world’s oceans. From the end of the Napoleonic wars in 1815 until the outbreak of World War I in 1914, tiny Britain with just 40 million people would preside over a global empire that controlled a quarter of all humanity directly through colonies and another quarter indirectly through client states. In addition to its vast territorial empire, Britannia ruled the world’s waves, while its pound sterling became the global reserve currency, and London the financial center of the planet.

America’s Petrol-Powered Hegemony

Just as Britain’s imperial age had coincided with its coal-driven industrial revolution, so Washington’s brand-new world order focused on crude oil to feed the voracious energy needs of its global economy. By 1950, in the wake of World War II, the U.S. petrol-powered economy was producing half the world’s economic output and using that raw economic power for commercial and military dominion over most of the planet (outside the Sino-Soviet communist bloc).

By 1960, the Pentagon had built a nuclear triad that gave it a formidable strategic deterrent, as five nuclear-powered submarines armed with atomic warheads trolled the ocean depths, while 14 nuclear-armed aircraft carriers patrolled the world’s oceans. Flying from 500 U.S. overseas military bases, the Strategic Air Command had 1,700 bombers ready for nuclear strikes.

As American automobile ownership climbed from 40 million units in 1950 to 200 million in 2000, the country’s oil consumption surged from 6.5 million barrels daily to a peak of 20 million. During those same decades, the federal government spent $370 billion to cover the country with 46,000 miles of interstate highways, allowing cars and trucks to replace railroads as the ribs of the nation’s transportation infrastructure.

To drive the carbon-fueled economy of Washington’s world order, there would be a dramatic, five-fold increase in the global consumption of liquid fossil fuels during the last half of the twentieth century. As the number of motor vehicles worldwide kept climbing, crude oil rose from 27% of global fossil-fuel consumption in 1950 to 44% by 2003, surpassing coal to become the world’s main source of energy.

To meet this relentlessly rising demand, the Middle East’s share of global oil production climbed from just 7% in 1945 to 35% in 2003. As the self-appointed guardian of the Persian Gulf whose vast oil reserves represented some 60% of the world’s total, Washington would become embroiled in endless wars in that tumultuous region, from the Gulf War of 1990-91 to its present-day interventions in Israel and Iran.

Whether thanks to Britain’s coal-fired factories or America’s auto traffic, all those carbon emissions were already producing signs of global warming that, by the 1990s, would set alarm bells ringing among scientists worldwide. From the “pre-industrial” baseline of 280 parts per million (ppm) in 1880, carbon dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere kept climbing to 410 ppm by 2018, resulting in the rising seas, devastating fires, raging storms, and protracted droughts that came to be known as global warming.

As evidence of the climate crisis became undeniable, the world’s nations responded with striking unanimity by signing the 2015 Paris Climate Agreement to cut carbon emissions and surge investments into alternative energy that soon yielded significant breakthroughs in both cost and efficiency. Within four years, the International Energy Agency predicted that dramatic drops in the cost of solar panels meant that solar energy would soon be “the new king of the world’s electricity markets.” Indeed, as technology slashed the cost of battery storage and solar panels, the International Renewable Energy Agency reported in 2024 that the solar generation of electricity had become 41% cheaper than fossil fuels, while offshore wind was 53% cheaper — a truly significant disparity that will, as technology continues to slash the cost of solar energy, render the use of coal and natural gas for electricity an economic irrationality, if not an utter absurdity.

In the game of empires, seemingly small margins can have large consequences, often marking the difference between dominance and subordination, success and failure — whether the 35% advantage of enslaved over free labor, the 50% cost advantage for Dutch sailing craft over British ones, and now a 41% savings for solar over fossil fuels. Moreover, the day is fast coming when fossil-fuel electricity will cost more than twice as much as alternative energy from solar and wind power.

To assure America’s economic future, the administration of President Joe Biden began investing trillions of dollars in alternative energy by building battery plants, encouraging massive wind and solar projects, and continuing a consumer subsidy to sustain Detroit’s transition to electric vehicles. In January 2025, however, Donald Trump entered the White House (again) determined to roll back the global green revolution. After quitting the Paris climate accord and labeling climate change a “hoax” or “the green new scam,” President Trump has halted construction of major offshore wind projects, ended the subsidy for electric vehicle purchases, and opened yet more federal lands for coal and oil leases. Armed with extraordinary executive powers and a single-minded determination, he will predictably delay, if not derail, America’s transition to alternative energy, missing market opportunities and undercutting the country’s economic competitiveness by chaining it to overpriced fossil fuels.

China’s Green-Energy Ride to Global Power

While Washington was demolishing America’s green energy infrastructure, Beijing has been working to make China a global powerhouse for alternative energy. Ten years ago, its leaders launched a “Made in China 2025” program to storm the heights of the global economy by becoming the world leader in 10 strategic industries, eight of which involved some aspect of the green-energy transformation, including “new materials,” “high-tech ships,” “advanced railways,” “energy-saving and new energy vehicles,” and “energy equipment.” Those “new materials” include China’s virtual monopoly on rare earth minerals, which are absolutely critical to the manufacturing of the key components for renewable energy — specifically, wind turbines, solar panels, energy storage systems, electric vehicles, and hydrogen extraction. In sum, Beijing is already riding the green energy revolution in a serious bid to become the world’s “leading manufacturing superpower” by 2049, while erasing America’s economic edge and its global hegemony in the bargain.

So, you might ask, have any of those seemingly pie-in-the-sky plans already become an economic reality? Given China’s recent progress in key energy sectors, the answer is a resounding yes.

Under its economic plan, China has already come to dominate the world’s solar power industry. In 2024, it cut the wholesale price of its solar panel exports in half and nearly doubled its exports of panel components. To replace its old export “trio” of clothing, furniture, and appliances, Beijing has mandated a “new trio” of solar panels, lithium batteries, and electric cars. And to put what’s happening in perspective, imagine that, in just the month of May, China installed enough wind and solar energy to power a country as big as Poland, reaching an impressive figure that represents half the world’s “total installed solar capacity.” By 2024, China was already producing at least 80% of the world’s solar panel components, dominating the global market, and undercutting would-be competitors in Europe and the U.S. Driving all that explosive growth, China’s investment in clean energy has reached nearly $2 trillion, representing 10% of its gross domestic product, and has been growing at three times the rate of its overall economy, meaning it would soon account for a full 20% of its entire economy.

With similar determination, its electric vehicles (EVs) are now beginning to capture the global car market. By 2024, 17.3 million electric cars were made worldwide, and China produced 70% of them. Not only are Chinese companies opening massive robotic assembly plants worldwide to crank out such cars by the millions, but they are also making the world’s cheapest and best cars — with the YangWang U9-X hitting a world speed record of 308 miles per hour; BYD’s latest plug-in hybrid models, priced at only $13,700 and capable of traveling a record 1,200 miles on a single charge and single tank of gas; the YangWang U8 with a capacity to literally drive across water; and the Xiaomi SU-7 displaying a high-tech driver interface that makes a Tesla look like a Ford Pinto.

Since an EV is just a steel box with a battery, technology will soon allow low-cost electric vehicles to completely eradicate gas guzzlers, enabling China to conquer the global car market — with full electric cars like the self-driving BYD Seagull sedan already priced at $8,000, models like BYD’s Han with a 5-minute charge time that’s faster than pumping a tank of gas, and sedans like the Nio ET7 with a standard range on a single charge of 620 miles. And most of that extraordinary technological progress has happened in less than four years, essentially the time remaining in Donald Trump’s second term in office.

An Agenda for America’s Economic Future

By discouraging alternative energy and encouraging fossil fuels, President Trump is undercutting America’s economic competitiveness in the most fundamental way imaginable. Amid an historic transformation in the world’s energy infrastructure (comparable in scope and scale to the coal-fired industrial revolution), the United States will spend the next three years under his watch digging coal and burning oil and natural gas, while the rest of the industrial world follows China as it pursues technological innovation to the furthest frontiers of the human imagination. Indeed, the latest annual report from the world’s energy watchdog, the International Energy Agency, states bluntly that the transition away from fossil fuels is “inevitable” as the world, “led by a surge in cheap solar power in… the Middle East and Asia,” installs more green energy capacity in the next five years than it has in the last 40 combined.

By the time Donald Trump leaves office in 2029, this country will be distinctly on the imperial decline amid fast-paced changes that will make electric vehicles universal and solar-powered electricity an economic imperative. And just as the Dutch used energy technology to capture their imperial moment in the seventeenth century, so the Chinese will undoubtedly do the same in this century.

After all, how can the United States produce competitive products, even for domestic consumption (much less export), if our costs for energy, the basic component of every economic activity, become double those of our competitors? Simply put, it won’t be possible.

If, however, when Donald Trump’s term in office is done, this country moves quickly to recover its capacity for economic rationality, it should be able to regain some version of its place in the world economy. For once the United States rejoins the green energy revolution, it can use its formidable engineering ingenuity to accelerate the development of this transformative technology — simultaneously reducing the CO2 emissions that are choking the planet and securing the livelihoods of average American workers in the bargain.

Stacey Geis There’s federal enforcement, EPA does enforcement, DOJ does.","Terry Gerton EPA enforcement cases have plummeted, even as noncompliance rates climb. Now, a major staffing cut at the Justice Department’s environmental section and a federal shutdown that paused inspections leave enforcement at a crossroads. Federal News Network’s Eric White spoke with former EPA Deputy Assistant Administrator Stacey Geis about the resource drain crippling environmental enforcement and whether states can fill the widening gap.

Eric White You know, as far as EPA enforcement, environmental enforcement from a federal perspective, things were kind of on a downward trend already and then with a slight bump. And now the first few months of the Trump administration, DOGE came in, the EPA was certainly on the list of agencies that they felt they could take some action against. What is the state of federal environmental enforcement right now? Let’s begin there.

Stacey Geis I think it’s important to understand the context of your question, meaning what is the state of environmental enforcement been, say, for the last 15 years generally and the landscape we are in right now? Back in, I think it was 2019, but there was a report that was done by Cynthia Giles, who was head of the office of enforcement and compliance assurance at EPA back in the Obama administration. And she went off to Harvard and did a report that showed that the level of significant noncompliance in the United States is surprising. And the numbers are that generally most facilities that have permits to pollute are 25% out of compliance, 25% of those companies are out of compliance with existing laws, regs or permits. And that for the facilities that emit the most hazardous air pollutants, the numbers were up to 50%, 75% noncompliance. So I say it because you’re starting from a place where we have more noncompliance than I think we would all expect. And of course, there could be a lot of reasons for that, including it could be laws that are tough to know how to comply with. So there’s a host of reasons. But I say that because it’s important to then put that into context of where we are now. Back during the Bush administration, Bush II, EPA was doing up to 6,000 enforcement cases a year. And then there was a very big decrease starting in the Obama years, and it just kind of kept going down, where they really decreased resources EPA’s enforcement. And now, you know, when the last administration came in and tried to revitalize EPA, hired hundreds of people, including in the enforcement division, and the numbers started going back up. But still, so in 2024, there were about 1,800 cases, civil enforcement cases that were concluded. So now we are in this, in the last 2025. What we’ve seen is two things. One, a reprioritization of this administration when it comes to what type of enforcement they want to do. And so a lot of folks, including the Department of Justice and the Environmental and Natural Resources Division were, on day one, reassigned to do other things, including immigration. And then of course, there was a whole host of terminations, administrative leaves, people who resigned, and then I think thousands who took the “fork in the road.” So we have an incredible resource drain right now at EPA. We also have it at the Department of Justice, which is obviously the partner that does a lot of the enforcement. So I would say where we are right now is that we will see in December, that’s when EPA has to announce, or generally for the last 10 years has announced, its enforcement results, its annual enforcement results. Meaning: how many civil cases were done, how many criminal cases, how many hundreds of millions of pounds of pollution were removed in the United States because of those enforcement actions? Those numbers will come out in December and it will be very interesting to see what those numbers are compared to prior years.

Eric White Let’s talk a little bit about the manpower aspect of this. What does proper environmental enforcement require? Does it need a lot of attorneys, investigators? I imagine that these aren’t easy cases to make, proving causation and whether or not who is to blame for environmental pollution, that can probably be tough given that it can be hard to obtain hard evidence. Can you just expand upon how, you know, just having workforce cuts in general to environmental enforcement, whether it is EPA or DOJ, and the effect that that just has on environmental enforcement in general.

Stacey Geis There’s federal enforcement, EPA does enforcement, DOJ does. There’s also states that do that, and we can talk about that later in terms of how potentially whether we will see the states gap-filling because of what we think will be a lack of federal enforcement. But going to your question, it is a whole team that exists to put together an enforcement case, and it starts with the inspectors. And those are also part of the Office of Enforcement. So you have inspectors who just routinely go out — like with any regulation, whether it’s OSHA, they go and they inspect the facilities for compliance. It starts there. And that’s one thing, for example, that’s paused during the shutdown, inspections are paused. But it’s the inspections that then are one of the key ways that an agency finds out that a facility may not be in compliance. And then that starts — you may have investigators who come in and start investigating further. You have to have scientists. You have to have hydrologists. You have to have people who know air regulations, who can come in and ascertain whether or not this really non-compliance. What level? Is this something that rises to the level of an enforcement action? And if so, what kind of enforcement action? Is it something that it should be a minor fine and they’re going to fix it? Or is it’s something that’s lying, cheating, stealing, and they are being deceptive, bypassing the pollution scrubber, and you could be looking at a criminal case. So you have inspectors, you have investigators, and then you have all the attorneys both at EPA and the Department of Justice. EPA has its own enforcement program where they do kind of those more minor, what we call administrative enforcement actions, where it’s going to be a fine and course-correcting and getting the company back into compliance. And then if it turns out the violations require a more serious enforcement, whether civil or criminal, it’ll be referred to the Department of Justice. And those Department of Justice attorneys then bring the cases to court. So that’s why the incredible drain we’re seeing in resources at DOJ as well — and I can give you numbers on that, but the environmental section is down, I think 50% to 60% of what it was in January — means understandably less resources to develop the case and less resources prosecute.

Eric White We’re speaking with Stacey Geis. She is a senior counsel with Crowell and Moring, also former deputy assistant administrator at the Environmental Protection Agency. You mentioned something in your first answer regarding how compliance could be tied to … it’s really, really hard to be in compliance, right? Especially when you’re operating a facility that is dealing with a lot of different chemicals. I mean, you know, just forming compliance, sometimes the drain comes from the people that you’re trying to enforce the regulations on, just because they need that expertise in order to reach compliance. Are there enough compliance experts to go around and also, how tough are these regulations to be in compliance? Are certain industries just going to always be having to deal with this?

Stacey Geis That is a question that we could have a whole day on that, in terms of how to craft good regulations that both are easy for the company to understand and comply with and easy to enforce. What I will say, though, is one of the challenges with the shutdown — because people are asking, what is the impact of the shutdown? I mean, the industry is facing incredible uncertainty. With the shutdown, what is paused, both at EPA and DOJ, are most enforcement actions. Criminal enforcement actions continue under their various shutdown plans, and it’s always been that way. And there’ll still be enforcement when it comes down to imminent and substantial threats to public harm or the environment. That is a very small subset. One thing that the Office of Enforcement does — it’s called the Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance, because not only does it enforce the laws, it’s there to provide compliance assistance to the companies, to help them. We want them to comply you, we as a public want companies to comply, right? And we want to have agencies, federal or state, that are assisting them in helping understand those regulations so they can comply. Right now, I don’t know if they called up EPA or one of the regions if they’re going to get the person, because they’re furloughed, to answer those questions. So one thing with this shutdown is not only does it mean that enforcement’s not going forward, but there’s a real uncertainty that the industry is facing right now, too, in terms of their cases aren’t moving forward, they can’t get in touch, they may have compliance questions they cannot get answered. So it actually impacts anyone who is affected by environmental regulations, meaning affected by pollution.

Eric White When you were in your position at EPA, how often were you all paying attention to those numbers? I’m just wondering about, you now, sometimes we can get caught up in, “well, the numbers increase that must mean that everything is on the up and up,” or you know, numbers are down as you had mentioned, when they’re severely down, something is definitely going on. What was the push and pull between quality versus quantity there, as far as the number of enforcement cases that you all were actually pursuing? And how did that factor into your analysis of whether or not you felt you were doing a good enough job or not?

Stacey Geis The question you want to address whenever you’re doing enforcement is going after the most harm, right? And you have limited resources. And then any unlawful violation, but certainly one of like a public and health and safety regulation, which is what pollution regulations really are, is how do you take these limited resources and best use them to enforce laws in a way that will alter behavior going forward, not just that company that may be out of compliance, but the entire industry? And so that is the challenge and always the work you’re doing is, how do you use those resources effectively and efficiently? And so while numbers matter to some extent in terms of showing like exactly what, what cases are being done, how many inspections are being done, there’s certainly a metric by which you want to use it to assess how your programs are going. You also are always looking and doing a harm analysis. Focusing on which of the cases rise to the level of the greatest harm, that maybe a federal response could be needed versus maybe the state could handle it. So that is always the calculus, it’s sort of this balance, right? So it’s never that the numbers mean everything, but that’s why you combine those numbers with, okay, so this is how many cases you prosecuted, this is many civil cases you did … that’s why when they bring the numbers, and that’s why the December numbers will be so important, is they do things like the on the ground metrics. How much pollution was reduced, was cleaned up, because of those enforcement actions? That’s a good metric. And one we’re going to want to look at. Because again, the goal is to abate the harm.

Eric White I don’t want to get you in any trouble, and you can talk as vague as you’d like, but I was wondering if we could maybe get some insight on a particular case. Who was your Al Capone? Who is your white whale that you were able to get one time? Like I said, you don’t have to mention any specifics, but is there anything that you can recall, an insight into what you saw one time and you were to successfully get them either in compliance or successfully prosecute any sort of criminal malfeasance?

Stacey Geis I mean, I can certainly talk about the defeat devices and the sort of “VW-gate” matters — that was where the company was intentionally altering the emissions control to allow the trucks or the vehicles to pollute more than the laws, regulations and permits allowed. And that was a billion-dollar criminal civil case. VW was not the only one. So those cases were still going forward while in the last couple of years. And even in the last year, there was one against Cummins, and this is public, it’s huge, they made all the Ram trucks. I think they paid over $1 billion. And then there was once against Hino, that’s public, that was a criminal-civil matter — they were called the subsidiary of Toyota. But again, those are really big cases where you’re really addressing a systemic issue. And again, bringing those cases, having very high fines, and even some of those cases being criminal is hopefully a deterrent and a message to other companies of, hey, if you’re going to try to unlawfully alter the systems of your software and your cars to pollute beyond what is allowed, that there will be enforcement there. So I think that was almost like a bigger effort that went over years, but that was something that happened in the last couple of years that I think were significant cases.

Eric White And finishing up here, we’ve seen the Trump administration decrease the resources in areas that they feel have too much government oversight in them; CFPB comes to mind. And what I’m feeling is, is that a major Supreme Court case is probably in our future of determining what an executive branch can do and what the threshold is. You know there are environmental laws that say the federal government is responsible for enforcement in this area; at what point do you deplete enough resources where a reasonable person can feel the government is not fulfilling that law? I just was curious about getting your thoughts on that, and if that is in fact in our future of some major case that may set the precedent for that.",https://federalnewsnetwork.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/EPA_Coal_Ash_51880-scaled.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 19:59:23.677011

Waste Management recently announced it would accept to-go cups. Rumpke Waste and Recycling has been taking them for two years now. Both companies provide recycling for multiple Indiana cities and towns or offer services like drop-off locations. Hillary Ladig with Rumpke said more demand for these materials has made recycling these cups possible.

“Paper mills kind of put out this announcement that they want cups. Take them in, and let's start recovering this very valuable material that we just simply didn't have a long term home for previously,"" she said.

There's also better technology to sort polypropylene, also known as plastic #5. Some to-go cups are polypropylene, but so are many tubs for things like yogurt, sour cream and imitation butter.

""The robotics in our Cincinnati recycling facility are trained to look for those specific shapes. And over time, as they do more picks or sort that material out more frequently, they become smarter. They learn what to look for,"" Ladig said.

When China decided to no longer accept low-level recycling from the U.S. in 2017, that forced the American recycling industry to innovate. Ladig said Rumpke has always been fortunate to have several manufacturers that can use its recycling in the Midwest.

“But it certainly was a wake up call to those of us in the recycling industry about ensuring long-term, viable recycling programs here domestically and making sure that we are more reliant on end users here at home versus abroad,"" she said.

Check with your local recycling service to make sure they accept to-go cups before throwing them in your recycle bin.

Ladig said all cups should be rinsed. Make sure to pair like materials together. So while a paper sleeve can stay on your paper coffee cup, the plastic lid should be thrown away.

Ladig said straws should go in the trash. Any plastic smaller than a business card likely won't make it through the sorting process.

EPA had earlier invited industries to apply for such exemptions via simple e-mail.

The action follows moves by the administration last week to weaken federal rules protecting millions of acres of wetlands and streams and roll back protections for imperiled species and the places they live. In a separate action, the Interior Department proposed new oil drilling off the California and Florida coasts for the first time in decades, advancing a project that critics say could harm coastal communities and ecosystems.

The Environmental Protection Agency finalized a rule last year that imposed strict standards for soot pollution, saying that reducing fine particle matter from motor vehicles and industrial sources could prevent thousands of premature deaths a year.

Twenty-five Republican-led states and a host of business groups filed lawsuits seeking to block the rule in court. A suit led by attorneys general from Kentucky and West Virginia argued that the EPA rule would raise costs for manufacturers, utilities and families and could block new manufacturing plants.

In a court filing this week, the EPA essentially took the side of the challengers, saying the Biden-era rule was done “without the rigorous, stepwise process that Congress required” and was therefore unlawful.

“EPA now confesses error and urges this Court to vacate the Rule” before Feb. 7, the agency said in a brief filed with the U.S. District Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Vacating the Biden-era rule would revert the soot standard to a level established a dozen years ago under the Obama administration. The Trump EPA is set to propose its own rule early next year.

Environmental groups said the agency’s action — which follows a pledge by EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to roll back the soot rule and dozens of other environmental regulations — threatens public health and undermines its obligations under the Clean Air Act.

“EPA’s motion is a blatant attempt to avoid legal requirements for a rollback, in this case for one of the most impactful actions the agency has taken in recent years to protect public health,” said Hayden Hashimoto, an attorney at the nonprofit Clean Air Task Force.

EPA press secretary Carolyn Holran said the 2024 rule would cost “hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars to American citizens if allowed to be implemented.” The rule “was not based on the full analysis of available science that the statute requires,” she said, adding that EPA will conduct a thorough review as required by the Clean Air Act.

The Biden rule set maximum levels of 9 micrograms of fine particle pollution per cubic meter of air, down from 12 micrograms established under former President Barack Obama. The rule sets an air quality level that states and counties must achieve in the coming years to reduce pollution from power plants, vehicles, industrial sites and wildfires.

“An abundance of scientific evidence shows that going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act,” Hashimoto said.

EPA said in creating the rule that the new standard would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits and 4,500 premature deaths, adding up to about $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. Then-EPA head Michael Regan said the rule would especially benefit children, older adults and those with heart and lung conditions, as well as those living near highways, factories and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean-air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of healthy communities at Earthjustice, a nonprofit law firm that represents environmental groups in the legal case.

President Donald Trump “has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money,” Simms said, adding under Zeldin, the EPA “has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives or serving children, families or communities.”

Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Energy Future Renewable energy storage solutions through battery recycling represent a critical convergence of clean energy technology and sustainable material management.","The transition to renewable energy depends on reliable storage solutions, and lithium-ion battery recycling fundamentals are playing a crucial role in creating sustainable energy storage systems. As solar and wind power generation continues to expand globally, the demand for efficient battery energy storage systems has reached unprecedented levels. The National Renewable Energy Laboratory emphasizes that transformative energy storage solutions require materials that are both high-performing and sustainably sourced.

Battery recycling has emerged as a critical component in developing renewable energy storage infrastructure, providing recycled materials that meet the highest performance standards while reducing environmental impact. The integration of recycled battery materials into renewable energy storage systems represents a significant advancement toward achieving a truly circular economy in clean energy technology.

The Growing Demand for Renewable Energy Storage Systems

Global renewable energy capacity continues to expand at an accelerated pace, with energy storage systems becoming essential for grid stability and reliability. The EPA's renewable energy waste management initiatives highlight the critical need for sustainable end-of-life management of energy storage components as deployment scales increase.

Large-scale battery energy storage systems now store excess electricity generated during peak renewable production periods, releasing it when demand is high or renewable generation is low. These systems require substantial quantities of critical minerals including lithium, cobalt, nickel, and graphite. Traditional mining operations struggle to meet the growing demand while maintaining sustainable practices, making recycled materials increasingly valuable for renewable energy applications.

The intermittency challenges inherent in solar and wind power generation necessitate sophisticated storage solutions that can respond rapidly to changing grid conditions. Battery energy storage systems provide the flexibility required to integrate variable renewable sources effectively, supporting grid stability while enabling higher renewable penetration levels across electric grids worldwide.

Advanced Battery Recycling Technologies for Energy Storage

Modern battery recycling technologies have evolved to produce materials specifically suited for renewable energy storage applications. GREEN HYDROREJUVENATION™ technology exemplifies these advances, converting spent battery waste directly into battery-grade materials without the energy-intensive processes traditionally required.

The NREL-ACE Green collaboration demonstrates how advanced recycling processes can economically recover materials from various battery chemistries, including lithium iron phosphate batteries commonly used in large-scale energy storage systems. These innovations enable the production of high-purity recycled materials that meet the stringent requirements of renewable energy storage applications.

Hydrometallurgical recycling processes have proven particularly effective for energy storage applications, achieving recovery rates exceeding 95% for critical materials. These processes produce battery-grade lithium carbonate, refined nickel and cobalt compounds, and high-quality graphite suitable for new battery manufacturing, directly supporting the renewable energy storage supply chain.

Environmental Benefits of Recycled Materials in Energy Storage

The environmental advantages of using recycled materials in renewable energy storage systems are substantial and well-documented. EPA research on lithium-ion battery recycling indicates that recycled battery materials can reduce greenhouse gas emissions by up to 90% compared to virgin material production, significantly improving the overall environmental profile of energy storage systems.

Recycling processes minimize the environmental impact associated with critical mineral extraction, reducing habitat destruction, water consumption, and chemical pollution typically associated with mining operations. The NREL manufacturing analysis confirms that incorporating recycled materials into energy storage systems substantially reduces their lifecycle carbon footprint while maintaining performance standards.

Water usage represents another critical environmental consideration, as traditional mining operations consume vast quantities of water resources. Recycling processes require significantly less water while producing materials of comparable or superior quality for energy storage applications. This reduction in water consumption becomes particularly important as renewable energy deployment scales to meet global climate goals.

Supply Chain Resilience Through Recycling

The development of domestic recycling capabilities enhances supply chain resilience for renewable energy storage systems by reducing dependence on volatile international markets for critical minerals. Sustainable battery supply chain strategies increasingly emphasize local material recovery to ensure consistent access to essential materials.

Recycling operations provide a reliable source of critical materials that can be scaled to meet growing demand from renewable energy storage deployments. The NREL LIBRA technical analysis projects that recycling could supply significant portions of future material demand for energy storage systems, reducing price volatility and supply disruption risks.

Strategic material recovery through recycling creates buffer stocks of essential minerals within domestic supply chains, providing security against geopolitical disruptions and export restrictions. This supply chain diversification proves particularly valuable for renewable energy storage deployments that require consistent material availability for sustained operation and maintenance.

Economic Advantages of Recycling for Renewable Energy Storage

The economic benefits of using recycled materials in renewable energy storage systems extend beyond simple cost savings to encompass broader value creation opportunities. Recycling operations generate new revenue streams while reducing disposal costs, creating positive economic impacts throughout the energy storage value chain.

Manufacturing costs for energy storage systems decrease when incorporating recycled materials, as recycling processes often produce materials at lower costs than equivalent virgin materials. These cost reductions enable more competitive pricing for renewable energy storage installations, accelerating deployment and improving project economics for renewable energy developers.

The domestic recycling industry creates high-value employment opportunities in advanced manufacturing and materials processing, supporting economic development in regions transitioning toward clean energy economies. Local recycling operations generate economic multiplier effects through supply chain integration and technology development activities.

Closed-Loop Systems for Renewable Energy Applications

Closed-loop lithium recovery systems represent the ultimate in sustainable material management for renewable energy storage, creating self-sustaining cycles where materials flow continuously from used batteries back into new energy storage systems without waste generation.

These closed-loop approaches optimize material utilization efficiency while minimizing environmental impact, aligning perfectly with the sustainability goals driving renewable energy adoption. Advanced recycling technologies enable the preservation of material quality through multiple use cycles, maintaining performance standards essential for reliable energy storage operation.

The implementation of closed-loop systems for renewable energy storage creates long-term material security while supporting circular economy principles. These systems reduce the overall material intensity of renewable energy deployments, making large-scale renewable energy storage more sustainable and economically viable.

Integration with Grid-Scale Storage Systems

Grid-scale renewable energy storage systems benefit significantly from the reliable material supply chains enabled by advanced recycling technologies. These large installations require substantial quantities of battery materials with consistent quality specifications, making recycled materials an attractive option for utility-scale deployments.

The modular nature of modern recycling operations allows for scalable material production that can grow alongside renewable energy storage deployment. This scalability ensures that material supply can match the rapid expansion of renewable energy storage capacity without creating supply bottlenecks or price pressures.

Technical specifications for grid-scale storage systems align well with the capabilities of advanced recycling technologies, which produce materials meeting or exceeding the performance requirements for utility-scale applications. The proven reliability of recycled materials in demanding applications provides confidence for grid operators investing in renewable energy storage infrastructure.

Future Trends in Sustainable Energy Storage

The convergence of advanced recycling technologies with renewable energy storage represents a fundamental shift toward truly sustainable energy systems. EV battery supply chain sustainability innovations demonstrate how integrated recycling approaches can transform entire sectors while supporting renewable energy goals.

Emerging recycling technologies continue to improve recovery rates and material quality while reducing energy consumption and environmental impact. These advances position recycled materials as preferred options for renewable energy storage applications, creating competitive advantages for sustainable energy storage solutions.

Regulatory frameworks increasingly support the integration of recycled materials into renewable energy infrastructure through incentives and requirements that favor sustainable material sourcing. The EPA Extended Producer Responsibility framework exemplifies these policy trends that will drive greater adoption of recycled materials in energy storage applications.

Technology Integration and Performance Optimization

The successful integration of recycled materials into renewable energy storage systems requires sophisticated technology platforms that can accommodate variable material inputs while maintaining consistent performance outputs. Advanced battery management systems optimize the utilization of recycled materials to ensure reliable operation under diverse grid conditions.

Quality control processes for recycled materials have evolved to meet the demanding specifications required for renewable energy storage applications. These processes ensure that recycled materials maintain the purity levels and performance characteristics essential for long-term storage system reliability and efficiency.

Performance monitoring systems track the behavior of recycled materials in operational renewable energy storage installations, providing valuable feedback for continuous improvement of recycling processes and material specifications. This data-driven approach enables ongoing optimization of recycled material integration in energy storage systems.

Global Impact and Scalability

The global impact of integrating recycled materials into renewable energy storage systems extends far beyond individual installations to encompass systemic changes in how clean energy infrastructure is developed and maintained. International cooperation in recycling standards and technology sharing accelerates the adoption of sustainable practices across global energy storage markets.

Scalability considerations for recycled material production align with the exponential growth projected for renewable energy storage deployments worldwide. The modular and distributed nature of modern recycling technologies enables proportional scaling to meet growing material demand without creating infrastructure bottlenecks.

The circular economy perspective on battery recycling demonstrates how sustainable material cycles can support unlimited renewable energy growth while minimizing environmental impact. This approach creates a foundation for long-term renewable energy expansion that remains environmentally and economically sustainable.

Conclusion: Building a Sustainable Energy Future

Renewable energy storage solutions through battery recycling represent a critical convergence of clean energy technology and sustainable material management. The integration of recycled materials into energy storage systems creates multiple benefits including reduced environmental impact, enhanced supply chain resilience, and improved economic viability for renewable energy deployments.

Advanced recycling technologies have matured to the point where recycled materials can fully meet the performance requirements of demanding renewable energy storage applications while providing significant advantages over virgin materials. The continued development of these technologies ensures that recycled materials will play an increasingly important role in supporting global renewable energy expansion.

The successful implementation of recycling-based renewable energy storage solutions requires continued innovation, supportive policy frameworks, and industry collaboration to realize the full potential of sustainable energy storage systems. These integrated approaches provide a pathway toward achieving renewable energy goals while maintaining environmental stewardship and economic sustainability.",https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/656f4b27b9760a4c6f6b2bd1/69135e1697a1dc61dfb19811_image-gen%20(20).png,N,,2025-11-25 19:02:12.161435

Loren McDonald, CEO and chief analyst at Chargeonomics, compared today’s EV market to the early days of cellular technology.
“In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said.
Since 2000, the clean energy manufacturing sector has drawn nearly $250 billion in investments, most announced since mid-2021, during Joe Biden’s presidency.
“Since 2021, the United States has experienced an unprecedented clean energy manufacturing boom, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to communities across the country,” according to the report.","It’s been doom and gloom galore for the EV sector of late.

Amid slower demand and federal policy changes deprioritizing electrification, the industry is shedding jobs and delaying or canceling projects. In fact, 2025 has seen more clean energy manufacturing investments canceled than announced—a stark change from just a few years ago, when the US was on the cusp of an EV and battery manufacturing boom.

But some industry analysts say that despite some very real pain in the short term, the future remains bright for zero-emissions vehicles. In the meantime, buckle up for a bumpy ride.

Loren McDonald, CEO and chief analyst at Chargeonomics, compared today’s EV market to the early days of cellular technology.

“What history has told us now is we were actually in the BlackBerry phase, and still are. The product is good, but it’s not compelling enough for average consumers,” he said. “We haven’t actually reached the phase with the product that’s more like the iPhone, where everybody goes, ‘Oh my God, I need to have an EV, it’s so much better than my gas car.’”

Pump the brakes

In October, General Motors said it planned to indefinitely lay off 1,750 workers and temporarily lay off another 1,670 as it trims EV and battery production at plants in Michigan, Ohio, and Tennessee. Part of the plan includes temporarily idling GM’s Factory Zero plant in Detroit, which produces multiple EVs, and then resuming production with only one shift, according to InsideEVs. The production pause at two EV battery plants is slated to last until mid-2026.

“In response to slower near-term EV adoption and an evolving regulatory environment, General Motors is realigning EV capacity,” the company said. “Despite these changes, GM remains committed to our US manufacturing footprint.”

EV maker Rivian also recently announced 600 job cuts, with CEO RJ Scaringe reportedly telling employees: “With the changing operating backdrop, we had to rethink how we are scaling our go-to-market functions.”

And as The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month, Ford is considering cutting its electric F-150 Lightning amid weak sales and mounting losses in its EV business. The WSJ also noted Stellantis’s canceled plans for an electric version of its full-size Ram pickup truck earlier this year and sluggish sales of Tesla’s Cybertruck.

Freudenberg e-Power Systems recently announced the closure of two EV battery plants in Michigan, resulting in 324 layoffs, The Hill reported; company leaders cited “the decrease in demand for heavy-duty electric and hybrid electric vehicles in North America.”

Rest of World published an analysis in September reporting that more than 30,000 workers had lost their jobs at EV manufacturers “and related industries worldwide over the past year” amid trade policy changes, weaker growth, geopolitical tensions, higher interest rates, and a more competitive market.

Research firm Atlas Public Policy, in partnership with the Environmental Defense Fund, recently tallied total cancellations representing nearly $21 billion in investments in clean energy manufacturing in the first three quarters of 2025. Battery projects have taken the biggest hit: 11% of announced projects were scrapped, mostly this year.

One bright spot: The authors noted that about four-fifths of active investments were under construction or operational, and Q3 had net positive investments. Since 2000, the clean energy manufacturing sector has drawn nearly $250 billion in investments, most announced since mid-2021, during Joe Biden’s presidency.

“Since 2021, the United States has experienced an unprecedented clean energy manufacturing boom, bringing hundreds of thousands of jobs to communities across the country,” according to the report. “However, the first nine months of 2025 have seen a stark change. Trump administration policies and cuts to clean energy tax credits have slowed growth considerably and threatened progress.”

The pullback comes on the heels of President Donald Trump’s tax and budget bill, which set Sept. 30 as the expiration date for federal tax credits on certain EV purchases. Atlas analysts pointed to “funding cuts and policy shifts” as the driving forces behind “cancellations of $20.8 billion and nearly 27,300 anticipated manufacturing jobs in 2025 alone.”

“When we think about the cancellations, it’s numbers for sure, but also this has a negative impact on communities that were anticipating preparing for economic opportunities from these clean energy projects, whether it was through the anticipated jobs themselves, maybe workforce development programs that the company and the community had agreed to establish,” Matthew Vining, a policy analyst at Atlas, told us.

Idling

If this all sounds bleak for the prospect of carbon-free transportation, some industry analysts view it as a short-term correction. What’s really happening, McDonald contended, is more complicated than just the fallout of tax credits going away. He sees the recent pullback as a result of how legacy automakers approached the launch of their first-generation EVs.

“[The end of the tax credits is] a real thing, but the automakers are using it as an excuse to pull back,” he said. “It allows them to take a deep breath and go, ‘Phew, now we can focus on selling those $80,000 fully loaded gas Chevy Tahoes and things like that,’ while they actually work on building their generation two, generation three EV models that are truly compelling.”

In some cases, legacy automakers converted existing internal combustion engine vehicles to electric rather than developing new platforms from the ground up. Many are now working on next-gen EVs built on new platforms. Ford, for example, is introducing an entirely new manufacturing process to support production of a smaller, more affordable electric truck.

GM, meantime, is preparing to relaunch the mass market-oriented Chevy Bolt, and Rivian is slated to debut its more-affordable R2 lineup next year, among other upcoming launches.

As McDonald sees it, the US’s first EV phase was defined by products that didn’t match what mainstream consumers were looking for. Automakers found some success, to be sure—Rivian’s R1S in the luxury segment, for example. And half of the Cadillac brand’s sales are now electric.

But the next EV era, McDonald said, must feature mass-market EVs with lower price tags and better software experiences.

“If you get the car right, and it’s a fit with the market, and you price it correctly, there’s solid demand and market for it,” McDonald said. “We just don’t have enough of those vehicles yet. And that’s the problem—not EVs.”","https://cdn.sanity.io/images/bl383u0v/production/1f862a4beb7dc8b49a20c1864db5c627c189415b-1500x1000.jpg?rect=0,106,1500,788&w=1200&h=630&q=70&fit=crop&auto=format",N,,2025-11-25 17:01:35.591886

Efforts to ease their path from Long Island Sound — including the installation of a fish ladder alongside the dam in the 1990s — have largely failed, officials say, and Kinneytown Dam remains a major migratory roadblock on the Naugatuck’s watershed.
The project is the largest active dam removal effort currently underway in Connecticut, which has one of the largest concentrations of dams in the United States.
A spokesperson for the federal agency said Monday that it has yet to receive a removal application related to the Kinneytown Dam.
A decade ago, DEEP completed work on a $6.3 million fish bypass on the Tingue Dam less than 2 miles upstream from Kinneytown.","For well over a century, fish making spawning runs up the Naugatuck River have had their journey cut short just 16 miles inland at the Kinneytown Dam in Ansonia.

Above the dam, the river flows relatively unencumbered from Thomaston 30 miles to the north, where it draws from dozens of tributaries that serve as vital habitats for spawning shad, lampreys, eels and Atlantic salmon.

Efforts to ease their path from Long Island Sound — including the installation of a fish ladder alongside the dam in the 1990s — have largely failed, officials say, and Kinneytown Dam remains a major migratory roadblock on the Naugatuck’s watershed.

“Without the removal of this dam, it can never be a river,” said Kevin Zak, a local advocate who has led efforts for years to restore the Naugatuck River, which he says behaves more like a “landlocked lake.”

“It looks like a river, and you would think that it acts like a river, but it doesn’t,” Zak said. “You can’t put a price tag on a free-flowing river, the economic and quality of life benefits are just astounding. You don’t have to build it, it’s already there.”

Earlier this month, the Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank announced that it had closed a deal to purchase the dam and surrounding property from a private company in Washington state for $1, a critical step forward in what officials expect will be a $60 million effort to remove the dam and restore the river to its natural course.

The project is the largest active dam removal effort currently underway in Connecticut, which has one of the largest concentrations of dams in the United States.

Many of the dams being removed date back to Connecticut’s industrial past, when rivers powered mills across the state.

“We have more than 4,000 dams in the state, and they’re being removed on a regular basis because they’re no longer functional,” said Alicea Charamut, executive director of the Rivers Alliance of Connecticut. “They’re deteriorating, and it’s important that they are removed before they cause too much damage.”

James Fowler, a spokesman for the state’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection, said that removing the Kinneytown Dam will “provide significant ecological, recreational, and community benefits, including for nearby environmental justice communities.” The agency has contributed $1.6 million toward the removal effort.

The dam, which was built in 1840s, continued to operate as a hydroelectric facility until 2020 when its generators were turned off by its former owners, Enel North America.

Enel sold the dam later that year to a firm called HydroLand Inc., which stated its intent to repair and modernize the dam in order to continue producing electricity. But that plan never came to fruition, leaving the dam to languish while local officials began exploring ways to purchase the dam to tear it down. (In the meantime, Hydroland transferred ownership of the dam to a related entity based out of Washington state, Trimaran Energy.)

“That went from a long period of time of these guys still trying to squeeze some dollars out of us in this acquisition to acquiring it for dollar,” said Rick Dunne, the president of the Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank.

Timothy Carlsen, who is listed in official documents as a point-of-contact for both HydroLand and Trimaran, did not respond to multiple requests for comment for this story.

The Connecticut Brownfield Land Bank is based in Waterbury and has worked on over a dozen environmental assessment and remediation projects throughout the state. Dunne, its leader, is also executive director of the Naugatuck Valley Council of Governments.

Concerns with the dam aren’t limited to the obstruction of migratory fish. Advocates and local officials have also worried that the dam’s deteriorating condition could result in a failure that would send millions of gallons of water rushing downstream.

When the region was hit with devastating floods in 2023, the torrent of water flowing over the dam washed away much of an earthen berm carrying Metro-North’s Waterbury branch line, resulting in millions of dollars of damage.

The berm also separates the river from a canal that flows into an artificial pond containing contaminated sediments leftover from the days when Ansonia was a center of brass manufacturing. Flooding could spread that contamination.

“It was only a matter of a few more inches of rain, or another hour or two of heavy rain, it could have completely breached,” Dunne said. “So we’re really worried about catastrophic release at this point because we found out things about the integrity of this dam since we’ve been in there that are really scary.”

Zak, the advocate who now serves as president of Naugatuck River Revival, said the dam has also suffered from a series of longstanding flaws related to the design of the fish ladder that was built in 1999 at the behest of the the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, in order to allow the dam to continue operating as a hydroelectric facility.

Videos filmed by Zak and posted online show fish struggling to make their way up river past the dam, while whole sections of the ladder are filled with debris.

“It was a terrible design,” Zak said. “Fish ladders, if they’re short and straight, are moderately okay. This is neither. This is extremely long… and it has a zigzag entrance, so the fish have to find it and navigate to it. Then they have to go up, down, back. It’s stupid.”

A 2010 fire in one of the dam’s two generation units caused further damage to the passageway, according to a complaint submitted to FERC in 2021 by the NVCOG and Naugatuck River Revival. By 2020, a report by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service found that the numbers of some fish species using the ladder — including alewife, shad and brown trout — had fallen by over 90%.

Enel North America, the company that owned the dam at the time the fish ladder was installed, did not respond to a request for comment last week.

Dunne said that more than $50 million has already been committed to the project from state and federal sources. More than half of that, $25 million, is state bonding approved by lawmakers earlier this year that’s awaiting final approval from the State Bond Commission.

The project has also been awarded a $15 million grant from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Association as well as $4 million in federal Clean Water Act funding. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is also spending $1.5 million to test the sediment behind the dam for contaminants.

As part of the effort to remove the dam, Dunne said the land bank also plans to ask officials in Ansonia and Seymour to waive any taxes that went unpaid by the dam’s previous owners.

So far, Dunne said none of the money for the dam removal has been affeccted by President Donald Trump’s budget cutbacks. (Earlier this year, NVCOG had a $5.7 million federal grant to complete portions of the Naugatuck River Greenway Trail rescinded by the Trump administration.)

The land bank must also receive formal approval from FERC, which regulates hydroelectric projects, to remove the dam. A spokesperson for the federal agency said Monday that it has yet to receive a removal application related to the Kinneytown Dam.

Absent any delays in the delivery of federal funding or regulatory approvals, Dunne said he expects crews to begin work next year on relocating a series of sewer mains that will be affected by the project.

From there, Dunne said removal of the dam structure could take place as soon as 2027, with final work on the project wrapping up the following year.

“Demolishing the dam is a relatively simple, straightforward and short process,” Dunne said. “It’s dealing with the sediments, dealing with the flows and dealing with the reconstruction, the rehabilitation and restoration of all the river features… that’s where the work is.”

If successful, the demolition of the Kinneytown Dam would follow similar dam removal projects along Connecticut’s Scantic and Farmington Rivers, as well as a string of other projects along the Naugatuck River.

A decade ago, DEEP completed work on a $6.3 million fish bypass on the Tingue Dam less than 2 miles upstream from Kinneytown.

The bypass, which is surrounded by a park, is wider than a traditional fish ladder and features a more gradual incline to mimic the natural flow of the river. But despite praise for its design, advocates like Zak say it is of little use to fish if they never make it past Kinneytown.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-80243/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/2025_1121_sr_kinneytowndam_017-771x5141764107030.jpg?h=65a9384d&itok=8ITsyUyr,N,,2025-11-25 17:03:57.382264

The lawsuit, filed in the 19th Judicial District Court in East Baton Rouge Parish, claims laws passed since 2020 violate the state constitution by allowing companies engaged in carbon capture and storage to use eminent domain for private gain.

The plaintiffs include the nonprofit group Save My Louisiana, composed of several property owners in Rapides, Vernon, Allen and Beauregard parishes. They want the laws declared unconstitutional and state officials ordered to halt all permitting and regulatory actions related to Class VI injection wells and pipelines across the state.

The lawsuit names the state of Louisiana as the defendant through Gov. Jeff Landry and Department of Conservation and Energy Secretary Justin Davidson. The plaintiffs argue Louisiana’s carbon capture and sequestration laws violate private property rights, allow improper use of eminent domain for private gain and fail to protect public health and safety.

Landry’s office and the Department of Conservation and Energy declined requests for comment on the lawsuit. The Center Square’s attempts to reach Save My Louisiana were unsuccessful before publication.

Louisiana is considered an attractive location for carbon storage wells due to its subsurface geology, which features deep saline aquifers and porous rock reservoirs, and because it is located in the center of manufacturing and energy hubs in the Southeast.

The state was granted primacy over Class VI carbon capture wells by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency in December 2023, giving it direct authority to permit and regulate the storage of carbon dioxide.

Around 31 carbon capture and sequestration projects are seeking state approval, mostly in central and southwest Louisiana, according to a map from the Department of Conservation and Energy.

In mid-October, after police juries in Vernon, Allen and other parishes in west central Louisiana opposed the projects, Landry issued an executive order directing the state’s Department of Energy and Conservation to suspend review of new applications to construct Class VI wells. The governor ordered the department to spend the next 45 days evaluating 33 pending permit applications.

Landry in the executive order called on all agencies, departments and local officials to collaborate on developing a road map to ensure Class VI applications follow state rules governing carbon inje",https://americanpress.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/65/2025/04/Carbon-capture.png,N,,2025-11-25 17:04:29.517553

SUBJECT: RFI Response – Accelerating Speed to Power

FROM: Bipartisan Policy Center, Energy Team

The Bipartisan Policy Center appreciates the opportunity to respond to this RFI on Accelerating Speed to Power. Through our Artificial Intelligence and Energy Project, BPC is exploring bipartisan policy opportunities at the intersection of AI, energy, and infrastructure. We are committed to forward-looking solutions that meet America’s growing electricity demand for reliable, affordable, and clean energy, while accelerating AI infrastructure development and optimizing AI’s use in the United States energy sector.

In April 2025, BPC launched an AI and Energy Task Force composed of tech leaders, power producers, utilities, scholars, nongovernmental organizations, and industry experts. The focus areas of the task force include electricity demand and grid reliability, AI innovation, and AI applications in energy. From ensuring grid stability to optimizing clean energy development, AI can be a powerful tool if the right policies are in place. BPC and the task force are researching and developing policy solutions that foster a competitive edge in AI while ensuring an abundant energy supply for generations to come.

This RFI response is informed by recent BPC publications related to AI and Energy, including BPC’s September 2024 publication, Accelerating AI Sustainability and Innovation at the Department of Energy and February 2025 publication, Electricity Demand Growth and Data Centers: A Guide for the Perplexed.

I. Use of DOE Funding, Financing, and Technical Assistance

BPC recommends the following for DOE to support development and deployment of large-scale generation and transmission projects.

Collaborating with industry to develop energy-efficient AI systems

Investing in AI applications to accelerate energy and fuel technology development

Enhancing the reliability of electricity grid and energy assets with AI tools

Delivering reliable, affordable, clean power to meet data center electricity needs

Centralizing DOE’s AI strategy and execution

Collaborating with industry to develop energy-efficient AI systems. The Department of Energy should focus R&D investments in energy-efficient AI systems to complement private sector investments. In recent years, industry partners have invested resources into developing chip efficiency and networking components for data transfer. Historically, this work was supported by DOE and has now reached a critical juncture where the private sector is equipped and motivated to pursue additional efficiency advancements on its own.

DOE was highly successful in advancing energy efficiency of supercomputing chips by setting aggressive efficiency targets for industry to meet in its Exascale Computing Program. Moving forward, continued collaboration with industry will be important to ensure federal resources are directed to areas lacking private-sector expertise or interest. This may include hardware-software integration, optimizing AI algorithms for scientific applications, and investing in R&D for energy-efficient data centers. DOE should deepen collaborations with companies to develop energy-efficient and custom AI systems for scientific research and other application areas relevant to DOE’s mission. These partnerships should focus on AI-specific workloads, such as scientific modeling, that differ from commercial AI systems.

DOE should also invest in R&D to advance data center energy efficiency. This could include advanced cooling technologies and applications of waste heat. This should be a cross-cutting effort that builds off DOE’s existing knowledge in this field at the Office of Science, Building Technologies Office, and Federal Energy Management Program.

Investing in AI applications to accelerate energy and fuel technology development. AI has the potential to accelerate every step of the energy and fuel technology development process from R&D to manufacturing, scaleup, commercialization, adoption, and operations. DOE is well-positioned to lead the nation in developing AI R&D for these applications. DOE should build off its existing expertise to help lay the groundwork for private sector adoption of AI-based applications that enhance the energy system. This should start with close collaboration between the DOE Office of Science and applied energy offices to develop research portfolios that meaningfully incorporate AI as a tool for accelerating energy and fuel technology invention, scaleup, and deployment.

Enhancing the reliability of electricity grid and energy assets with AI tools. Beyond technology development, DOE should invest in R&D to build AI applications that improve the operations, maintenance, and management of the electricity grid and other energy assets including nuclear power plants. This could include using AI to improve forecasting of flexible generation based on weather patterns to aid in matching energy generation and load, develop more accurate models of climate impacts to enable resilient infrastructure investments, and support predictive maintenance of grid infrastructure and energy assets.

DOE should partner closely with utilities, regional transmission organizations, and other relevant private sector stakeholders in this effort to advance AI-enabled solutions that solve barriers to deployment of smart grid technologies. DOE can make investments through R&D to advance technological feasibility of AI grid applications and test beds to pilot and prove technologies in environments that mimic real-world scenarios. This could build off existing grid test beds at the DOE national labs.

Delivering reliable, affordable, clean power to meet data center electricity needs. With the increasing electricity demand from AI and data centers, DOE should support the development of power projects by supporting partnerships between project developers and AI and data center companies seeking reliable energy. DOE could help facilitate the timely development of the power projects, transmission facilities, and cost allocation frameworks that are necessary to ensuring ample supplies of power for AI and data centers. DOE support could also include assistance from the Energy Dominance Financing Program, which could supply project developers with needed capital while also providing a long-term customer that derisks demand-side challenges for nascent energy technologies that have not yet been widely deployed. This is a crucial opportunity to leverage AI and data center electricity demand to finance clean energy demonstration projects—such as advanced geothermal and advanced nuclear—to scale these nascent technologies to commercial viability.

Centralizing DOE’s AI strategy and execution. DOE should establish a single coordinating office at DOE to align research priorities and resource allocation across the department’s science and applied energy offices and 17 national labs.

II. Load Growth Trends

In February 2025, BPC published Electricity Demand Growth and Data Centers: A Guide for the Perplexed, which examines the accuracy of data center electricity demand projections and their implications for policymakers. This report noted that data centers will likely account for up to 25% of expected electricity load growth nationally through 2030, with the remaining 75% being driven by onshoring of manufacturing and increasing electrification of transportation, heating, and industrial processes. It is important to address future uncertainties from advancements or changes in computing efficiency, manufacturing capacity, and demand for AI products and services. BPC has identified the following primary drivers of new electric load:

Data centers and AI computing facilities driving multi-gigawatt demand growth

Advanced manufacturing and semiconductor fabrication plants as complementary large loads

Two major factors are expected to determine the impact of new computing applications on electricity demand in coming years:

Service Demand, as determined by the quantity of computations being performed

Computing efficiency, at determined by the amount of energy required to perform each computation.

There is evidence that data center buildout is entering a new and more contentious phase with siting issues and growing public concern. Thus, expectations that growth will continue in the next decade as rapidly as it has in the recent past are uncertain.

BPC supports efforts to improve load growth forecasting methodology through better data collection methodology, tightening criteria around how to “count” projects in the pipeline, and assigning probabilities to projects at different stages of development.

III. Grid Infrastructure Constraints

BPC has identified the following energy system constraints which are limiting the ability to serve future demand:

Long interconnection queues

Challenges with the existing permitting process

Supply chain challenges

Slow uptake of existing Grid Enhancing Technologies

Long interconnection queues. The process to connect new electricity generation to the electric grid varies significantly by state and region, ranging from 2-5 years. Aligning data center construction timelines with access to power is a challenge, prompting data center developers to favor sites with shorter interconnection queues. Some jurisdictions are considering accelerating interconnection for power to serve data centers if the operators agree to serve as flexible loads. This could increase grid reliability in regions where these projects are being considered.

Challenges with the existing Permitting process. The current permitting process for energy projects is too slow and expensive to meet our energy reliability and affordability needs. BPC’s report, Finding the Goldilocks Zone for Permitting Reform, provides a list of 70 policy ideas, ranked by level of effectiveness and controversy, that could be considered to address delays and challenges associated with permitting. Overall, BPC believes that permit reform options should simultaneously increase the efficiency of the permitting process, protect the environment, and ensure public safeguards. BPC sees strong potential for AI to support streamlining of the permitting process.

Supply chain challenges. Components required for electricity generation technologies and grid equipment are experiencing supply chain challenges. This includes delays for transformers, other grid equipment, and natural gas turbines. While these delays are not specific to powering data centers, such projects are being affected. Due to these supply chain challenges, some data center operators are seeking to procure their own generation through co-location agreements or repowering decommissioned generation facilities, including nuclear plants.

Slow uptake of existing Grid Enhancing Technologies. GETs maximize the transmission of electricity across the existing system through a family of technologies that include sensors, power flow control devices, and analytical tools. Adoption of these technologies has been inefficient due to a misalignment of incentives and lack of comfort with the application of GETs technologies on existing systems.

Sincerely,

Kathryn Kline Tyndall

And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.
Earthjustice, its clients, and partners intervened last year to defend the soot standard against court challenges from polluters and their allies.
“EPA’s soot standards are life-saving protections that are firmly grounded in bedrock Clean Air Act legal authority.
We will continue to vigorously defend these vital safeguards.” – Peter Zalzal, distinguished counsel and associate vice president for Clean Air Strategies, Environmental Defense Fund.","Washington, D.C. —Last night, in an unprecedented move, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave up defending the national, health-based limits on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), also known as soot, that EPA strengthened last year. The EPA’s court filing asks the U.S, Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to strike down the soot standard.

Soot, made up of tiny toxic particles that lodge deep in the lungs, results in severe health harms, including premature death, and comes from sources like vehicle exhaust pipes, power plants, and factories.

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 — or the soot standards — are a cornerstone of the Clean Air Act. After over a decade without updates, the EPA followed the advice of independent experts and extensive scientific evidence and strengthened the annual soot standard to better protect public health, reducing the allowable level from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. Corporations and dozens of state attorneys general sued shortly after, though the rule is projected to result in billions of dollars in health benefits, prevent thousands of premature deaths, and deliver cleaner air to millions of people, particularly those living near highways, factories, and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of Healthy Communities at Earthjustice. “Trump has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money, and this administration’s EPA has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives, or serving children, families, or communities. We will continue to defend this life-saving standard.”

“The public health and economic benefits of the current standard are tangible,” said Hayden Hashimoto, attorney at Clean Air Task Force. “By EPA’s own estimate, the current PM NAAQS would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits, and 4,500 premature deaths — adding up to $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. An abundance of scientific evidence shows going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act.”

The EPA has never before abandoned its legal defense of a strengthened national ambient air quality standard. The agency and Department of Justice had previously vigorously defended the standard as recently as December 2024. Despite EPA’s filing endorsing some of the challengers’ legal arguments, the science remains clear that the prior standard allowed significant human health harms to occur, including numerous deaths, and needed to be strengthened to protect public health. The standard also remains in effect and is firmly within EPA’s legal scope, supported by the EPA’s own scientific evidence.

The EPA found that meeting the stronger standard would provide benefits for public health valued at $46 billion each year once all areas come into compliance, while costing less than 1.5% of that amount. There are many commonsense and low-cost solutions to reduce pollution from large industrial sources. Earthjustice analyzed polluters’ faulty claims about predicted impacts of the new standard and found that they were based on flawed analysis. Cleaner air and economic growth have gone hand in hand after past air standard improvements. And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.

Air pollution is a serious problem, especially for children, and Black communities and other people of color breathe in more of it, and face higher rates of asthma, heart disease, and premature death. Studies show that Black communities are exposed to roughly 1.5 times more deadly soot pollution than white communities.

In April, a coalition of 100 environmental, public health, and community groups urged EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to uphold and swiftly implement the 2024 soot standard, warning that any delay would endanger already overburdened communities.

Earthjustice, its clients, and partners intervened last year to defend the soot standard against court challenges from polluters and their allies. Earthjustice clients are Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Lung Association, Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition, Rio Grande International Study Center, and Sierra Club. Clean Air Task Force represents Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future and Conservation Law Foundation.

Quotes from our clients

“Instead of enforcing clean air protections, EPA is cynically partnering with big polluters to bypass public input and dismantle the laws that safeguard the air we all breathe. It ignores the clear science telling us that this choice will be deadly,” said John Walke, senior attorney and director of federal clean air at NRDC.

“Our communities already carry the burden of polluted air and higher rates of asthma and heart disease. Weakening soot protections will only deepen these disparities and cost more Black lives,” said Yvonka Hall, executive director of the Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition.

“In the border region, families breathe air laced with pollution from trucks, refineries, and factories. This decision puts our health and our children’s future at even greater risk,” said Tricia Cortez, executive director of the Rio Grande International Study Center.

“As nurses, we see the toll air pollution takes on our patients — especially kids and older adults. Gutting science-based standards puts lives in danger and public health on the line,” said Katie Huffling, DNP, RN, CNM, FAAN executive director from the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

“EPA’s soot standards are life-saving protections that are firmly grounded in bedrock Clean Air Act legal authority. The Trump administration’s attempt to reverse course and weaken the soot standards would mean more pollution, more serious health problems, and more deaths. We will continue to vigorously defend these vital safeguards.” – Peter Zalzal, distinguished counsel and associate vice president for Clean Air Strategies, Environmental Defense Fund.

“Lee Zeldin’s continued attacks on clean air are reckless, life-threatening, and a complete betrayal of the EPA’s core mission to protect our communities and our environment,” said Sierra Club Climate Policy Director Patrick Drupp. “While this administration continues to strip away access to affordable health care, they are simultaneously allowing fossil fuel companies to cut corners and make Americans sicker. We will continue to fight back against Lee Zeldin’s dangerous agenda to bolster fossil fuels and protect Americans from toxic pollutants.”",https://www.nrdc.org/favicon.ico,N,,2025-11-25 17:03:12.800937
,Louisiana Environment,2025-11-25 19:11:56+00:00,Louisiana Illuminator,Gramercy alumina refinery put on notice for toxic discharges into Mississippi River,"Wesley Muller, www.facebook.com, WesleyMuller.news",,,,,https://lailluminator.com/2025/11/25/refinery-discharge-river/,"The document, which the Department of Environmental Quality published earlier this month, notes the Atalco refinery failed an effluent toxicity test of the discharges sampled from its Mississippi River drainage outlet.
According to the test conducted Sept. 4, Atalco’s sampled discharges were significantly more toxic than what the state allows in the Mississippi River.
“The stuff that’s in the effluent is probably far more toxic than they realize.” LDEQ puts Atalco refinery on notice for ‘red mud’ leaks.
It’s unclear how often facilities such as Atalco fail effluent toxicity tests.
Harhara said toxicity test failures are infrequent at facilities with properly working treatment systems.","A refinery near Gramercy faces new allegations from state regulators after water samples taken from the facility’s Mississippi River outfall proved deadly to aquatic animals during a routine lab test.

On Oct. 24, the Louisiana Department of Environmental Quality issued a new “Notice of Potential Penalty” compliance order to the Atlantic Alumina Co. facility that refines bauxite mineral into a feedstock chemical used to make aluminum. The facility is the only one of its kind in the United States.

The notice serves to warn the company of potential penalties for alleged violations state inspectors documented during a recent file review and field visits conducted Aug. 8 and Oct. 17 following a citizen’s complaint. The document, which the Department of Environmental Quality published earlier this month, notes the Atalco refinery failed an effluent toxicity test of the discharges sampled from its Mississippi River drainage outlet. Performed every three months as a matter of routine, the toxicity test involves exposing minnows and crustaceans to various concentrations of the sampled effluent over a 48-hour period.

According to the test conducted Sept. 4, Atalco’s sampled discharges were significantly more toxic than what the state allows in the Mississippi River. Even at the lowest concentration tested, the sampled effluent began killing significant numbers of crustaceans. When tested at the 1.5% standard concentration at which the animals should still be able to survive, the effluent killed 64% of the Daphnia pulex crustaceans, better known as water fleas.

Atalco did not respond to a request for comment for this report.

Ahmed Harhara is a chemical engineer who runs a neighborhood-level environmental data website in the Houston area and is familiar with the toxicity tests used in refinery operations. He reviewed the Atalco lab results and said they are a strong signal of a serious problem at the facility.

“These tests are basically an early warning system,” Harhara said. “If fish or small aquatic animals don’t survive in the sample water, it means the effluent is too toxic — even after it’s been treated — and could harm life in nearby streams if released.”

Harhara pointed out that the method for toxicity testing is tailored to the specific water stream receiving the discharges. The test conducted for Atalco uses a dilution or concentration factor that takes into account the Mississippi River’s current and massive volume of water, meaning it would take high levels of toxicity to fail the test.

Nicholas Fisher, an environmental scientist who studies aquatic pollution at Stony Brook University and also reviewed the lab results, said effluent toxicity tests often understate the danger of the pollution.

“I would say they’re overlooking a lot of the toxicity,” Fisher said. “The stuff that’s in the effluent is probably far more toxic than they realize.”

LDEQ puts Atalco refinery on notice for ‘red mud’ leaks. Fines to be determined.

When tested on minnows, the sampled effluent had no significant effect, but both Harhara and Fisher said that’s not surprising as the crustaceans are generally far more sensitive to many industrial contaminants. Also, fish are more mobile than small crustaceans and can swim away from areas of poor water quality, Harhara said.

It’s unclear how often facilities such as Atalco fail effluent toxicity tests. LDEQ spokeswoman Meagan Molter said only it happens occasionally, but had no relevant data available. The agency doesn’t track the test results in a global way, she added.

Harhara said toxicity test failures are infrequent at facilities with properly working treatment systems.

“In my view, it is newsworthy precisely because these failures are rare and measurable. They show where the treatment system may have slipped, even briefly,” he said. “It’s the kind of data point regulators and the public should pay attention to.”

On Oct. 21, just days before the Department of Environmental Quality issued the notice of potential penalty, aerial photos of the Atalco site showed plumes of discoloration in the river coming from the facility’s drainage pipe.

Aside from the toxicity test results, LDEQ’s notice cited large volumes of discharges with high pH levels that Atalco drained into the river at over 20 times the rate allowed under its permit.

When state inspectors visited the area on Aug. 8 and Oct. 17, they discovered public stormwater ditches and waterways filled with reddish-orange water. This included the Hope Canal, which flows to the Maurepas Swamp, according to the notice.

An Atalco representative told the inspectors the facility’s runoff containment system failed after it was inundated with sediment, and the runoff became contaminated with Atalco’s “red mud” waste, the notice states.

“The inspection revealed that the Respondent failed to maintain waters of the state in an aesthetically attractive condition and meet the generally accepted aesthetic qualifications,” the LDEQ notice said.

Atalco received a similar notice from the Department of Environmental Quality in August for separate violations stemming from erosion channels in the giant levees of Atalco’s red mud waste lakes. The fissures allowed waste slurry to escape from the facility and contaminate state waters.

While attention often focuses on breakthroughs in battery technology or records in renewable energy installations, a new market analysis suggests that the foundational hardware enabling these technologies is poised for significant expansion.

According to a detailed market report from Allied Market Research (AMR), the copper alloy connector market is projected to nearly double in value over the next decade. The report found the segment was valued at $13.4 billion in 2024 and is forecast to reach $24.9 billion by 2033, growing at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 6.5% from 2025 to 2033. This growth highlights copper’s indispensable role, not just as a conductor, but as a material that must be alloyed and engineered to handle the stresses of the modern electric economy.

Connecting the Electric Vehicle Revolution

The primary driver of this forecasted growth is the global automotive sector, which is rapidly transitioning to electric vehicles (EVs). This shift relies on reliable, high-performance connectors capable of handling the high-voltage power transmission required for batteries, inverters, and fast-charging systems.

In an EV, connectors must withstand elevated temperatures, deliver power efficiently, and be mechanically durable to ensure the safety and longevity of the vehicle's electrical architecture. Pure copper, while highly conductive, often lacks the mechanical strength for such demanding environments. Consequently, copper alloys—such as brass, phosphor bronze, and beryllium copper—are increasingly specified for these applications. These alloys effectively balance high electrical conductivity with the required mechanical stability, resisting wear, stress relaxation, and fatigue, according to the report.

This expanding requirement extends beyond the vehicle itself into the charging infrastructure, where robust, durable connectors are non-negotiable for reliable, fast-charging networks across North America, Europe, and Asia-Pacific.

The Foundation of Smart Power Distribution

Beyond transportation, the second major catalyst is the ongoing global overhaul of power infrastructure through smart grids and the integration of renewable energy. Traditional, one-way power grids are being replaced by complex, decentralized systems that must manage bidirectional power flow from diverse sources, including solar installations, wind farms, and grid-scale battery storage.

This transformation requires connection hardware that guarantees high efficiency, corrosion resistance, and safety across numerous connection points, from utility-scale projects to residential solar installations. Copper alloys, due to their superior performance characteristics, are uniquely positioned to ensure the reliability and durability required by these dynamic, digitized power systems. This includes critical infrastructure projects globally, such as the UN-backed effort to upgrade Indonesia's electricity system with a comprehensive smart grid framework, slated for completion by the end of 2025.

Market Dynamics and Supply Chain Pressures

While the demand side is robust and structurally sound, the copper alloy connector market remains sensitive to macroeconomic pressures and supply chain volatility. A key constraint identified by AMR is the volatility of copper prices worldwide. As a critical commodity for the energy transition, the base metal's price is subject to supply-demand imbalances, geopolitical factors, and rising mining and refining costs.

The supply chain is complex and geographically concentrated. Global imports of copper-based electrical connectors have been trending upward, with key industrial economies such as the United States, Germany, Japan, and South Korea among the largest consumers. Meanwhile, China dominates the export landscape, accounting for nearly 40% of the world's total exports in 2023, while Germany and Mexico also maintain strategic export positions, particularly for high-performance and North American applications.

The growth of the copper alloy connector market is a bellwether of the global transition to electric power. Its trajectory confirms that electrification efforts are moving past the initial design stages into the critical phase of physical infrastructure buildout, a phase that depends heavily on the performance and reliable sourcing of foundational materials, such as high-grade copper alloys.

Trump’s Pesticide Stance Sparks Backlash After Earlier Promise of Crackdown

During his campaign, Donald Trump vowed to protect Americans from toxic chemicals—especially pesticides—promising a major investigation led by Robert F. Kennedy Jr. and pledging to phase out harmful agricultural chemicals banned abroad. Yet critics say the administration is now moving in the opposite direction.

Despite public commitments to reduce exposure to dangerous chemicals, the EPA under Trump has pushed to approve several new pesticides, including products containing PFAS—chemicals twice blocked by federal courts over health risks. The agency insists its review process is rigorous, science-driven, and designed to protect people and the environment, emphasizing that pesticides remain essential for farming, pest control, and public health.

Some experts say the EPA’s pace is typical and that PFAS-based pesticides aren’t new. They argue that certain PFAS, like TFA, pose different risks than long-chain PFAS such as PFOS or PFOA, and that modern agriculture can’t rely solely on organic methods.

But environmental and farmworker advocates argue the administration is abandoning its promises. They warn that approving more powerful pesticides deepens farmer dependence on toxic chemicals, increases risks for farmworkers and nearby communities, and contributes to long-term health issues—including cancer, Parkinson’s disease, fertility problems, and developmental disorders in children. They also express concern that the EPA is “fast-tracking” approvals without adequate review.

PFAS pesticides are especially controversial due to their persistence in the environment, ability to contaminate drinking water, and links to cancer, immune disruption, and hormonal effects. While some scientists note that newer PFAS pesticides break down faster in the body, others say their hazards are too well documented to justify expanded use.

Overall, critics argue that instead of building a safer, more resilient food system, the administration’s actions risk locking farmers and communities into a cycle of escalating chemical dependence and worsening health outcomes.

Education

Jil McIntosh graduated from East York Collegiate in Toronto, and then continued her education at the School of Hard Knocks. Her early jobs including driving a taxi in Toronto; and warranty administration in a new-vehicle dealership, where she also held information classes for customers, explaining the inner mechanical workings of vehicles and their features.

Experience

Jil McIntosh is a freelance writer who has been writing for Driving.ca since 2016, but she’s been a professional writer starting when most cars still had carburetors. At the age of eleven, she had a story published in the defunct Toronto Telegram newspaper, for which she was paid $25; given the short length of the story and the dollar’s buying power at the time, that might have been the relatively best-paid piece she’s ever written.

An old-car enthusiast who owns a 1947 Cadillac and 1949 Studebaker truck, she began her writing career crafting stories for antique-car and hot-rod car club magazines. When the Ontario-based newspaper Old Autos started up in 1987, dedicated to the antique-car hobby, she became a columnist starting with its second issue; the newspaper is still around and she still writes for it. Not long after the Toronto Star launched its Wheels section in 1986 – the first Canadian newspaper to include an auto section – she became one of its regular writers. She started out writing feature stories, and then added “new-vehicle reviewer” to her resume in 1999. She stayed with Wheels, in print and later digital as well, until the publication made a cost-cutting decision to shed its freelance writers. She joined Driving.ca the very next day.

In addition to Driving.ca, she writes for industry-focused publications, including Automotive News Canada and Autosphere. Over the years, her automotive work also appeared in such publications as Cars & Parts, Street Rodder, Canadian Hot Rods, AutoTrader, Sharp, Taxi News, Maclean’s, The Chicago Tribune, Forbes Wheels, Canadian Driver, Sympatico Autos, and Reader’s Digest. Her non-automotive work, covering such topics as travel, food and drink, rural living, fountain pen collecting, and celebrity interviews, has appeared in publications including Harrowsmith, Where New Orleans, Pen World, The Book for Men, Rural Delivery, and Gambit.

Moolenaar previously focused on another Chinese firm called Gotion, telling The Midwesterner there are ""about 30 tax credits"" in the law ""Biden calls his Inflation Reduction Act [that] will go to companies who are manufacturing, in some way, green energy.""

Moolenaar’s ""No Gotion Act"" would ensure no subsidies go to firms based in officially designated politically-concerned countries like China, Russia, North Korea and Iran.

He also inserted language in the 2024 funding bill for the Department of Energy that would prohibit the agency from awarding contracts to companies tied to the CCP.

Fox News Digital reached out to Moolenaar for additional comment.

Rep. Carlos Gimenez, R-Fla., chair of the House Homeland Security Transportation Subcommittee, said at the time that the U.S. cannot continue ""ceding dominance over our critical supply chains to our greatest geopolitical rival.""

Gimenez, who was born in communist Cuba and fled to the U.S. as a child, said Western nations were too slow to recognize threats from Huawei and TikTok, and that doing business in China ensures the CCP will get a cut; ""a steep cost.""

Canadian Solar had about 12,000 employees in China at the beginning of the year with less than 6,000 in the rest of the world combined.

The Coalition for a Prosperous America raised red flags in a report last year on Chinese dominance in the solar industry, and the fact that they’re largely kept afloat by ""massive financial support"" from the Chinese government – with reports citing as much as Y1B ($140M) in subsidies in recent times.

Those subsidies, CPA argued, threaten all solar firms in the West.

In 2024, Trina Solar, then a subsidiary of a Chinese solar giant by the same name, forged an agreement to sell its Texas-based manufacturing assets to another U.S.-based but Chinese-tied company, which is now known as T1 Energy. Trina Founder Gao Jifan is also a Chinese National People’s Congress delegate.

Gao has several links to CCP-connected organizations, as a profile on the Chinese-controlled search giant Baidu lists several curriculum vitae, including a former vice president of the China Chamber of Commerce for Import and Export of Machinery and Electronic Products – a semi-governmental trade association made up of representatives from several industrial and green-energy corporations like Huawei and Trina Solar.

More recently, in 2023, Gao was vice president of the China Association for the Promotion of Industry-Academic-Research Cooperation, a group under the auspices of the CCP’s Ministry of Science and Technology that connects research universities and manufacturing outfits in the fields of nanotechnology, material manufacturing and green energy.

Trump Is Taking The Fight To The Ccp. It's Long Past Time We Protected Our Bases And Critical Infrastructure

On its homepage, T1 bills itself as ""building domestic solar and battery supply chains to invigorate America with scalable, reliable, and low-cost energy,"" and saying that ""America needs advanced manufacturing capacity to unlock our most scalable energy resources.""

Baidu noted Gao’s investment in a Texas solar module factory, saying he did so to ""prevent the shipment of photovoltaic products from being blocked.""

T1 formed after FREYR Battery, a Norwegian firm, sold off its Texas assets to Trina Solar, which then rebranded the operation as T1 Energy after a restructuring – while FREYR focused on a separate Georgia operation.

Brother-in-law Of Top Dem Senator Played Key Role In Recruiting Chinese Firms To Deep Blue City

T1 positions itself as an ""integrated U.S. supply chain for solar and batteries,"" but remains largely dependent on Trina.

Earlier this month, T1 tweeted a video of robots at its Texas factory, saying that it produced 14MW of solar panels in one day and calling it ""the path to American power.""

Trina Solar, the Chinese company, owns between 16-25% of T1, according to reports, allowing it a minimum of two board members. One member is reportedly a businessman who previously held a deputy directorship at the Chinese Development Bank, a financial powerhouse that helps fund China’s infamous Belt-and-Road Initiative.

Cozy Ties Between Top Newsom Ally And Ccp Official Unearthed On Networking Site: 'She Helped Me A Lot'

A Caribbean-domiciled firm tied to the wife of a Trina executive also holds a stake in T1, potentially offering more Eastern control.

With T1 being a U.S. company eligible for tax credits under the IRA, the company benefits – but also its dependence on Chinese subsidy translates to a CCP-tied firm benefiting from American money.

In Canadian Solar’s case, critics have considered the branding and international dynamic to be geopolitical camouflage, suggesting to Western governments the company is one of their own.

The overall dynamic is one that again depicts China’s persistence in circumventing or manipulating U.S. defenses in various situations, this time in business and investments.

(Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana.
The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule.
It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said.
“Today’s inauguration ceremony marks a transformative moment for Iberia Parish,” Iberia Industrial Development Foundation President and CEO Michael J. Tarantino said.
We look forward to seeing “Made in Iberia Parish, Louisiana” come to life.” Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company.","TEMPE, AZ. – First Solar, Inc. (Nasdaq: FSLR) (the “Company” or “First Solar”) today inaugurated its new fully vertically integrated manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The $1.1 billion facility, which spans approximately 2.4 million square feet and is about 11 times the size of the New Orleans Superdome, currently employs over 700 people and is expected to have 826 employees by the end of the year. Once fully ramped, the Iberia Parish facility is expected to add 3.5 gigawatts (GW) of annual nameplate capacity, taking First Solar’s American manufacturing footprint to 14 GW in 2026, and 17.7 GW in 2027, when a recently announced production facility in South Carolina is expected to be fully ramped.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar’s Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

“First Solar’s investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,” Governor Jeff Landry said. “This is exactly how we advance President Trump’s agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we’re strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.”

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish’s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

“This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It’s a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,” First Solar CEO Mark Widmar said. “By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we’re demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn’t just a thesis, it’s an operating reality.”

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

“First Solar’s investment in Iberia Parish represents the kind of forward-looking growth that reinforces Louisiana’s leadership in energy and advanced manufacturing,” LED Secretary Susan B. Bourgeois said. “By pairing innovation with our state’s long-standing energy expertise and world-class workforce, this project creates lasting opportunities for Louisiana and bolsters American energy security.”

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

“Today’s inauguration ceremony marks a transformative moment for Iberia Parish,” Iberia Industrial Development Foundation President and CEO Michael J. Tarantino said. “We are grateful for First Solar’s commitment and investment in our community, and we are proud to welcome their contribution to our growing energy portfolio. We look forward to seeing “Made in Iberia Parish, Louisiana” come to life.”

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country’s leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world’s largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

“First Solar’s inauguration marks an incredible milestone for Iberia Parish and the entire Acadiana region,” One Acadiana President & CEO Troy Wayman said. “We’re proud to celebrate alongside both our state and local partners at Louisiana Economic Development and Iberia Industrial Development Foundation as we see this investment come to life — bringing quality jobs, new economic activity, and continued momentum for our manufacturing and energy sectors.”

State Activities

Federal Activities

On November 21, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) released its Fair Debt Collection Practices Act (FDCPA) Annual Report 2025, summarizing 2024 activity. The CFPB received about 207,800 debt collection complaints (7% of all complaints), with “attempts to collect debt not owed” the most common issue and credit card debt the most complained-about category after “I do not know.” Companies responded to 97% of complaints sent to them, most often closing with explanation or non‑monetary relief. Supervisory examinations of larger participants found violations, including failures to provide timely validation notices, use of misleading names and missing required disclosures, contacting consumers at inconvenient times, harassing conduct despite requests to stop, failure to honor requests not to use a specific medium or number, and unfair practices stemming from misdocumented statutes of limitations on credit card debt sold to collectors. Legally, the CFPB and Federal Trade Commission (FTC) filed amicus briefs, with the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit affirming that pay‑to‑pay fees are prohibited unless expressly authorized by agreement or law and a federal court rejecting payoff statement fees. The CFPB withdrew a medical‑debt advisory opinion in 2025. Enforcement activity in 2024 was led by the FTC, while the CFPB announced no public FDCPA actions. The report also details consumer education and outreach (including heavy “Ask CFPB” usage), research on medical collections removal and credit-score impacts, targeted initiatives for older Americans, servicemembers, students, and Native communities, and continued market monitoring and implementation feedback on Regulation F.

On November 21, the Federal Reserve Board announced it will extend the comment period on its proposal to improve stress test model and scenario transparency and accountability until February 21, 2026, citing the need to give interested parties more time to analyze the issues and prepare feedback. The original deadline was January 22, 2026, and the separate deadline for comments on the 2026 stress test scenarios remains December 1, 2025, as outlined in the related Federal Register notice on enhanced transparency and public accountability of supervisory stress test models and scenarios. For more information, click here.

On November 21, the Federal Reserve Board released results from its Senior Financial Officer Survey, capturing how banks manage reserve balances and their expectations for balance sheet size and composition, deposit pricing strategies, and developments in stablecoins and digital assets. Conducted with the New York Fed between September 19 and 29, 2025, the survey includes responses from institutions holding roughly three‑quarters of total system reserve balances.

On November 21, Federal Reserve Vice Chair Philip Jefferson, speaking at the Cleveland Fed’s Financial Stability Conference, said AI’s rapid diffusion could both raise productivity and ease inflationary pressures while also displacing some workers, leaving the net employment effects uncertain and warranting humility in monetary policy as the Fed distinguishes cyclical dynamics from structural change. He assessed the financial system as sound and resilient but noted the Fed’s Financial Stability Report found 30% of market contacts now cite a potential turn in AI sentiment as a salient risk (up from 9% in spring), which could tighten financial conditions. Comparing today to the late‑1990s dot‑com era, Jefferson highlighted key differences: AI‑linked firms generally have established earnings, lower price‑to‑earnings ratios than dot‑com peaks, and a narrower public cohort, with limited leverage so far — though debt financing may rise to fund data centers and talent — making a replay of the dot‑com boom less likely. He concluded that ensuring the AI transition occurs within a stable financial system is essential to achieving the Fed’s dual mandate of maximum employment and price stability.

On November 21, the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) announced that its Crypto Task Force has rescheduled the Financial Surveillance and Privacy Roundtable, originally slated for October, to Monday, December 15 from 1 to 5 p.m. ET at SEC headquarters. The event is open to the public, will be webcast on sec.gov, requires registration for in-person attendance (not for online viewing), and, per Task Force Head Commissioner Hester Peirce, aims to advance sound privacy policies and highlight tools that help Americans protect their data. For more information, click here.

On November 20, the CFPB will hand off its remaining enforcement lawsuits and other active litigation to the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) as the CFPB prepares for a potential funding lapse. CFPB staff were informed that DOJ will begin assuming matters from the CFPB’s enforcement and legal divisions in the coming weeks, with transfer logistics to be worked out. It remains unclear whether all pending cases will survive the transition or whether case schedules and continuity will be affected. For more information, click here.

On November 20, SEC Commissioner Mark Uyeda, speaking at the ICI Retail Alternatives and Closed‑End Funds Conference, argued that 401(k) plans face a “diversification deficit” and should be able to allocate prudently to private investments — such as private equity, private credit, venture capital, infrastructure, and real estate — to improve risk‑adjusted returns amid rising public‑market concentration and target‑date funds’ typical reliance on open‑end, public strategies. Citing institutional results and modern portfolio theory, he rejected a “zero exposure” presumption, urged ERISA fiduciary guardrails over outright exclusion, noted recent policy moves to broaden access (including the Trump Administration’s executive order), and called for litigation reform to curb hindsight‑driven ERISA suits that chill innovation. Uyeda also pressed for coordinated SEC–Department of Labor frameworks on disclosures, fees, valuation, conflicts, and custody so defined‑contribution savers can access private markets responsibly while maintaining robust investor protections.

On November 20, the U.S. Senate Committee on Agriculture, Nutrition, and Forestry advanced Michael Selig’s nomination to serve as chairman and commissioner of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) with Senator John Boozman (R-AR) calling it a critical moment as Congress weighs expanding the CFTC’s authority and stressing that strong leadership is essential to implement new policies and responsibilities. Boozman further praised Selig as the right person to strike the balance and urged swift Senate confirmation. Selig’s nomination now heads to the full Senate for consideration.

On November 20, U.S. Representative Warren Davidson (R-OH) introduced the Bitcoin for America Act, which would allow Americans to pay federal taxes in Bitcoin and direct all such payments into a Strategic Bitcoin Reserve — an initiative he says will modernize U.S. finance, strengthen long-term resilience, and position the U.S. for global digital asset leadership. Citing Bitcoin’s fixed 21 million-coin supply, record of appreciation versus inflationary currencies, and decentralized, permissionless access that could broaden participation (including among the unbanked), Davidson argues that channeling tax-paid Bitcoin into the Reserve would diversify U.S. assets, protect against dollar erosion, bolster the national balance sheet, and reduce reliance on debt, while ensuring the U.S. keeps pace as other major nations accumulate Bitcoin.

On November 20, U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman John Boozman (R-AR) and Senator Cory Booker (D-NJ) released a bipartisan market structure discussion draft that would give the CFTC new authority to regulate the spot market for digital commodities, building on the House-passed CLARITY Act. The draft outlines a CFTC-led regime with a clear definition of “digital commodities,” robust consumer protections (including fund segregation, conflict safeguards, disclosures, and limits on affiliated trading), a trading registration framework to support liquid, resilient markets, mandated CFTC–SEC coordination, protections for self-custody and innovative technology, and a new funding stream for the CFTC to stand up the program. Boozman emphasized that the CFTC is the right agency and pledged to work with colleagues and the administration to ensure sufficient staffing and resources, while Booker highlighted the need to protect consumers and market integrity, and flagged outstanding concerns — including resource adequacy, commissioner balance, preventing regulatory arbitrage, and guardrails against corruption — inviting stakeholder feedback as unresolved issues remain bracketed in the draft.

On November 20, Federal Reserve Governor Lisa Cook, speaking at Georgetown’s Psaros Center, said the financial system remains resilient, but highlighted key vulnerabilities such as elevated asset valuations across equities, credit, leveraged loans, and housing; rapid growth and rising complexity in private credit that could transmit losses through leveraged and interconnected funding chains; and the expanding hedge fund footprint in the U.S. Treasury market, where leveraged relative‑value trades funded via short‑term repo could amplify stress during volatility. She also examined generative AI’s implications for market stability, noting potential benefits for price discovery and reduced herding alongside risks of correlated trading, opacity (“black box” concerns), and manipulation, while pointing to improving surveillance and venue safeguards. Cook emphasized that maintaining financial stability is essential to the Fed’s dual mandate and that ongoing monitoring and prudent policy can navigate these emerging risks amid significant technological change.

On November 20, a coalition of digital asset and blockchain organizations sent a letter to President Donald Trump praising first‑year actions (IRS Broker Rule nullification, the GENIUS Act, and rescission of DOL’s 2022 crypto guidance) and urging immediate, whole‑of‑government steps to cement U.S. leadership: Treasury/IRS tax clarity on mining and staking (taxed at disposition), nonrecognition for bridging/wrapping, airdrops/forks/rebases treatment, collateral/liquidation rules, a de minimis exemption for small purchases, streamlined charitable donations, foreign trading safe harbor, R&D credit eligibility, and delaying §6050I rules; regulatory clarity from CFPB (reaffirm broad §1033 data rights and fee ban), the SEC (expedite its agenda; issue no‑action/exemptive relief protecting open, permissionless protocol/front‑end developers; embrace self‑custody), plus safe harbors/sandboxes for DeFi; coordinated SEC–CFTC exemptive relief, Treasury/NIST cyber and illicit‑finance collaboration, updated FinCEN guidance confirming the Bank Secrecy Act does not cover noncustodial software, and disavowal of the proposed “mixing” special measure; and DOJ reforms to end “regulation by prosecution,” extend Section 230‑style protections to DeFi developers, and dismiss charges against Roman Storm, underscoring that publishing open‑source code is protected speech.

On November 19, Trump nominated Stuart Levenbach, an energy official at the Office of Management and Budget (OMB), to serve a five-year term as permanent director of the CFPB. Levenbach’s experience is in natural resources and energy policy rather than financial regulation, and he would inherit an agency facing profound uncertainty after months of leadership turmoil, enforcement retrenchment, and dwindling finances.The next day, U.S. House Financial Services Committee Ranking Member Maxine Waters blasted the nomination as a “sham” aimed at extending CFPB Acting Director Russell Vought’s control of the CFPB without Senate confirmation and furthering an effort to “gut” the agency. She also condemned the administration’s legal theory that the CFPB cannot draw funds from the Federal Reserve and criticized moves to curtail small‑business loan data collection, pledging that Committee Democrats will fight to preserve consumer protections.For more information, click here and here.

On November 19, the Senate Banking Committee voted 13–11 to advance Travis Hill’s nomination to be Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) chair. Hill, currently acting chair and formerly vice chair, highlighted at his October hearing his role in deregulatory efforts and priorities to refocus supervision on material financial risks over process, strengthen large-bank resolution readiness, and adjust the capital framework. The committee also advanced the nominations of Joseph Gormley to lead Ginnie Mae, Francis Cassidy to be a HUD assistant secretary, and Paul Hollis to be director of the U.S. Mint. For more information, click here.

On November 19, Senators Elizabeth Warren, Ron Wyden, and Richard Blumenthal wrote to Vought warning that the CFPB appears poised to gut the bipartisan Personal Financial Data Rights rule finalized in 2024, urging the CFPB to reinstate the rule and preserve consumers’ free access to their own data and the ability to authorize a broad range of third parties to use that data, while prohibiting bank-imposed fees that would choke off competition and harm innovation. The senators cited recent litigation posture changes, industry pressure, and examples of exorbitant access fees as evidence of likely consumer harm and anticompetitive outcomes. Five days earlier, Hill and Vice Chairman Bill Huizenga of the House Financial Services Committee submitted a letter to the CFPB urging robust, consumer-directed data portability under Dodd-Frank §1033, interpreting “representative” to include nonfiduciary entities, anchoring privacy and security in GLBA’s uniform standards to avoid duplicative regimes, and allowing practical flexibility on access methods (including APIs and, where needed, screen scraping) to support smaller institutions. The letter concluded with support for a durable framework that advances consumer control without upending the existing ecosystem. For more information, click here and here.

On November 19, the Office of Financial Research delivered its 2025 Annual Report to Congress, analyzing U.S. financial stability risks and detailing organizational changes over FY 2025 (October 1, 2024, through September 30, 2025), including a smaller workforce, budget reductions aligned with administration goals, and efficiency gains from AI. The report highlights persistent technology and cyber vulnerabilities, especially via third‑party providers and propagation across financial and information networks; unusually low corporate debt spreads and stabilizing commercial real estate alongside elevated subprime household delinquencies; fading concerns over banks’ unrealized securities losses, concentrated office‑mortgage credit risk at large banks, and rapidly rising hedge fund borrowing and leverage in macro and relative‑value strategies; resilient market functioning, with Treasury markets performing well amid April volatility, high equity price‑to‑earnings ratios, and robust liquidity from proprietary trading firms; and money‑market developments, including new OFR data collection on non‑centrally cleared bilateral repo, reduced institutional prime money market fund balances, and continued predominance of financial‑firm and asset‑backed commercial paper issuance. For more information, click here.

On November 19, the House Financial Services Committee, led by Hill, examined the U.S. deposit insurance framework, weighing proposals to raise coverage limits amid concerns over unclear FDIC data (e.g., account classifications and insured vs. uninsured reporting), implementation costs for smaller banks, and potential moral hazard. Members noted that more than 99% of deposits are already insured under current limits and stressed preserving a diverse banking ecosystem (community, midsize, regional, and GSIBs) while avoiding one-size-fits-all reforms. Witnesses highlighted data gaps and contagion risks in a real‑time, digital environment; warned that accounting choices to spread costs over 10 years could mask reserve‑ratio pressures and expose small banks to special assessments; urged clarity and proportionality to reduce regulatory burden on community banks; and split on raising limits — some opposing broader guarantees as costly and risk‑inducing, others advocating targeted insurance for business operating accounts to reduce run risk and keep local capital working.

On November 19, the Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs received for Executive Order 12866 review the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency’s (OCC) proposed rule titled “Guidelines Establishing Heightened Standards for Certain Large Insured National Banks, Insured Federal Savings Associations, and Insured Federal Branches; Technical Amendments,” which is at the proposed rule stage and carries no legal deadline.

On November 18, the Federal Reserve Board released new supervisory operating principles to enhance bank supervision by focusing examiners on material financial risks to safety and soundness and taking timely, proportionate action to address them. Vice Chair for Supervision Michelle Bowman emphasized the approach “sharpens” rather than narrows supervision, anchoring it in transparency, accountability, and fairness. The principles align examinations and ratings to core financial risks, reduce duplication among supervisors, and streamline remediation of cited issues. The Federal Reserve is training examiners for prompt implementation, and supervision leadership plans to refine and, where appropriate, formalize the principles through public guidance or regulatory changes.

On November 18, Acting CFTC Chairman Caroline Pham delivered a keynote at FIA EXPO outlining the agency’s market‑structure and innovation agenda and a 12‑month “Crypto Sprint” to bring digital assets inside existing U.S. regulatory perimeters: listed spot crypto trading on designated contract markets by year‑end; guidance to enable tokenized collateral, including qualified payment stablecoins, by year‑end with DCOs going live in early 2026; and a rulemaking to make technical amendments for collateral, margin, clearing, settlement, reporting, and recordkeeping to support blockchain/tokenization by August 2026. Pham detailed recent actions to reduce swaps‑market burdens (interpretive letters, procedures, proposed rule amendments, targeted no‑action relief, and withdrawals of legacy proposals), strengthen innovation and oversight (FBOT registration clarity, volatility controls, risk‑management advisories, FCM FAQs, adoption of Nasdaq surveillance), and revive SEC–CFTC coordination (a joint roundtable and harmonization workstreams). She tied the roadmap to the President’s Working Group report and the GENIUS Act’s stablecoin framework, encouraged DCOs/FCMs to treat qualified payment stablecoins and tokenized money market funds as eligible margin and settlement assets with appropriate haircuts, custody, and liquidity safeguards, and emphasized technology‑neutral, activity‑based regulation to modernize U.S. markets without compromising integrity or customer protection.

On November 18, the OCC issued Interpretive Letter 1186 confirming that national banks may pay blockchain “network” or “gas” fees to facilitate otherwise permissible activities and may hold, as principal on balance sheet, the amounts of crypto‑assets reasonably needed to cover anticipated network fees. The letter also permits banks to hold crypto‑assets as principal for testing otherwise permissible crypto‑asset-related platforms (whether developed internally or obtained from third parties), provided all such activities are conducted in a safe and sound manner and comply with applicable law.

On November 17, the U.S. Department of Justice released its 2025 Annual Report to Congress on Activities to Combat Elder Fraud and Abuse, highlighting more than 280 enforcement actions against over 600 defendants, domestic and overseas, who attempted to steal or stole over $2 billion from more than one million older Americans, as well as actions holding multiple nursing home operators accountable for grossly substandard care. The DOJ expanded capacity through the first National Elder Abuse Multidisciplinary Team Summit (nearly 400 participants), recovered or froze millions for victims, and, via VOCA grants, supported more than 4,000 victim assistance organizations serving nearly 200,000 older victims. It also launched the first National Elder Abuse Victim Services Needs Assessment. Public outreach included nearly 1,200 events reaching about 15 million Americans, underscoring DOJ’s commitment to enforcement, victim services, capacity building, and prevention.

On November 17, the FTC announced a final order permanently banning Seek Capital and its CEO from offering business financing, debt relief, and credit repair services after the agency alleged the firm deceived entrepreneurs by promising loans or lines of credit and instead charging thousands to open credit cards while harming credit scores and imposing undisclosed fees. A federal court granted most of the FTC’s summary judgment, finding misrepresentations that violated the FTC Act and Telemarketing Sales Rule, contracts that violated the Consumer Review Fairness Act, and Ferman’s personal liability. The order imposes a $48,280,328 monetary judgment (partially suspended for inability to pay, due in full if finances are misrepresented), bars misrepresentations, billing without informed consent, TSR violations, and restrictions on consumer reviews, and was approved 3–0 by the commission.

On November 14, the Federal Reserve issued its 35th annual Report to Congress on the profitability of credit card operations, finding that specialized “credit card banks” posted a 2024 pretax return on assets of 3.87% (up from 3.31% in 2023) driven by higher interest income and reduced loan-loss provisioning (3.62% vs. 3.92%), far outpacing the 1.38% ROA for all banks. The report notes eight monoline credit card banks held 29% of balances at year-end 2024 (down from 42 banks holding 77% in 1996), with top 10 issuers now controlling 83% of balances, consumers carrying $1.4 trillion in revolving credit against more than $5 trillion in available limits, and market activity totaling 64.5 billion transactions and over $6.2 trillion in volume. Delinquencies rose early in 2024 before edging down, while charge-offs remained above pre-pandemic norms. Acquisition has shifted heavily to digital channels (with 2.8 billion direct-mail offers still significant), and usage trends include buy-now-pay-later growth and post‑transaction installment features. On pricing, average nominal rates across all accounts held near 21.5% and about 22.8% for accounts incurring interest at year-end 2024, despite a decline in the two‑year Treasury yield to roughly 4.2%, underscoring sustained high APRs amid evolving credit card market structure and regulation.

On November 13, the U.S. Treasury’s Office of Foreign Assets Control (OFAC) and the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network (FinCEN), in coordination with the Government of Mexico, targeted the Hysa Organized Crime Group (HOCG) and cartel-linked money laundering through Mexico’s gambling sector, with OFAC sanctioning 27 individuals and entities, including HOCG family members and key businesses, thereby blocking their U.S. property and prohibiting U.S. persons from transacting with them, and warning of potential secondary sanctions for foreign financial institutions. Concurrently, FinCEN proposed a USA PATRIOT Act section 311 special measure to cut off 10 named Mexico-based gambling establishments from the U.S. financial system by restricting correspondent account use and requiring heightened due diligence to guard against laundering. Treasury underscored that sanctions aim to change behavior and outlined the process for removal from the SDN List, while inviting public comment on FinCEN’s NPRM via regulations.gov.

State Activities

On November 20, the Illinois Supreme Court narrowly construed private rights of action under the federal Fair Credit Reporting Act (FCRA), creating a de facto “concrete injury” requirement for claims under the FCRA and potentially other federal statutes with similar language authorizing rights of action. Although Article III’s concrete-injury requirement has become familiar in federal courts over the last decade, Illinois courts had not previously imposed such a requirement in cases involving statutory rights of action. The court in Fausett v. Walgreen Co., held that the FCRA does not explicitly authorize consumers to sue for violations, so the law did not authorize consumer lawsuits unless the consumer could show that a violation caused them a concrete injury. This ruling will significantly narrow consumers’ ability to bring no-injury claims under similar statutes in Illinois state courts.

The Genesis Mission will transform American science and innovation through the power of artificial intelligence (AI), strengthening the nation’s technological leadership and global competitiveness.

The ambitious mission will harness the current AI and advanced computing revolution to double the productivity and impact of American science and engineering within a decade. It will deliver decisive breakthroughs to secure American energy dominance, accelerate scientific discovery, and strengthen national security.

“Throughout history, from the Manhattan Project to the Apollo mission, our nation’s brightest minds and industries have answered the call when their nation needed them,” said U.S. Secretary of Energy Chris Wright. “Today, the United States is calling on them once again. Under President Trump’s leadership, the Genesis Mission will unleash the full power of our National Laboratories, supercomputers, and data resources to ensure that America is the global leader in artificial intelligence and to usher in a new golden era of American discovery.”

The announcement builds on President Trump’s Executive Order Removing Barriers to American Leadership In Artificial Intelligence and advances his America’s AI Action Plan released earlier this year—a directive to remove barriers to innovation, reduce dependence on foreign adversaries, and unleash the full strength of America’s scientific enterprise.

Secretary Wright has designated Under Secretary for Science Darío Gil to lead the initiative. The Genesis Mission will mobilize the Department of Energy’s 17 National Laboratories, industry, and academia to build an integrated discovery platform.

The platform will connect the world’s best supercomputers, AI systems, and next-generation quantum systems with the most advanced scientific instruments in the nation. Once complete, the platform will be the world’s most complex and powerful scientific instrument ever built. It will draw on the expertise of roughly 40,000 DOE scientists, engineers, and technical staff, alongside private sector innovators, to ensure that the United States leads and builds the technologies that will define the future.

The Genesis Mission will focus on addressing three key challenges of national importance:

American energy dominance: The Genesis Mission will accelerate advanced nuclear, fusion, and grid modernization using AI to provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy for Americans.

Advancing discovery science: Through DOE’s investment and collaboration with industry, America is building the quantum ecosystem that will power discoveries—and industries—for decades to come.

Ensuring national security: DOE will create advanced AI technologies for national security missions, deploy systems to ensure the safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile, and accelerate the development of defense-ready materials.

Additional quotes for media:

Under Secretary for Science and Genesis Mission Director, Dr. Darío Gil: “The Genesis Mission marks a defining moment for the next era of American science. We are linking the nation’s most advanced facilities, data, and computing into one closed-loop system to create a scientific instrument for the ages, an engine for discovery that doubles R&D productivity and solves challenges once thought impossible.”

Administrator of the National Nuclear Security Administration, Brandon Williams: “The Genesis Mission represents the next great chapter and an unparallelled opportunity for America’s scientific and national security leadership. “Building on decades of innovation and collaboration across our national laboratories, NNSA will leverage AI, quantum computing, and advanced data analytics that will strengthen our deterrents and ensure the United States maintains an unmatched strategic edge over our adversaries. Under President Trump’s leadership, this mission will embody the very best of American ingenuity, turning science and innovation into security.”",https://www.energy.gov/sites/default/files/2025-02/DOE%20Full%20Seal%20on%20white%20gray%20background%20-%201250x785_1.png,N,,2025-11-25 17:01:47.792797

The reporting rule’s lengthy lookback period and the breadth of information and activities it covers have presented challenges for regulated entities, including spending resources to determine whether they are subject to the rule and what information is reportable. EPA has twice extended the initial reporting deadline, most recently to April 2026.

Earlier this month, the EPA under the Trump administration proposed several significant exemptions to the PFAS reporting rule to reduce compliance costs and burdens for regulated entities. The proposed exemptions would include:

De Minimis. PFAS in mixtures or articles at concentrations below 0.1 percent.

Imported Articles. PFAS imported as part of a manufactured item, such as a textile, that has an end-use function dependent on its shape or design and that does not have any commercially relevant change of chemical composition during use.

Byproducts, Impurities and Non-Isolated Intermediates. Typically, PFAS that emerge as byproducts of a manufacturing process (not used for commercial purposes).

Research and Development (“R&D”) Chemicals. PFAS manufactured (including imported) in small quantities for R&D purposes.

ABC says American households throw away about 26 million tons of food each year, while food processors, grocers and restaurants produce an additional 30 million tons of food waste.
ABC says prevention is the best strategy to reduce food waste.
As of this month, ABC says 304 biogas systems in the U.S. convert food waste into renewable energy, a 19 percent increase over the past five years.
In addition, ABC says 62 farms anaerobically digest food waste in combination with animal manure, putting another 1.7 million tons of food scraps to good use.","Approaching Thanksgiving, the Washington-based American Biogas Council (ABC) has released new data highlighting the growth of biogas systems that convert food waste into energy.

On Thanksgiving Day, Americans will throw away about 160,000 tons of food scraps, representing $550 million worth of food tossed in a single day, according to ReFED. ABC says American households throw away about 26 million tons of food each year, while food processors, grocers and restaurants produce an additional 30 million tons of food waste.

ABC says prevention is the best strategy to reduce food waste. However, biogas systems help ensure that discarded food is used productively. These systems capture the energy from surplus food and other organic material, like manure and wastewater solids, as they break down. Biogas facilities use anaerobic digestion to recycle waste into energy that can be used to power and heat homes, fuel vehicles or generate electricity through engines and fuel cells.

As of this month, ABC says 304 biogas systems in the U.S. convert food waste into renewable energy, a 19 percent increase over the past five years. ABC found that 118 of these facilities recycle food waste only, handling over 10 million tons of pre- and postconsumer inedible scraps each year.

Wastewater treatment plants and farm-based biogas systems also recycle discarded food. ABC counts 124 wastewater plants in the U.S. that combine food waste with wastewater solids to generate energy, recycling an additional 1.1 million tons of wasted food each year. In addition, ABC says 62 farms anaerobically digest food waste in combination with animal manure, putting another 1.7 million tons of food scraps to good use.

In total, these facilities recycle 12.8 million tons of food scraps and other organic waste into more than 35 billion cubic feet (Bcf) of biogas a year, which ABC says is enough to cover the year-long energy use of 283,000 U.S. households.

“The U.S. still overlooks the enormous value in food processing scraps and inedible food,” says ABC Executive Director Patrick Serfass. “Biogas facilities can convert this waste into enough home-grown energy to supply the needs of millions of Americans, while creating jobs and catalyzing new, local investments. We hope more municipalities and industrial food processors will choose to invest in biogas systems to recycle their resources locally.”

Looking into the future, ABC says if three-quarters of the discarded food from homes, grocers, restaurants and food processors were recycled in biogas systems, that wasted material could turn into 115 Bcf of biogas per year, equivalent to the energy needs of nearly one million U.S households.

The EPA’s court filing asks the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to strike down the soot standard.

Soot, made up of tiny toxic particles that lodge deep in the lungs, results in severe health harms, including premature death, and comes from sources like vehicle exhaust pipes, power plants, and factories.

Corporations and dozens of state attorneys general sued shortly after, though the rule is projected to result in billions of dollars in health benefits, prevent thousands of premature deaths, and deliver cleaner air to millions of people, particularly those living near highways, factories, and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of Healthy Communities at Earthjustice. “Trump has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money, and this administration’s EPA has nothing to do with protecting people's health, saving lives, or serving children, families or communities. We will continue to defend this life-saving standard.”

“The public health and economic benefits of the current standard are tangible,” said Hayden Hashimoto, attorney at Clean Air Task Force. “By EPA’s own estimate, the current PM NAAQS would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits, and 4,500 premature deaths – adding up to $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. An abundance of scientific evidence shows going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act.”

The EPA has never before abandoned its legal defense of a strengthened national ambient air quality standard. The agency and Department of Justice had previously vigorously defended the standard as recently as December 2024. Despite EPA’s filing endorsing some of the challengers’ legal arguments, the science remains clear that the prior standard allowed significant human health harms to occur, including numerous deaths, and needed to be strengthened to protect public health. The standard also remains in effect and is firmly within EPA’s legal scope, supported by the EPA’s own scientific evidence.

The EPA found that meeting the stronger standard would provide benefits for public health valued at $46 billion each year once all areas come into compliance, while costing less than 1.5% of that amount. There are many commonsense and low-cost solutions to reduce pollution from large industrial sources. Earthjustice analyzed polluters’ faulty claims about predicted impacts of the new standard and found that they were based on flawed analysis. Cleaner air and economic growth have gone hand in hand after past air standard improvements. And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.

Air pollution is a serious problem, especially for children, and Black communities and other people of color breathe in more of it, and face higher rates of asthma, heart disease, and premature death. Studies show that Black communities are exposed to roughly 1.5 times more deadly soot pollution than white communities.

In April, a coalition of 100 environmental, public health, and community groups urged EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to uphold and swiftly implement the 2024 soot standard, warning that any delay would endanger already overburdened communities.

Earthjustice, its clients, and partners intervened last year to defend the soot standard against court challenges from polluters and their allies. Earthjustice clients are Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Lung Association, Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition, Rio Grande International Study Center, and Sierra Club.

Puget Sound Energy is set to transfer its 370-MW stake on Jan. 1 to NorthWestern Energy for zero dollars. Separately, NorthWestern is also acquiring Avista’s 222-MW stake in the power plant at no cost on the same day.

When the deals are closed, NorthWestern will own 70% of the Colstrip power plant, NorthWestern Energy Group said in an Oct. 30 filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission.

NorthWestern expects it will be able to use the PSE stake in the plant to sell power to future large load customers, but in the meantime has entered into the Mercuria PPA, the company said in the filing.

NorthWestern said it expects the Mercuria PPA will “largely offset” the roughly $30 million in annual operating and maintenance costs related to owning the PSE capacity. The PPA is set to run from Jan. 1 to Sept. 30, 2027, according to NorthWestern Colstrip’s application at FERC.

However, MEIC contends that the application is flawed in two ways.

First, NorthWestern failed to get FERC’s approval for its acquisition of PSE’s stake in the power plant, according to the advocacy group. The Federal Power Act’s section 203 requires FERC approval of transactions, such as buying and selling power plants, that are valued at more than $10 million, MEIC said.

Although NorthWestern is acquiring PSE’s stake in the power for zero dollars, the capacity is worth at least $10 million, according to MEIC. NorthernWestern, for example, expects to reap roughly $30 million a year in revenue under its Mercuria PPA, the group said.

Second, NorthWestern failed to show that its utility customers wouldn’t inappropriately cross-subsidize NorthWestern Colstrip, according to MEIC.

“The below-cost rate NorthWestern Colstrip proposes to charge Mercuria raises an acute concern that NorthWestern Energy’s retail customers will subsidize the cost of service for the wholesale affiliate,” MEIC said.",https://imgproxy.divecdn.com/-qrIafKystmfeHYhsNweTnpSmebuehhr4fg9i4kiFWE/g:ce/rs:fit:770:435/Z3M6Ly9kaXZlc2l0ZS1zdG9yYWdlL2RpdmVpbWFnZS9HZXR0eUltYWdlcy0xODEwODUyNTIuanBn.webp,N,,2025-11-25 13:01:12.254507

In summary

California utilities regulators are bringing down “return on equity” payments to power company shareholders. It’s the lowest profit margin in 20 years for PG&E and Southern California Edison, but will be hard to notice in your payments.

With California electric rates stuck at nearly the highest in the nation, the state’s utility regulator is poised to lower the payout shareholders can receive from California’s three large investor-owned power companies.

In a proposed decision, the California Public Utilities Commission recommended dropping the “return on equity” by 0.35% each for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. If approved, shareholders of all three companies would see a potential return next year of just under 10%. Such returns for PG&E and Edison haven’t dipped below double digits in at least 20 years.

Utilities said the decline would affect their ability to bring in needed investment for their work. Critics of the decision said that the decline is too small to meaningfully impact ratepayers’ bills, even if it’s a step in the right direction.

“California and other [public utility commissions] authorize rates of return that are far in excess of the statutory requirement,” said Mark Ellis, former chief economist at Sempra, which owns San Diego Gas & Electric.

The California Public Utility Commission is expected to vote on the decision in December.

Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A number of factors go into those rates, including wildfire mitigation costs. PG&E in particular has attracted the ire of California customers for its frequent rate hikes within the last year.

Baked into those bills is the return on equity, money meant to compensate shareholders for the risk of doing business. These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%. If approved, PG&E’s rate would be 9.93% (down from 10.28%), Edison would be 9.98% (down from 10.33%), and San Diego Gas & Electric would be 9.88% (down from 10.23%). These rates are not automatically guaranteed – utilities can fall short of this return if they don’t keep down costs, such as project overruns or unexpected lawsuit fees.

A small change in this rate can be a difference of millions of dollars for ratepayers. The return is a percentage of the rate base, the total value of a utility’s assets it can earn a return on; this includes projects such as building a new power plant, for example. The rate bases for California’s three large investor-owned utilities have steadily grown each year as they add new customers and projects, increasing the amount that shareholders can receive.

PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million. Had it been 1% lower, the potential return would have been $12.5 million less.

“The proposed cost of capital decision needs refinement to better reflect California’s unique risks and market realities,” said Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford. “Making those refinements in the final decision will enhance SCE’s ability to finance essential infrastructure projects for a more reliable, resilient and ready electric grid.”

PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison echoed this sentiment, saying the decision “fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems.”

Anthony Wagner, spokesperson at San Diego Gas & Electric, said, “A decision that accurately reflects these realities is essential to enabling investments that reduce wildfire risk, strengthen reliability, replace aging infrastructure and advance California’s clean energy transition for the benefit of the communities we serve.”

Utilities routinely request these rates be pushed higher because they are a key part of what goes into utilities’ credit rating, affecting the interest they pay on loans for infrastructure investments. But in recent years, experts and consumer advocates point to a mismatch – the utility industry is typically considered low-risk, but critics say the shareholder return rates don’t reflect that. Rates for U.S. 10-year treasury bonds, which are considered the benchmark for a risk-free investment, are about half of the national average for approved utility shareholder return rates. And it’s costing utility ratepayers across the country as much as $7 billion annually, according to academics.

Ellis, the former Sempra economist, said there is a way to lower shareholder returns while keeping customer bills in check and maintaining credit ratings that the commission has not yet explored – changing the balance of debt and equity each utility has.

“You really need to understand credit,” he said. “This is where they’re going to get you.”

The commission is allowed to set the debt-equity balance when it determines shareholder returns, but it left this unchanged for all three utilities in its proposed decision for 2026. Keeping shareholder return rates high as the main means for keeping credit ratings up, Ellis said, unnecessarily burdens ratepayers.",https://lostcoastoutpost.com/loco-media/cache/18/bb/18bbce40fd30c6a257827246c45251f7.webp,N,,2025-11-25 14:02:06.166354

“EPA’s soot standards are life-saving protections that are firmly grounded in bedrock Clean Air Act legal authority.
We will continue to vigorously defend these vital safeguards.” – Peter Zalzal, distinguished counsel and associate vice president for Clean Air Strategies, Environmental Defense Fund.","—

Last night, in an unprecedented move, the Trump administration’s Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) gave up defending the national, health-based limits on fine particulate matter (PM2.5), also known as soot, that EPA strengthened last year. The EPA’s court filing asks the U.S, Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit to strike down the soot standard.

Soot, made up of tiny toxic particles that lodge deep in the lungs, results in severe health harms, including premature death, and comes from sources like vehicle exhaust pipes, power plants, and factories.

The National Ambient Air Quality Standards (NAAQS) for PM2.5 — or the soot standards — are a cornerstone of the Clean Air Act. After over a decade without updates, the EPA followed the advice of independent experts and extensive scientific evidence and strengthened the annual soot standard to better protect public health, reducing the allowable level from 12 to 9 micrograms per cubic meter. Corporations and dozens of state attorneys general sued shortly after, though the rule is projected to result in billions of dollars in health benefits, prevent thousands of premature deaths, and deliver cleaner air to millions of people, particularly those living near highways, factories, and power plants.

“Walking away from these clean air standards doesn’t power anything but disease,” said Patrice Simms, vice president of Healthy Communities at Earthjustice. “Trump has made it clear that his agenda is all about saving corporations money, and this administration’s EPA has nothing to do with protecting people’s health, saving lives, or serving children, families, or communities. We will continue to defend this life-saving standard.”

“The public health and economic benefits of the current standard are tangible,” said Hayden Hashimoto, attorney at Clean Air Task Force. “By EPA’s own estimate, the current PM NAAQS would avoid 800,000 cases of asthma symptoms, 2,000 hospital visits, and 4,500 premature deaths — adding up to $46 billion in health benefits in 2032. An abundance of scientific evidence shows going back to the previous standard would fail to provide the level of protection for public health required under the Clean Air Act.”

The EPA has never before abandoned its legal defense of a strengthened national ambient air quality standard. The agency and Department of Justice had previously vigorously defended the standard as recently as December 2024. Despite EPA’s filing endorsing some of the challengers’ legal arguments, the science remains clear that the prior standard allowed significant human health harms to occur, including numerous deaths, and needed to be strengthened to protect public health. The standard also remains in effect and is firmly within EPA’s legal scope, supported by the EPA’s own scientific evidence.

The EPA found that meeting the stronger standard would provide benefits for public health valued at $46 billion each year once all areas come into compliance, while costing less than 1.5% of that amount. There are many commonsense and low-cost solutions to reduce pollution from large industrial sources. Earthjustice analyzed polluters’ faulty claims about predicted impacts of the new standard and found that they were based on flawed analysis. Cleaner air and economic growth have gone hand in hand after past air standard improvements. And the dire results polluters claimed would result from the strengthened soot standard have failed to materialize.

Air pollution is a serious problem, especially for children, and Black communities and other people of color breathe in more of it, and face higher rates of asthma, heart disease, and premature death. Studies show that Black communities are exposed to roughly 1.5 times more deadly soot pollution than white communities.

In April, a coalition of 100 environmental, public health, and community groups urged EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin to uphold and swiftly implement the 2024 soot standard, warning that any delay would endanger already overburdened communities.

Earthjustice, its clients, and partners intervened last year to defend the soot standard against court challenges from polluters and their allies. Earthjustice clients are Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments, American Lung Association, Environmental Defense Fund, NRDC (Natural Resources Defense Council), Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition, Rio Grande International Study Center, and Sierra Club. Clean Air Task Force represents Citizens for Pennsylvania’s Future and Conservation Law Foundation.

“Our communities already carry the burden of polluted air and higher rates of asthma and heart disease. Weakening soot protections will only deepen these disparities and cost more Black lives,” said Yvonka Hall, executive director of the Northeast Ohio Black Health Coalition.

“In the border region, families breathe air laced with pollution from trucks, refineries, and factories. This decision puts our health and our children’s future at even greater risk,” said Tricia Cortez, executive director of the Rio Grande International Study Center.

“As nurses, we see the toll air pollution takes on our patients — especially kids and older adults. Gutting science-based standards puts lives in danger and public health on the line,” said Katie Huffling, DNP, RN, CNM, FAAN executive director from the Alliance of Nurses for Healthy Environments.

“Instead of enforcing clean air protections, EPA is cynically partnering with big polluters to bypass public input and dismantle the laws that safeguard the air we all breathe. It ignores the clear science telling us that this choice will be deadly,” said John Walke, senior attorney and director of federal clean air at NRDC.

The facility would include around 180,000 lithium-ion (Li-ion) batteries stored in three specially designed, 30-foot tall “low profile” buildings.

According to Vistra representatives, another benefit of the site selection is that it would have connected to Pacific Gas & Electric’s (PG&E’s) active transmission lines. Three new project-level substations would link to PG&E’s existing substation, which was originally built to draw electricity from the existing gas power plant.

After facing delays with the local municipal permitting process, Vistra Energy decided to seek approval from the CEC to build the BESS under the provisions of Assembly Bill (AB) 205.

On 28 October 2024, Vistra issued the Morro Bay City Council with a letter requesting a pause on municipal review of the standalone BESS project, opting instead to use the CEC’s streamlined certification process.

AB 205, signed into law by California Governor Gavin Newsom in 2022, expanded the CEC’s authority to include permitting BESS facilities exceeding 200MWh, offering developers an alternative pathway for approval through the ‘Opt-In’ programme – effectively bypassing the need for local authority permitting.

Earlier this year, CPUC established new standards for the maintenance and operation of battery energy storage facilities.

The CPUC modified General Order 167, which provides a method for implementing and enforcing maintenance and operation standards for electric generating facilities.

Additional changes to operating BESS in California were quickly introduced the week followingthe Moss Landing fire. Local politician Dawn Addis, California Assembly member for the 30th District which includes part of Monterey County, introduced AB 303, also known as the ‘Battery Energy Safety & Accountability Act’.

The Act proposed removing rules that allow the ‘Opt-In’ programme. Addis’ bill failed to make it past the first reading and missed the house of origin deadline.

In March, ESN published an article about a solar-plus-storage project with a 4.6GWh BESS that progressed through the Opt-In programme, in which we included a roundup of all eight projects making use of the programme at the time (Premium access).

This cap will only apply to information requests for CSRD reporting purposes, and not to other commercial information exchanges.
Taxonomy Reporting: As in the current CSRD, only companies within the proposed scope of CSRD reporting (which varies among the three institutions) will be required to report under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation.
By early 2026, there will likely be a final CSRD/CSDDD Omnibus that amends the current CSRD and CSDDD rules, and which Member States must then transpose into national law applicable to companies.","After months of uncertainty, the outlook for key EU sustainability laws is far clearer.

On November 13, 2025, the European Parliament adopted its negotiating position on the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (“CSRD”) and the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive (“CSDDD”) Omnibus simplification. This follows the European Commission’s Omnibus proposal in February (see more here) and the Council of the EU’s negotiating mandate in June (see more here). “Trilogue” negotiations between the three institutions began on November 18, 2025, with the aim of finalizing the legislation by the end of 2025 (see four-column document here).

This post uses the Parliament’s position as the basis to set out some of the key points on the CSRD and CSDDD that have been the focus of debate. It also flags some key outstanding discrepancies between the Parliament and Council positions which will need to be ironed out in the Trilogue negotiations. So while the legislative journey is not yet over, the emerging alignment on these texts is finally coming into greater focus. As a result, companies are now starting to reinvigorate their efforts to prepare for compliance, given the significant areas of convergence between the Parliament and Council (flagged in brackets below) and confirmation that both institutions continue to support the extraterritorial application of the CSRD and CSDDD to certain non-EU parent companies.

CSDDD

Applicability Thresholds (Parliament and Council aligned):

For EU-incorporated companies: 5,000+ employees and over EUR 1.5 billion in net worldwide turnover (on a consolidated basis for EU ultimate parent companies of corporate groups).

For non-EU-incorporated companies: EUR 1.5 billion in net turnover generated in the EU (on a consolidated basis for non-EU ultimate parent companies of corporate groups).

Timing (Parliament and Council not aligned):

Application: The Parliament proposes to maintain the CSDDD application timeline set out in the Commission’s “Stop the Clock” proposal, i.e., obligations will apply to all in-scope companies starting July 26, 2028. The Council, in contrast, proposes postponing the CSDDD’s application by another year, to July 26, 2029.

Transposition: The Parliament maintains the Commission position on the Member State transposition deadline (July 26, 2027), whereas the Council would also push this by a year (July 26, 2028).

Level of Harmonization (Parliament and Council partially aligned): All three institutions propose a significantly broader harmonization of CSDDD obligations across the Member States. Parliament proposes the most extensive harmonization with mandatory alignment for all provisions from Articles 6 to 16. Parliament also proposes deleting the provision that would allow Member States to introduce more stringent or more specific due diligence obligations. This expanded harmonization would substantially reduce the risk of fragmented national requirements across the EU.

Changes to Due Diligence Obligations (Parliament and Council not aligned): The main focus of recent debates has been the required approach to identification and assessment of adverse impacts (under Article 8). Some of the key areas of divergence are as follows:

Broader Value Chain Scope and Risk-Based Approach to the Identification and Assessment of Adverse Impacts: The Parliament proposes requiring a company to cover the entire in-scope chain of activities (including both direct and indirect business partners) when identifying and assessing adverse human rights and environmental impacts. Rather than limiting the due diligence obligations to specific “tiers” of the supply chain, the Parliament position emphasizes a risk-based approach that takes into account relevant risk factors. This is in contrast to the Commission and Council positions which seek to introduce a two-tiered approach that limits impact assessment obligations to a company’s own operations, its subsidiaries, and direct business partners in the chain of activities (with additional triggers for when indirect business partners may be included).

Reframed Risk Identification and Assessment Steps: The Parliament’s position reframes and somewhat limits the risk identification and assessment requirements:

Step One: Companies must first carry out a “scoping” exercise (revising the Commission’s “mapping exercise”), relying solely on “already reasonably available information” to identify general areas where adverse impacts are most likely to occur and most severe. During this initial phase, companies are expressly not required to request information from their business partners.

Step Two: Based on the results of their scoping exercise, companies would only proceed to a “further assessment” (replacing and limiting the Council’s “in-depth assessment”) where, based on “relevant and verifiable information,” they have “grounds to believe” that adverse impacts may arise or have arisen, and only in the areas that were previously identified to be most likely to occur and most severe.

Value Chain Information Cap: For the purposes of further assessments in “Step Two” above, companies must only seek information from business partners where necessary, and never in the areas where no likely and severe risks were identified. To protect smaller companies from burdensome requests, in-scope companies can only request additional information from business partners with fewer than 5,000 employees (in contrast to the Council’s 1,000 employee cap) as a last resort, and only if that information cannot reasonably be obtained by other means. All information requests must be targeted, reasonable, and proportionate.

Other Substantive Obligations (Parliament and Council aligned in key areas): While the nature of the other substantive obligations (Articles 9–16) is broadly aligned between the Parliament and Council positions, some differences must still be resolved. For example, in Articles 10 and 11, the Parliament has proposed that it will always be voluntary for a company to suspend a relationship with a business partner as a way to prevent or end adverse impacts (the Commission proposed these “last resort” measures as mandatory). The Parliament also proposes to shorten Article 15’s regular due diligence assessment interval to four years, in contrast to the five-year interval proposed by the Commission and Council.

Climate Transition Plans (“CTPs”) (Parliament and Council not aligned): The Parliament’s proposal removes the mandatory CTP requirement entirely by deleting Article 22. This differs from the Council’s position, which maintains the obligation for companies to have a CTP, albeit with reduced obligations.

Civil Liability (Parliament and Council aligned): Both the Parliament and Council support the Commission’s proposal to remove the mandatory EU-wide civil liability regime. Civil liability for CSDDD breaches would still be subject to the rules and procedures of each Member State’s national court system.

Penalties (Parliament and Council aligned): Both the Parliament and Council require the Commission, together with Member States, to develop penalty-setting guidance for supervisory authorities. The Parliament clarifies that this guidance should spell out the “appropriate level” of penalties, a requirement not included in the Council’s text. Instead, the Council’s position includes a mandatory “cap” on penalties in the operative provision. However, in the Recitals the Parliament also agrees with the Council that the maximum limit for pecuniary penalties should be set at 5% of the net worldwide turnover.

CSRD

Applicability Thresholds (Parliament and Council not aligned):

For EU companies: The Parliament’s proposal increases the proposed employee threshold to 1,750+ employees (the Council sets the threshold at 1,000+ employees). The Parliament maintains the Council’s proposed turnover requirement of over EUR 450 million.

For non-EU ultimate parent companies: The Parliament’s proposal limits applicability to non-EU ultimate parent companies that have an EU-incorporated subsidiary or branch in the EU that generates more than EUR 450 million in net turnover. The Council maintains the prior structure of the threshold that requires (i) a large EU subsidiary or branch and (ii) the non-EU parent to generate more than EUR 450 million of turnover “in the EU.”

The Parliament proposes to exempt from direct reporting requirements “financial holding” companies that have the sole purpose of acquiring and managing shares in other companies, without directly or indirectly being involved in the management of those companies. The subsidiaries of those companies may have reporting requirements, if they meet the applicability requirements in their own right.

Separately, on November 13, 2025, a Delegated Regulation entered into force that provides reporting relief for companies that were required to publish CSRD sustainability statements on FY 2024 data (Wave 1 companies). Applying retroactively from January 1, 2025, the Delegated Regulation ensures that companies in the first wave of CSRD reporting will not be required to disclose additional information when reporting on FY 2025 and FY 2026 data beyond what was in their FY 2024 sustainability statements.

ESRS (“European Sustainability Reporting Standards”): The Parliament’s position broadly aligns with the Commission’s proposal and the Council’s position that reporting standards must be simplified and reduced. The Parliament also tasks the Commission with developing sector-specific guidelines to assist voluntary sector-specific reporting. The European Financial Reporting Advisory Group (“EFRAG”) has announced that the next draft of the simplified ESRS will be released on December 4, 2025. EFRAG’s initial proposal for revisions in the Amended ESRS confirm that the CSRD’s distinct double materiality assessment will be preserved (albeit streamlined), and both the Council and the Parliament ask that the Commission provides further clarity on the application of the double materiality principle when it adopts the Amended ESRS as a delegated act.

Value Chain Information Cap: The Parliament proposes that companies reporting under the CSRD are not allowed to request information from companies with an average of less than 1,750 employees and a net turnover of EUR 450 million, beyond what is required under the voluntary reporting standard for non-listed micro, small and medium enterprises (“VSME”). By comparison, the Council limited this cap to companies not exceeding an average of 1,000 employees. This cap will only apply to information requests for CSRD reporting purposes, and not to other commercial information exchanges.

Taxonomy Reporting: As in the current CSRD, only companies within the proposed scope of CSRD reporting (which varies among the three institutions) will be required to report under Article 8 of the Taxonomy Regulation. The Parliament and the Council agree to delete the Commission’s proposed option to report on partial Taxonomy alignment.

We expect to see growing clarity on these outstanding questions over the coming weeks. By early 2026, there will likely be a final CSRD/CSDDD Omnibus that amends the current CSRD and CSDDD rules, and which Member States must then transpose into national law applicable to companies.

The Iberia Parish facility began production in July 2025, several months ahead of schedule. The accelerated timeline was driven by the passage of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration's trade policies, both of which catalyzed demand for American-made solar technology that is fully compliant with anticipated Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidance. The facility, which has no dependencies on Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains, produces First Solar's Series 7 modules using American materials including glass from Illinois and Ohio, and steel produced in Mississippi and fabricated into backrails in Louisiana.

""First Solar's investment is already delivering real results for Iberia Parish and the surrounding region with hundreds of good-paying jobs and new opportunities for Louisiana workers and businesses,"" said Louisiana Governor, Jeff Landry. ""This is exactly how we advance President Trump's agenda of American energy dominance. Louisiana has always powered this country, and with projects like this, we're strengthening our workforce and securing an all-of-the-above energy future that drives growth and prosperity.""

According to an economic impact analysis conducted by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette and commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority (IEDA) the new facility is forecast to grow Iberia Parish's Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 4.4% in its first full year of operations at capacity. Manufacturing roles at the facility offer an average compensation package of $90,000 per year, more than three times the per capita income in Iberia Parish.

""This is more than just a manufacturing facility. It's a commitment to American energy dominance, affordable electricity, growth and prosperity,"" said Mark Widmar, chief executive officer, First Solar. ""By competitively producing energy technology in America with American materials, while creating American jobs, we're demonstrating that US reindustrialization isn't just a thesis, it's an operating reality.""

The high-tech factory is enabled by artificial intelligence (AI), using computer vision and deep learning to automatically detect defects in solar panels during production, while technicians and operators leverage AI-powered tools to make operating adjustments and guide decision making.

""This is, beyond doubt, one of the most advanced solar manufacturing facilities in the world and it represents the very best of American manufacturing innovation,"" said Kuntal Kumar Verma, chief manufacturing officer, First Solar. ""Along with its sister facilities in Ohio and Alabama, this factory demonstrates how AI can be harnessed to help American factory workers reach their full potential. Our fleet offers proof that AI can help realize productivity gains that allow us to out-innovate the competition and run our operations smarter, better, and faster.""

The Louisiana facility is part of what is already the largest solar technology manufacturing and research and development (R&D) footprint in the Western Hemisphere and includes three fully vertically integrated manufacturing facilities in Ohio, and one in Alabama, along with R&D centers in Ohio and California. Last week, the Company announced an investment in a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to onshore final production processes for Series 6 modules initiated by its international fleet. Altogether, the Company, which expects to directly employ over 5,500 people in the US by the end of 2026, will have invested approximately $4.5 billion in American manufacturing and R&D infrastructure since 2019.

Having manufactured in the US since 2002, First Solar is the country's leading PV solar technology and manufacturing company. It is the only one of the world's largest solar manufacturers to be headquartered in the US. By 2027, the Company expects to support over 30,000 direct, indirect, and induced jobs across the country, estimated to represent more than $3 billion in labor income.

Last week, five of the region’s states launched a $450 million effort to warm more of the homes in the often-frigid region with energy-efficient, low-emission heat pumps instead of burning fossil fuels.

“It’s a big deal,” said Katie Dykes, commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection. ​“It’s unprecedented to see five states aligning together on a transformational approach to deploying more-affordable clean-heat options.”

The New England Heat Pump Accelerator is a collaboration between Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Rhode Island. The initiative is funded by the federal Climate Pollution Reduction Grants program, which was created by President Joe Biden’s 2022 Inflation Reduction Act. The accelerator’s launch marks a rare milestone for a Biden-era climate initiative amid the Trump administration’s relentless attempts to scrap federal clean energy and environmental programs.

The goal: Get more heat pumps into more homes through a combination of financial incentives, educational outreach, and workforce development.

New England is a rich target for such an effort because of its current dependence on fossil-fuel heating. Natural gas and propane are in wide use, and heating oil is still widespread throughout the region; more than half of Maine’s homes are heated by oil, and the other coalition states all use oil at rates much higher than the national average. The prevalence of oil in particular means there’s plenty of opportunity to grow heat-pump adoption, cut emissions, and lower residents’ energy bills.

At the same time, heat pumps have faced barriers in the region, including the upfront cost of equipment, New England’s high price of electricity, and misconceptions about heat pumps’ ability to work in cold weather.

“There’s not a full awareness that these cold-temperature heat pumps can handle our winters, and do it at a cost that is lower than many of our delivered fuels,” said Joseph DeNicola, deputy commissioner of Connecticut’s Department of Energy and Environmental Protection.

To some degree, the momentum is shifting. Maine has had notable success, hitting its aim of 100,000 new heat pump installations in 2023, two years ahead of its initial deadline. Massachusetts is on track to reach its 2025 target, but needs adoption rates to rise in order to make its 2030 goal.

The accelerator aims to speed up adoption by supporting the installation of some 580,000 residential heat pumps, which would reduce carbon emissions by 2.5 million metric tons by 2030 — the equivalent of taking more than 540,000 gas-powered passenger vehicles off the road.

The initiative is organized into three program areas, or ​“hubs,” as planners called them during a webinar kicking off the accelerator this week.

The largest portion of money, some $270 million, will go to the ​“market hub.” Distributors will receive incentives for selling heat pumps. They will keep a small percentage of the money for themselves and pass most of the savings on to the contractors buying the equipment. The contractors, in turn, will pass the lower price on to the customers. In addition to reducing upfront costs for consumers, this approach is designed to shift the market by encouraging distributors to keep the equipment in stock, therefore making it an easier choice for contractors and their customers.

These midstream incentives are expected to reduce the cost of cold-climate air-source heat pumps by $500 to $700 per unit and heat-pump water heaters by $200 to $300 per unit. When contractors buy the appliances, the incentive will be applied automatically — no extra paperwork or claims process required.

“It should be very simple for contractors to access this funding,” said Ellen Pfeiffer, a senior manager with Energy Solutions, a clean energy consultancy that is helping implement the programming. ​“It should be almost seamless.”

Consumers will also remain eligible for any incentives available through state efficiency programs, such as rebates from Mass Save or Efficiency Maine, but will likely not be able to stack the accelerator benefits with federal incentives like the Home Efficiency Rebates and Home Electrification and Appliances Rebate programs.

Program planners expect to be finalizing the incentive levels through the end of the year, enrolling and training distributors in the early months of 2026, and making the first participating products available in February 2026, said New England Heat Pump Accelerator program manager Jennifer Gottlieb Elazhari.

The second program area is the innovation hub. Each state will receive $14.5 million to fund one or two pilot programs testing out new ways to overcome barriers to heat pump adoption by low- and moderate-income households and in disadvantaged communities. One state might, for example, create a lending library of window-mounted air-source heat pumps, allowing someone whose oil heating breaks down the time to research replacement options rather than just installing new oil equipment.

The innovation hub will also include workforce development and training. Organizers are talking with contractors and other partners to figure out where the gaps are in heat pump training. In the first few months of 2026, they will develop a program with a target start date in April.

The goal will be not only to ensure that there are tradespeople with the needed skills to install the systems, but also to lay the groundwork for faster adoption by spreading knowledge about the capabilities of the technology and the available incentives.

The third major area of the accelerator is a resource hub to aggregate information for contractors, distributors, program implementers, and other stakeholders. Overall, organizers hope to have all three hubs operational in spring 2026.

Accelerator planners expect programs to boost adoption even as a federal tax credit of up to $2,000 on heat pumps and heat-pump water heaters is phased out at the end of the year, leaving states leading the way on clean energy action.

“At the state level, this is one example of a way we are helping to make progress in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, but with a solution that can help people take control of their energy costs,” Dykes said. ​“That’s really what we’re focused on.”",https://newhampshirebulletin.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/heatpumpcanary-2048x1536.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 15:02:33.099432

The United States Electric Commercial Vehicle Market was valued at USD 13.88 Billion in 2024, and is expected to reach USD 55.92 Billion by 2030, rising at a CAGR of 26.41%.

The United States electric commercial vehicle (ECV) market is experiencing robust growth due to rising environmental concerns, stringent emission regulations, and the growing adoption of clean energy solutions.

Businesses are prioritizing sustainability, driving the demand for ECVs across logistics, delivery, and public transportation sectors. Government incentives and subsidies, including tax credits for purchasing electric vehicles, have further propelled market expansion. According to the U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), there were over 12,000 electric medium- and heavy-duty vehicles operating in the U.S. as of Q4 2023. This includes delivery vans, trucks, and buses, reflecting a nearly 35% increase year-over-year in deployment.

The development of advanced battery technologies has enhanced vehicle efficiency and reduced operating costs, making ECVs increasingly attractive for commercial applications. The growing awareness of corporate social responsibility among companies encourages investments in cleaner fleet options. Key trends in the market include advancements in battery technology, such as solid-state batteries offering greater energy density and faster charging times.

The integration of smart connectivity features, including telematics and vehicle-to-everything (V2X) communication, is transforming fleet management and optimizing operational efficiency. Emerging technologies, such as hydrogen fuel cells, are also gaining traction, especially for long-haul commercial applications. The shift toward autonomous electric vehicles is creating opportunities for cost reduction and enhanced safety in logistics operations. Collaborations between automotive manufacturers and technology firms are accelerating innovation, while fleet electrification strategies by major logistics companies are bolstering market growth.

Market Drivers

Government Incentives and Regulations

The United States has implemented a series of policies to accelerate the adoption of electric commercial vehicles (ECVs). Incentives such as tax credits, grants, and rebates for fleet operators and vehicle manufacturers reduce the upfront cost of adopting ECVs. Stringent emissions regulations encourage a shift away from internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles.

The California Air Resources Board (CARB) and federal initiatives like the Zero-Emission Vehicle (ZEV) program mandate fleet electrification, making ECVs essential for regulatory compliance. These measures provide a stable demand for ECVs, particularly among logistics and public transportation operators seeking sustainable and regulatory-compliant solutions. For instance, in 2023 leasing models allowed electric cars to qualify for relaxed commercial vehicle tax credits. Savings were passed to leaseholders, boosting EV adoption. This strategy supported sustained rollouts.

Key Market Challenges

High Upfront Costs

The initial cost of electric commercial vehicles remains a barrier despite declining battery prices. ECVs are generally more expensive than their ICE counterparts due to the cost of advanced batteries and associated technologies. Fleet operators often face budget constraints that make the transition to ECVs challenging, particularly for small businesses.

Even with incentives, the total cost of ownership (TCO) calculation, factoring in charging infrastructure and maintenance, can deter adoption. Addressing these financial barriers requires scalable production and economies of scale to further reduce manufacturing costs.

Key Market Trends

Adoption of Electric Delivery Vans and Trucks

The increasing focus on last-mile delivery efficiency is driving the adoption of electric delivery vans and trucks. Companies in the logistics and retail sectors are prioritizing these vehicles for urban deliveries to reduce emissions and operational costs.

According to the North American Council for Freight Efficiency (NACFE), electric delivery vans used by fleets like FedEx and UPS demonstrated 30-50% lower total cost of ownership (TCO) compared to internal combustion vehicles in urban use cases.

Six new shuttles will replace older vehicles nearing the end of their service life, lowering the overall age of Wave Transit’s fleet. The purchase also completes Wave’s transition from diesel to compressed natural gas, which officials say will improve reliability, reduce emissions, and support a safer transit system for riders and other drivers.

Ridership on Wave’s Seahawk Shuttle routes — operated in partnership with UNCW — has increased 48% over the past year, or roughly 42,000 additional trips. Systemwide ridership across all fixed routes rose by 28%. Wave plans to deploy the new shuttles primarily on Seahawk routes, with flexibility to use them on other fixed routes when needed.

The Wave Transit board approved the agency’s application for the federal Low- or No-Emission grant in June. The $1.02 million award requires a $180,000 local match. Wave was one of only two transit agencies in North Carolina to receive awards in this year’s $2 billion national funding round, alongside Winston-Salem Transit Authority.

Wave previously won a Low- or No-Emission grant in 2023, which paid for four compressed natural gas fixed-route buses and one compressed natural gas shuttle, completing its transition of fixed-route vehicles away from diesel.

Earlier this year, Westinghouse publicly shared its plan with the White House to have 10 of its state-of-the-art AP1000 nuclear reactors under construction by 2030. The new reactors would help address growing demands on the U.S. energy grid from AI and other sources, and when completed, they would provide enough combined power to electrify 7.5 million households. That’s roughly every household in the five largest U.S. cities plus a few data centers.

Yet reactor construction has slowed down in recent decades due to complex approvals and building processes. To reach its ambitious goal, Westinghouse has partnered with Google Cloud to develop a custom AI-powered platform using specialized models from both Google and Westinghouse — itself a leader in AI for energy production — that helps optimize and accelerate reactor construction.

So far, early pilots of the platform have shown significant time and cost savings, and the companies are also exploring ways for AI to help enhance nuclear operations and safety. Here’s a closer look.

AI fuels itself

The partnership is driven by a pressing global challenge of meeting the ever-increasing energy demands with carbon free power. Dr. Lou Martinez Sancho, Westinghouse's CTO and Executive Vice President of R&D and Innovation, framed the core idea as ""energy for AI and AI for energy.""

Nuclear is notable for offering clean, reliable power at an immense scale from a small footprint. With the United States projected to need 400 gigawatts of new power by 2040 — a 32% increase from current usage — conventional construction timelines are insufficient.

A foundation for AI

Westinghouse CEO Dan Sumner has stressed that AI-driven decision-making optimization is essential to making nuclear power a viable investment for utilities and addressing energy urgency. A major factor in the partnership’s success has been Westinghouse's AI readiness.

The company already established its own proprietary AI infrastructure, Hive, designed specifically to meet nuclear's stringent regulatory and export-control frameworks. They also developed Bertha, a generative AI assistant that instantly accesses 75 years of meticulous nuclear knowledge and documentation at Westinghouse. Google engineers were impressed that a 140-year-old company had quietly assembled the exact foundation needed to deploy AI securely in a heavily regulated environment.

Building on data

The core AI innovation targets the construction process — historically 60% of reactor costs. Until recently, construction management relied on spreadsheets and paper documents, leading to delays that cascaded across thousands of interdependent tasks. But with AI, Westinghouse turned decades of documentation to its advantage.

The new AI system combines the companies’ AI models and prediction tools with Westinghouse’s WNEXUS, a 3D digital twin of its reactors. When combined with current and historic data, the system can predict bottlenecks, optimize construction task sequences, adjust staffing levels, and account for external factors like supply chain constraints.

AI as a ""technology brick""

The optimization technology for new reactor construction is built using a ""technology brick approach"" Martinez Sancho said, meaning it has applications far beyond the initial project. The same AI tools are already being applied to reduce licensing processes and operations timing. By finding the fastest path through maintenance and refueling tasks, the AI helps minimize reactor downtime.

Westinghouse views AI not as a tool for simple cost optimization, but instead as a catalyst for a revolution that transforms the energy sector and turns decades of documentation into an asset that accelerates progress.",https://info.westinghousenuclear.com/hubfs/Blog/Westinghouse-vogtle-plant-georgi.width-1000.format-webp.jpeg,N,,2025-11-25 12:02:22.833209

Your bill will barely drop,News From The States,,,,,https://www.newsfromthestates.com/article/california-about-cut-power-company-profits-historic-lows-your-bill-will-barely-drop,"Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.
These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%.
PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million.
Rates for U.S. 10-year treasury bonds, which are considered the benchmark for a risk-free investment, are about half of the national average for approved utility shareholder return rates.
Keeping shareholder return rates high as the main means for keeping credit ratings up, Ellis said, unnecessarily burdens ratepayers.","With California electric rates stuck at nearly the highest in the nation, the state’s utility regulator is poised to lower the payout shareholders can receive from California’s three large investor-owned power companies.

In a proposed decision, the California Public Utilities Commission recommended dropping the “return on equity” by 0.35% each for Pacific Gas & Electric, Southern California Edison and San Diego Gas & Electric. If approved, shareholders of all three companies would see a potential return next year of just under 10%. Such returns for PG&E and Edison haven’t dipped below double digits in at least 20 years.

Utilities said the decline would affect their ability to bring in needed investment for their work. Critics of the decision said that the decline is too small to meaningfully impact ratepayers’ bills, even if it’s a step in the right direction.

“California and other [public utility commissions] authorize rates of return that are far in excess of the statutory requirement,” said Mark Ellis, former chief economist at Sempra, which owns San Diego Gas & Electric.

The California Public Utility Commission is expected to vote on the decision in December.

Californians pay the second-highest electric rates in the U.S. after Hawaii, according to the most recent figures from the U.S. Energy Information Administration. A number of factors go into those rates, including wildfire mitigation costs. PG&E in particular has attracted the ire of California customers for its frequent rate hikes within the last year.

Baked into those bills is the return on equity, money meant to compensate shareholders for the risk of doing business. These shareholder return rates are set by each state’s utility regulators and hover nationally around 10%. If approved, PG&E’s rate would be 9.93% (down from 10.28%), Edison would be 9.98% (down from 10.33%), and San Diego Gas & Electric would be 9.88% (down from 10.23%). These rates are not automatically guaranteed – utilities can fall short of this return if they don’t keep down costs, such as project overruns or unexpected lawsuit fees.

A small change in this rate can be a difference of millions of dollars for ratepayers. The return is a percentage of the rate base, the total value of a utility’s assets it can earn a return on; this includes projects such as building a new power plant, for example. The rate bases for California’s three large investor-owned utilities have steadily grown each year as they add new customers and projects, increasing the amount that shareholders can receive.

PG&E, for example, had a 10% shareholder return in 2023, a possible return of about $125 million. Had it been 1% lower, the potential return would have been $12.5 million less.

“The proposed cost of capital decision needs refinement to better reflect California’s unique risks and market realities,” said Edison spokesperson Jeff Monford. “Making those refinements in the final decision will enhance SCE’s ability to finance essential infrastructure projects for a more reliable, resilient and ready electric grid.”

PG&E spokesperson Jennifer Robison echoed this sentiment, saying the decision “fails to acknowledge current elevated risks to help attract the needed investment for California’s energy systems.”

Anthony Wagner, spokesperson at San Diego Gas & Electric, said, “A decision that accurately reflects these realities is essential to enabling investments that reduce wildfire risk, strengthen reliability, replace aging infrastructure and advance California’s clean energy transition for the benefit of the communities we serve.”

Utilities routinely request these rates be pushed higher because they are a key part of what goes into utilities’ credit rating, affecting the interest they pay on loans for infrastructure investments. But in recent years, experts and consumer advocates point to a mismatch – the utility industry is typically considered low-risk, but critics say the shareholder return rates don’t reflect that. Rates for U.S. 10-year treasury bonds, which are considered the benchmark for a risk-free investment, are about half of the national average for approved utility shareholder return rates. And it’s costing utility ratepayers across the country as much as $7 billion annually, according to academics.

Ellis, the former Sempra economist, said there is a way to lower shareholder returns while keeping customer bills in check and maintaining credit ratings that the commission has not yet explored – changing the balance of debt and equity each utility has.

“You really need to understand credit,” he said. “This is where they’re going to get you.”

The commission is allowed to set the debt-equity balance when it determines shareholder returns, but it left this unchanged for all three utilities in its proposed decision for 2026. Keeping shareholder return rates high as the main means for keeping credit ratings up, Ellis said, unnecessarily burdens ratepayers.",https://www.newsfromthestates.com/s3/files/styles/social_large/s3/articles/feeds-state-47635/calmatters.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/111023_angelica-vasquez_mo_cm_131764089140.jpg?h=56d0ca2e&itok=Fna5JS1u,N,,2025-11-25 12:02:35.145444

The United States, which pulled out of the 2015 Paris climate agreement at the start of the year, did not send a delegation. This no-show of the world’s second-largest carbon emitter was not the only disappointment. The meeting, which was held in Belém, Brazil, has done little to make progress, with the decisions made and the eight-page final document barely shifting the dial on slowing down climate change or averting its most dangerous effects.

Don’t scrap climate COPs, reform them

There were some positives. Delegates to this conference of the parties (COP) agreed on a substantial increase for ‘adaptation finance’, whereby high-income nations fund projects, ideally through grants, that protect low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) from the effects of climate change. But although COP30 was dubbed the ‘implementation COP’, the core issue of phasing out fossil-fuel use did not make it into the final text. Even by the incremental standards of COP meetings, things have stood still.

In 2021, governments attending COP26 in Glasgow, UK, agreed to “phase down” the use of coal without carbon capture and to eliminate subsidies for fossil-fuel companies. They then adopted a goal of “transitioning away from fossil fuels” at COP28 in Dubai. But despite the efforts of a coalition of at least 80 countries from around the world, negotiators at COP30 failed to agree on even the idea that this transition needs a road map. This failure was mainly the result of opposition from oil-producing states, led by Saudi Arabia and including influential countries such as India and Russia — known collectively as the like-minded group.

Next year’s COP will be held in Antalya, Turkey, and will be jointly organized by the governments of Australia and Turkey. The two hosts and their allies have 12 months to inject some fresh thinking into a stalling process that risks consigning current and future generations to the perils and uncertainties of a warming planet. Fossil fuels must be phased out in a just and equitable way if the world is to prevent dangerous climate change. The challenge is how to bring the discussion on a road map back to COP31 and avoid a repeat of the outcome of COP30.

The ‘implementation COP’: why the Belém summit must ratchet up climate action

Although Brazil did not succeed this time — nor in agreeing a separate plan that sought to end deforestation — the country aims to continue informally discussing road maps for both goals with those nations that have supported developing such plans. This is positive and echoes a call made in these pages last month for the creation of informal spaces for policymakers and scientists to discuss contentious issues in UN negotiations (Nature 646, 1025–1026; 2025).

However, an agreement on how to end fossil-fuel use isn’t going to happen for as long as the current stand-off continues. Those countries objecting to even the idea of discussing a road map say that they cannot put their economies at risk. This is a legitimate concern, and any discussion on a road map must engage, in the necessary detail, with how to mitigate this.

However, national interests will not be served unless all countries can be persuaded to recognize the enormity of the bigger picture. That’s a core lesson from the 2015 Paris climate agreement, and from accords in other domains that have succeeded against the odds, including this year’s agreement on a pandemic treaty. These have succeeded, at least in part, because countries rich and poor realized (or accepted) that if they did not act together, there would be risks for everyone — including themselves.

Navigating the black box of fair emissions targets

The transition to renewable energy is under way, especially in LMICs. But the development of clean energy is not going to reduce the risk of dangerous climate change while nations continue to burn fossil fuels at a high rate. This is widely accepted and backed by robust evidence. It also cannot be denied that, if climate change is allowed to continue at the current pace, no country will be immune to or safe from its effects. Yes, richer countries will initially cope better than poorer ones. But without coordinated global action, the effects of extreme weather will eventually harm all countries. It is not enough to say this just once or twice. It needs to be repeated again and again.

The legitimate concerns of states that rely on fossil-fuel exports need to be taken into account, and any formula for phasing out fossil fuels needs to be fair and equitable, especially to countries that are still on a path to industrialization. Those least able to afford the transition to clean energy must be supported by those that can. But, in the end, it is in everyone’s interests that all countries act to phase out fossil fuels. Efforts to block even a discussion on this have to stop.

For real climate action, empower women

COP30’s failure to acknowledge the need for a road map was a missed opportunity, but the fact that the talks did not blow up completely is a cause for hope, particularly at a time when multilateralism is under severe stress. It is also a sign that countries could yet recapture the spirit of Paris in 2015, when it seemed that the world had finally woken up to the dangers of global warming, and agreed the beginnings of a road map on how to restrict global temperature increases to within 2 °C of pre-industrial levels — and ideally 1.5 °C.

Thirty years after the first COP meeting took place in Berlin, and one decade on from Paris, that road map must be expanded to include a plan to phase out fossil fuels.

This isn’t the first time Trump has gutted the Endangered Species Act, or ESA.
What the new ESA rollbacks will mean The Endangered Species Act was, at its start, a bipartisan piece of legislation, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973.
It could significantly impact our ability to protect species from climate change, curb our ability to fight it, and even fuel it more.
But four out of five Americans support the current remit of the Endangered Species Act.","For more than 50 years, the Endangered Species Act has saved thousands of animals and plants from threats like poaching, habitat loss, and pollution. It brought bald eagles back from the brink of extinction, reestablished grizzly bear populations on public lands, and safeguarded the redwood forests that play host to dozens of vulnerable animals. In total, it has prevented the extinction of 99 percent of the species it has protected.

Last week, President Donald Trump announced that his administration is weakening or eliminating key provisions of the bedrock environmental law that protect vulnerable species from extractive activities like oil drilling.

This isn’t the first time Trump has gutted the Endangered Species Act, or ESA. Back in 2019, his administration changed the act to make it easier to remove a species from the list and to allow economic factors to be considered when determining whether to list a new species. Many of those changes were reversed during Joe Biden’s presidency, but may now be overturned once again. The new rollbacks were announced by the National Marine Fisheries Service and the Department of the Interior’s U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The proposed changes would also limit federal agencies’ ability to consider potential future impacts on a species — such as the impacts of climate change — when deciding which species to list. In addition, the so-called blanket rule, which bestows species listed as threatened with the same protections as those listed as endangered, would be canceled. (“Endangered” means a species is in danger of extinction, while “threatened” means it’s likely to become endangered in the foreseeable future.)

“This is certainly of a piece with this administration’s drive to undermine conservation, undermine protection of federal lands and wildlife, and to benefit the extractive industries and stakeholders that certainly have this administration’s ear,” said Jane P. Davenport, a senior attorney at Defenders of Wildlife, an environmental nonprofit.

The ESA proposal came within days of two other major environmental rollbacks: The Environmental Protection Agency announced plans to remove federal protections from millions of acres of wetlands and streams, scaling back the Clean Water Act and threatening drinking water for millions of Americans. The administration also said it would open nearly 1.3 billion acres of U.S. coastal waters to new oil and gas drilling.

What the new ESA rollbacks will mean

The Endangered Species Act was, at its start, a bipartisan piece of legislation, signed by President Richard Nixon in 1973. At the time, many states had their own legislation in place, but those laws tended to be weak, Noah Greenwald, of the Center for Biological Diversity, said. Rules constrained by state borders didn’t reflect the natural spread or movement of species or the threats that impacted them, and they didn’t provide protections for habitats. The ESA addressed both of those concerns.

In 1982, Congress passed a set of amendments to the law that made it easier for non-federal land managers to develop endangered species’ habitat — even, in some cases, when those species might be “incidentally harmed.” Developers, loggers, and mining and drilling corporations have long pushed to create more workarounds, but have often been stymied by the idea of “critical habitat” — land that is protected by virtue of how necessary it is to a specific species.

The northern spotted owl, for instance, needs the complex forests of the Pacific Northwest in order to thrive. The rusty patch bumblebee needs places to nest underground in the Midwest and Northeast. “It’s not just enough to protect a species,” said Rebecca Riley, a managing director at the Natural Resources Defense Council. “You also have to protect its habitat.”

What species to protect and how, as well as when to delist them, had previously been decided using only “the best scientific and commercial data available.” The Trump administration’s new policies will allow economic factors to now be part of the species listing process and habitat designation.

The climate implications of the proposed changes

The dismantling of the ESA would have ramifications for decades to come. It could significantly impact our ability to protect species from climate change, curb our ability to fight it, and even fuel it more. Forests being protected under the act soak up heaps of carbon dioxide in their tissues and transfer much of that carbon to fungi for storage in the soil. Wetlands, too, not only provide a safe place for species, but trap loads of carbon and, if they’re on the coast, act as buffers for hurricane storm surges and rising sea levels. Losing any of these habitats would mean a harder fight against planetary warming. Weakening the ESA will also open doors to more oil and gas drilling — adding more greenhouse gases to the atmosphere. “It has double the effect,” Riley said. “You’re hurting the species and the ecosystem, and you’re harming the climate.”

When President Donald Trump attempted to weaken the Endangered Species Act during his first administration, he was up against stiff opposition: Environmental and climate groups sued the president, and Biden undid many of Trump’s changes in the first months of his presidency.

But 2025 is not 2019. In his second term, President Trump has pushed even harder to support expanded fossil fuel development, and critical minerals extraction is opening new avenues for mining, including on protected lands. The under-construction Rhyolite Ridge lithium mine in Thacker Pass, Nevada, for example, is to be built on the habitat of two organisms — Tiehm’s Buckwheat, a wildflower, and a rare snail called the Kings River pyrg, each of which is endemic to the area. (The wildflower is listed as endangered, the snail is not.) Environmental groups and tribes sued the Bureau of Land Management in an attempt to protect the Tiehm’s Buckwheat; those lawsuits cite the Endangered Species Act to provide legal backing.

“This administration is restoring the Endangered Species Act to its original intent, protecting species through clear, consistent, and lawful standards that also respect the livelihoods of Americans who depend on our land and resources,” said Secretary of the Interior Doug Burgum in a statement.

But four out of five Americans support the current remit of the Endangered Species Act. “I think Americans understand that extinction is forever,” Riley said, “and they understand that we have a moral obligation to try to prevent species from going extinct.”",https://grist.org/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/GettyImages-2215762083s.jpeg?quality=75&strip=all,N,,2025-11-25 13:01:21.895765

The silver lining in the loss of the federal tax credits could be increased scrutiny of such costs as the solar industry struggles to maintain momentum.
Dealer fees Dealer fees, sometimes called program fees, lending fees, finance fees, platform fees or original issue discounts, have for years been the dirty secret of the solar lending industry.
“We’re bringing the borrower, we’re underwriting the application, we’re signing the loan, we’re servicing the loan,” he said.
Paulen thinks that saving customers money by cutting out dealer fees could save the solar industry.","The holiday season could be a busy one for contractors and other installers of solar panels, battery storage and heat pumps.

Home and business owners are racing a December 31 deadline to complete such projects in order to be eligible for generous federal tax credits.

“We’ve actually had to recently hire on a new crew just to take the influx and demand,” Christian DeLuca of OHM Solar Solutions in Chico, Calif., told a local television station.

Many of the incentives for renewable energy and home upgrades were phased out under the Republicans’ “One Big Beautiful Bill” legislation that President Trump signed in July. Sorry, the deadlines for electric vehicle tax credits have already passed.

Clean energy advocates are not throwing in the towel.

“We could cry. Or we could electrify,” the nonprofit Rewiring America says on its website, which includes a handy list of the expiring subsidies, as well as a tool to calculate potential savings.

The falling cost of photovoltaic panels, for example, can make residential solar systems a financial win for homeowners even without the federal subsidies (many states continue to offer their own incentives). In the US, the median installation cost per watt of residential solar panels, before incentives, fell from $3.80 per watt in 2014 to $2.53 last year, according to EnergySage.

And the “soft” costs for solar systems could be cut further through streamlined permitting processes and direct-to-consumer loan products that eliminate the “dealer fees” that were often hidden in residential solar loan agreements. The silver lining in the loss of the federal tax credits could be increased scrutiny of such costs as the solar industry struggles to maintain momentum.

“The downside of the investment tax credit is there’s been extra fat available, and so that’s how these dealer fees have been able to survive so long, in such magnitudes,” said Bill Paulen, CEO of Seattle-based LoanTERRA, which launched last month to help credit unions and other lenders originate renewable energy loans, without dealer fees. “You’ve got that 30% tax credit that’s essentially eaten up by a dealer fee that can be 20%, 30% or more.”

“it’s hitting the taxpayer, and it’s hitting the borrowers and the consumers,” Paulen told ImpactAlpha.

Dealer fees

Dealer fees, sometimes called program fees, lending fees, finance fees, platform fees or original issue discounts, have for years been the dirty secret of the solar lending industry. Solar installers often have agreements with fintech lenders to offer point-of-sale financing to customers that want to avoid high upfront costs for solar systems and other upgrades.

The fees generally get added to the cash price of the system and rolled into the principal of the loan. That can make deceptive a seemingly low interest rate because the principal amount has been inflated by the hidden fee.

The Consumer Financial Protection Board, before it was itself gutted under the Trump administration, spotlighted harms to consumers from the fees. “Some lenders include substantial markups and fees that can increase the loan principal by 30% or more above the cash price,” the CFPB found. A $30,000 system with a $9,000 dealer fee, for example, would require a $39,000 loan.

Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison last year filed suit against four solar-lending companies for deceptive trade and lending practices and illegally high rates of interest. The lenders pocketed the fees, canceling out incentives for solar-panel purchases, Ellison said. “The lenders I sued today seriously misled consumers by promising cheap credit for solar installation, only to charge huge upfront fees that consumers didn’t know about.”

One of the companies, Solar Mosaic, filed for bankruptcy in June. Another of the companies, GoodLeap, told NPR that the fees are common in other areas, such as auto financing, and that the company complies with the Truth in Lending Act.

“It’s been a little lonely, being the voice standing on the mountain saying, ‘We’ve got this big problem in the industry of the dealer fees,’ and trying to get others to pay attention,” said LoanTERRA’s Paulen.

Customer demand

Paulen spent a decade developing solar loan products for credit unions, first as CEO of Generations Credit Union and then at Community 1st Credit Union. LoanTERRA is a platform to let any credit union, or other community lenders, make their own direct-to-consumer solar loans, cutting out the fintech middlemen and eliminating the dealer fees.

“This is too big of an opportunity, and there’s too much opportunity to clean up the financing in this industry,” Paulen told ImpactAlpha. LoanTERRA gets a 2% fee, paid by the lender, for bringing them the loan business, a standard practice in the industry.

“We’re bringing the borrower, we’re underwriting the application, we’re signing the loan, we’re servicing the loan,” he said. “We are able to contrast our products favorably to products that are already in the industry.”

That opens a new line of business for credit unions and community banks. Delinquency rates on residential solar loans average less than 1.5%, compared with 22% for credit cards. LoanTERRA’s first group of lenders is going through the due diligence process.

Paulen thinks that saving customers money by cutting out dealer fees could save the solar industry.

“Everyone’s expecting an anvil to fall on their head,” with the loss of the tax credits next year, he said. “If the public believes that solar has become 30% more expensive, it’s going to be harder for sales people to overcome that.”

The winners may be companies that can keep reducing solar prices, even without subsidies.

“No one really knows what’s going to happen in 2026,” Paulen said. “But even as the pie shrinks, we’re going to get a bigger slice of the pie because we’re the solution that makes it easier for people.”",http://impactalpha.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/shutterstock_2359319045.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:01:52.002440

Everyone wants higher performance and more secure domestic supply chains.”

Perovskite-silicon tandem solar technology offers higher conversion efficiencies, meaning more power generation per panel compared with current industry-standard silicon cell technologies. But the material is very unstable and degrades at rates which have prevented any commercial adoption of the technology to date.

For its part, Swift Solar recently secured a contract with the US Department of Defence (recently rebranded the Department of War) to deploy perovskite tandem modules at a cyber warfare exercise in Virginia. This followed US$27 million in funding in June last year to support its technology development; the funding came from Eni Next, the corporate venture capital arm of Eni, Plenitude’s parent company.

Swift said it expects its modules to reach efficiencies of “28% or higher”, compared with the peak efficiencies of around 25% available in commercial modules today. In a public statement, the company said that with the expected surge in electricity demand from US data centres, “this efficiency advantage becomes increasingly valuable, enabling maximum power generation from limited land while reducing installation costs and improving project economics.”

Interest in perovskite tandem products is certainly high, and the technology seems to be getting closer and closer to meaningful commercial use. But challenges still present themselves, most notably the durability and stability issues with perovskite. More established technologies, like tunnel oxide passivated contact (TOPCon), which entered the mainstream of solar manufacturing last year, have made headlines in recent months as technical experts have unearthed issues with longevity and degradation at the cell level.

This creates risks for project returns and energy production which perovskite will have to overcome if it is going to take of at scale.",https://www.pv-tech.org/wp-content/uploads/2023/02/Plenitude_Texas.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:04:31.584121

First Solar has been producing solar technology in the United States since 2002 and remains the country’s leading photovoltaic manufacturer.","First Solar, Inc. has officially opened its new fully vertically integrated solar manufacturing facility in Iberia Parish, Louisiana. The company invested $1.1 billion in this project, which covers around 2.4 million square feet, making it nearly eleven times larger than the New Orleans Superdome. The factory currently employs more than 700 workers, and this number is expected to reach 826 by the end of the year. Once the facility reaches full production capacity, it will add 3.5 gigawatts of annual manufacturing output. With this addition, First Solar’s total U.S. manufacturing capacity is projected to reach 14 gigawatts in 2026 and expand to 17.7 gigawatts in 2027, once its newly announced South Carolina plant is fully operational.

The Iberia Parish facility began manufacturing solar modules in July 2025, several months earlier than planned. This faster schedule was made possible by strong policy support, including the One Big Beautiful Bill Act and the Trump administration’s trade measures, which boosted demand for solar technology made entirely in the United States and compliant with expected Foreign Entities of Concern (FEOC) guidelines. The facility is independent of Chinese crystalline silicon supply chains and uses American-produced materials such as glass from Illinois and Ohio, as well as steel from Mississippi that is fabricated into module backrails in Louisiana. It manufactures First Solar’s Series 7 modules.

Louisiana Governor Jeff Landry said that First Solar’s investment is already creating significant benefits for Iberia Parish by generating hundreds of well-paying jobs and increasing economic opportunities. He added that projects like this strengthen the state’s workforce and support the national goal of achieving American energy dominance. According to an economic impact analysis by the University of Louisiana at Lafayette, commissioned by the Iberia Economic Development Authority, the new facility is expected to increase Iberia Parish’s GDP by 4.4 percent in its first full year of operation. Jobs at the plant offer an average total compensation of $90,000 per year, which is more than three times the current per capita income in the parish.

First Solar’s CEO Mark Widmar stated that the new plant reflects the company’s commitment to supporting American energy leadership, economic growth, and affordable electricity. He emphasized that manufacturing solar technology in the U.S. using American materials and talent demonstrates that large-scale reindustrialization is actively happening, not just being discussed.

The manufacturing facility is equipped with advanced technologies, especially artificial intelligence. AI-enabled systems, including computer vision and deep learning, help detect defects automatically during the production process. Workers use AI-driven tools to make operating decisions and improve efficiency. First Solar’s Chief Manufacturing Officer, Kuntal Kumar Verma, described the Louisiana plant as one of the most advanced solar factories in the world, adding that it shows how AI can enhance productivity and support American workers in reaching higher performance levels.

This new site is part of First Solar’s extensive manufacturing and research presence in the Western Hemisphere, which includes three fully integrated factories in Ohio, another in Alabama, and R&D centers in Ohio and California. Recently, the company also announced a new production line in Gaffney, South Carolina, to bring additional Series 6 module processes back to the United States. By the end of 2026, First Solar expects to employ more than 5,500 people across the U.S. Since 2019, the company will have invested around $4.5 billion in manufacturing and research infrastructure nationwide.

First Solar has been producing solar technology in the United States since 2002 and remains the country’s leading photovoltaic manufacturer.

Toyota Mississippi: The Blue Springs, Miss., plant will receive a $125 million investment to produce hybrid-electric Corollas, marking the first electrified Corollas assembled in the U.S. The plant employs 2,400 workers and represents a $1.3 billion investment, Toyota said.

Toyota Tennessee: The Jackson, Tenn., casting plant will get a $71.4 million investment, adding 33 jobs to increase production of hybrid transaxle cases, housings and engine blocks. The investment includes three new production lines, increasing capacity by nearly 500,000 units annually. Production is expected to start in 2027 and 2028. The plant represents a $497 million investment.

Toyota Missouri: The Troy, Mo. casting plant will receive $57.1 million to add 57 jobs and a new cylinder head production line for hybrid vehicles. Toyota said the new line will increase plant capacity by more than 200,000 cylinder heads annually, starting production in 2027. The total investment in the plant is $629 million.

U.S. Manufacturing

This investment supports Toyota’s goal to invest up to $10 billion over five years in U.S. manufacturing, it said. Currently, Toyota assembles about half of the vehicles it sells in the U.S. North American facilities assemble more than three-quarters of the vehicles sold in the U.S.

Toyota’s multi-pathway powertrain approach is driving steady growth in electrified vehicles, it said. That includes hybrids, plug-ins, and all-electric models, which now account for nearly 50% of the company’s U.S. sales.

“We’re proud of our plant’s continued growth and honored to help lead Toyota’s transition into a mobility company,” said Alivia Luikart, team member, Toyota West Virginia. “Our future is bright. It’s rewarding to know that our company has faith in our ability and trusts our team to drive Toyota forward.”

Toyota said it is preparing the workforce of the future through initiatives like the $110 million Driving Possibilities program. This initiative aims to close educational gaps through hands-on STEM learning while addressing essential needs of students and families.",https://s37629.pcdn.co/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/Toyota-Hybrid-Investment-2025.jpg,N,,2025-11-25 11:04:14.010813

Transcript

Sara Ivry: Hi everybody, I’m Sara Ivry, features editor at JSTOR Daily. About five years ago in Charleston, South Carolina, authorities announced plans to remove a public statue of John Calhoun. He was the seventh vice president of the United States and a defender of slavery. The news ignited passionate debates about public monuments and their role in society. Should public sculptures that cause offense be removed, or should they be left intact, so we’re reminded of our history even when that history is profoundly ugly?

These questions are part of a larger project that we’re undertaking at JSTOR Daily about public space and how it’s used. Our project includes this podcast series, which brings me to today’s guests. Jo and Joy Banner are twin sisters from Louisiana and the founders of The Descendants Project, which is anchored at Woodland Plantation about thirty miles from New Orleans on the banks of the Mississippi. You’ll hear more about that in a moment.

First, I want to welcome Jo and Joy to our podcast. Hello, and thanks for being here.

Jo Banner: Thank you for having us.

Joy Banner: Thank you.

I wonder, Joy, if you can start off by telling us a little bit about The Descendants Project. What are its origins?

Joy: Yeah, so The Descendants Project is a non-profit organization that my sister and I started about five years ago—can’t believe it’s already been five years. And we started The Descendants Project with the interest of protecting our Black descendant community, because we are in probably the most industrialized stretch of the Mississippi River, and our communities are getting wiped out by heavy industrial development. And so we wanted to protect our community. And Jo and I’s background is in tourism. And so, we are in a very heavily touristed spot as well. And most of the tourism is because of the plantations that we have around.

You won’t be surprised to hear that most of those plantations are one, not addressing the narrative of enslaved people, and, our tourist commissions and tourism bodies are not involving and including Black descendant communities and local community in the tourism economy, which we think is, you know, a good shift away from heavy industry, a much greener alternative economy and is one that actually centers the preservation of historic communities like ours. So, The Descendants Project, we sit sort of in this intersection of historic and community preservation along with environmental justice.

Ivry: And to be clear, descendants are descendants of the enslaved people who worked the plantations, is that correct?

Joy: Yes. So, along the Mississippi River between Baton Rouge and New Orleans there were hundreds of plantations, and so communities like ours, who—it is not unique, me and Jo are tenth-generation Louisianians—and so, literally, we are we are still living in the spaces and places where plantations once existed, right? And so we are descended of people that were enslaved at the plantations that are as near as, you know, a couple hundred feet, in fact, from us.

Ivry: I want to talk more about The Descendants Project, but first I want to know a little bit more about the plantation itself, Woodland Plantation. Jo, maybe you can tell us a little bit about the history of this particular plantation and also its connection to you, if you grew up visiting it, what that was like for you, and so forth.

Jo: Woodland Plantation is located in Laplace, Louisiana, which is approximately twenty-five miles away from where we live. It was started around the 1700s, and [in] 1811 there was the German Coast uprising that occurred on a plantation site. So, this German Coast uprising was led by Charles Deslondes. Charles Deslondes went through numerous plantations along the river, throughout the river parishes of Louisiana, which is now known as Cancer Alley. He organized a revolt with about 500 people that participated in it. The intent was for the revolutionaries to gain their freedom, to march into New Orleans, whether it would either try to sell back to their homes, or they would capture the city and set it up as a free society. So, the culmination of that event happened on Woodland Plantation. And it’s believed to be one of the largest, or the largest, slave revolt that happened in this country. Despite that fact, however, many people are unaware of it, including the descendants who still live around the plantation home.

Ivry: I wonder if you can tell me what was your thinking in buying it, and what are your hopes for it? How does it fit into the larger puzzle of The Descendants Project?

Joy: So, the headquarters of The Descendants Project is actually not at Woodland, it’s in Wallace, at a separate plantation. And our community was being threatened by a massive industrial grain facility that would have wiped out our community. And in some type of mitigation to offset the damage that they would have done to not only us, but to Whitney Plantation, which is a slavery museum, they partnered with Woodland for $25,000. It had been operated as a museum for a couple of years, but it was not doing very well.

And so that was really the impetus of us understanding that when it comes to these plantation houses, it’s not strange for industry to come in and—they have to purchase them because they want the land—and then you have the big house that’s there, and then there’s some type of, again, like mitigation, public relations that happens where it’s like, “Look, we’re restoring a plantation.” You know, “We’re restoring this historic site.”

And so that was the company’s intention, was to really downplay the impact it would have on us by partnering with this plantation museum at the time. And that partnership did not work out, but it certainly signaled to Jo and I that if we did not step in to be the stewards of Woodland, that it was going to be used by industry to turn, like literally turn Black communities against each other, so that’s when we made the decision that we were going to seriously consider buying Woodland, and here we are.

Ivry: You mentioned Cancer Alley. Can you explain for listeners who may not have ever heard that phrase, what that refers to?

Jo: Cancer Alley is stretched between New Orleans and Baton Rouge that is heavy industry. It’s also been called Industrial Corridor because there are numerous plants, hundreds of plants, throughout the area. They’re all involved with pollution in one way… We have plastic pollution. We have oil and gas, we have grain, there is sugar refining, there’s aluminum, there’s steel. And because of our exposure to pollution, the residents in our area are at a higher risk of cancer. So, we have one of the highest risk of cancers in the country, we’re the 95th to 99th percentile, depending on where you’re located within Cancer Alley. So our community, St. John the Baptist Parish, is actually, like, we are in the exact middle of that stretch of, between New Orleans and Baton Rouge. We have been on the United Nations. Oh, there’s been at least a couple of reports from United Nations, the situation that’s happening here in our community. So, it’s really like an international human rights crisis that’s happening right here in the United States.

Ivry: Of course, environmental degradation and pollution doesn’t observe any boundary, property lines or boundaries. It goes everywhere. It infiltrates all public space. I wonder how do you see the boundary between public and private, both in that case and in a more global sense?

Joy: So, I would like to correct that, because actually the science has proven for us that because of where these plants are sited—and they are sited around a predominantly Black community—that there is more polluted air based on race, right? And there are more health impacts, but you are right that in terms of the way that air works, these facilities and industries are not going to stop with our communities. And in Cancer Alley, just because we’re impacted more based on your community doesn’t mean that we don’t have white people that are getting cancer as a result of pollution. So yes, it’s an issue of private and public, but I think it’s more of an issue of the haves and the have nots. Right? Because even if people that are getting sick from the various diseases are going to have more access to the medical care that can alleviate their symptoms, that can still extend, you know, their life, can give them a better quality of life. And, like the way that the system is getting, as things get more and more expensive, and as there’s less and less restrictions on the permitting, I think that that space of, that cone of who’s getting impacted, is going to get larger and larger and larger. And I just hope that we can all, like, realize beforehand that they’re coming after the people that are most vulnerable.

Jo: Well, to your point, just recently, in the parish that’s neighboring us, St. Charles Parish, has been a public-private partnership between Shell and the community to create this whole park. So, this park is literally on the fence line of one of their refineries. It’s like a half-a-million-dollar investment has been put into this plant, and, “Wow, look how great it is, it’s new and shiny!” except literally the fence right there is just pollution billowing out of it. And there’s a constant hissing noise around it. So, all of this is happening as if there’s something we should be rejoicing about these public spaces. Like, do you realize how absolutely dangerous it is now? But yeah, it’s the shutting down of the senses, literally, to say, “Oh, wow, and let’s cut the ribbon at this public-private partnership!” The fact that we’re not noticing, or we ignore the danger, or many people are ignoring the danger. Some people just, they see it, but what can you do to stop it?

Joy: Well, and then the economic part of it, right? Like, how much money, and we say this as people who—our parents worked at Shell and Union Carbide, so we are children of industry. We are an industrial family. But that Shell emblem was everywhere. I mean, everywhere in our household, and Union Carbide, everywhere. But, like, Shell is getting how many hundreds of millions of dollars of tax incentives, right? And so now, that money that would have been used for infrastructure, that would have been used to build a park, Shell got excused from it. And then now, because they’re giving you a little bit money back of your own money, right? And now it’s like, “Let’s celebrate Shell for doing the good thing,” but it’s, like, but that’s way less than the money that you owe anyhow to actually address the harm. That’s the reason why you’re being taxed the way that you’re being taxed is to address the use and address the harm that you’re putting on a community, and, like, you get off with just building a park and then putting your logo on top of it.

Ivry: I wanted to ask you both, are you historians by training? What is your professional background? You mentioned being in tourism, but you’re definitely well versed in the environmental and history parts of this. So, tell me a little bit about your backgrounds.

Joy: Well, as I like to say, I’m a recovering business professor, business and marketing professor. My PhD is in communication studies—and I will say that that training in communication, especially now for this fight, is an excellent tool to have. I have never used it and appreciated it as much as I appreciated it now. And I think in terms of our background, we’re from an old community, and we had the benefit and pleasure of growing up around our elders, who were fantastic storytellers and who told about life on the river. And so it ended up making us enchanted by the history. And so I think we are just unrequited historians, but really being in a place where the focus was so much on industry and business, never saw a place for us career-wise in history, anthropology, and archaeology. And so the good part is now we’re getting to live all of that, you know, through The Descendants Project.

Jo: I would just say that, Joy expressed the humanities side of it, if you want to call it that, but also living in an environment where we have had our community almost taken away from us twice, from plastic production with PVC from Formosa to Greenfield Louisiana with grain, having that experience. Also being exposed to chemical leaks and going through explosions along the river or seeing our community treated differently because we were a Black descendant community versus a white community who’s pushing back against industry. That was a great teacher as well. So, we live in this intersection, we live in the middle of it all, and there’s no way we can shut out one without embracing or talking about the other.

So, like that plantation-to-pollution pipeline, we live right in the middle of it all. And because we are descendants, and we say we descend from the enslaved, but we descend from the river, and we descend from everything that happened along that river. All of that is in our blood. And that is also how I think it helps us and what we do in educating others and just also showing, “This is what it looks like in real life. This is what it looks like in the flesh and blood.” It’s not just, you know, a chapter in the history book, it is part of our lives, and it’s real.

Ivry: I can imagine you know, buying a place like Woodland and wanting to destroy it, you know, just as people wanted to take down the statue of Calhoun or something, that it represents something so toxic, why would you want to even leave it standing?

Joy: Well, I think for Jo and I, well, we understand, first of all, slavery is not something that just happened on plantations. Jo and I, we have worked as staff members, as tour guides, as administrators, you know, in all different positions, as directors at plantations. And people think that slavery happened here on this site, and just specifically. So, first of all, plantations, like, yes, is it ground zero? I call it ground zero. But the northern economy was also, you know, like, we forget that the north was like the first places where slavery is happening. You know, there are many people that are benefiting from slavery. You know, there are many buildings that have [been] built by the enslaved. So I don’t think that there’s any spot in the United States that hasn’t been touched by slavery and/or acts of racist violence against Black people. So that’s certainly one aspect of it.

Jo: What I think, too, is what I’ve noticed, is that what most people are angry about is not the fact that the plantations exist, because that is part of our history. You can knock down the building, but that wouldn’t change the fact that our ancestors were enslaved and that we’re still dealing with the ramifications of enslavement that are around us. What most people respond to I think negatively is the way the history is treated—or the erasure of that history. So, if we are going on a plantation, and it’s a Hollywood version of plantation life, that is the infuriating and frustrating part. So I mean, just from owning it, this was something, owning plantations—and something that I never expected—was how many people were, actually, Black people rejoiced in the fact that, “Wow, you all own a plantation, now we get to tell our story, now we can’t they can’t ignore it anymore,” because it symbolizes that the plantation is a part of our history, and they feel like we will honor—and we will—honor every part of that and respect it and give it the care that it deserves.

Joy: And I also think too, like, yes, a house is an inanimate object, but it’s made of organic material, and I believe that in our liberation, like, we’re liberating the house itself. You know, like that house, that wood never said it wanted to be used for the enslavement of people. Like those crops never said that they wanted to be used, you know, to cause such brutality and labor. And so I do feel like when we liberate ourselves, and it does feel like I’m releasing, you know, that house from that kind of violence. And then also to be used as an important resource, you know, I think it’s important education-wise and also as a center of healing. So, there’s so many uses that it can still be used for that I think we as a Black community still need, you know, for our healing.

Ivry: I wanted to ask you, Jo, you mentioned, like, the Hollywood version of plantation life, what do you mean by that? Can you explain a little bit more?

Jo: Yeah, I’m thinking of movies that glamorize plantations and the Civil War such as Gone with the Wind and, we will even see renditions of that in modern day, right? I’m surprised, I look back and Louisiana tourism had a commercial, and it featured the plantation on this tourism commercial, and it’s very, like, the person who was there was eating pecan pie, and it was like “Come visit sweet Louisiana!” So, it’s those images that are totally made up it shows this glamorous lifestyle of the plantation owner, of the sugar baron, and we see that often a lot because these plantations are our royalty. This is what royalty looks like in the United States or in North America. We still see it. I’m still surprised at how often I see that imagery. And that’s what is infuriating when someone can talk about, “Come and have a mint julep, and come dine here and imagine yourself in the footsteps of these people” without understanding that: But what was that built on? What about those who were enslaved? And also, even the lifestyle of a sugar baron wasn’t necessarily easy either. It was hard life, it could be very dirty life. But that part has been totally sanitized, has been totally erased in many instances, and that’s what people, I think, that’s what they respond to as a fact that this is totally not an accurate depiction of what plantations would have been and are.

Ivry: Where I live in New York City, you often see efforts, you know, to make spaces public, to take it away from private hands in order to make it accessible for everybody, or you have a private corporation that comes in and makes something accessible to everybody. In your case, it’s kind of like you flipped the script, and you’ve taken something into your own hands to make it more accessible to a population that wasn’t being served by the former owners of the site. I wonder if you can talk a little bit about that, about sort of, like, privatizing in order to publicize in a way.

Joy: Yeah, I think that’s, it’s a good point of showing how government can be so difficult for communities like ours that have been deemed sacrificial from the start. It touches back to being, our ancestors being sacrificed, coming from Africa, being put on these plantations, even when they were buried, there wasn’t really much concern. So, it’s just this lineage of not caring, of ignoring, of sacrificing our communities. So you have a government that’s very much doing what it’s been doing for, you know, all of these centuries, which has not been for our protection. So the only way that we can truly protect ourselves, until we can get a government that will truly honor the independence that it brags about every year and celebrates, we are the ones who have to take our own health into our hands, and our own happiness into our hands. So that is what liberation looks [like] for us: is being able to own that land and then find some way to then give it back to the public, until we can have a system that finally cares about us and [is] concerned about our survival and our existence.

Ivry: I think one of the really interesting things about this conversation is that it highlights that there are different publics and different communities. I mean, when we say public space, that’s so amorphous, and then when we start to sort of drill down, we’re like, oh, there’s different populations that are served. And it makes you really wonder what would be a completely public space in which everybody was equally represented and felt equally welcome. I don’t know what that would be, where that would be, and how it would look.

Jo: I think for, like your point about the statues, if you put a statue of Robert E. Lee in a park, or you name it after Robert E. Lee, and you say this for the public, how would your Black person… Is that space really for you? You’re saying, you’re signifying, this is not your space. Or yes, it’s your space, if you bow down to white supremacy, then yes is your space. So I think, right, just because we say public, what do we mean by public naming and placemaking is also a big part of that public space.

Joy: Yeah. And I think that the argument that, you know, like I’m hearing, like, “Oh, we can, why don’t we keep the statues up and just talk about the context of what it was in. Let’s talk about the racism!”

Really? We’re seeing that right now, right, where the intent of a statue is that it represents a value or an ideal that we as a public want to honor and uplift. That says, “Here is who we should be emulating!” Right? And then for us to take these quote unquote heroes to some and say, we’re going to leave it up there, but we’re going to talk about the fact that he owned 300 slaves. We’re going to talk about the fact that he raped women. You know, we’re going to talk about the fact that he sold children, and the organization that’s behind putting up, you know, this statue in the 1920s, like way after the Civil War, was actually a racist women’s group, you know, from the South. So, really, are you telling me that people are going to be okay with putting all that context in with the statues? Probably not.

Jo: And even if you did, if I’m just going to a park, do I really want to hear all of that? I just want to go to a picnic with my family. Really, do I need to know all about, okay, Robert E. Lee. No.

Joy: The trauma.

Jo: Right, the trauma. And okay, go and enjoy your hamburger, you know. And so, it’s just, like, come on, right?

Joy: That’s a really good point.

Jo: Oh gosh, yes.

Ivry: You know, as I understand it, you want Woodland ultimately to be a site of education. And I wonder what do you imagine that looks like? And then also for whom?

Joy: So, when we say that Woodland is a site of education, there is still a descendant community specific to Woodland that is still near it, it’s called Woodland Quarters. And so first of all, as an organization called The Descendants Project, our first responsibility is to the descendant community. And so what we would hope is that for them and the larger, you know, Black community, and the larger community in general, to think of that space as a place of education but also heritage, and arts, and a resource that assists, you know, their pursuit of quality of life, right? Something that adds something to their population and that’s in service of them.

But in terms of the education… Parts of it, we want to deal with slavery in a way that… We have a lot of organizations that are doing a great job, I named one, Whitney Plantation. But it’s like, how can we build on this education about slavery that’s also not being taught.

Right now, we have a temporary executive director who has a background in, like, the impact of trauma to the body, right? So as we are setting up Woodland as this interpretive space, like, we are looking at what has been the impact of trauma on Black bodies, not only because of racism and because of issues, but like literally when they are walking through a space, like Jo just mentioned, like sure we can add all of this context to a statue, but then as a Black person, does that make it better that I have to see Robert E. Lee and all of the pain that he caused, you know, while I’m trying to have peace and relaxation, you know, with my family? So, we want to address all of those issues.

Jo: And I’ll also add to, like, for education, much of it is about building, but also, it’s about deconstructing and allowing expression. Because what we don’t want is for, especially Black people, to walk into that space and feel that they can’t express themselves because they’re so used to how the tour has been constructed through, like, other sites that they may have visited.

We will find that, as our programming is touching more to like Black community, we may find a need, for example, where we may sing and we may dance, and it may be on a porch of a plantation, but you know what, it fits in because of this is something that we as Black people do. So, like, we’re seeing like all these different threads and through lines and all this engagement now that honestly I hadn’t even thought about it until it happens. And we’re, like, okay right now there is, we have a DJ that’s playing on a porch for a Black commemoration event, and he’s playing music that you hear at a Black family reunion. The Black people are going to dance, are going to want to feel that need to dance. So, how’s it all coming together? I think ultimately what it means, like this is what liberation feels like, and this is what happens when Black people can freely express themselves on sites like Woodland.

Ivry: Given all the obstacles that this project faces, given the environmental degradation of the area, how do you yourselves keep going every day? I mean, it’s got to be very emotionally taxing.

Joy: You know, I would say that there is a movement called “Living with the Trouble.” You know, like, even when you are in places of devastation, in some respects, it doesn’t mean that you aren’t in places of absolute beauty. Like, I’m looking at my window right now, and it’s green, and there’s a bird sitting out on my ledge. My parents are right next door. I’m able to work in an organization that Jo and I created literally from the dreams that we had, from our passions. I get to work with my twin sister. And so, it’s like, along these obstacles, it’s not like good stuff isn’t happening, right? And, you know, and I think that there is an art form, and there is a satisfaction that comes with tackling problems. And like, we’re winning some, too; like, we’re winning a lot. And so I think that this idea of, like, because things aren’t absolutely perfect that we give it all up and stuff… That’s not life. That’s not anybody’s reality. Every aspect has its challenges. And so I feel especially grateful and blessed to be anointed and chosen to do this kind of work.

Jo: Yeah, I’ll just add that we don’t have the luxury of giving up. We don’t have the luxury of saying, “How do I keep going?” You just keep going. And so that’s what we do, and I think, like Joy said, there is a lot of beauty around us. This area is… it’s breathtaking. In the bad ways, but also in the good ways, too. It’s life giving, and it’s the roots. I can’t walk out of my door without tripping on a root. So, literally of my roots, and that makes me so connected to the land and understanding the spirituality and the energy that’s here.

And that’s what keeps me going. And you know, it’s fun pissing off billionaires. I have to say, that gives me a lot of joy in the world. When they think they can take you out, right, and they can tell you what to do. And you can push back just on your stubbornness, and you win? Right? That is very life-giving, too.

Joy: We’ve had some fun. We’ve had some fun.

Jo: Like we mean, when we say we are going to fight morning, noon, and night? I mean, we have fought morning, noon, and night. We don’t stop fighting. And so, and that’s what gives us our advantage, is because we have something that we truly love and we’re passionate for.

You know, our, the symbol of our, of The Descendants Project is a Fawohodie, an adinkra symbol, meaning, it’s a symbol of emancipation. But what it really means is: emancipation comes with its responsibilities. And, like, we understand the work that is involved in being stewards of this land, and we’ve, not only did we sign up for it, we created an organization to do just that. And so we just have to, like, again, this is our purpose in life. And we are extremely happy to do the work.

the only thing that I wanted to add, as you talked about, again, at the public and private space, that now we are seeing our public spaces attacked for the stories that they’re telling and the truth that they are telling. And it is going to be the responsibility of private organizations, like The Descendants Project and other private museums, that is going to have to step up. We’ve been doing that work, but I think there’s going to be an even larger responsibility, you know, those of us that are not getting as much funding from the federal government, which we are not, thankfully. It will be up to us to carry that mission. So donating and funding organizations like ours is going to be, you know, extremely important.

Ivry: Jo and Joy Banner, thank you so much for joining us.

Basic EB-2 NIW Requirements for Wind Energy Engineers

Before diving into strategy, understand foundational EB-2 NIW requirements for wind energy engineers.To qualify as engineer for EB-2 NIW, must satisfy two categories of requirements: Advanced Degree like master's degree or higher in engineering field or foreign equivalent, and Exceptional Ability demonstrated by degree of expertise significantly above norm Kameli Law.

For most wind energy engineers, the advanced degree path works smoothly. You need a master's or higher in mechanical engineering, electrical engineering, aerospace engineering, or related fields with wind energy focus. Bachelor's degree plus five years progressive experience in wind energy also qualifies.Provide evidence of a US degree above bachelor's or foreign equivalent degree, or evidence of US bachelor's degree or foreign equivalent followed by 5 years progressive experience in specialty USCIS. Wind energy system design, turbine engineering, or renewable energy integration all qualify as specialty areas.Foreign degrees work fine as long as they're equivalent to US advanced degrees. Get credential evaluation if needed to establish equivalence clearly for immigration purposes.

The exceptional ability route requires meeting at least three criteria. Official academic records showing exceptional performance. Professional engineering license. Evidence of ten years full-time experience in wind energy. Salary demonstrating exceptional ability compared to peers. Membership in professional associations like American Wind Energy Association. Recognition for achievements through industry awards or patents.Most wind energy engineers qualify through advanced degrees combined with technical achievements rather than exceptional ability alone.

The Three Prong Dhanasar Test for Wind Engineers

Every EB-2 NIW for engineers must prove three specific prongs from Matter of Dhanasar.

Prong One: Substantial Merit and National Importance

Your proposed endeavor must have intrinsic value and broad national impact, which for engineers could mean working on national infrastructure, advancing technology supporting national security, contributing to clean energy innovation, or delivering automation solutions boosting economy Kameli Law.Offshore wind development demonstrates clear national importance. Build policy-ready narrative aligning work with US priorities like CHIPS Act or National AI Strategy Amir Ismail And Associates. Federal offshore wind targets of 30 gigawatts by 2030 validate priority status.

Turbine efficiency improvements serve energy goals. Work increasing capacity factors, reducing costs per megawatt-hour, or extending operational lifespans advances renewable energy competitiveness. Every percentage point of efficiency gain multiplies across thousands of turbines.Grid integration solutions address critical infrastructure needs. Wind energy variability creates grid management challenges. Work on energy storage integration, forecasting systems, or grid stability solutions serves documented reliability concerns.

Manufacturing and supply chain innovation shows importance. Domestic turbine component production, blade manufacturing efficiency, or tower fabrication advances support jobs and economic competitiveness while reducing foreign dependency.Floating offshore wind technology demonstrates strategic value. Deep water sites hold tremendous potential. Engineering solutions for floating platforms, mooring systems, or installation methods unlock new capacity.

Prong Two: Well Positioned to Advance the Endeavor

You must prove you specifically can accomplish this wind energy work. Past achievements matter most.Technical publications demonstrate capability. Papers in Wind Energy journal, Renewable Energy, Journal of Wind Engineering, or field-specific publications. Conference presentations at AWEA conferences or international wind energy symposiums.Patents prove innovation. Patents represent particularly strong technical achievements, granted US patent proving invention was novel enough for USPTO approval, contributing intellectually to innovation, and having commercial or technical value worth protecting Beyondborderglobal. Turbine design patents, control system innovations, or grid integration methods strengthen cases.

Project experience matters tremendously. Engineering projects evidence requires documenting scope, technical complexity, your role, innovations introduced, and outcomes achieved Beyondborderglobal. Utility-scale wind farms you designed or commissioned. Offshore projects you contributed to. Turbine systems showing measurable performance improvements.Industry recognition validates expertise. Awards from wind energy associations. Speaking invitations to industry conferences. Peer review for technical journals. Consulting roles for major developers or utilities.

Prong Three: Waiving Labor Certification Benefits US

Must prove skipping the traditional labor certification process is in national interest, meaning work so important that requiring employer sponsorship would delay its national benefit Shoreline Immigration.

For wind energy engineers, several factors support this prong. Your expertise might serve multiple wind developers or utilities simultaneously. Independent consulting spanning multiple projects doesn't fit single-employer models. Specialized knowledge in emerging areas like floating offshore wind may not have established labor market frameworks.Given critical shortage of professionals, waiving requirements allows faster deployment of expertise addressing urgent infrastructure needs Harvey Law Corporation. Documented shortages strengthen waiver arguments significantly.

The funding will support Constellation Energy Generation, LLC in financing the Crane Clean Energy Center, an 835 MW facility located on the Susquehanna River in Londonderry Township, Pennsylvania. This loan marks a major step toward restoring reliable, carbon-free power to the region.

Energy Secretary Wright highlighted further,

“Thanks to President Trump’s bold leadership and the Working Families Tax Cut, the United States is taking unprecedented steps to lower energy costs and bring about the next American nuclear renaissance. Constellation’s restart of a nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania will provide affordable, reliable, and secure energy to Americans across the Mid-Atlantic region. It will also help ensure America has the energy it needs to grow its domestic manufacturing base and win the AI race.”

Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG) is the first company to receive a simultaneous conditional loan commitment and financial close from the DOE Loan Programs Office. Its strong finances and credit rating allowed the process to move quickly. The loan, provided through the Energy Dominance Financing Program, will lower financing costs and attract private investment to restart the plant. In addition, DOE noted the project will help the U.S. stay competitive in the global AI and digital economy, which is driving higher electricity demand.

Crane Clean Energy Center: Returning 835 MW of Carbon-Free Power

The Crane Clean Energy Center is an 835-megawatt nuclear plant on the Susquehanna River. Previously known as Three Mile Island Unit 1, it has a long and historic legacy. In March 1979, Three Mile Island Unit 2 suffered a partial meltdown and has remained in monitored storage ever since. Unit 1, however, continued operating safely for four decades before being shut down in September 2019 due to market conditions rather than safety concerns.

In September 2024, Constellation signed a 20-year power purchase agreement with Microsoft, which allows the tech giant to buy the carbon-free electricity generated by the restarted plant. Following the agreement, Constellation rebranded the facility as the Crane Clean Energy Center. As said before, once operational, the plant will provide 835 MW of nuclear energy.

DOE Loan Accelerates the Restart

Constellation (Nasdaq: CEG) is the first company to receive a simultaneous conditional loan commitment and financial close from the DOE Loan Programs Office. Its strong finances and credit rating allowed the process to move quickly. The loan, provided through the Energy Dominance Financing Program, will lower financing costs and attract private investment to restart the plant. In addition, DOE noted the project will help the U.S. stay competitive in the global AI and digital economy, which is driving higher electricity demand.

DOE stated that the Crane loan aligns with President Trump’s Executive Order on Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base. The project is the first under this administration to receive a simultaneous conditional commitment and financial close.

Because the reactor was never fully decommissioned, restarting it is faster and more cost-effective than building a new plant. The loan will fund equipment inspections, system upgrades, workforce training, and regulatory compliance. Once approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission, the plant will supply enough electricity to power about 800,000 homes across the PJM Interconnection region. It will help lower electricity costs, strengthen grid reliability, and create hundreds of jobs.

Pennsylvania Leads in Clean Energy and AI Power

Senator Dave McCormick praised the DOE loan, saying Pennsylvania is leading the nation in energy independence and AI innovation. He highlighted that the restart will deliver more than 800 MW of carbon-free electricity and create 3,400 direct and indirect jobs.

McCormick also noted Constellation’s ongoing investments across the state, including commitments announced at the Pennsylvania Energy and Innovation Summit. The restart comes amid unprecedented electricity demand from AI, cloud computing, and expanding data centers.

A Goldman Sachs report predicts that AI could increase data-center power demand by 160 percent. AI queries, like those used by tools such as ChatGPT, require nearly ten times more electricity than a standard Google search. Nuclear power is vital to meet this growing demand reliably.

Extending Nuclear Plant Life: Constellation’s Strategy for Reliable Power

Constellation has invested in local communities by committing over $1 million in charitable contributions over five years. In 2025 alone, the company donated $200,000 to support nonprofits, workforce programs, and local initiatives.

Significantly, restarting Crane is part of Constellation’s larger multi-billion-dollar plan to extend the life of America’s nuclear fleet, increase output, and ensure reliable power for decades.

The Crane Clean Energy Center is expected to deliver significant economic benefits to Pennsylvania. An analysis by the Pennsylvania Building and Construction Trades Council projected that the restart would create thousands of direct and indirect jobs. It could add more than $16 billion to the state’s GDP and generate over $3 billion in state and federal tax revenue.

The plant is already more than 80 percent staffed, with over 500 employees, including engineers, mechanics, technicians, and licensed operators. Regulatory reviews and technical inspections remain on schedule.

Joe Dominguez, president and CEO of Constellation, said:

“DOE’s quick action and leadership is another huge step towards bringing hundreds of megawatts of reliable nuclear power onto the grid at this critical moment. Under the Trump administration, the FERC and DOE have made it possible for us to vastly expedite this restart without compromising quality or safety. It’s a great example of how America first energy policies create jobs, growth and opportunities and make the grid more reliable. Utilities and grid operators are moving too slowly and need to make regulatory changes that will allow our nation to unlock its abundant energy potential. Constellation and nuclear energy are helping to lead the way and we are thankful to President Trump and Secretary Wright for putting the ‘energy’ back into DOE.”

Nuclear Power for America’s Clean Energy Future

The surge in AI, electrification, and cloud computing has made nuclear energy more critical than ever. Small modular reactors and advanced technologies are gaining interest from utilities and data-center developers.

The U.S. produces about 30 percent of the world’s nuclear electricity. Ninety-four reactors supply steady, clean power to millions of homes and industries nationwide. According to the World Nuclear Association, U.S. reactors generated 779 terawatt-hours in 2023, accounting for 19 percent of the nation’s total electricity output.

The administration aims to quadruple U.S. nuclear capacity to 400 gigawatts by 2050. The International Energy Agency projects 35 GW of new capacity by 2035 and 200 GW by 2050, nearly triple current levels. Restarting Crane contributes to this goal while providing reliable baseload power, supporting AI and digital growth, and boosting the economy.

Other delivery services Farmers who sell to grocery stores typically have to meet high standards, Woods said.
“And so your local grocery store, believe it or not, is still transporting that from California.","The pollution from food is sneaky. Because the apple sitting on your kitchen counter isn't really causing any harm.

But chances are good that you didn't pick it from a tree in your backyard. It required land and water to grow, machines to harvest and process, packaging to ship, trucks to transport and often refrigerators to store. Much of that process releases planet-warming greenhouse gases into the atmosphere.

That's why the global food system makes up roughly a third of worldwide, human-caused greenhouse gas emissions, according to the EDGAR FOOD pollution database.

Meanwhile, roughly a third of the U.S. food supply is lost or wasted without being eaten, according to the U.S. Department of Agriculture. It might never get harvested, it might spoil in transit or the grocery store might reject it for being the wrong size or color. That's a big reason why some consumers are looking for less-wasteful alternatives ranging from farmers markets to delivery services for produce that didn't meet supermarket size or appearance standards.

“There’s a whole breadth of opportunities to purchase food,” said Julia Van Soelen Kim, food systems adviser with the University of California Cooperative Extension.

And during the week of Thanksgiving, this decision is especially high stakes because lots of grocery shoppers are buying for extra guests, and more food can mean a bigger climate impact.

Here are tips for reducing impact by shopping beyond the grocery store.

The community supported agriculture box

Jane Kolodinsky, professor emerita at the University of Vermont and director of research at Arrowleaf Consulting, has bought her produce directly from a local farmer for 30 years.

It’s called Community Supported Agriculture, or CSA. At the beginning of every harvest season, Kolodinsky pays that farm a fee. Then, once per week, she picks up a box of produce at the farm. Some CSA programs pick the produce, while others let you customize. Some deliver. An online database shows which farms participate in CSA programs.

Since the food is grown nearby, there is less processing and packaging. “There's a smaller carbon footprint for purchasing locally compared to global or national food distribution channels,” said Van Soelen Kim. “When they’re local, they’re traveling less distance, so less gas, less fuel.”

Local farmers are also likely to grow whatever works best for the area's climate and season. “When things are in season, they need less storage time, so less electricity for cold storage,” said Van Soelen Kim, who added that can also mean a smaller food bill.

It’s not pollution-free, because the crops still require land and water, and the food does travel some distance. But CSAs avoid many steps in the modern food supply chain.

That model is challenging for consumers who want to maintain the same shopping list year-round. Shopping in-season requires more flexibility. “I would encourage consumers to think, ’OK, year-round we want some hand fruit that’s firm,'” she said. “So maybe it’s apples, and then it’s pears, and then its gonna move to kiwis, and then is gonna move to pluots.”

And in colder regions, she said there is still local produce. It's just more likely to be dried, frozen or canned.

The farmers market

Kolodinsky said the oldest alternative food system is the farmers market, where vendors gather and sell directly to consumers. Growers also sell at farm stands that aren’t tied to a centralized, scheduled event.

Farmers markets allow consumers more flexibility to pick the produce than a typical CSA. They also offer seasonal produce and less packaging and processing than a grocery store. Many also accept payment associated with government food assistance programs.

Plus, these models cut down on waste because customers are more tolerant of produce that's not a uniform size and shape, said Timothy Woods, a University of Kentucky agribusiness professor.

“It doesn’t matter to me if one cucumber’s a couple inches longer than the other one,” he said. “Less waste means more efficient utilization of all the resources that farmers are putting out to produce that crop in the first place.""

Other delivery services

Farmers who sell to grocery stores typically have to meet high standards, Woods said. For example, there could be onions that never got big enough or the carrot that grew two roots — vegetables that are just as safe and tasty to eat. There's also surplus harvest.

“They will intentionally not pick certain melons that are undersized out in the field. And so you’ll have gleaning programs that will be people that are saying, ‘Those are perfectly good cantaloupe that are out there. We’ll send a team out there to pick those,’” said Woods.

He said services delivering food that doesn’t meet supermarket size or appearance requirements, such as Misfit Markets or Imperfect Produce, have become more popular in recent years.

Van Soelen Kim said there isn't a lot of data yet on whether these services have a significantly lower climate impact. They reduce food waste, but the food might come from far away.

Misfits Market refreshes its online selection weekly. Customers then fill a box of often discounted groceries that might have misprinted labels or are undersized or blemished. They are delivered via a company truck or third-party courier such as FedEx. The company's founder and CEO, Abhi Ramesh, said it minimizes emissions by having set delivery days instead of offering on-demand delivery.

“By doing that, we batch all of our deliveries together. So it is one van to your ZIP code on that day. One truck that goes from our warehouse on that date,” he said.

Ramesh said sometimes a farmer's market or CSA is even better at offering nearby seasonal food than his company. But for a lot of the country, those services go away when the harvest season ends. “And so your local grocery store, believe it or not, is still transporting that from California. But the difference is we’re able to go and transport the food waste piece, which reduces a ton of emissions.”

Woods' advice for using services like Misfits Market is the same as other channels: Eat seasonally, eat locally and look for minimal packaging.

After nearly a year since the environmental disaster caused by Enterprise Products, LLC from a failure of its pipeline, the Southern Ute Indian Tribe extends its appreciation to the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) for its increased authority over the remediation and waste management at the site.

The pipeline failure occurred in December 2024 has resulted in Colorado’s largest spill of its kind — an estimated 97,000 gallons of refined gasoline.

The EPA announced last week that it will fulfill its statutory responsibility and federal trust responsibilities and work with CDPHE to implement the State’s Corrective Action Plan (CAP). The Tribe, EPA, and CDPHE are jointly responding to the spill. On November 4, 2025, the Tribe expressed significant concerns with hazardous waste management, treatment, and storage related to the Enterprise remediation site to the EPA. In response to Tribal concerns, the EPA will ensure that the cleanup is performed in accordance with federal requirements and will also monitor Enterprise’s hazardous waste generator requirements, better known as Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA) compliance.

Enterprise previously submitted a Treatment-by-Rule Request to CDPHE to treat hazardous waste associated with the remediation on-site. On-site hazardous waste treatment can be done in a safe and responsible manner, but there have been issues of non-compliance with applicable hazardous waste laws. The Tribe has been actively monitoring the situation and expressed concern with the request given the non-compliance.

The EPA has issued a notice of non-compliance to Enterprise regarding violations and safety concerns at the site, including hazardous waste characterization, storage and disposal. With hazardous waste stored near Reservation residents and the Animas River, continued delay puts people and the environment at unnecessary risk. The EPA, the Tribe, and CDPHE will conduct a joint inspection on December 2, 2025, to confirm if these issues have been rectified.

Although the spill occurred on fee lands within the Reservation boundary, the Tribe’s Environmental Programs Department (EPD) recognized the threat to Tribal members and the public from the onset and has been fully involved in oversight decisions with EPA, CDPHE, and Enterprise. EPD, along with support from the Tribe’s Department of Energy, attends weekly update meetings, technical discussions, comments on remedial documents submitted by Enterprise and conducts independent technical assessments to gauge the cleanup progress.

EPD’s dedication to ensuring the utmost accountability and visibility from the responsible party is part of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe’s commitment to the protection of our people, water and environment.

Although natural gas generation still provides more electricity than any other source in California, electricity generation from natural gas has decreased over the past several years while generation from solar has increased.

According to data from our Electric Power Monthly, electricity generation from January through August 2025 (the latest data in our October release) was 140.9 billion kilowatthours (BkWh), 8% more than the same period in 2020.

The generation growth in recent years has been driven by solar. Solar generation by utility-scale power plants in California totaled 40.3 BkWh in the first eight months of 2025, nearly double the 22.0 BkWh over the same period in 2020. In the first eight months of 2025, solar generation increased 17%, or 5.9 BkWh, compared with the same time period in 2024.

Between January and August 2025, natural gas supplied 45.5 BkWh of electricity, 18% less than during the same period in 2020. Output increased in 2021 due to drought-spurred reduced hydroelectric output, but natural gas generation has fallen since then. The largest year-over-year drop occurred this year, when natural gas generation declined 9.5 BkWh, or 17%, compared with 2024.

In low-water years, the need for natural gas generation can increase. For example, hydro output fell in the first eight months of 2021 to 10.3 BkWh, and natural gas generation spiked to 63.5 BkWh.

Natural gas generation decreases during the middle of the day when solar generation is highest. During the midday hours (between noon and 5:00 p.m.) in May and June, which have similar cooling requirements, solar generation increased from 10.2 gigawatts (GW) in 2020 to 18.8 GW in 2025, according to the California Independent System Operator (CAISO). CAISO changed its data collection methodology for natural gas in December 2023, and data posted prior to that are not comparable.

During peak evening hours between 5:00 p.m. and 9:00 p.m., generation from batteries charged by excess solar generation during midday rose from an average of less than 1 GW in May and June 2022 to 4.9 GW in 2025, displacing natural gas generation during that period. In 2025, the hourly data show a decrease in natural gas generation during the midday hours, when solar generation is at its peak.",https://cleantechnica.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/11/California-electricity-generation-by-source.png,N,,2025-11-25 11:02:22.584252

The atmosphere reflected the uneasy state of EVs in America in this first year of the new Trump administration. During Kia’s press conference to start the day, for example, the EV9 three-row electric crossover lingered at the edge of the stage while brand bigwigs revealed a redesign of its petroleum-powered cousin, the best-selling Telluride, whose climate credentials go only as far as a 30-miles-per-gallon hybrid version.

Hyundai has been perhaps the most successful brand outside of Tesla in selling America on EVs, but its L.A. presentation pushed battery power into niche corners of the car world, the racetrack and the trail. One of its two attractions was the North American reveal of the limited-edition Ioniq 6N, the powered-up sports car version of the Ioniq 6 electric sedan, which the brand revealed at this very show three years ago.

This 641-horsepower battery-powered beast was an inevitability, given that Hyundai’s high-performance “N” division has built limited-edition racing versions of many of the carmakers’ stock vehicles, and its muscular version of the Ioniq 5 hatchback has been one of the best-regarded performance-focused EVs yet to hit the car market. Like its predecessor, Ioniq 6N is a test case in how to make electric power appeal to car enthusiasts who crave stick shifts and snarling V8s, so Hyundai built in simulated gear shifts and sounds to simulate the sensations of pushing a combustion car to its limits.

More compelling — and curious — was the Crater, the kind of otherworldly angular tank that Tesla’s Cybertruck wishes it were. A concept car rather than a vehicle ready to go into real production, the Crater is meant to signify the vision of Hyundai’s XRT sub-brand that makes off-roading versions of the brand’s vehicles, combustion ones included.

Although Hyundai barely said the “e” word during its presentation, Crater is meant to at least suggest an all-electric version of a supremely rugged vehicle that would compete with the likes of the Jeep Wrangler and Ford Bronco. The concept has no tailpipe or engine, and the pixelated lights are taken from those used on the Ioniq series. Yet even this is uncertain: Having been burned by the back-and-forth of regime change in America, with Biden-era EV incentives disappearing just as the Korean brands were adjusting their production lines to meet the rules, the carmakers are wondering how hard to push battery power here.

Even the all-electric car brands didn’t arrive with sound and fury to show off all-new cars that would invigorate the EV market. Instead, they are doing the slow and steady work that legacy car companies have been doing for years, hoping to build long-term stability by filling out their vehicle lineups with more subtly different versions at more price points.

The Rivian R2 sat at the edge of the brand’s small display, giving many people their first in-person look at what could be the make-or-break vehicle for the EV startup. Its quiet presence was a subtle reminder that the smaller SUV is coming next year at a promised price of around $45,000, which would provide a (more) affordable option for drivers who’ve lusted after the brand’s $70,000-plus initial slate of electric SUVs and pickup trucks.

Likewise, Lucid took the mic after Hyundai to introduce a somewhat more attainable version of its electric SUV. The Gravity Touring edition brings the vehicle’s starting price from six figures down to $80,000, thanks in part to a smaller battery pack that still delivers more than 300 miles of range thanks to the carmaker’s hyper-focus on aerodynamics and efficiency. The price is still high, but this is a compelling vehicle: Gravity is a spacious three-row vehicle that goes 0 to 60 miles per hour in four seconds and recharges its battery at blazing speed thanks to 1,000-volt architecture that can add a claimed 200 miles in 15 minutes.

Car show stories come with a big caveat: These events don’t have the status they did in the heyday of old media, when new vehicles greeted the world for the first time in front of the assembled reporters. Tesla has always hosted its own vehicle events rather than share the stage, and these days, lots of brands have followed suit. Rivan revealed the R2 and R3 on its own turn last year, which is why the R2 could loom, unheralded, in a quiet corner of the show floor in Los Angeles.

Yet what the car industry chooses to show and say in front of the car media is still a telling indicator. What the companies said and didn’t say on Thursday suggests an industry that’s clearly struggling to navigate the electrification transition in America. Kia has been at the forefront of building great EVs for the States; its trumpeting of a hybrid Telluride is welcome, but 10 years out of date. The absence of EV hype in press events reveals an industry putting the brakes on the big talking points and preparing to lean back toward fossil fuels to maintain their profitability through this era of American EV limbo.

The idea demands a far meatier discussion than world leaders have had to date, according to Oliver Geden, a senior fellow at the German Institute for International and Security Affairs, and a key contributor to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s scientific reports. If limiting warming to 1.5 degrees now requires surpassing that level and coming back to it later, and if this is something that countries actually want to attempt, there are a lot of implications to think through.

Geden and Andy Reisinger, an associate professor at Australian National University and another IPCC author, published an article last week spelling out what it would mean for policymakers to take this concept of “temporary overshoot” seriously. For example, the final agreement from COP30 encourages Parties to align their nationally determined contributions towards global net zero by or around mid-century.” Net zero, in this case, means cutting CO2 emissions as far as possible, and then cancelling out any residuals with efforts to remove carbon from the atmosphere.

Scientists now estimate that if the world achieves that balance by 2050, we’ll pass 1.5 and bring warming to a peak of about 1.7 degrees above pre-industrial levels. At that point, the planet will not begin to cool on its own. Ensuring that an “overshoot” of 1.5 degrees is temporary, then, requires removing even more carbon from the atmosphere than is being emitted — it requires achieving “net-negative” emissions.

Suffice it to say, you will not find the words “net negative” in any COP agreements. “If 1.5 degrees C is to remain the core temperature goal, then net zero can no longer be seen as an end point but only as a transition point in climate policy,” Geden and Reisinger wrote. The two stress that this wouldn’t prevent all of the harms of going past that level of warming, but it would reduce risk, depending on the magnitude and duration of the overshoot.

I spoke to Geden on Thursday, while the UN climate conference was still underway in Belém, Brazil, about what policymakers are missing about overshoot and the 1.5 degree goal. Our conversation has been lightly edited for clarity.

I’ve had scientists tell me they don’t like the term “overshoot” because the 1.5 degree boundary is arbitrary. How do you think about it?

You can apply the concept of overshoot to any level. You could also apply it to 2 degrees or 1.6 or 1.7. It’s just saying that there is a defined level you care about, and it’s about exceeding that level and returning to it later. That is the basic concept, and then 1.5 is the logical application right now in terms of where climate policy is. That return idea is not very well represented, but that’s how it has been used in the IPCC for quite some time — exceedance and return.

What was the impetus for writing the article with Reisinger and what was your main message?

We wanted to explain the concept of overshoot because it seems that it’s now being discussed more. The UN secretary general started using it in a speech to the World Meteorological Association two weeks before Belém, and now has continuously done so. It also led to some irritation because people interpret it as, He just called 1.5 off, although he usually says, “Science tells us you can come back to it.”

These overshoot trajectories and pathways for 1.5 degrees have been around since at least the Special Report on 1.5 Degrees in 2018, and then increasingly dominated the modeling of 1.5. But we feel that the broader climate policy community never quite got the point that it is baked into these trajectories whenever scientists say 1.5 is still possible. But then this element of, what does this now mean? Who has to do what? How is it possible to get temperature down? That’s even more obscure, in a way, in the political debate, because it means net-zero CO2 is not enough. Net-zero CO2 would halt temperature increase. To get it down, you need to go net negative. And then the obvious question, politically, would be, who’s going to do that?

In the paper, you write that the amount of net-negative emissions required to reduce global average temperatures by just 0.1 degrees is about equal to five years of current annual emissions, or 100x our current annual carbon removal, which is mostly from planting trees. Given that, is it realistic to talk about reversing warming?

That’s not for me to say. If you think about the trajectory — how would, let’s say, a temperature trajectory in the 21st century look? What you would get now is a peak warming level above 1.5. Then really the question is, what happens afterwards? If everybody only talks about going to net-zero CO2 then we should assume it’s that new peak temperature level, and then we just stay there. But if you want to say the world needs to go back down to 1.5 by the end of the century then we have to talk about net-negative levels, and we still may find out that it’s not realistic.

This kind of circumvents the conversation of how good we look on getting to net zero. We all assume that’s doable. I also assume that’s doable. But you cannot forget the fact that right now, our emissions are still rising.

One of the policy implications you write about in the piece is that if Europe were to set a target to go net negative, its carbon pricing scheme could go from a source of income to a financial burden. Can you explain that?

If you have carbon pricing and you have emitters, you can finance carbon dioxide removal through the revenues from carbon pricing. But if you want to go net negative, you need more removals than you have emissions. The question is, who’s going to pay for it? You would always have residual emitters, but if you want to go deeply into net negative, you will run out of revenue sources to finance these removals.

One of the big problems is, conceptually, a government can say, Okay, your factory does not have a license to produce anymore, and you can force it to close down. But you cannot force any entity to remove CO2 for you. So how can a government guarantee that these removals are really going to happen? Would the acceleration of this carbon dioxide removal actually work? Which methods do we prefer? Do we have enough geological storage? It’s all unresolved. This paper is not a call to Europe to say hey, just make a promise. [It’s saying,] can you please really think about it? Can we please stop assuming somebody is going to organize all this to go net negative and then it magically happens? You need to make a serious plan. And you may find out that it’s too hard to do.

Another question is, how will other actors react? I think that’s part of the reluctance to talk about going net negative. The mental model right now of being a frontrunner is going down to the net zero line and then waiting there for the others to come. But if you enter net negative territory, it becomes basically bottomless. So every developing country could, reasonably so, demand ever higher levels of you. In the European Union, where you have 27 member states, even there, you would get into distributional challenges because some member states may ask others to go net negative because they are disadvantaged.

Also, which sectors would be forced to go net negative, which ones can stay net positive? Agriculture, at least as long as you have livestock, will be net positive. Then you have a country like Ireland, with 30% of the emissions coming from agriculture. They will stay a net-positive country, probably, and then others would have to go net negative. So you can imagine what kind of tensions you would get in.

I know you’re not in Belém, but from what you’ve read and from what you’re hearing, do you think that overshoot and all of these questions that you raise are being discussed more there? Do you get the sense that they are making their way into the conversation more?

A bit. The talk you hear is only just about 1.5 and 1.5-aligned, and it makes you wonder what governments or NGOs think, how this is going to happen. In the text presented by the Brazilian government, overshoot is mentioned, and “limiting or minimizing magnitude and duration of overshoot.” But it does not talk about what that actually means.

The whole 1.5 conversation, I think it’s hard for governments to understand. At the same they’re getting told, “if you just look at the pledges, you will end up at 2.6 or 2.7 or 2.8 by the end of the century, you have to do more.” Of course they all have to do more, but to really get to 1.5 they have to do more than they can imagine. If the world does not want to cross 1.5, never ever, it would need to be at net-zero CO2 in 2030, between 2030 and 2035. And if you go later, then you have to go net negative. It’s actually quite easy, but it seems to be uncomfortable knowledge. And then the way we communicate the challenge — governments, scientists, media — it’s not very straightforward.

All these temperature targets are special in the sense that they set an absolute target. Usually policymakers, governments, set relative targets, like 0.7% of national GDP for overseas development aid — you can miss that every year, but then you can say, next year we’re going to meet it. That logic does not apply here. Once you are there, you are there. Then it’s not enough to say that next year we are going to put more effort into it. You just then can limit the extra damage.

The final resolution that concluded the United Nations climate summit in Brazil made no mention of fossil fuels, in what The New York Times called “a victory for oil producers like Saudi Arabia and Russia.” But the so-called COP30 confab in the northeastern Amazonian city of Belém made some notable progress. This was the first conference to seriously broach the effects of mining the metals needed for the energy transition, as I wrote here last week. The event had other firsts, as the Financial Times noted: It was the first completely spurned by the U.S. administration, “the first since the world hit 1.5 degrees Celsius of global warming for an entire calendar year,” and — it turned out — “the first with a venue plagued by extreme heat, flooding — even a fire that brought the talks to a standstill for much of their second-last day.” But, FT columnist Pilita Clark continued, Brazil’s turn at the yearly summit “still managed something these huge annual gatherings should have done years ago: a shift away from showy pledges to tackling the real world complexities of cutting carbon emissions.”

The COP30 statement “does not spell out the implications or required response as bluntly as many want to see,” Heatmap’s Emily Pontecorvo wrote, “It does, however, introduce an important new concept that could become a key part of the negotiations in the future. For the first time, the text references a resolve to ‘limit both the magnitude and duration of any temperature overshoot.’ This not only acknowledges that it’s possible to bring temperatures back down after warming surpasses 1.5 degrees, but that the level at which temperatures peak, and the length of time we remain at that peak before the world begins to cool, are just as important. The statement implies the need for a much larger conversation about carbon removal that has been nearly absent from the annual COPs, but which scientists say that countries must have if they are serious about the Paris Agreement goals.”

2. U.S. Export-Import Bank will invest $100 billion in ‘energy dominance’

The U.S. Export-Import Bank plans to invest $100 billion in overseas energy projects to promote President Donald Trump’s global energy dominance. The first tranche of funding will go to projects in Egypt, Pakistan, and Europe. In his first interview since taking office in September, the federal lender’s newly-appointed chair, John Jovanovic, told the FT the administration was focusing the bank on “efforts to secure U.S. and allied supply chains for critical minerals, nuclear energy, and liquified natural gas to counter western reliance on China and Russia.” In short, Jovanovic said, the Ex-Im Bank is “back in a big way, and it’s open for business.”

3. Wyoming is planning America’s first new coal plant in 12 years

Wyoming Governor Mark Gordon last week announced $4 million in state matching funds to study building a second coal-fired unit at the Dry Fork Station power plant in Gillette. The move, Cowboy State Daily reported, “could be the first step toward building a new coal-fired power plant” in the sparsely populated state’s third-largest city. “This is clear proof that coal is not dead and a reminder that Wyoming’s strength has always come from our ability to innovate without abandoning our values,” Gordon, a Republican, said in a statement. If built, the plant would be the first new coal-fired unit to open in the U.S. since 2013.

The Trump administration is trying to keep existing coal plants open. But it’s running into the problem that their equipment keeps breaking down, as Heatmap’s Matthew Zeitlin wrote. The trend toward coal isn’t unique to Trump’s America. Coal demand is rising globally.

4. Oregon’s governor orders sweeping review of clean energy bottlenecks

Oregon Governor Tina Kotek ordered state agencies last week to speed up the government’s performance on permitting, energy efficiency, electrification, and low-carbon fuel. In a speech, the Democrat said her administration would pursue the cheapest pathway to the state’s 2040 target of decarbonizing electricity, E&E News reported. “We’re talking about what we really need to meet our [climate] goals in an affordable way… where we’re not getting help from the federal government,” Kotek said Wednesday at a press conference.

Democratic states are largely in a moment of flux on climate policy. California eased permitting restrictions and passed a series of bills on energy and emissions, as Emily laid out at the time. As I reported here last week, Pennsylvania took the opposite approach and withdrew from the multi-state cap-and-trade market under pressure to contain costs. New York, meanwhile, has required a federal judge to intervene to force its government to enforce climate regulations. It's all part of the emerging tension between Democrats' affordability campaigns and the party's desire to cut planet-heating pollution, as Heatmap's Robinson Meyer wrote.

5. British oil and gas developer Harbour Energy is pumped on the U.S.

Regular readers of this newsletter scarcely need reminding of two basic realities about the American oil and gas industry right now: Trump is opening virtually everywhere he can to production, but drilling has largely remained flat. But the market is looking good to the British developer Harbour Energy. In an interview with The Wall Street Journal, Linda Cook, the company’s chief executive, said Harbour Energy is exploring a potential acquisition or merger with rivals in the U.S. offshore and onshore drilling business as a way to enter “the biggest market in the world” where the London-headquartered firm isn’t already present. In a sign of confidence in Trump’s as-yet-unrealized promise to “drill, baby, drill,” Harbour Energy has widened its scope from its past inquiries into only U.S. offshore assets to also look at onshore drilling.

Oregon joined 21 other Democratic-led states in August to sue the federal government for threatening to withhold $1.4 billion in federal Victims of Crime Act funding unless the states agreed to help with immigration enforcement. The lawsuit never went to trial because the Trump administration abandoned its plan after the suit was filed, allowing states to retain federal grants without any new immigration enforcement rules.

It’s one of 46 lawsuits the state has filed against the Trump administration, often teaming up with other Democratic states to prevent federal funding cuts. The state of Oregon doesn’t have to pay anything out of pocket by signing onto another state’s lawsuit, according to Oregon Department of Justice spokesperson Jenny Hansson.

The Oregon Department of Justice has spent at least $19,000 in legal fees and travel expenses this year to send employees to attend court hearings in Washington D.C. and New York, according to public records obtained by the Capital Chronicle. Meanwhile, by filing the lawsuits the state has kept about $4.5 billion meant for Oregon Health and Science University research, electric vehicle infrastructure, sexual health education programs and education programs supporting low-income and unhoused students.

The lawsuits are to ensure Oregonians aren’t left paying the price when the federal government oversteps or breaks the law, Hansson said.

“The Oregon Department of Justice is committed to protecting Oregonians — not wasting their money,” Hansson told the Capital Chronicle. “The resources we’ve invested in defending Oregon’s rights in court are a fraction of what’s at stake.”

Oregon’s federal litigation team isn’t funded with direct taxpayer dollars

Some states set aside millions for potential lawsuits against the Trump administration. In California, Gov. Gavin Newsom in late 2024 convened a special session to set aside $25 million to pay for anticipated legal costs against the Trump administration. In Maryland, Attorney General Anthony Brown received $1 million from the governor to fund a federal litigation team, Maryland Matters reported.

The state of Oregon did something similar, allocating $8.2 million in its 2025-27 Department of Justice’s budget to fund 20 full-time positions to support civil litigation and for the “defense of state interests.”

What’s unique about Oregon is that the money going toward defending state interests isn’t coming from the state general fund — or money collected from personal or corporate income taxes — but rather it’s coming from proceeds from civil litigation when the state is awarded damages, according to legislative fiscal analyst Steve Robbins.

With this designated funding, the department created a federal litigation team to respond to national legal issues. An agency webpage tracks all the lawsuits Oregon is a part of tied to immigration, human rights, LGBTQ+ issues, federal employment and other Trump administration policies.

In total, Oregon’s Department of Justice’s budget increased by 4% from the previous two-year cycle, raising its budget to $1 billion.

Some of that new funding also includes $17 million to support child advocacy centers and support services for domestic and sexual violence victims, $13 million to replace some of its legal software, $8.8 million to upgrade its child support software system and $10.8 million to add 33 full-time attorneys in its trial division to reduce the state’s need to contract with more expensive, private firms.

Kraken Bond, a leading manufacturer of high-performance chemical solutions for the construction and industrial sectors, is emphasizing the significant financial benefits available to homeowners through the Federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit when purchasing qualifying insulation products. The company’s FastCoat Class A Fire-Rated Spray Foam Insulation Kits qualify for this federal tax incentive, offering homeowners both superior energy savings and important safety compliance features.

The Federal Energy Efficient Home Improvement Credit, also known as the 25C tax credit, provides homeowners with a maximum annual credit of $3,200 for qualifying energy-efficient home improvements. Specifically for insulation and air sealing materials, homeowners can claim 30 percent of the cost, up to $1,200 per year. The FastCoat Spray Foam Insulation materials from Kraken Bond meet the eligibility requirements for this credit, making the purchase a financially strategic investment for property owners looking to enhance their home’s energy efficiency.

The FastCoat system distinguishes itself through its Class A Fire Rating certification under ASTM E84 standards, providing a critical safety feature that exceeds basic insulation requirements. The product delivers an R-Value of R-5.66 per inch through its closed-cell formula, creating an air-tight seal that significantly reduces energy loss. These technical specifications directly contribute to the energy savings that qualify the product for federal tax credit eligibility.

“Homeowners are increasingly seeking solutions that combine safety, efficiency, and financial prudence,” said a spokesperson for Kraken Bond. “Our FastCoat Spray Foam Insulation not only meets stringent fire safety standards but also helps customers take advantage of substantial federal tax credits while reducing their energy costs long-term.”

The spray foam insulation kit has been designed for user-friendly application, making professional-grade insulation accessible to DIY homeowners. The smooth, mess-free application process allows property owners to achieve professional results without requiring specialized contractors, further enhancing the cost-effectiveness of the upgrade. Tax Credit Eligible Products like the FastCoat represent a practical approach to home improvement that balances immediate installation savings with long-term energy efficiency benefits.

As energy costs continue to fluctuate and building codes increasingly emphasize fire safety, products that address both concerns while offering financial incentives have become particularly relevant. The federal tax credit remains available through the end of 2025, providing a limited window for homeowners to maximize their savings on qualifying improvements.

Kraken Bond maintains an extensive product portfolio that includes adhesives, sealants, and various specialty chemical solutions for construction and industrial applications. The company provides comprehensive product information and updates through multiple channels, including Kraken Bond on Instagram, where contractors and homeowners can access application tips and project inspiration.

Kraken Bond specializes in developing and manufacturing high-performance chemical solutions for the construction and industrial sectors.

,Texas American Energy ,2025-11-25 14:04:57+00:00,washingtonreporter.news,EXCLUSIVE: 24 House Republicans outline how the Department of Energy can prioritize ...,Matthew Foldi,,,,,https://washingtonreporter.news/p/exclusive-24-house-republicans-outline,"Twenty-four members of the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC) want the Trump administration to prioritize more baseload energy sources to keep the lights on for American families.
“It is crucial for the United States to harness our abundant natural resources and increase our baseload energy capacity to unlock this once-in-a-generation opportunity,” the lawmakers, led by RSC Chairman August Pfluger (R., Texas) and Rep.
Troy Balderson (R., Ohio), wrote; Balderson is also the chairman of the House Energy Action Team (HEAT).
“As you consider funding allocations and other authorities to ensure the electric grid has the energy resources the nation needs to accommodate and enable this growth, we urge you to prioritize baseload energy generation sources,” the Republicans said.

Lawmakers wrote to Energy Secretary Chris Wright in a letter obtained exclusively by the Washington Reporter, thanking Wright and President Donald Trump for their “thoughtful leadership on energy dominance and for your commitment to strengthening America’s grid to meet the emerging power demands of data centers and artificial intelligence (AI).” They specifically appreciate Trump’s Executive Order 14154, which “terminated harmful Biden-era policies, advanced meaningful improvements in the efficiency and certainty of permitting approvals, and supported critical baseload energy projects.”

But, they want the administration to do even more. “It is crucial for the United States to harness our abundant natural resources and increase our baseload energy capacity to unlock this once-in-a-generation opportunity,” the lawmakers, led by RSC Chairman August Pfluger (R., Texas) and Rep. Troy Balderson (R., Ohio), wrote; Balderson is also the chairman of the House Energy Action Team (HEAT).

The lawmakers’ letter comes as Republican lawmakers work with the administration to achieve the president’s goal of American energy dominance, and as Congress and the White House increasingly focus on affordability issues.

“Without sufficient energy to power our data centers and keep up with the rapid pace of technological innovation and development, our strategic adversaries, including China, may ultimately win the AI arms race. Failure is not an option, as our nation’s economic and national security are at stake,” lawmakers cautioned Wright.

Republican lawmakers have a desired solution: “We must increase the amount of new, reliable, baseload resources connected to the grid to adequately meet rising demand and offset planned retirements,” they wrote.

“As you consider funding allocations and other authorities to ensure the electric grid has the energy resources the nation needs to accommodate and enable this growth, we urge you to prioritize baseload energy generation sources,” the Republicans said. “Coal- and natural gas-fired power plants jointly accounted for 91 percent of planned retirements of power generation capacity in 2024. As grid operators and experts have warned, our nation cannot solely rely on weather-dependent, intermittent resources.”

“For these reasons, we respectfully urge the Department of Energy to exercise its authorities and programs to rapidly expand energy generation to reliably and affordably meet electricity demand growth across the country,” the lawmakers wrote. “Such action would align with the Trump Administration’s broader objectives of strengthening domestic supply chains and supporting American energy workers. We are committed to working with you, the Department of Energy, and President Trump to get out of the energy crisis caused by the Biden-Harris Administration’s deeply misguided policies and hostility towards domestic energy production. The golden age of technological innovation depends on a resilient grid and a reliable energy supply.”

Joining Reps. Balderson and Pfluger in signing the letter are Reps. Stephanie Bice (R., Okla.), Rick Allen (R., Ga.), Andy Barr (R., Ky.), Nick Begich (R., Alaska), Josh Brecheen (R., Okla.), Andrew Clyde (R., Ga.), Jeff Crank (R., Colo.), Dan Crenshaw (R., Texas), Vince Fong (R., Calif.), Scott Franklin (R., Fla.), Craig Goldman (R., Texas), Morgan Griffith (R., Va.), Harriet Hageman (R., Wyo.), Pat Harrigan (R., N.C.), Jeff Hurd (R., Colo.), Bob Latta (R., Ohio), Laurel Lee (R., Fla.), Rich McCormick (R., Ga.), Dan Newhouse (R., Wash.), Gary Palmer (R., Ala.), John Rose (R., Tenn.), Pete Sessions (R., Texas), Randy Weber (R., Texas), and Roger Williams (R., Texas).","https://substackcdn.com/image/fetch/$s_!2Iqp!,w_1200,h_600,c_fill,f_jpg,q_auto:good,fl_progressive:steep,g_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fsubstack-post-media.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fpublic%2Fimages%2Fd4146e4a-3308-4980-b46e-e1aefa64d1a3_1200x630.jpeg",N,,2025-11-25 10:01:59.155570
